Today, we gratefully remember the life and \nleadership of Gouverneur Morris, born on this day in 1752. We \nprayerfully recall that he was the writer of the final draft of the \nConstitution, the head of the Committee on Style, and the originator of \nthe phrase, ``We the people of the United States.''\n  Thank You for the impact of Mr. Morris, who at the age of thirty-five \nbecame a member of the Continental Congress and spoke 173 times during \nthe Constitutional debates, more than any other delegate. We honor his \nmemory, not just for the quantity of his words but for their quality. \nIn particular, we are moved by his conviction about You. ``There is one \nComforter,'' he said ``who weighs our Minutes and Numbers out our \nDays.'' About the importance of a strong faith in You he said, \n``Religion is the only solid basis of good morals; therefore education \nshould teach the precepts of religion, and the duties of man toward \nGod.'' May we never forget that ``morality is truth in full bloom.'' \nFather, keep America rooted in Your moral absolutes. You are our Judge \nand Redeemer.

Mr. President, I also wish to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues the fact we had significant debate on this last night. \nSenator Sessions did an outstanding job in making his presentation. I \nencourage colleagues to review his statements and encourage all \ncolleagues who wish to speak on this nomination to come to the floor \nearly and make their statements so we can confirm John Ashcroft, or \nhave a vote on his confirmation by tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask my colleague to yield for a \nbrief interruption.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend from Oklahoma. \nI know how important his statement is. I know how much of a tragedy the \nState of Oklahoma and everyone in the country suffered.\n  But I did want to say before we left the floor that we agree with the \nSenator that the debate should go forward in full flow, and I say to \nthe Democratic Senators within the sound of my voice, this could be a \nvery late night. We have a lot of people on the Democratic side who \nwant to speak on this\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nnomination. They are going to have that opportunity.\n  We did not do as much talking as probably should have taken place \nlast night. We completed our work at 7 o'clock. We expected to go to 9. \nI think tonight we will go at least until 9 or 10 o'clock.\n  I say to Democratic Senators, they should be prepared because there \nmay not be a tomorrow. I know there are efforts around here to move \nthis forward. We have completed 14 of the 15 nominations that had been \nsent to us by the President, which is a record-setting pace. We want to \nmove forward on the Ashcroft nomination as quickly as we can. We hope \nit does not have to go into next week. We will need cooperation from \nthe Republican side. We are going to do the best we can to have \nsomebody in place just as quickly as we can.\n  I, again, apologize for interrupting my friend, but I appreciate his \nallowing me to do so.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's comments. I echo that. I \nencourage all Senators who wish to speak on the Ashcroft nomination to \ncome to the floor earlier today, rather than later today. It was a \nlittle regrettable because I think both leaders had stated publicly we \nintended to be in session late last night for this nomination. But we \ncould not get additional speakers so we adjourned earlier than planned. \nI thank my friend and colleague from Nevada.\n  I might also add when he said we moved forward expeditiously, I am \npleased we have confirmed all but one nominee. But I might remind my \ncolleagues, 8 years ago every Clinton nominee was confirmed by January \n22, unanimously, by voice--every single one. The only one that was not \nwas the Attorney General, and the reason for that was that the Clinton \nadministration had withdrawn a couple of nominees. The eventual nominee \nfor Attorney General, Janet Reno, was confirmed 98-0 after very short \ndebate.\n  I just make those points to clarify the record. Eight years ago \nCongress moved very expeditiously to confirm all nominees. All were \nconfirmed by January 21--by voice vote, I might add. The only recorded \nvote was Janet Reno and that was 98-0.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S836-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY PLANE CRASH\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, tragedy struck my State, as members of \nthe Oklahoma State basketball team and news organizations were killed \nin a tragic plane crash just outside of Denver.\n  Of course any plane crash is not anticipated, but this was especially \npainful and tragic because it snuffed out the lives of 10 outstanding \nindividuals, who were well known on campus and throughout the state. \nTwo team members were killed. They were outstanding athletes.\n  Eight other individuals that were on the plane were a part of the \nteam in various capacities and it is a real tragedy, a tragedy to our \nState and to our university.\n  Today there is a memorial service taking place at Oklahoma State \nUniversity to memorialize these 10 exceptional individuals.\n  One of the individuals was Nate Fleming. His sister served as an \nintern in my office. He was a nephew of one of my best friends and an \noutstanding athlete. Nate was a National Honor Society member and \nvaledictorian of his class. He was only 20 years old.\n  Another team member, Daniel Lawson, 21, was a junior and played \nguard. He was originally from Detroit, Michigan. Another was Pat Noyes, \n27. Pat was director of basketball operations at Oklahoma State \nUniversity.\n  Brian Luinstra, 29, the athletic trainer, leaves a wife and two \nchildren.\n  Will Hancock, 31, was in his fifth year as coordinator of media \nrelations. His wife, Karen, is the coach of the OSU women's soccer team \nand they had their first child just this last November.\n  Jared Weiberg, 22, was a student manager and nephew of the Big 12 \ncommissioner, Kevin Weiberg. Jared was a part of the team and will most \ncertainly be missed by all.\n  Bill Teegins, 48, was the play-by-play voice of the Oklahoma State \nUniversity Cowboys for many seasons and was sports director for Channel \n9 in Oklahoma City. He was honored several times as sportscaster of the \nyear. He was known by everyone across the state and needless to say, he \ndid an outstanding job.\n  Kendall Durfey, 38, was a producer and engineer for the OSU radio \nnetwork. Denver Mills, the pilot, from Oklahoma City, was well liked \nand was a great aviator.\n  Bjorn Falistrom was the copilot, originally from Sweden.\n  This is a real loss for their families, for Oklahoma State \nUniversity, for Oklahoma and the nation. The contributions these \nindividuals made to the State and to the University will always be \nremembered. We extend our condolences to Coach Sutton and to President \nJames Hallogan and the extended family of Oklahoma State University. It \nis with deep sadness that we extend our prayers to their families, and \nto their friends in mourning such a great loss. Certainly, they will be \nmissed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a different \nissue, one of great importance and one I think we are going to see take \nplace, and that is overdue tax relief for the American people.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has just announced the 10-year budget \nsurplus projection has increased to $5.6 trillion. When I came to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1994, it would have been hard to fathom \nnumbers of this nature, but through fiscal restraint, a plan put in \nplace to limit the amount of spending over a period of years, and a \nhealthy, growing economy, we are now to the point where we are \nprojecting and experiencing budget surpluses. It is wonderful that we \nhave this opportunity.\n  I also point out to the American public, in case you are worried the \nRepublicans in Congress are taking their eyes\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\noff the ball of fiscal discipline and paying down the debt, we are \npaying down the debt, and we will continue to pay down the debt.\n  Over the past 3 years, we paid down over $360 billion of public \ndebt--$360 billion over 3 years. We will continue at that pace, if not \ngreater, of reducing the Federal debt. We are going to continue to do \nthat. But it also is possible, and I suggest necessary, for us to do \nthe needed tax cuts and tax relief the American public deserves. \nAmerica's taxpayers are overpaying the bill for their Government. More \nspecifically, it is a tax on their success. It is, in fact, a tax on \nthe robust economic growth we have experienced and which now seems to \nbe slowing.\n  Of the $5.6 trillion, we have already committed to save $2.7 trillion \nfor Social Security, and we should do that. That still leaves almost $3 \ntrillion. This is separate and distinct from the Social Security trust \nfund. We have put that in a lockbox. The Republican Congress said we \nare building a lockbox; we are going to put the Social Security surplus \nin it. That is the $2.7 trillion of Social Security income, leaving $3 \ntrillion over the next 10 years for tax cuts and debt reduction. We can \ndo both. We must do both.\n  With the announcement by the Congressional Budget Office last week, \nalong with Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's comments, there is no \nlonger any credible excuse not to cut taxes for the American people. \nThere is more than enough money to cut taxes, protect Social Security, \nand continue on our path of debt reduction--the $360 billion paydown we \nhave done over the past 3 years. Americans demand fiscal \nresponsibility, and they deserve a tax cut.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to pass meaningful tax relief this \nsession, sooner rather than later. I think that is important for the \neconomy, I think it is important for the American people, and it is \nnecessary. We have worked in a bipartisan fashion to balance the \nbudget, to pay down the debt, and protect Social Security. Now we must \nwork in the same fashion to give the American people a tax cut they \ndeserve.\n  As virtually everyone in the free world knows, our economy is \nslowing. Some are even concerned we are teetering on the brink of a \nrecession. Recent reports indicate consumer confidence has now dipped \nto its lowest level since December of 1996, which could have the effect \nof fueling further fears of a slow downturn into a recession.\n  The last month and a half has shown the accuracy of President Bush's \nremarks about the state of the economy as he was in the midst of \nhandling his transition. We now await further action by Chairman Alan \nGreenspan. It is worthy of note that several of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have urged the Chairman not to increase \ninterest rates. I think that was correct. However, now it is clear the \nFed is changing its direction. In fact, according to many economists, \nthe markets are already assuming a half basis point reduction to be \nannounced at the conclusion of the meeting that began yesterday.\n  The Federal Reserve is doing its job to strengthen this economy and \nprevent it from going into a recession. It is now time for Congress to \ndo its job, which is to cut taxes. In fact, I think as a body we need \nto worry less about the job Mr. Greenspan is doing down the street and \nmore about the job we need to do on Capitol Hill.\n  Both monetary and fiscal policy needs to be used to keep this economy \nfrom going into recession but lift it up. Our part in doing this, as \nvirtually all economists will note, is to cut taxes to help stimulate \nthe economy. We need to pursue a fiscal policy that reflects the needs \nof Americans and of our economy.\n  Based on the surplus projections of the Congressional Budget Office, \nwe have the resources available to not only realize our commitment to \nsound fiscal policy, protecting Social Security, and paying down the \ndebt, but to significantly--and I want to add the point, \nsignificantly--reduce the tax burden faced by Americans.\n  We must cut taxes now for America's working families. In fact, we \nneed to pursue broader and deeper tax cuts than those proposed last \nweek by my colleagues from Texas and Georgia. It is a bipartisan tax \ncut bill that was put in last week by Senators Gramm and Miller.\n  We must cut taxes for two primary reasons. First, tax cuts are in \neffect an insurance policy for further economic growth because of the \nstimulating effect they would have on the economy. Second, tax cuts are \ngood policy not only because they return hard-earned dollars back to \nthe American people--the people who earned the dollars in the first \nplace--but also because they help limit the growth of Government.\n  If we do not send the surplus back to the American people in the form \nof tax cuts, Washington's big spenders will use the money to grow the \nsize of Government. It is almost an iron rule of Government; if there \nis a dollar left on the table around here, it is going to get spent. It \nneeds to go back to the American people because they have overpaid. And \nit will help stimulate our economy, which is one of the keys of how we \nhave been able to balance the budget and pay down the debt and have a \nstrong economy. If that economy weakens, we are not going to have the \ntax receipts to be able to pay down the debt or do the things that \npeople would like to do as well. If the markets are any indication, we \nneed to use our fiscal policy now to grow the economy, not to grow the \nGovernment.\n  Today, we are collecting more from hard-working Americans than we \nhave at any point since the conclusion of World War II. Artificially \nhigh tax rates used to fund our bloated Federal Government is one \nreason we are collecting so much revenue from the American people; the \ngrowth in the stock market and an increase in entrepreneurial activity \nis the other.\n  The American people should not be taxed on success, but that is \nexactly what we are doing when we impose high rates of taxation, \nparticularly on capital gains. We punish people for innovation, thrift, \nand hard work, and we penalize them for being successful. We need \nanother reduction in capital gains tax rates to follow on the 1997 \nreductions.\n  I want to go to a particular point at this time, and that is the \nmarriage penalty tax that has been in place now for a number of years. \nTwice in Congress we have passed a bill to repeal it. Now is the time \nfor us to repeal it and get it signed into law by a President who \nagrees that we should repeal the marriage penalty tax.\n  We have been taxing people for being married. It is a ridiculous \npolicy. We have discussed it a number of times on the floor. An average \nAmerican couple, in a two-wage-earner family, pays about $1,500 extra \nin taxes just for the privilege of being married. It is ridiculous.\n  Recently, my colleague, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and I \nintroduced a bill to eliminate the marriage penalty. It is now clearly \nwithin our grasp to rid the Tax Code of this onerous, ridiculous \npenalty. I believe we must eliminate this penalty immediately.\n  Unfortunately, some of the proposals being considered to reduce taxes \nfail to adequately address the marriage penalty. We need real marriage \npenalty reduction, not more gimmicks in our Tax Code. We need to double \nthe standard deduction immediately. In fact, I prefer to make it \nretroactive to January 1 of this year. We also need to double the \nincome subject to the marginal rate brackets for married couples to \ntwice the amount it is for individuals. This accomplishes real marriage \npenalty relief.\n  As we move to consideration of a reconciliation bill later this year, \nI will be pushing for broad-based marriage penalty relief. I am hopeful \nthis Congress, with an enormous on-budget surplus, will be able to \naccomplish real tax cuts for American families.\n  The proposal by my colleagues is a good way to start the debate on \ntax cuts, but I am hopeful we can do more than the $1.6 trillion tax \ncut. We have $3 trillion that is available, and $2.7 trillion of the \nSocial Security surplus is set aside. We have $3 trillion to pay down \ndebt and to be able to cut taxes. I think we can do better than the \n$1.6 trillion. I think it will be necessary for us to do that to help \nto stimulate this economy.\n  Finally, I believe tax cuts work in part because they do stimulate \neconomic growth and also because they\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nhelp insure against an economic downturn. We need that insurance policy \nbefore the economic situation deteriorates even more.\n  I would add that there is a positive psychological effect that takes \nplace; when the Federal Reserve reduces the rate it charges by half \nbasis points, there is a psychological point that, OK, the Fed is \nstepping in and taking action to make sure this economy does not go in \nrecession. Therefore, more people say: Good, that is a positive sign. I \nam going to watch, and I am going to be maybe a little more positive.\n  If the Congress would do that similarly with tax cuts, the American \npeople, as well, would say: OK, they are concerned about this economy, \nbut they are taking action. I can see there is light at the end of the \ntunnel.\n  We should do that for its economic and stimulative effect on people's \npositive thinking of what can take place for this economy.\n  I am hopeful that Congress will pass meaningful tax cuts earlier in \nthis year rather than later. Americans deserve some tax relief. They \nhave waited long enough.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much for your time. I yield the floor \nand yield back any time allotted to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S838-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S838-S839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAX CUTS AND THE BUDGET SURPLUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is opportune I am here following my \nfriend and colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, to talk about the \nsame issue because I think we both agree on several things, but we may \nhave a little difference of opinion on several others.\n  Senator Brownback and I came to the House of Representatives at about \nthe same time. We lived through the era of red ink--the terrible \ndeficits and mounting national debt. Many times it appeared we would \nnever get out from under that burden.\n  I can recall when I first came to the Senate, Senator Orrin Hatch was \nat this desk right over here and had stacked up next to the desk all of \nthe budget books for the previous 20 or 30 years, which all showed a \ndeficit. He said: It is time to amend the Constitution for a balanced \nbudget amendment. It is the only way to get Congress to stop its \nprofligate ways and to finally bring balance to our books.\n  I resisted that amendment. I thought it was overkill and unnecessary. \nIt failed by one vote, and thank goodness it did because the ink had \nhardly dried in the Congressional Record than we started turning the \ncorner. The economy started getting stronger, and we started leaving \nthe deficit era, going into the surplus era. And what a change it has \nbrought about with all of the Americans who are currently working, \nthough there clearly is some downturn in the economy now. Those working \nAmericans, and their families, and their businesses have brought \nsuccess not only to them personally but also to our Nation's economy. \nIt certainly is reflected in the fact that we now are talking about \nsurpluses.\n\n  The obvious question the American people ask of us in the Senate is: \nIf we have more money than we need in Washington, why do you keep it? \nWhy don't you do something good with it? And one of the good things you \ncan do with it is to reduce the tax burden on families.\n  Senator Brownback suggested that. I agree with him. It is President \nBush's plan. It is a democratic plan. If I had to put my money on one \nthing that is likely to happen this year, there would be some form of a \ntax cut; and there should be. I think we are at a point in history \nwhere it is not only the right thing to do, because there is a surplus, \nit is the right thing to do for the economy.\n  Chairman Greenspan at the Federal Reserve appeared before the Senate \nBudget Committee just a few days ago and basically said he thinks we \nare at a point where there is no growth in our economy. If you have \nthat situation, basic economics tells you that you try to put some \nstimulus in the economy to get it moving again. And that would be a \nlowering of interest rates, which helps everyone who has an adjustable \nmortgage rate or is paying off a car loan or some credit card loan that \nis reflective of those interest rates, or you find a fiscal approach; \nthat is, a tax cut that also generates more strength, more activity in \nthe economy.\n  But I think where there may be a difference between Senator Brownback \nand myself is on the question of how much we have to spend on the tax \ncut. What can we afford to put into a tax cut? I am going to use the \nmaximum amount that is reasonable, but let's look at some of the \nfigures that are being used.\n  This chart shows the projected budget surplus for the next 10 years: \n$5.7 trillion in a unified surplus. But when we take out the Social \nSecurity trust fund--which, incidentally, both parties were very clear \nin saying: We are not going to raid Social Security to spend or for \nanybody's tax cut--that takes away $2.7 trillion, so we have a net of \n$3 trillion in our surplus. Then we take away the Medicare trust fund, \nwhich I am sure all of us agree we would not want to raid for spending \non other programs, to protect it, and we are now down to a net \nprojected budget surplus for the next 10 years of $2.6 trillion.\n  Projecting a budget surplus means assuming certain things will \nhappen. There are as many economists in Washington as there are \nopinions about what might happen to our economy, but most of these \nprojections about a surplus assume certain growth in the economy. They \nsay if we continue to grow, we will continue to generate surplus. If \nthey are wrong, if the economy takes a downturn, there will be less \nmoney available, less money for whatever purposes we might consider on \nthe floor of the Senate or in the Federal Government.\n  Let's take a look at President Bush's proposed tax cut. His proposal \nis $1.6 trillion, which reflects a 10-year tax cut plan. There is also \nan element in the tax law known as the alternative minimum tax. All of \nus are concerned that the alternative minimum tax has been written in a \nway that is starting to penalize a lot of families and businesses we \nnever intended to penalize in any way. So reform of the alternative \nminimum tax appears to be agreed by almost everyone as something we \nshould do. That would cost us another $200 billion over a 10-year \nperiod of time.\n  In addition, if we take money and, instead of buying down the debt of \nthe country, put it into something such as a tax cut, it increases the \ninterest costs that have to be paid on that debt by $400 billion over \nthe same period of time. The true net cost of the Bush tax plan, \nconsidering these two scenarios, is $2.2 trillion.\n  Recall earlier I said that our actual surplus by these estimates will \nbe $2.6 trillion. To put it into some perspective, look at the tax cuts \nassuming a $2.6 trillion surplus. If we put $2.2 trillion into tax \ncuts, as President Bush has recommended, literally 85 percent of the \nsurplus will be going exclusively to tax cuts. The remaining $400 \nbillion, 15 percent, would be there and could be used. However, look at \nall of the things we frankly have to consider out of this $400 billion \nover 10 years: As to debt reduction--I will get back to that in a \nmoment--we have a $5.7 trillion national debt. I will talk about what \nit costs us to maintain that debt. The prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare is going to cost us some money; some suggest $300 billion over \n10 years. We are taking this slice of $400 billion and all the things \nin which we want to invest.\n  The President has called for more money for education. I like that \nidea. I think it is a good thing to do. Again, it is coming out of this \nslice, this 15-percent slice.\n  He has also asked for more money for defense; we anticipate a need \nfor agriculture as we have in the past; Medicare reform, Social \nSecurity reform, and some have even suggested the creation of a rainy \nday fund to protect our economy and our budget in bad times.\n  The reason I like to reflect for a moment on the national debt is \nthat we have to consider this as the mortgage that we are leaving our \nkids. The best thing we can do for our children and grandchildren is to \nmake that debt, that mortgage, as little as possible so\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nthey are not burdened with the responsibility and debt of the \nobligations of our generation.\n  What does a national debt of $5.7 trillion cost us? Literally, we \ncollect $1 billion a day in Federal taxes from individuals, families, \nand businesses to pay interest on old debt. That is $1 billion a day \nthat isn't being spent to put a computer in a classroom or to make \nAmerica's national defense any stronger. It is $1 billion a day which \ninstead is being spent for interest on old debt.\n  Many of us believe if we truly are at a time of surplus, this is the \nmoment we should seize to pay down that national debt, bring it down as \nlow as we can conceivably bring it so that future generations and our \nkids and grandkids won't be burdened with this debt and responsibility.\n\n  As you pay down the national debt, the competition for money in the \nmarketplace is reduced. The Federal Government is not out there \nborrowing and servicing debt. Therefore, interest rates tend to come \ndown. Now not only will we be taking the burden off of families who pay \n$1 billion a day for interest on the old debt, we will also be reducing \nthe interest rates they pay on their homes and their cars and their \ncredit cards. Families win both ways.\n  Ultimately, this is as good, if not better, in many respects, as a \ntax cut. It reduces the cost of living for real families facing real \ndifficulties.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the tax cut itself. There are a \nvariety of ways we can approach this tax cut. Some have suggested \ncutting marginal rates. That is a shorthand approach to a tax cut which \nwould, in fact, benefit some of the wealthiest people in this country \nmore than working families and middle-income families. That is where I \nhave some difficulty.\n  I know what is going on in my home State of Illinois now. I know \nbecause my wife called me a few weeks ago and said: I just got the \nfirst gas bill for the winter. You will never guess what happened. It \nis up to $400 a month in Springfield, IL. It is about a 40-percent \nincrease in my hometown. I hear this story all over Illinois, all over \nthe country--energy bills up 50 percent, natural gas bills up 70 \npercent. If we talk about tax cuts, we ought to be thinking about \nfamilies who are literally struggling with these day-to-day bills. \nWhether it is the need to heat your home or to pay for a child's \ncollege education or perhaps for tuition in a school, should we not \nfocus tax cuts on the working families who struggle to get by every \nsingle day?\n  I always express concern on the Senate floor that we seem to have \nmore sympathy for the wealthiest people in this country than for those \nwho are really struggling every single day to build their families and \nmake them strong. If we are going to have a tax cut--and we should--\nlet's make sure the tax cut benefits those families.\n  I also want to make certain we protect Social Security and Medicare. \nIf as an outcome of this debate we end up jeopardizing Social Security \nor Medicare, then we have not met our moral and social obligation to \nthe millions of Americans who have paid into these systems and depend \non them to survive.\n  I believe the good news about the surplus should be realistic news. \nWe should understand that surpluses are not guaranteed. We ought to \nmake certain that any tax cut we are talking about is not at the \nexpense of Social Security and Medicare. We should focus the tax cuts \non working families to make sure they are the beneficiaries so that \nthey have the funds they need to make their lives easier. That should \nbe the bottom line in this debate.\n  As I said at the outset, Democrats and Republicans alike believe \nthese tax cuts are going to happen. I believe it is a good thing to do. \nLet us pay down this national debt. Let us provide a tax cut for the \nfamilies who need it. Let's make sure we protect Social Security and \nMedicare in the process.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S839-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and proceed to the Ashcroft \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John Ashcroft, \nof Missouri, to be Attorney General.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee \nyesterday evening favorably reported the nomination of Senator John \nAshcroft to be the next Attorney General of the United States. I look \nforward to a fair debate of Senator Ashcroft's qualifications and am \nhopeful that we could move to a vote on his confirmation this week. It \nis important that we confirm Senator Ashcroft as soon as possible so \nthat the President has his Cabinet in place and he can move ahead with \nthe people's agenda.\n  John Ashcroft is no stranger to most of us in this body. We have \nserved with him during his 6 years of service as the Senator \nrepresenting Missouri, some had worked with him when he was Governor \nand some others had worked with him when he was the Attorney General of \nMissouri.\n  In the Senate, he served on the Judiciary Committee with distinction \nover the past four years--working closely with members on both sides of \nthe aisle. As a member of the committee, he proved himself a leader in \nmany areas, including the fight against drugs and violence, the \nassessment of the proper role of the Justice Department, and the \nprotection of victims' rights.\n  But, having heard the relentless drumbeat of accusation after \naccusation in recent weeks, I can fairly say, in my view, that there \nhas been an unyielding effort to redefine this man of unlimited \nintegrity. Some have termed the statements made by John Ashcroft, \nduring the nearly four days of hearings in the committee, a \n``confirmation conversion''--``a metamorphosis.''\n  On the contrary. The true metamorphosis of John Ashcroft is in the \nmisleading picture painted of him by narrow left-wing interest groups. \nIn fact, I welcomed them to the committee, and said: We haven't seen \nyou for 8 years. I think there is a lot to be garnered out of that \nstatement.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, John Ashcroft has an impressive 30-\nyear record of loyal public service as a state attorney general, a two \nterm Governor, and then--of course--as Senator, for the State of \nMissouri. I should also mention that as Missouri's attorney general, he \nwas so well respected that he was elected by his peers across the \nnation to head the National Association of Attorneys General, and again \nas Governor, he was elected by this nation's governors to serve as the \nhead of the National Governors' Association.\n  That really defines John Ashcroft rather than some of the accusations \nthat have been thrown against him in the Senate.\n  I have said this before and I will say it again, of the sixty-seven \nAttorneys General we have had, only a handful even come close to having \nsome of the qualifications that John Ashcroft brings in assuming the \nposition of chief law enforcement officer of this great nation.\n  The Department of Justice, of course, encompasses broad jurisdiction. \nIt includes agencies ranging from the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Marshal's Service, \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorneys, to \nthe Bureau of Prisons. It includes, among other things, enforcement of \nthe law in areas including antitrust, terrorism, fraud, money \nlaundering, organized crime, drugs, and immigration. To effectively \nprevent and manage crises in these important areas, one thing is \ncertain: we need, at the helm, a no-nonsense person with the background \nand experience of John Ashcroft.\n  Those charged with enforcing the law of the nation must demonstrate \nboth a proper understanding of that law and a determination to uphold \nits letter and spirit. This is the standard I have applied to nominees \nin the past, and this is the standard I am applying to John Ashcroft \nhere today in my full-hearted support of his nomination to be the\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nnext Attorney General of the United States.\n  During John Ashcroft's 30-year career in public service, he has \nworked to establish numerous things to keep Americans safe and free \nfrom criminal activities. For example, he has: (1) fought for tougher \nsentencing laws for serious crimes; (2) authored legislation to keep \ndrugs out of the hands of children; (3) improved our nation's \nimmigration laws; (4) protected citizens from fraud; (5) protected \ncompetition in business; (6) supported funding increases for law \nenforcement; (7) held the first hearings ever on racial profiling; (8) \nfought for victims' rights in the courts of law and otherwise; (9) \nhelped to enact the violence against women bill; (10) supported \nprovisions making violence at abortion clinics fines non-dischargeable \nin bankruptcy; (11) authored anti-stalking laws; (12) fought to allow \nwomen accused of homicide to have the privilege of presenting battered \nspouse syndrome evidence in the courts of law. On that point, I should \nadd that as governor, he commuted the sentences of two women who did \nnot have that privilege; (13) signed Missouri's hate crimes bill into \nlaw.\n  I could go on and on. His record is distinguished.\n  I am getting a little irritated that some even implied that he might \nbe a racist, but all, including the judge for Ronnie White, said they \ndo not believe he is a racist. In fact, he is not. His record proves he \nis not. I might add that his record proves that he is in the mainstream \nof our society.\n  Senator Ashcroft appeared before the Judiciary Committee for two days \nand answered all questions completely, honestly and with the utmost \nhumility. Over the inaugural weekend, he received over 400 questions. \nHe completely answered these follow-up questions that the Senators both \non and off the committee sent to him. He has testified and committed \nboth orally and in writing that he will uphold the laws of the United \nStates, regardless of his religious views on the policy which, within \nhis constitutional duties as a Senator, he may have advocated changing. \nHe understands his role as the chief law enforcement officer of this \nnation.\n  Virtually every Senator on the committee and every Senator in this \nSenate has to admit he has the utmost integrity, honor, dignity, and \ndecency. If that is true, why not give him the benefit of the doubt \nrather than the other way?\n  We saw at the four days of hearings that even when he disagreed with \nthe underlying policies, he has an undisputable record of enforcing the \nlaws. This was the case with respect to abortion laws, gun laws, or \nlaws relating to the separation of church and state.\n  Mr. President, a great number of people have said to me that they are \ntired of living in fear. They want to go to sleep at night without \nworrying about the safety of their children or about becoming victims \nof crime themselves.\n  As someone who both knows John Ashcroft as a person and who is \nfamiliar with his distinguished 30-year record of enforcing and \nupholding the law, I can tell you that I feel a great sense of comfort \nand a newfound security in the likely prospect of his confirmation to \nbe our nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  Mr. President, as I told my committee colleagues last night, we have \nserved with John Ashcroft, and we know that he is a man of integrity, \ncommitted to the rule of law and the Constitution. We know that he is a \nman of compassion, faith, and devotion to family. We know that he is a \nman of impeccable credentials and many accomplishments.\n  Some have charged that we are asking that the Senate apply a \ndifferent standard to John Ashcroft than other nominees because he was \na member of this cherished body. Let me be clear. I am not asking nor \nadvocating that a standard be applied to his nomination that is \ndifferent than that which is applied to other nominees. I am simply \nsaying that you have worked with him and know him to be a man of his \nword. He is not the man unfairly painted as an extremist by the left-\nwing activists who have reportedly threatened Senators in their re-\nelection bids if they vote for his confirmation.\n  They present a man that none of us really know. They have distorted \nhis record and impugned his character and have exaggerated their case.\n  I am saying that a nominee, especially one we all personally know to \nbe a man of deep faith and integrity, deserves to be given the benefit \nof the doubt when he commits to us under oath that he will enforce and \nuphold the rule of law regardless of his personal or religious beliefs.\n  Mr. President, that is the benefit we accorded General Reno, \nPresident Clinton's nominee 8 years ago. She was pro-abortion, she had \nsaid so. She was anti-death penalty, she had said so. On both of these \nissues, among others, she had a totally different ideological view than \nalmost all of the Republican Senators serving at the time. But she \ncommitted to uphold the laws of the land, regardless of her personal \nviews. and we accorded her the benefit of the doubt which I believe \nPresident Bush's nominee similarly deserves, especially since we all \nknow him.\n  I ask that we evaluate this man based on his record, his testimony, \nand based on your personal experiences with him. We know John Ashcroft \nis not an extremist. That is the image of him that has been painted \nthrough a vicious campaign by a well organized group of left-wing \nspecial interest activists.\n  They have a right to be active. They have a right to complain. They \nhave a right to find fault. They have a right to present their case. \nBut they do not have a right to impugn a man's integrity, or distort \nhis record, which I think they have done.\n  Sometimes in life, though, the measure of a person is best seen in \ntimes of adversity. So it is with John Ashcroft who, after a difficult \nbattle for something that meant a great deal to him--re-election to the \nSenate--resisted calls to challenge the outcome of that election. His \nown words during this difficult time say it best:\n\n       Some things are more important than politics, and I believe \n     doing what's right is the most important thing we can do. I \n     think as public officials we have the opportunity to model \n     values for our culture--responsibility, dignity, decency, \n     integrity, and respect. And if we can only model those when \n     it's politically expedient to do so, we've never modeled the \n     values, we've only modeled political expediency.\n\n  Contrary to what a few special interest groups with a narrow \npolitical agenda would have us believe, these are not the words of an \nextremist or a divisive ideologue. These are the words of a fine public \nservant who is a man of his word and of faith and who is willing to do \nthe right thing, even when it means putting himself last.\n  Mr. President, John Ashcroft, like many of us, is a man of strongly \nheld views. I have every confidence, based on his distinguished record, \nthat as Attorney General, he will vigorously work to enforce the law--\nwhether or not the law happens to be consistent with his personal \nviews.\n  Mr. President, As I asked my colleagues in the Judiciary Committee, I \nask that in keeping with our promise to work in a bipartisan fashion, \nwe reject the politics of division. If we want to encourage the most \nqualified citizens to serve in government, we must do everything we can \nto stop what has been termed the politics of personal destruction. This \nis not to say that we should put an end to an open and candid debate on \npolicy issues. Quite the contrary: our system of government is designed \nto promote the expression of these differences and our Constitution \nprotects that expression. But the fact is that all of us both Democrats \nand Republicans, know the difference between legitimate policy debate \nand unwarranted personal attacks promoted--and sometimes urged--by \nnarrow interest groups.\n  Mr. President, let me cite just one example of what I mean by the \nnarrow interest group campaign of personal destruction. Many may have \nread, hopefully with disbelief and dismay, a New York Times report, the \nday following the release of the transcript of Senator Ashcroft's \nspeech at the Bob Jones University, which read, ``the leader of a major \nliberal group opposing Mr. Ashcroft's nomination expressed \ndisappointment that the comments were not much different from those \nmany politicians offer in religious settings.'' The piece continued, \nquoting this ``leader'' as saying `` `[t]his, clearly, will not do it,' \nthis person said of hopes that the speech might help defeat the \nnomination.''\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\n  Let me note that some opponents have charged that Senator Ashcroft's \nanswers at the hearing and his written answers to the approximately 400 \nquestions sent to him by Judiciary Committee members were evasive. \nWrong.\n  I don't know of any case where we had that many questions of a \nCabinet official. Usually it is an insignificant number.\n  Throughout, Senator Ashcroft has consistently and persuasively \nresponded that he will enforce the law irrespective of his personal \nviews. His long and distinguished record in Missouri supports his \ncommitment to follow and observe the rule of law. But that record is \nignored by his critics.\n  For some of those looking to oppose him, he simply cannot do anything \nright. When he answers questions in detail to attempt to explain his \nrecord, he's termed evasive because he should have simply answered \n``yes'' if he really meant it. When he answers a question with a simple \nand straightforward yes, he's accused of not confronting the issue \ncompletely.\n  Let us be clear. John Ashcroft is strongly pro-life. He always has \nbeen as far as I know, and I expect he always will be. He is a deeply \nreligious man--he always has been as far as I know, and I expect he \nalways will be. He has strenuously committed to a policy of equal \njustice and opportunity for all--and has a long record which supports \nthis commitment of these matters. But he opposed Mr. Hormel for an \nambassadorship, as did a number of his colleagues; he opposed Bill Lann \nLee, as did eight other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, \nincluding myself; and he opposed Justice Ronnie White. This is the \nrecord upon which many paint John Ashcroft as a right wing extremist. I \ndisagree.\n  Let me simply conclude by repeating the words of John Ashcroft which \nI cited earlier. ``Some things are more important than politics, and I \nbelieve doing what's right is the most important thing we can do.'' I \nonly hope that my colleagues will heed these words as they consider \ntheir vote in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this \nnomination.\n  By the way, I am urging my colleagues to do what we did for Attorney \nGeneral Reno: Give John Ashcroft the benefit of the doubt instead of \ntaking the exact opposite tack, of which I think I have seen enough \nevidence. When Attorney General Reno came up, there were 2 days of \nhearings. In fact, there was only 1 day for Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh. There were only 2 days for Attorney General Bill Barr, only \n2 days for Janet Reno. In none of those cases did we allow right-wing \ngroups to come in and attack the witness. We allowed them to submit \nstatements, but we didn't go on and on trying to destroy the reputation \nof really good people. John Ashcroft is really good people. He is a \ndecent, honorable, religious, thoughtful, kind man who has a reputation \nof being fair and honest. I personally resent those who try to say \notherwise and try to impugn that reputation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the comments of my friends from Utah and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He suggests a \nlot of questions were asked of Senator Ashcroft. I read today in the \nWall Street Journal, a newspaper that has strongly backed Senator \nAshcroft, they believe we didn't ask enough questions, especially \nconcerning fundraising activities by Senator Ashcroft.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Wall Street Journal \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when we talk about the time involved in a \nnomination such as this, I recall the last controversial nomination for \nAttorney General we had when the Republicans controlled the Senate. \nThat was for Edwin Meese. It took considerably longer, with far more \nwitnesses and questions than we are having in this debate. We sometimes \nforget the history of what goes on here.\n  This is a case where the White House actually sent Senator Ashcroft's \nnomination to the Senate on Monday--Monday of this week, 2 days ago. We \nare having the debate on the floor today. Prior to the President's \ninauguration, the Democrats controlled the Senate. We moved forward \neven without the paperwork or anything else from the incoming \ntransition team. We moved forward to speed up a hearing on Senator \nAshcroft.\n  Today we begin the debate on the floor, after the Judiciary Committee \ndebated the nomination yesterday and voted yesterday evening. As I \nsaid, I convened 3 days of hearings on this nomination over a 4-day \nperiod from January 16 to January 19. That was prior to having received \nall the paperwork on Senator Ashcroft. We did that to help the new \nadministration. The Republican leadership announced weeks ago that all \n50 Republican Senators would vote in favor of the nomination, \nirrespective of whatever came out of those hearings. I am glad that \nother Senators declined to prejudge the matter.\n  Actually, the Committee on the Judiciary has done the best we could \nto handle this nomination fairly and fully. We have had hearings, I \nthink, that make all members of the committee and the Senate proud. I \nhave served in this body for 26 years. I believe very much in the \ncommittee system. I believe very much in having real hearings and then \nhaving a record available for Senators.\n  In fact, we actually invited Senators who had served in the 106th \nCongress and were going to leave the committee, as well as some we \nanticipated would be coming in from both the Republican and Democratic \nside, to sit in on those hearings. I mention this because we did not \nactually set the membership of our committee until last Thursday, but \nwe did this ahead of time.\n\n  The committee heard from every single witness Senator Ashcroft or \nSenator Hatch wanted to call in his behalf. This is not a case where \nsuddenly one side or the other was something loaded up. I think there \nwere an equal number of witnesses on both sides. We completed the oral \nquestioning of Senator Ashcroft in less than a day and a half. We \nlimited each Member to two rounds of questions, for a total of only 20 \nminutes. The nominee was not invited back by the Republicans following \nthe testimony of the public witnesses. As a result, any unanswered \nquestions had to be answered in writing.\n  We then expedited the sending of written questions to the nominee. We \nsent the majority of written questions on Friday, January 19, the last \nday of the hearing, rather than waiting until the following Monday when \nthey were due. Senator Hatch sent out the final batch of written \nquestions on the Tuesday following the hearing.\n  We received some of what were described as answers to some of the \nwritten followup questions sent to the nominee late last Thursday. It \nis clear from those answers that the nominee has chosen not to respond \nto our concerns or address many of our questions. In fact, the \ncommittee has had outstanding requests to the nominee to provide a copy \nof the entire videotape of the commencement proceedings in which he \nparticipated at Bob Jones University, as has been discussed here on the \nfloor. We have had that request pending since early January. That \nvideotape was provided, incidentally, to news outlets but not to the \ncommittee.\n  I have also requested that the nominee provide a formal response to \nthe allegations that while he was Governor of Missouri he asked about a \njob applicant's sexual preference in an interview, and we have not \nreceived any answer.\n  There have been references on the floor already today as though there \nwere some kind of left-wing conspiracy to defeat John Ashcroft. I am \nnot aware of that. I have asked my questions as the Senator from \nVermont, and I responded to the interests of my constituents, both for \nand against Senator Ashcroft, from Vermont.\n  But if there is any question of whether there is influence of anybody \non this nomination, I will refer to the New York Times of Sunday, \nJanuary 7, and the Washington Post of Tuesday, January 2, in which they \nquote a number of people from the far right of the Republican Party who \nopenly bragged about the fact that they told the new President he could \nnot appoint Governor Racicot of Montana--whom he wanted to appoint--but \nthat he must appoint John Ashcroft.\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\n  I mention that because, if anybody thinks this nomination has been \ninfluenced by liberal groups, the only ones who have actually \ndetermined this nomination and have openly gone to the press and \nbragged about influencing it are an element of the far right of the \nRepublican Party. They have openly bragged about the fact that they \ntold the incoming administration and President Bush that he could not \nhave his first choice, the Governor of Montana--who is a conservative \nRepublican and now the former Governor--but that he must appoint \nSenator Ashcroft. That remains a fact. That is why we are here.\n  Notwithstanding all this, and notwithstanding the fact that the \nquestions have not all been answered, the requested material has not \nall been sent, we Democrats granted consent to advance the markup date \nin order to proceed yesterday afternoon and last evening. As the \ndistinguished chairman knows, normally we would have had our debate \nbefore the committee today. I said, following his request, that we \nwould not object to moving it up 24 hours. I was told the Republicans \nhave a meeting of their caucus scheduled for later this week and it \nwould accommodate both the new administration and the Republicans in \nthe Senate if we moved that up. I agreed to that. As I said, the Senate \nworks better if Senators can work together. Accommodation, however, \ndoes not mean changing one's vote.\n\n  We had a good debate in the committee. I think Republicans and \nDemocrats would agree it was a good, solid debate. We reported the \nnomination to the Senate by a margin of 10-8, a narrow margin. \nActually, in most of that debate we had between six and nine Democratic \nMembers present. We usually had three to four Republican Members.\n  I brought with me the hearing record. Here it is, right here. This is \na good, solid record. It is part of the history of the Senate. I wish \nall Senators would review that record. Many have. Unfortunately, we are \nnot going to have a committee report on this controversial nomination. \nI think we would have been helped by doing that. There was a time when \nwe did seek to inform the Senate with committee reports on nominations, \nnominations such as that of Brad Reynolds or William Bennett and a \nnumber of important and controversial judicial nominations. We prepared \nsuch reports when Senator Thurmond required that as chairman.\n  In lieu of a committee report, each Senator is left with the task of \nreviewing the record and searching his or her conscience and deciding \nhow to vote.\n  I did put into the Record a large and I hoped complete brief prepared \nby me and the lawyers on the Senate Judiciary staff--Bruce Cohen, Beryl \nHowell, Julie Katzman, Tim Lynch and others--which I think would be \nvery helpful to the Senate.\n  We may want to consider and contrast the behavior that has been \nengaged in on the other side. We have talked about the time this may \nhave taken. We had the hearing, we expedited the debate, and we came to \nthe floor. The consideration of the nomination of Attorney General \nMeese when the Republicans controlled the Senate--with a Republican \nSenate, one would assume that would move very quickly--that took 13, \nnot days, not weeks: 13 months. And then we had several days of debate \nin a Republican-controlled Senate before final Senate action.\n  There was reference to how we how we handled the nomination of \nAttorney General Reno. That was noncontroversial, and that still took a \nmonth from nomination to confirmation. She was not confirmed by the \nSenate until mid-March in the first year of President Clinton's term. \nAttorney General Meese was not confirmed by the Senate until late \nFebruary in 1985, at the beginning of President Reagan's second term. \nHere we are in January. This nomination was sent to the Senate on \nMonday, 48 hours ago.\n  I hope those who advise the President will point out to him these \nfacts so he is not under the impression this nomination has been \ndelayed from Senate consideration. The Democrats, when we controlled \nthe Senate for a few weeks, expedited this. Republicans, when they \ncontrolled the Senate at the time of President Reagan, took 13 months \nto get his nomination of Edwin Meese through.\n  I have reviewed the hearing record and the nominee's responses to the \nwritten followup questions from the Judiciary Committee. I did that \nbefore I announced I would oppose John Ashcroft to be Attorney General \nof the United States.\n  I have talked to the Senate already about this, and to the committee, \nabout my reasons for opposing the nomination. I expect we will go back \nto this during the debate.\n  Let's not lose sight of the historical context in which we consider \nthis nomination. This is an especially sensitive time in our Nation's \nhistory. Many seeds of disunity have been carried aloft by winds that \ncome in gusts--especially, unfortunately, from the State of Florida. \nThe Presidential election, the margin of victory, the way in which the \nvote counting was halted by five members of the U.S. Supreme Court--\nthese remain sources of public concern and even alienation. Deep \ndivisions within our country have infected the body politic. We \nexperienced the closest Presidential election in the last 130 years, \nprobably the closest in our history. For the first time, a candidate \nwho received more votes than were cast for the victor in the last three \nelections for President, who received half a million more votes than \nthe person who eventually was inaugurated as President--received half a \nmillion more votes, I should say, than the man who became President--\nsaw the man who became President declared the victor of the \nPresidential election by one electoral vote.\n  I do not question the fact that President Bush is legitimately our \nPresident. Of course, he is. I was at the inauguration. We all were. He \nwas inaugurated. Yet, I would hope Senators will realize the concerns \nin this country: One person gets half a million more votes, the other \nperson becomes President; the one who becomes President after a \ndisputed count in one State becomes President by one electoral vote.\n  He is President. He has all the powers, he has all the obligations, \nall the duties of the Presidency, and all the legitimacy of the \nPresidency. I have no question about that. But I think he has an \nobligation to try to unite the country, not to divide the country. In \nfact, 11 days ago, President Bush acknowledged the difficulties of \nthese times and the special needs of a divided Nation. He said:\n\n       While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the \n     promise, even the justice, of our own country.\n\n  He pledged to ``work to build a single nation of justice and \nopportunity.''\n  I was one of those who had lunch with the new President less than an \nhour after his inauguration. I spoke to him and told him how much his \nspeech meant to me. I told him he will be the sixth President with whom \nI have served. I told him how impressed I was by his inaugural speech. \nI said he had a sense of history and a sense of country, and I \napplauded him for it. I do think the nomination of John Ashcroft to be \nAttorney General does not meet the standard that the President himself \nhas set. For those who doubt the promise of American justice--and, \nunfortunately, there are many in this country who doubt it--this \nnomination does not inspire confidence in the U.S. Department of \nJustice.\n  My Republican colleagues have urged us to rely on John Ashcroft's \npromise to enforce the law, as if that is the only requirement to be an \nAttorney General.\n  If Senator Ashcroft would have come before the committee and said he \nwould not enforce the law, we would not be debating this issue today. I \ncannot imagine any nominee--and I have sat in on hundreds of nomination \nhearings--would say they would not enforce the law. That is not the end \nof the story. The Senate's constitutional duty to advise and consent is \nnot limited to extracting a promise from a nominee that he will abide \nby his oath of office. Let me quote what my good friend, Senator Hatch, \nsaid on the floor on November 4, 1997, about the nomination of Bill \nLann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights:\n\n       His talents and good intentions have taken him far. But his \n     good intentions should not be sufficient to earn the consent \n     of this body. Those charged with enforcing the Nation's law \n     must demonstrate a proper understanding of that law, and a \n     determination to\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\n     uphold its letter and its spirit * * *. At his hearing before \n     the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Lee suggested he would enforce \n     the law without regard to his personal opinions. But that \n     cannot be the end of our inquiry. The Senate's responsibility \n     is then to determine what the nominee's view of the law is.\n\n  Like Senator Ashcroft, Bill Lann Lee promised to enforce the law as \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court. He made the promise emphatically, he \nmade it repeatedly, and he made it specifically with respect to certain \nSupreme Court decisions with which he may have personally disagreed. \nDespite all of Bill Lann Lee's assurances that he would enforce the \nlaw, the Republican-controlled Senate would not allow a vote up or down \non the floor on his nomination.\n  I believe John Ashcroft's assurances that he would enforce the law is \nnot the end of our inquiry. Far more than the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights, a job to which Bill Lann Lee was nominated, \nthe Attorney General has vast authority to interpret the law and to \nparticipate in the law's development.\n  Unlike one of his assistants, he has to be held to a higher standard \nbecause he sets the policy. The assistant carries out the policy of the \nAttorney General. The Attorney General's job is not merely to decide \nwhether common crimes, such as bank robbery, should be prosecuted. Of \ncourse, they should. Does anybody believe that whoever is Attorney \nGeneral faced with something as horrendous as the Oklahoma City bombing \nis going to say, ``I am not going to prosecute''? Does anybody believe \nan Attorney General faced with a skyjacking or assassination is going \nto say, ``I am not going to prosecute''? Of course, they are going to \nprosecute.\n  But there are many other less spectacular matters, matters that are \nnot in the news every day, where the Attorney General has to decide how \nthe law is to be enforced. The Attorney General has more discretion in \nthis regard than anybody in Government.\n  The Attorney General advises the President on judicial nominations. \nHe decides what positions to take before the Supreme Court and lower \nFederal courts. He decides which of our thousands of statutes require \ndefending or interpreting. He allocates enforcement resources. The \nAttorney General decides whom we are going to sue and, even more \nimportantly, perhaps, decides which cases we are going to settle. He \nmakes hiring and firing decisions. He sets a tone for the Nation's law \nenforcement officials.\n  I think it is reasonable to go back and look at how John Ashcroft \nacted as attorney general before, and I go back to Missouri. Again, he \nwas sworn to enforce the laws and all the laws. So how did he focus the \nresources of his office? This is how he did it.\n  He focused the resources of his office on banning abortions and also \non blocking nurses from dispensing birth control pills and IUDs. He \nsued political dissenters, and he fought voluntary desegregation. I am \nsure with murder cases or anything else such as that he would enforce \nthe law, but it is how he chose to decide which of those discretionary \nareas to act in that troubles me.\n  He has used language here describing the judiciary that is disturbing \nto many. He has shown what Senator Biden calls ``bad judgment'' in \nassociating with Bob Jones University and Southern Partisan magazine, \nand he unfairly besmirched the reputations of Presidential nominees, \nincluding Judge Ronnie White and Ambassador James Hormel.\n  I am particularly concerned that he has not fully accepted what he \nnow calls the settled law regarding a woman's right to choose. His \nconfirmation evolution seems implausible, given his support less than 3 \nyears ago for the Human Life Act, which he now admits is \nunconstitutional even though he supported it, and his denial of the \n``legitimacy'' of Roe and Casey in the 1997 ``Judicial Despotism'' \nspeech, in which he called the Supreme Court ``ruffians in robes.''\n  I have disagreed with the Supreme Court on some cases, but I have \nnever called them that.\n  His assurances are totally undercut by the recent remarks of \nPresident Bush and Vice President Cheney. Just 1 day after Senator \nAshcroft assured the committee that Roe and Casey were settled law and \nthat he would not seek an opportunity to overturn them, the President \nsaid he would not rule out having the Justice Department argue for that \nresult. The Vice President similarly refused to commit himself on this \nissue over the weekend.\n  A promise to enforce the law is only a minimum qualification for the \njob of Attorney General. It is not a sufficient one. It is simply not \nenough just to say you will enforce the law.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's record does matter in making a judgment about \nwhether he is the right person for this job. Throughout the committee \nhearings, my Republican colleagues said we should give Senator Ashcroft \ncredit for his public service. I agree with that, just as I give him \nstrong credit and admire him for his devotion to his family and his \nreligion.\n  At the same time, my Republican friends insist that his record and \nthe positions he has taken in public service do not matter because he \nwill take now a different position as U.S. Attorney General.\n  President Bush asked us to look into Senator Ashcroft's heart, but we \nare being urged not to look into his record. I do not doubt the \ngoodness of his heart. I do doubt the consistency of his record.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues went so far as to argue we should \nnot hear from any witnesses other than the nominee, that we need not \nreview all the nominee's required financial disclosures and his files \nand his speeches before passing on this nomination. That is not the way \nwe go about our responsibility of advise and consent. Remember, the \nConstitution does say advise and consent, not advise and rubber stamp.\n  That is why, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, during the weeks \nI held that post, I refused to railroad this nomination through. \nInstead, I had full, fair, informative hearings to review the nominee's \nrecord and positions.\n  The American people are entitled to an Attorney General who is more \nthan just an amiable friend to many of us here in the Senate and \npromises more than just a bare minimum that he will enforce the law. \nThey are entitled to someone who will uphold the Constitution as \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court, respect the courts, abide by \ndecisions he disagrees with, and enforce the law for everybody \nregardless of politics. The way to determine that is to look at the \nnominee's record, not to engage in metaphysical speculation about his \nheart.\n  John Ashcroft's stubborn insistence on re-litigating a voluntary \ndesegregation decree consented to by all the other parties over and \nover again, at great expense to the State of Missouri and with \nsometimes damaging disruption to the education of Missouri's children, \nis relevant. It is relevant because someone who has used his power as a \nState Attorney General to delay and obstruct efforts to remedy past \nracial discrimination by the State, and who has then publicly \nexcoriated the judges who ruled against him and made a major political \nissue of his disagreements with the courts, may use his greater power \nas the U.S. Attorney General for similarly divisive political purposes.\n  His effort as a State Attorney General to suppress the political \nspeech of a group with which he disagreed--the National Organization of \nWomen--by means of an antitrust suit is relevant, because it reflects \non how he might respond to political dissent as U.S. Attorney General.\n  His actions as Governor of Missouri and as a U.S. Senator are also \nrelevant. In those offices, he took the same oath of office to uphold \nthe Constitution that he would take as U.S. Attorney General. Yet, in \nboth of those offices, he sponsored legislation that was patently \nunconstitutional under Roe v. Wade: the 1991 anti-abortion bill in \nMissouri, and the 1998 ``Human Life Act'' in the Senate. It is highly \nrelevant to ask why, if his oath of office did not constrain him from \nignoring the Constitution in those public offices, we should expect it \nto constrain him as Attorney General. And it is also relevant to ask \nwhether the same John Ashcroft who as a U.S. Senator went around making \npublic speeches calling a majority of the current conservative Supreme \nCourt ``five ruffians in robes'' has the temperament needed to be an \neffective advocate before that same Court as U.S. Attorney General.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  I cannot judge John Ashcroft's heart. But we can all judge his \nrecord. Running through that record are troubling, recurrent themes: \ndisrespect for Supreme Court precedent with which he disagrees; grossly \nintemperate criticism of judges with whom he disagrees; insensitivity \nand bad judgment on racial issues; and the use of distortions, secret \nholds and ambushes to destroy the public careers of those whom he \nopposes.\n  I cannot give my consent to this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I will say more, but I see several Senators from both \nsides of the aisle on the floor. I am going to withhold in just a \nmoment. But just think for a moment, we are a nation of 280 million \nAmericans. What a fantastic nation we are. We range across the \npolitical spectrum, across the economic spectrum, all races and \nreligions.\n  I think of, in my own case, my mother's family coming to this country \nnot speaking a word of English. My grandfathers were stonecutters in \nVermont. I look at the diversity of ethnic backgrounds in our family, \nmy wife growing up speaking a language other than English. We have \ngreat diversity in this country and, over it all, everybody knowing, \nwhether they are an immigrant stonecutter or whether they are a wealthy \nMember of the Senate, the laws will always treat them the same; \neverybody knowing, whether they are black or white, they can rely on \nthe law to treat them the same.\n  But on top of all that, the Attorney General of the United States \nrepresents all of us. The Attorney General is not the lawyer for the \nPresident; the President has a White House counsel. In fact, to show \nthe separation, the White House counsel does not require Senate \nconfirmation; he or she is appointed by the President, and that is the \nchoice of the President alone. But the Attorney General requires \nconfirmation because the Attorney General represents all of us.\n  We hold this country together because we assume the law treats us all \nthe same. When I look at the public opinion polls in this country and \nsee a nation deeply divided over this choice for Attorney General, it \nshows me that American people do not have confidence in this \nnomination. I hope, if John Ashcroft is confirmed, he will take steps \nto heal those divisions, take steps to say he will be the Attorney \nGeneral for everybody, not just for one group who told the President he \nhad to appoint him. So in that regard, I hope all Senators will think \nabout that.\n  Mr. President, I will go back to this later on, but I see other \nSenators on the floor, so I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 31, 2001]\n\n        Senate Panel Backs Ashcroft Despite Fund-Raising Issues\n\n                (By Tom Hamburger and Rachel Zimmerman)\n\n       Washington.--The Senate Judiciary Committee narrowly sent \n     John Ashcroft's nomination as attorney general to the Senate \n     floor, even as outside critics complained that his history of \n     aggressive fund raising raises questions about his ability to \n     enforce campaign-finance laws.\n       The committee's 10-8 vote, with Democrat Russell Feingold \n     of Wisconsin joining the committee's nine Republicans, \n     signaled that Mr. Ashcroft is almost certain to win \n     confirmation from the full Senate later this week. But the \n     panel's sharp division and Senate Minority Leader Thomas \n     Daschle's announcement yesterday that he will vote against \n     his former colleague reflect the strong opposition among \n     Democratic constituencies to Mr. Ashcroft's staunchly \n     conservative record.\n       Mr. Daschle accused the Missouri Republican of having \n     ``misled the Senate and deliberately distorted'' the record \n     of African-American judicial nominee Ronnie White, leading \n     the Senate to reject Mr. White's nomination to the federal \n     bench. Answering such attacks for the GOP, Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah complained that a \n     ``vicious'' campaign by liberal advocacy groups had left \n     Democratic senators giving Mr. Ashcroft ``not one positive \n     benefit of the doubt.''\n       One of Mr. Ashcroft's most voluble opponents, Democratic \n     Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, indicated that he won't \n     attempt to block the nomination with a filibuster. President \n     Bush urged quick action by the Senate so that his \n     administration could proceed with the organization of the \n     Justice Department, where a number of top department \n     appointments have been held up pending action on Mr. \n     Ashcroft.\n       ``I would just hope there are no further delays,'' Mr. Bush \n     said. ``There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of debate . . \n     . and it's now time for the vote, it seems like to me.''\n       Actually, the former senator's history of campaign fund \n     raising hasn't been debated much within the Senate. Mr. \n     Feingold, who backed Mr. Ashcroft in yesterday's vote, is one \n     of the chamber's leading advocates of campaign reform. But \n     yesterday, he cited the ``substantial deference'' a president \n     deserves in nominations.\n       Critics say Mr. Ashcroft has repeatedly pushed at the edges \n     of campaign-finance regulations by using taxpayer-financed \n     office staff to wage election campaigns, and by joining other \n     candidates in both parties in finding loopholes that have \n     allowed him to pursue larger donations than the $1,000-a-\n     person contributions permitted to a candidate's campaign \n     committee.\n       Those critics, from Democrats in Mr. Ashcroft's home state \n     to representatives of national organizations promoting \n     campaign-finance overhaul, say the lack of attention to the \n     issue reflects how deeply the Senate itself is steeped in the \n     techniques of fully exploiting the campaign-finance system. \n     But at a time when an overhaul bill may soon overcome \n     lingering resistance on Capitol Hill, they say Mr. Ashcroft's \n     record casts a cloud over his commitment to enforce \n     rigorously the laws regulating how political money is raised \n     and spent.\n       ``The Senate has completely failed its obligation to pursue \n     this line of inquiry,'' complains John Bonifaz, executive \n     director of the National Voting Rights Institute, a Boston \n     nonprofit group that specializes in campaign finance and \n     civil-rights litigation.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's backers on Capitol Hill and in the Bush \n     administration dismiss the complaints as ideologically \n     inspired sniping. Administration spokeswoman Mindy Tucker \n     says Mr. Ashcroft has ``always adhered to the law on \n     campaign-finance issues and his campaign-finance practices \n     have been above reproach.''\n       Like other senators in both parties, Mr. Ashcroft formed a \n     joint committee with his national party's Senate campaign arm \n     to collect unregulated ``soft money.'' When he was exploring \n     a presidential bid, he went to Virginia, which has few \n     campaign-money limits, to establish a political action \n     committee that accepted a $400,000 donation. ``A blatant \n     evasion of laws that are designed to protect against the kind \n     of corruption the attorney general is charged with \n     upholding,'' complains Scott Harshbarger, Common Cause \n     president.\n       In one case, Missouri Democrats allege, Mr. Ashcroft went \n     over the line of propriety. It dates to 1982, when Mr. \n     Ashcroft was Missouri attorney general and brought an action \n     against a local oil company for selling tainted gasoline. The \n     company, Inland Oil, countersued, charging that Mr. \n     Ashcroft's actions were motivated by his desire to win \n     election as governor. In a deposition. Mr. Ashcroft's \n     administrative assistant said be worked on Mr. Ashcroft's \n     election campaign while a state employee and contacted \n     potential campaign contributors from his government office.\n       The lawsuit also noted that Mr. Ashcroft had solicited an \n     executive of Inland Oil for a donation to the state GOP in a \n     fund-raising appeal under the state attorney general's \n     letterhead, and that he personally sought a donation from a \n     barge-company owner who did business with Inland. Mr. \n     Ashcroft has said the mail solicitation was merely sent in \n     his name, and Ms. Tucker says he hadn't known of the barge \n     concern's connection to Inland when he sought a donation.\n       The state later settled its complaint against Inland Oil, \n     which in turn dropped its counter suit. An opposing legal \n     counsel in that case, Alex Bartlett, says Mr. Ashcroft \n     ``caved'' on the case to avoid answering questions about his \n     fund-raising practices. Mr. Bartlett also says Mr. Ashcroft \n     later exacted retribution by effectively blocking the Clinton \n     administration from nominating him for a federal judgeship in \n     the mid-1990s. Former White House Counsel Abner Mikva says \n     then-Sen. Ashcroft told him in early 1995, ``I don't like'' \n     Mr. Bartlett.\n       Ms. Tucker rejects that interpretation of events, saying \n     Mr. Ashcroft negotiated an appropriate settlement in the \n     Inland Oil matter. If he later expressed reservations about \n     Mr. Bartlett to Mr. Mikva, she adds, he didn't block him from \n     the bench since Mr. Bartlett was never formally nominated. \n     She also says Mr. Ashcroft never used public employees to \n     perform campaign work except in their off ours.\n\n\n                         Fund-Raising Vehicles\n\n       John Ashcroft has harvested donations, in recent years \n     using these political committees:\n       Ashcroft 2000: Senate re-election committee raised $8.9 \n     million in ``hard'' money subject to federal limits of $1,000 \n     per individual donation, $5,000 per political action \n     committee.\n       Ashcroft Victory Fund: Collected $3.8 million unregulated \n     ``soft'' money during 1999-2000, split evenly between \n     Ashcroft 2000 and National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n       Spirit of America PAC: So-called leadership PAC collected \n     $3.6 million in hard money since 1997, largely to finance \n     Ashcroft's exploration of a presidential bid.\n       American Values PAC: Virginia-based PAC raised $586,533 \n     beginning in 1998, which financed TV ads in Iowa and New \n     Hampshire.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments that both Chairman \nHatch and Senator Leahy have just made with respect to this nomination.\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\n  We began when I referred to Senator Leahy as Mr. Chairman, and now we \nare nearing the conclusion of this during the time that Senator Hatch \nwill be referred to as Mr. Chairman. I agree, it is time to bring the \nconfirmation proceedings for Senator Ashcroft to a close.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the long-range implications of \ntheir votes with respect to Senator Ashcroft. I have, I think, never \nregretted voting for a nominee for office, but I have regretted some of \nthe votes I have cast against nominees. I hope my colleagues judge how \ntheir votes will be considered a year from now, 4 years from now, \nperhaps 20 years from now, in thinking about how they will cast their \nvotes.\n  Most of the points Senator Leahy made have been made before and have \nbeen fairly thoroughly rehashed during the committee process and in \nother forums. I would really like to only respond to three points \nSenator Leahy just made.\n  First, he made this comment in the Judiciary Committee meeting \nyesterday, as well. Senator Leahy said it is not liberal or left-wing \ngroups that have influenced this nomination but, rather, groups on the \nfar right. And it is possible, of course, for anybody to brag about \nwhat they may or may not have done. President Bush is fully capable of \ndeciding whom he is going to nominate for Attorney General. I was one \nof the people who recommended John Ashcroft to him. So I do not think \nwe can ascribe John Ashcroft's nomination to the fact that some people \nwho are very conservative brag about the fact that they stopped \nsomebody else and recommended his nomination. He was recommended by \nother people as well, including myself.\n  In any event, I think it is rather odd to suggest that liberal groups \nhave not been actively involved in this debate. Immediately after it \nbegan, I received a copy of a special report from the People for the \nAmerican Way--clearly a liberal, left leaning group--making the case \nagainst the confirmation of John Ashcroft as Attorney General. And page \nafter page after page of it, in effect, is opposition research opposing \nthe nomination.\n  I also will note just one story from the Washington Times of January \n17 of this year. I will quote this at length because I think it makes \nthe point rather clearly.\n\n       Senate Democrats are under enormous pressure from liberal \n     interest groups to defeat Mr. Ashcroft, whom they accuse of \n     insensitivity to minorities and of harboring a stealth agenda \n     to undermine abortion rights.\n       Yesterday, Kweisi Mfume, president of the National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said his \n     organization will ``fund major information campaigns for the \n     next 4 years'' in States whose senators vote in favor of Mr. \n     Ashcroft.\n\n  This is continuing the quotation from Mr. Mfume:\n\n       Senators who vote for Ashcroft will not be able to run away \n     from this and assume people will forget, said Mr. Mfume. For \n     Democratic senators, in particular, this vote comes as close \n     to a litmus test as one can get on the issue of civil rights \n     and equal justice under law from the party's most loyal \n     constituency.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think it really matters much. It is very \nclear that both liberal and conservative interest groups have weighed \nin on this nomination. It is totally appropriate for them to do so. \nTherefore, I am not quite clear why one would make the point that it is \nonly conservative groups who have weighed in. Clearly, liberal groups \nhave weighed in as well. That is their right.\n  I, in fact, admire those Democratic Senators who will vote to confirm \nSenator Ashcroft because I appreciate the intense pressure they are \nunder. We all have pressures, but it takes courage sometimes to go \nagainst what they may perceive as going against the grain in their own \nState.\n  The second point made was that this was a divisive nominee. It is a \nlittle hard for me to understand how a nomination can be divisive until \nsomebody objects. President Bush laid out his potential Cabinet, and \nimmediately all attention focused on three of those nominees. They were \nsaid to be divisive. They were divisive because somebody objected to \nthem.\n  Third--and this relates to it--this business about enforcing the law \nhas really put Senator Ashcroft in a difficult position. It is a catch-\n22 for him; he cannot win, literally.\n  If he says he will enforce the law, which, of course, every nominee \nhas said, then he is subject to the criticism that this is a change, a \nnew Ashcroft, and we can't believe that he will, in fact, enforce the \nlaw. What is he to do? He can't prove a negative. He can't prove he \nwill not fail to enforce the law.\n  We can look to his experience. We can look to his service in the \nSenate.\n  One of our colleagues who will be voting on him made this statement. \nThis is from West Virginia Democratic Senator Robert Byrd:\n\n       I'm going to vote for him. He was a legislator. His \n     opinions at that time were the opinions of someone who writes \n     the laws. He is now going to be an officer who enforces the \n     laws. He will put his hand on the Bible. He will swear to \n     uphold the law, that he will enforce the law. He has said so, \n     and I take him at his word. I believe Ashcroft means what he \n     says.\n\n  Of course, some have noted that John Ashcroft is a very religious \nman. Yet it seems paradoxical to me that after referring to his faith, \nthey would somehow doubt that he would be firm in his commitment to \nuphold the laws. I agree with Senator Byrd. We can trust this man, that \nhe will do what he says he will do.\n  I will submit for the Record just one of the many examples that one \ncan point to about the immediate past Attorney General not enforcing \nthe law; in this case, a situation in which Attorney General Reno \nspecifically refused to enforce the Controlled Substances Act when it \ndealt with the matter of assisted suicide. Yet I heard nobody who is a \ncritic of John Ashcroft criticize Attorney General Reno for her refusal \nto enforce existing law.\n  These are matters of judgment, and reasonable people will differ. \nThat is why it is especially perplexing to me to note the vehemence \nwith which some have expressed opposition to Senator Ashcroft on the \ngrounds that they know he won't enforce the law. That is perplexing to \nme.\n  A final point on this--it has been made over and over, but I think it \nbears a little bit of discussion right now--Bill Lann Lee was a nominee \nof Bill Clinton for a very important job in the Justice Department, \nhead of the Civil Rights Division. There were many who opposed his \nnomination, including myself. Senator Leahy and others have been very \ncritical of our opposition. In effect, they have said we should not \nhave opposed him for that position. We applied too tough a standard; we \nshould have believed him when he said he would enforce the law.\n  Not getting into all of the reasons why we didn't think he would \nenforce the law and why, as it turns out, we were correct. Nonetheless, \npeople such as Senator Leahy have been very critical of us for the \nstance we took. Yet they are now saying they are going to apply the \nsame test they say we applied in the case of Bill Lann Lee. Either we \nwere wrong in that case and that test should not be applied or we were \nright and it is a test that can be applied. And they then apply it and \nperhaps reach a different conclusion than we.\n  We should discuss this honestly. I don't think you can say on the one \nhand that test was wrong for Republicans to apply in the case of Bill \nLann Lee but it is right for Democrats to apply it in the case of John \nAshcroft. Which is it? If it is wrong for us to say we just didn't \nbelieve that Bill Lann Lee could do what he said he would do, then the \nDemocrats have a very tough argument to make that they should be able \nto say precisely that with respect to John Ashcroft.\n\n  The bottom line is, it doesn't matter what John Ashcroft says to some \nSenators. They have reached a conclusion--I will suggest in good faith; \nI will never question the motives of my colleagues even if they \nvehemently disagree with me--that he is not suitable to be the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. That is their right.\n  I don't think John Ashcroft can ever satisfy them. He can say: I \npromise you I will uphold the law, as he did over and over and over \nagain in the hearing. We know he is a man of integrity and no one has \nquestioned that. Yet they still apply this test which, in their minds, \nrequires them to vote against his confirmation. So be it.\n  We have to be honest about the application of these tests. If it is \nfair to do it in the case of John Ashcroft, then it\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nwas fair for Republicans to do it in the case of Bill Lann Lee. We \nsimply reached different conclusions. If it was unfair in the case of \nBill Lann Lee, then it certainly can be argued to be unfair in the case \nof John Ashcroft.\n  People who argue about this ``rule of law'' point would be much more \ncredible if over the course of the last 8 years they would have been \nmore outspoken about the repeated problems of the immediate past \nadministration with respect to the rule of law. They were defending \ntheir administration. They were defending their Attorney General and \ntheir President. They didn't speak out about these matters.\n  The rule of law is really at the bottom the most important thing that \nthose of us on the Judiciary Committee can focus on and that we do need \nto consider when the President has nominees pending on the floor. That \nis why I am happy to conclude these brief remarks with my view that \nthere is no one whom I believe in more with respect to fulfilling the \nresponsibility to support the rule of law than John Ashcroft, a man of \ngreat integrity, a man of unquestioned intelligence and experience--in \nfact, the most experienced nominee ever for the position of Attorney \nGeneral--a man who repeatedly was elected by his constituents in \nMissouri, who had every opportunity to view him as an extremist, if \nthat in fact had been the case, but it was not; and a man who served in \nthis body for 6 years.\n  During that time, he was a friend of virtually everybody in the body \nbecause they knew him, they liked him, they trusted him, and they \nworked with him. Therefore, it is perplexing and hurtful to me to hear \nsome of the things that have been said about him in connection with his \nconfirmation.\n  Oppose him if you will; that is your right. Reasonable people can \nreach different conclusions about whether he should be confirmed. But \nwe need to do it in a civil way so that there is not lasting harm done \neither to the confirmation process, to the legitimacy of the Senate's \nactions with respect to confirmation, or to the legitimacy of President \nBush and his Department of Justice under the leadership of John \nAshcroft.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider whether in 4 or 5 or 6 years they \nwill be happy with and glad to defend a negative vote on this \nconfirmation. I urge them to consider that carefully.\n  I am very proud to express my strong support for the nomination of \nJohn Ashcroft. He will, in the words of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, make a \nsuperb U.S. Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I express my appreciation to our \nchairman and the members of the Judiciary Committee for the way these \nhearings were held on Senator Ashcroft to be the Attorney General, at \nthat time chaired by our long-time friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, \nand also, in terms of the markup, by Senator Hatch. Those who had the \nopportunity to watch the course of the hearings would understand the \nsense of fairness and fair play all of us who are members of the \ncommittee believe they conducted the hearings with. I am grateful to \nboth of them.\n  I hope at the start of this debate that we can put aside the cliches \nand the sanctimonious attitudes we sometimes hear on the floor of the \nSenate that those of us who have very serious and deeply felt concerns \nabout this nominee somehow are responding to various constituency \ngroups, or somehow these views are not deeply held or deeply valued. I \nhave been around here long enough to know that in many situations, it \nis very easy for any of us to say those who agree with our position are \ngreat statesmen and women, and those who differ with us are just \nnothing but ordinary politicians who are not exercising their good \njudgment.\n  Those are policies or at least slogans which are sometimes used here.\n  This issue is too important not to have respect for those views that \nsupport the nominee as well, hopefully, as those that have serious \nreservations about it.\n  Listening to my friend from Arizona talk about the difference between \nBill Lann Lee and this nominee, the differences couldn't have been \ngreater. Bill Lann Lee was committed to upholding the law and had a \nlong-time commitment to upholding the law. His statements to the \ncommittee confirmed a commitment to uphold the law just like Dr. \nSatcher and Dr. Foster.\n  Many of us have serious concerns about this nominee's commitment to \nthe fundamental constitutional rights that involve millions of our \nfellow citizens in the areas of civil rights, women's rights, privacy, \nas well as the issues of the Second Amendment, and the treatment of \nnominees over a long period of time. I think the record will reflect \nthat I find very, very powerful and convincing evidence that the \nnominee fails to give the assurance to the American people, should he \ngain the approval, that he will protect those particular rights and \nliberties of our citizens.\n  I intend to outline my principal concerns in the time that I have \nthis morning.\n  Mr. President, two weeks ago the Judiciary Committee heard four days \nof testimony on Senator Ashcroft's nomination to serve as Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. We heard Senator Ashcroft--as well as \nthose who support and oppose his nomination--discuss his record.\n  I found the testimony on civil rights, women's rights, gun control, \nand nominations very disturbing. As I said then, Americans must be \nconfident that the Attorney General and the Justice Department will \nvigorously enforce our nation's most important laws and vigorously \ndefend our citizens' most important rights. Neither Senator Ashcroft \nnor his supporters have been able to provide that assurance.\n  Civil rights is the unfinished business of America, and the people of \nthis country deserve an attorney general who is sensitive to the needs \nand rights of all Americans, regardless of color. It is not enough for \nSenator Ashcroft to say after the fact that he will always enforce the \nlaws fairly. We must instead examine his record as Attorney General of \nMissouri and as Governor of Missouri and the impact he had on the civil \nrights of the citizens of Missouri. We must consider whether as \nAttorney General or Governor of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft tried to \nadvance the cause of civil rights in his state or whether he tried to \nset up roadblocks. Based on the totality of his record, I must sadly \nconclude that he did the latter. I am particularly concerned about \nSenator Ashcroft's testimony on school desegregation in St. Louis. He \nasserted that the discrimination that segregated the schools of St. \nLouis was from the distant past and that the state had not actively \ndiscriminated since the decision by the United States Supreme Court \nBrown v. Board of Education in 1954. He made sweeping general \nstatements about having always opposed segregation and supported \nintegration. He made specific claims that he complied with all court \norders, that the state was not a party to the lawsuits and that the \nstate had never been found guilty of any wrongdoing.\n  Those statements and claims are inconsistent with the facts and with \nhis record as Attorney General and Governor of Missouri. I see no \nplausible conclusion other than that Senator Ashcroft misled the \ncommittee during his testimony.\n  Senator Ashcroft's testimony that state sponsored segregation ended \nin the 1950s sheds light on his attitude about discrimination and his \nwillingness to turn a blind eye to the disenfranchised. Responding to a \nlist of the state actions that maintained segregated schools, Senator \nAshcroft said:\n\n       Virtually none of the offensive activities described in \n     what you charged happened in the state after Brown v. Board \n     of Education. As a matter of fact, most of them had been \n     eliminated far before Brown v. Board of Education.\n       Secondly, in saying that the city maintained a segregated \n     school system into the '70s, is simply a way of saying that \n     after Brown v. Board of Education when citizens started to \n     flee the city and move to the county . . . the schools, as \n     people changed their location, began to be more intensely \n     segregated. That was after the rules of segregation had been \n     lifted, and it was not a consequence of any state activity.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's testimony, at best, ignored the undeniable facts \nabout school segregation in St. Louis, ignored court rulings, and was \nvery misleading. In fact, far from having eliminated the ``offensive \nactivities'' Senator Ashcroft referred to ``far before Brown,'' \nMissouri was still passing\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nnew segregation laws in the decade before the Brown decision, going as \nfar as amending its state constitution to require segregation.\n  In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Senator Ashcroft \ndenied that the city maintained a segregated school system into the \n1970s. He testified that the schools remained segregated only because \nwhites fled the city. He emphasized that this segregation ``was not a \nconsequence of any state activity.'' Again, this statement is seriously \nmisleading in light of the facts and the court rulings.\n  The record shows that the response by St. Louis to the Brown decision \nwas what the school board called a ``neighborhood school plan.'' The \nplan was designed to maintain the pre-Brown state of segregation in the \nSt. Louis schools, and that is exactly what it did.\n  Reviewing the board's 1954-56 neighborhood school plan, the 8th \ncircuit found:\n\n       The boundary lines for the high schools, however, were \n     drawn so as to assign the students living in the \n     predominately black neighborhoods to the two pre-Brown black \n     high schools. Following implementation of the School Board \n     plan, both of these schools opened with 100 percent black \n     enrollments. the elementary school boundaries were also drawn \n     so that the school remained highly segregated.\n\n  The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals went on to make clear that there was \nno justification, other than perpetuating segregation, for the \nboundaries chosen:\n\n       The Board could have, without sacrificing the neighborhood \n     concept, drawn the boundaries so as to include significant \n     numbers of white students in the formerly all-black schools. \n     a reading of the record also makes clear, however, that \n     strong community opposition has prevented the Board from \n     integrating the white children of South St. Louis with the \n     black children of North St. Louis.\n\n  The board's own documents show that maintaining the status quo of \nsegregation was the intent of the plan, and that the new attendance \nzones were drawn to reassign the fewest number of students possible. \nLeaving no stone unturned, the board also made sure that the staffs of \nthe schools remained segregated as well.\n  The court went on to make clear findings of fact that contrary to \nSenator Ashcroft's testimony, the board's active segregation of the \nschools did not end in the 1950s. In fact, the board actively used a \nstudent transfer program, forced busing, school site selection and \nfaculty assignments throughout the 1950s, 1970s and into the 1970s to \nmaintain the segregated status quo. In 1962, all 28 of the pre-Brown \nblack schools were all or virtually all black, and 26 still had \nfaculties that were 100 percent black. At the same time, the pre-Brown \nwhite schools that had switched racial identities has switched their \nfaculties from white to black also.\n  Choosing sites for new schools could have helped, but instead was \nalso used to make the segregation even worse. In 1964, ten new schools \nwere opened and were placed so their ``neighborhoods'' would ensure \nsegregated enrollment--all ten opened with between 98.5 percent and 100 \npercent black students. From 1962 to 1975, there were 36 schools \nopened--35 were at least 93 percent segregated, only 1 was integrated.\n  Forced busing was also designed to continue segregation. As late as \n1973, 3,700 students were being bused to schools outside their \nneighborhoods to reduce overcrowding. The vast majority of the black \nstudents were bused to other predominantly black schools, while \nvirtually all of the white students were sent to other white schools. \nOnly 27 white students were bused to black schools.\n  The court of appeals summed up the continuing legacy of \ndiscrimination in 1980, in a case that Attorney General Ashcroft had \nlitigated for the state:\n\n       The dual school system in St. Louis, legally mandated \n     before 1954 and perpetuated by the Board of Education's 1954-\n     1956 desegregation plan, has been maintained and strengthened \n     by the actions of the Board in the years since.\n\n  All of these numbers and statements are facts according to the \nfederal courts--from federal court cases that Attorney General Ashcroft \nlitigated. Senator Ashcroft knew these facts. He knew them in the 1980s \nwhen he tried these cases. He knew them in 1984 when he ran for \ngovernor as the candidate who would fight the hardest against \nintegration. And, most important, he knew them when he testified before \nthe Committee.\n  Senator Ashcroft also gave misleading testimony about his own actions \nin fighting school desegregation. He claims that he has always \nsupported integration and supported desegregation. But his protracted \nand tenacious legal fight against desegregation, his failure to make a \ngood faith effort to cooperate with court-ordered desegregation, and \nhis frequent exploitation of racial tension over desegregation during \nhis 1984 campaign for governor suggests otherwise.\n  Over a four year span as Missouri's Attorney General, Senator \nAshcroft fought the desegregation plan all the way to the Supreme Court \nthree times--and lost his bid for review of the 8th Circuit Court of \nAppeals decisions each time. As attorney general, he lost definitively \nin the 8th Circuit in 1980, 1982, and 1984. In the 1984 case, it took \nthe court 4 pages just to describe the myriad suits, motions, and \nappeals Ashcroft filed. And then he appealed that one, too. And during \nthe time that he was filing repeated legal challenges to the \ndesegregation plan, Attorney General Ashcroft proposed no desegregation \nplan of his own and strongly resisted a negotiated settlement for \nentirely voluntary school transfers that had been agreed to by the city \nof St. Louis and St. Louis County. These are not the actions of a man \nwho supports integration and opposed segregation.\n  In response to questioning by the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nAshcroft made this specific claim:\n\n       In all of the cases where the court made an order, I \n     followed the order, both as attorney general and as governor. \n     It was my judgment that when the law was settled and spoken \n     that the law should be obeyed.\n\n  One of the simplest and least burdensome orders of the court flatly \nrefutes Senator Ashcroft's claim. In May 1980, the federal district \ncourt ordered the state to prepare and submit a proposal within 60 days \nfor desegregating the schools. In a telling example of his \nunwillingness to support any form of desegregation plan, Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft failed to comply with the order. In fact, it wasn't \nuntil December 1980 that the State responded at all--other than filing \nmotions to block the order to submit a plan and appealing them all the \nway to the Supreme Court--and the court did not consider the responses \nto be a good-faith effort. In 1981, after several more orders and \ndeadlines were missed he was finally threatened with contempt of court \nfor his repeated delays.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft was not threatened with contempt because he \nobjected to the cost of a particular desegregation plan or because he \nwas aggressively filing appeals. He was threatened with contempt for \nhis failure to comply with the court's 1980 order to submit a plan for \nintegrating the schools. He refused, in effect, to even participate in \ndesegregation at all. Later, instead of being chastened by his brush \nwith contempt for defying the court, he cited it as a badge of honor \nduring his 1984 campaign for governor, as proof of his adamant \nopposition to desegregation. He publicly bragged that it showed ``he \nhad done everything in [his] power legally'' to fight the desegregation \nplan.\n  In fact, as the court had stated in its 1981 order:\n\n       The foregoing public record reveals extraordinary \n     machinations by the State defendants in resisting Judge \n     Meredith's orders. In these circumstances, the court can draw \n     only one conclusion. The State has, as a matter of deliberate \n     policy, decided to defy the authority of the court.\n\n  In yet in another attempt to claim that his opposition to the \ndesegregation plan did not mean he was opposed to integration, Senator \nAshcroft testified he opposed the plan because the State was not a \nparty to the lawsuit and did not have a fair chance to defend itself. \nAs he stated:\n\n       Well, you know, if the State hadn't been made a party to \n     the litigation and the state is being asked to do things to \n     remedy the situation, I think it's important to ask the \n     opportunity for the State to have a kind of, due process and \n     the protection of the law that an individual would expect.\n\n  This claim borders on the bizarre. The state became a party to the \ncase in 1977, the very year that Senator Ashcroft took office as \nattorney general, and three years before the first 8th Circuit ruling. \nThroughout his entire eight year tenure, Attorney General Ashcroft \nlitigated this case up and down the federal system on behalf of the \nState of Missouri. To claim that\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nthe State was not a party to the litigation is a disingenuous and \ntransparent attempt to evade responsibility for his actions.\n  In some of his court challenges, Attorney General Ashcroft did claim \nthat the State was not a party to the settlement agreement and should \nnot be required to implement it. The truth is that the other parties \nagreed and submitted a plan to the court. Attorney General Ashcroft had \nevery opportunity to submit his own proposal in fact, he was ordered to \ndo so but he refused. To then claim that he shouldn't have to follow \nthe court ordered plan is tantamount to saying that a guilty party who \ndoesn't want to be punished is somehow beyond the authority of the \ncourt. The defense was rightly rejected by the district court and the \n8th Circuit and the Supreme Court refused to hear it.\n  In his testimony, Senator Ashcroft directly, clearly, and repeatedly \nsaid that he opposed State liability for desegregation because the \nState had never been found guilty of the segregation. In his response \nto questioning from Senator Leahy, he testified:\n\n       I opposed a mandate by the Federal Government that the \n     State, which had done nothing wrong, found guilty of no \n     wrong, that they should be asked to pay this very substantial \n     sum of money over a long course of years. And that's what I \n     opposed.\n\n  This was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the denial of \nresponsibility moments later, saying:\n\n       Here the court sought to make the State responsible and \n     liable for the payment of these very substantial sums of \n     money, and the State had not been found really guilty of \n     anything.\n\n  These two statements, made under oath in testimony before the \nCommittee, are flatly wrong and grossly misleading. The St. Louis cases \nwere certainly long and convoluted, but one point is abundantly clear: \nthe courts held that the State of Missouri was responsible for the \ndiscrimination. The 8th Circuit left no doubt about the State's guilt \nand liability for segregating the schools. As the court said in 1984:\n\n       We, again noted that the State and City Board--already \n     judged violators of the Constitution--could be required to \n     fund measures designed to eradicate the remaining vestiges of \n     segregation in the city schools, including measures which \n     involved the voluntary participation of the suburban \n     schools.\n\n  This statement by the court highlights a very important point. The \ncourt said ``We again noted that the State and City Board--already \nadjudged violators of the constitution''--were responsible for \ndesegregating the schools. This 1984 decision came four years after the \noriginal 8th circuit decision held that the state was in fact \nresponsible for the discrimination.\n  Senator Ashcroft was attorney general of Missouri for all of those \nyears and was campaigning for governor when the decision was issued. No \none knew better than he that the state had been found guilty of \ndiscrimination, and had been found guilty repeatedly. Yet he was still \ndenying responsibility before the court in 1984 and it is deeply \ntroubling that he was denying it before this committee in 2001.\n  I am also deeply troubled by Senator Ashcroft's exploitation of the \nracial tensions over desegregation to promote his campaign for governor \nin 1984. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported at the time that Senator \nAshcroft and his Republican primary opponent were ``trying to outdo \neach other as the most outspoken enemy of school integration in St. \nLouis,'' and were ``exploiting and encouraging the worst racist \nsentiments that exist in the state.'' The Economist, a conservative \nmagazine, reported that both candidates ran openly bigoted ads and that \nAshcroft called his opponent a ``closet supporter of racial \nintegration.'' Even the Daily Dunklin Democrat, a newspaper that \nsupported Ashcroft's appeals of the desegregation orders, took him to \ntask for exploiting race in his campaign, criticizing the 1984 primary \ncampaign as ``reminiscent of an Alabama primary in the 1950s.''\n  Ashcroft claimed in the Judiciary Committee that in opposing the \ndesegregation plan he was merely opposing the cost of the desegregation \nthat was being imposed on the state. But according to press reports of \nthat campaign, Ashcroft repeatedly attacked the courts and the \ndesegregation plan for reasons wholly unrelated to cost, even going as \nfar as calling the desegregation plan an ``outrage against human \ndecency'' and an ``outrage against the children of this state.'' I \nbelieve, instead, that it is the repeated, legally unsupportable, \nvigorous opposition to desegregation, that is an outrage against human \ndecency and an outrage against the children of Missouri.\n  For these reasons, I have great concern about Senator Ashcroft's \ntestimony and his actions surrounding the entire issue of \ndesegregation. His actions as Attorney General of Missouri leave no \ndoubt that at every turn, he chose to wage a non-stop legal war against \nintegration and desegregation, and that he used the full power of his \noffice to do so.\n  The question for Senator Ashcroft, and for senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, is how can it mean anything for Senator Ashcroft to say that \nhe will enforce the law against discrimination, when this record shows \nbeyond any reasonable doubt that he will go to extraordinary lengths to \ndeny the facts of discrimination?\n  Senator Ashcroft's record and testimony on voter registration \nlegislation are equally troubling. In response to a question about his \ndecision as Governor of Missouri to veto two bills to increase voter \nregistration in the city of St. Louis, which is heavily African \nAmerican, Senator Ashcroft testified:\n\n       I am concerned that all Americans have the opportunity to \n     vote. I am committed to the integrity of the ballot.  . . . I \n     vetoed a number of bills as governor, and frankly, I don't \n     say that I can remember all the details of all of them. \n     Accordingly, I reviewed my veto message and recalled that I \n     was urged to veto these bills by responsible local election \n     officials. I also appeared to anticipate the Supreme Court's \n     recent decision, as I expressed a concern that voting \n     procedures be unified statewide.\n\n  A review of the facts surrounding Governor Ashcroft's decision to \nveto the voter registration bills raises serious questions about \nwhether he truly is ``concerned that all Americans have the opportunity \nto vote.'' Even the equal protection principle recently stated by the \nU.S. Supreme Court in the Florida election case cannot be reconciled \nwith Ashcroft's actions.\n  As Governor of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft appointed the local \nelection boards in both St. Louis County and St. Louis City. The \ncounty, which surrounds much of the city, is relatively affluent. It is \n84 percent white, and votes heavily Republican. The city itself is less \naffluent, 47 percent black, and votes heavily Democratic.\n  Like other election boards across the State, the St. Louis County \nElection Board had a policy of training volunteers from nonpartisan \ngroups--such as the League of Women Voters--to assist in voter \nregistration. During Senator Ashcroft's service as Governor, the county \ntrained as many as 1,500 such volunteers. But the number of trained \nvolunteers in the city was zero--because the city election board \nappointed by Governor Ashcroft refused to follow the policy on \nvolunteers used by his appointed board in the county and the rest of \nthe State.\n  Concerned about this obvious disparity, the State legislature passed \nbills in 1988 and 1989 to require the city election board to implement \nthe same training policy for volunteers used by the county election \nboard and the rest of the State. Despite broad support for these bills, \non both occasions, Governor Ashcroft vetoed them, leaving in place a \nsystem that clearly made it more difficult for St. Louis City residents \nto register to vote.\n  Among the justifications offered by Ashcroft for the vetoes was a \nconcern for fraud, even though the Republican director of elections in \nSt. Louis County was quoted in press reports as saying: ``It's worked \nwell here . . . I don't know why it wouldn't also work well [in the \nCity].''\n  The issues of fraud and voter registration had also been addressed by \nthe United States Senate several years earlier, which concluded that \n``fraud more often occurred by voting officials on election day, rather \nthan in the registration process.''\n  In fact, in Missouri in 1989--five months after Governor Ashcroft's \nsecond veto--a clerk on the city of St. Louis Election Board was \nindicted for voter fraud by Secretary of State Roy Blunt.\n  Ultimately, the repeated refusal by the St. Louis City Election Board \nto train volunteer registrars had a serious\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nnegative impact on voter registration rates in the city. During Senator \nAshcroft's eight years as Governor, the voter registration rate in St. \nLouis City fell from a high of nearly 75 percent to 59 percent--a rate \nlower than the national average, lower than the statewide average, and \n15 percent lower than St. Louis County rate.\n  The types of barriers to voter registration approved by Governor \nAshcroft and his appointed election board in the city were explicitly \ncriticized in the early 1980s by both Democrats and Republicans in the \nUnited States Congress. In October 1984, the Subcommittee on Civil \nRights and Constitutional Rights of the House Judiciary Committee \nissued a report with the following finding:\n\n       There is no room in our free society for inconvenient and \n     artificial registration barriers designed to impede \n     participation in the electoral process. . . . [W]e do not \n     quarrel with increasing registration outreach and expanding \n     the system of deputization [i.e., training volunteers \n     registrars].\n  So we had the two vetoes, one where we had a limited bill that was \njust targeted for the city of St. Louis where they were going to, in \neffect, have training registrars like they had in the county. Ashcroft \nvetoed that bill and said it was special legislation and, therefore, he \ncouldn't agree to it because it was just special to a city in Missouri. \nSo he vetoed it.\n  A year later, the Missouri legislature passed an overall plan for the \nwhole state that encouraged the appointment of training registrars, so \nit would have application to the city of St. Louis. And he vetoed that \nagain. He vetoed it because he said it was too broad and unnecessary.\n  So the result of both of his vetoes was this dramatic adverse impact \non black voter participation in the city of St. Louis. At the same time \nthat there were 1,500 voting registrars just outside of the core city, \nthere were zero voting registrars in the city of St. Louis as a result \nof Senator Ashcroft's actions in the inner city. As a result, there was \na significant expansion of voter registration in Republican areas, in \nthe white community, and there was the beginning of the collapse of \nvoter registration in the black communities. That is a direct result.\n  I will, in just a few moments, show this on a chart which vividly \nreflects this in a compelling way.\n  The core question at issue in the recent Florida election case was \nwhether the different county-by-county standards in Florida for \ndetermining what constituted a valid vote were inconsistent with the \nequal protection clause. Seven members of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nrelying upon existing precedent, concluded that the equal protection \nclause required the application of a uniform statewide standard for \ndetermining what was a valid vote.\n  I think it should have been that way by common sense, but here we \nhave the overwhelming statement of the law by the Supreme Court. It is \nsomething I think all Americans can understand, but it was not good \nenough for Senator Ashcroft. As a result of that failure, we saw a \ndramatic reduction in voter participation and registration in that \ncommunity. At a time when the issues of the adequacy of the counting \nand the sacred right to vote are part of our whole national dialog and \ndebate about how we are going to remedy the extraordinary injustices \nthat occurred in the last election and in other elections as well, it \nwould seem to me that all citizens want to have confidence in whomever \nis going to be Attorney General; that they are going to protect their \nright to vote.\n  If you were one of those Americans who was disenfranchised in the \nlast national election and knew this particular record of Mr. \nAshcroft--would you be wondering whether you could ever get a fair \ndeal?\n  We ought to have an Attorney General in whom all Americans can have \nconfidence that their votes will be counted and counted fairly.\n  In 1988, when Governor Ashcroft vetoed the first voter registration \nbill, he cited two reasons. He said it was unfair to pass a law \nrequiring the city of St. Louis--but no other jurisdiction--to train \nvolunteers to help register voters. And he said he was urged to veto \nthe bill by his appointed St. Louis Board of Elections. (Governor's \nVeto Message, June 6, 1988.) Yet every other jurisdiction in Missouri--\nother than St. Louis City--actively trained outside volunteers.\n  In 1989, the Missouri legislature, in an effort to respond to \nGovernor Ashcroft's concerns about unfairness, passed a second bill. \nThis time the legislature adopted a uniform registrar training \nrequirement for election boards throughout the State of Missouri. But \nGovernor Ashcroft vetoed the legislation again claiming that \n``[e]lection authorities are free to participate with private \norganizations now to conduct voter registration.''\n  Democrats and Republicans alike in the legislature said if the \nGovernor is going to veto it because it is targeted, we will pass one \nwith general application. That is what they did, claiming that election \nauthorities are free to participate with private organizations.\n  As I mentioned, what is troubling is there was a second veto by then \nGovernor Ashcroft. The veto effectively ensured that there would not be \na ``unified statewide'' procedure--a result that directly conflicts \nwith the equal protection principles announced in the Florida election \ncase and cited by Senator Ashcroft in his testimony to our committee.\n  The facts are clear. For 8 years as Governor, Senator Ashcroft had \nthe opportunity to ensure that citizens of St. Louis city--nearly half \nof whom are African-American--were afforded the same opportunity to \nregister to vote as citizens in the rest of Missouri. Instead of \nworking to expand the right to vote, Governor Ashcroft and his \nappointed election board in the city of St. Louis chose to maintain \ninconvenient and artificial registration barriers that had the purpose \nand effect of depressing participation in the electoral process, \nparticularly by African-Americans.\n  Senator Ashcroft's record on desegregation and voter registration are \nrelevant to his recent visit to Bob Jones University and his interview \nwith Southern Partisan magazine. The policies of both Bob Jones \nUniversity and Southern Partisan magazine represent intolerance, \nbigotry, and a willingness to twist facts to create a society in that \nimage. And those are policies that all Americans should reject.\n  Displaying an extraordinary lack of sensitivity, Senator Ashcroft \nclaims that he went to Bob Jones University and was interviewed by \nSouthern Partisan magazine without knowing the policies and beliefs of \neither. Even if those claims are true, Senator Ashcroft's comments \nduring the hearing were--at best--disturbing. Senator Ashcroft \ncondemned slavery and discrimination, but his response displayed a \nfundamental misunderstanding of how certain institutions in our society \nperpetuate discrimination.\n  Senator Ashcroft was unwilling to say that he would not return to Bob \nJones University. He believes his presence there may have the potential \nto unite Americans. But to millions of Americans, such a visit by \nSenator Ashcroft as Attorney General of the United States would be a \npainful and divisive gesture.\n  Similarly, on Southern Partisan magazine, Senator Ashcroft would only \nsay that he would ``condemn those things which are condemnable.'' \nSurely the man who wants to sit at the head of the Department of \nJustice should say more and do more where bigotry is the issue. On the \nissue of women's rights, Senator Ashcroft's record is equally \ntroubling. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade a quarter \ncentury ago held that women have a fundamental constitutional right to \ndecide whether to have an abortion. The Court went on to say that \nStates may regulate the abortion procedure after the first trimester of \npregnancy in ways necessary to protect a women's health. After fetal \nviability, a State may prohibit abortions in cases where the procedure \nis not necessary to protect a woman's life or health.\n  In the years since Roe v. Wade, opponents have relentlessly sought to \noverturn the decision and restrict a woman's constitutional right to \nchoose. Senator Ashcroft has been one of the chief architects of that \nstrategy. As attorney general of Missouri, he told the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in 1981:\n\n       I have devoted considerable time and significant resources \n     to defending the right of the State to limit the dangerous \n     impacts of Roe, a case in which a handful of men on the \n     Supreme Court arbitrarily amended the Constitution and \n     overturned the laws of 50 states relating to abortions.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's position is clear. He believes that, except when \nmedically necessary to save a woman's life,\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\nabortion should never be available, even in cases involving a victim of \nrape or incest. He has said, ``Throughout my life, my personal \nconviction and public record is that the unborn child has a fundamental \nindividual right to life which cannot be infringed and should be \nprotected fully by the 14th Amendment.'' While I respect Senator \nAshcroft's personal convictions, they cannot and should not be used as \nan excuse to deprive women of their constitutional right to choose.\n  Nevertheless, Senator Ashcroft has been unrelenting in his efforts to \noverturn Roe v. Wade. While serving as attorney general and as \nGovernor, Senator Ashcroft constantly sought the passage of State \nantichoice legislation and was a principal architect of a continuing \nnationwide litigation strategy to persuade the Supreme Court to \nrestrict or overturn Roe v. Wade. In 1991, as Governor, he even boasted \nthat no State had more abortion-related cases that reached the Supreme \nCourt.\n  As attorney general, Senator Ashcroft was so intent on restricting a \nwoman's right to choose that he personally argued Planned Parenthood of \nWestern Missouri v. Ashcroft in the United States Supreme Court. In \nthat case, decided in 1983, the Supreme Court specifically and clearly \nrejected, by a 6 to 3 margin, the attempt by the State of Missouri to \nrequire all second trimester abortions to be performed in a hospital. \nThe Court did permit, however, three requirements--that a second \nphysician be present during a post-viability abortion; that a minor \nobtain either parental consent or a judicial waiver to have an \nabortion; and that a pathology report be prepared for each abortion.\n  In 1986, Governor Ashcroft signed into law a bill that attempted to \noverturn Roe v. Wade by declaring that life begins at conception. The \nbill also imposed numerous restrictions on a woman's constitutional \nright to choose. After signing the bill into law, Governor Ashcroft \nsaid, ``the bill makes an important statement of moral principle and \nprovides a framework to deter abortion wherever possible.''\n  In 1989, the bill was challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. The State of Missouri \nnot only asked the Supreme Court to uphold the statute, but it also \nspecifically asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Court \nrefused to overturn Roe. But by a vote of 5-4, the Court upheld some \nprovisions of the statute, including the prohibitions on the use of \npublic facilities or personnel to perform abortions.\n  In addition to his attempts to restrict a woman's right to choose, \nSenator Ashcroft as attorney general also took direct and improper \naction that prevented poor women from obtaining gynecological and birth \ncontrol services. As Attorney General, he issued an opinion stating \nthat nurses in Missouri did ``not have the authority to engage in \nprimary health care that includes diagnosis and treatment of human \nillness, injury or infirmity and administration of medications under \ngeneral rather than direct physician guidance and supervision.'' \nFollowing this opinion, the Missouri State Board of Registration for \nthe Healing Arts threatened the criminal prosecution of two nurses and \nfive doctors employed by the East Missouri Action Agency who provided \nfamily planning services to low-income women.\n  The nurses provided family planning, obstetrics and gynecology \nservices to the public--including information on oral contraceptives, \ncondoms and IUDs; initiatives on breast and pelvic examinations; and \ntesting for sexually-transmitted diseases--through funding for programs \ndirected to low-income populations. The nurses were licensed \nprofessionals under Missouri law, and the doctors issued standing \norders for the nurses. All services performed by the nurses were \ncarried out pursuant to those orders or well-established protocols for \nnurses and other paramedical personnel. The board, however, threatened \nto find the nurses guilty of the unauthorized practice of medicine, and \nto find the physicians guilty of aiding and abetting them.\n  In 1983, more than 3 years after Attorney General Ashcroft issued his \nopinion, the Supreme Court of Missouri rejected the opinion, finding \nthat nothing in the state statutes purported to limit or restrict the \nnurses' and doctors' practices, and that the nurses actions ``clearly'' \nfell within the legislative standard governing the practice of nursing. \nAlthough the decision ensured that nurses in Missouri could continue to \nprovide family planning services, during the almost 3 years that the \ncase was pending, Attorney General Ashcroft's legally untenable opinion \nplaced nurses providing gynecological services, including family \nplanning, in considerable legal peril.\n  Senator Ashcroft's aggressive and vocal opposition to Roe v. Wade \ncontinued during his service as a Member of the Senate. He voted in \nfavor of overturning Roe v. Wade and sponsored both a human life \namendment to the Constitution and parallel legislation. The human life \namendment would prohibit all abortions except that required to prevent \nthe death of the mother--but only if every reasonable effort is made to \npreserve the life of the women and the fetus. The proposed \nconstitutional amendment contains no exception for rape or incest, and \nno protections for a woman's health. Because the amendment and the \nproposed statute define life as beginning at fertilization, its \nlanguage could also be used to ban any type of contraception which \nprevents a fertilized egg from being implanted in the uterus, including \nbirth control pills and IUDs.\n  Two weeks ago, however, Senator Ashcroft appeared to experience a \nconfirmation conversion. He asked us to disregard his past record and \nunyielding position against reproductive rights and accept his new \nposition--he now views ``Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey as \nthe settled law of the land.'' He will not longer work to dismantle \nRoe, but to enforce it, he says.\n  When asked about his efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, Senator \nAshcroft told the Committee that he ``did things to define the law by \nvirtue of lawsuits . . . did things to refine the law when I had an \nenactment role.'' But as an example of his view of ``defining'' and \n``refining'' the law, during his 1981 testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee as attorney general of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft \ntestified that the human life bill--which would prohibit all \nabortions--could be constitutional within the framework of Roe v. Wade. \nIt is clear that as Attorney General of the United States, Senator \nAshcroft could easily feel free to define and refine Roe v. Wade out of \nexistence.\n  Senator Ashcroft also wants the committee to believe that he won't \nask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The current Court has \nmade it clear that it will not overturn Roe. In that sense, Roe is \nsettled law. But once the current composition of the Court changes, \nhowever, President Bush and Senator Ashcroft will feel free to take \nsteps to overturn Roe. In an interview on January 20, 2001, President \nBush said;\n\n       Roe v. Wade is not going to be overturned by a \n     Constitutional amendment because there's not the votes in the \n     House or the Senator. I--secondly--I am going to put judges \n     on the Court who strictly interpret the Constitution, and \n     that will be the litmus test . . . I've always said that Roe \n     v. Wade was--was a judicial reach.\n\n  If Senator Ashcroft becomes Attorney General, he will be well-\npositioned to undermine and eliminate this most basic right of privacy \nfor all American women. President Bush and Senator Ashcroft will select \njudges and justices who are prepared to turn back the clock to a time \nwhen women did not have the right to choose.\n  We know Senator Ashcroft is willing to go to the courts time and time \nagain to challenge settled law. State of Missouri v. The National \nOrganization for Women is a case in point. In that case, the \norganization had called for a boycott of Missouri because of the \nfailure by the State to ratify the equal rights amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Senator Ashcroft told the Judiciary Committee that the litigation \nbrought in Missouri by his office against the National Organization for \nWomen was well within the law. He said:\n\n       We filed the lawsuit, to the best of my recollection, \n     because the boycott was hurting the people of Missouri, and \n     we believed it to be in violation of the antitrust laws. The \n     lawsuit had nothing to do with the ERA . . . or the political \n     differences that I might have had with NOW.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Now, I litigated that matter thoroughly, and frankly, other \n     states attempted it . . . I\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\n     think the law is clear now and has been clear in the \n     aftermath of that decision.\n\n  That testimony was grossly misleading. At the time he brought the NOW \ncase, he law was already well-settled in direct opposition to Senator \nAshcroft's position. In ruling against Attorney General Ashcroft, both \nthe federal district court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \nrelied upon the Supreme Court's decision in Eastern Railroad Presidents \nConference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.--a case decided 17 years before \nSenator Ashcroft brought suit against NOW. The Attorney General said in \nthat case:\n\n       [The Sherman Act] . . . is a code that condemns trade \n     restraints, not political activity, and, a publicity campaign \n     to influence governmental action falls clearly into the \n     category of political activity.\n\n  Still, Attorney General Ashcroft was not deterred, even though the \ndistrict court and the court of appeals had ruled against him, relying \nupon the clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Senator Ashcroft persisted \nand asked the Supreme Court to review the NOW case. The Court refused \neven to hear the case.\n  It is deeply troubling that as attorney general, Senator Ashcroft \nused state resources to litigate a weak case that rested on an argument \nrejected by the Supreme Court years ago. But, as with the litigation \nsurrounding the voluntary school desegregation plan, he preferred to \nfight on in appeal after appeal in a losing and illegitimate battle, \nrather than surrender to justice and protect the rights of women.\n  Mr. President, just for the information of Members, I have probably 4 \nor 5 more minutes. I know other wish to speak. Than I will put the rest \nof the statement in the Record.\n  Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft's opposition to gun control, his \ninterpretation of the second amendment, and his advocacy of extremist \ngun lobby proposals are also very disturbing. Over 30,000 Americans \nlose their lives to gun violence every year, including over 3,000 \nchildren and teenagers. Our Nation's level of gun violence is \nunparalleled in the rest of the world. In response to the devastation \ncaused by gun violence, the majority of Americans support stricter gun \ncontrol laws and vigorous enforcement of the laws now on the books.\n  Contrary to the majority of the American public, Senator Ashcroft \nvigorously opposes stricter gun control laws. He addressed this issue \nduring the hearing, where he seemed to change his long held beliefs and \nemphasized his commitment to enforce the gun laws and defend their \nconstitutionality. He testified that ``there are constitutional \ninhibitions on the rights of citizens to bear certain kinds of arms.'' \nSaying he supported some controls, Senator Ashcroft referred to his \nattempt to amend the juvenile justice bill to make semiautomatic \nassault weapons illegal for children. However, he neglected to mention \nthat his proposed amendment was actually a weaker version of one \nproposed by Senator Feinstein.\n  He sought to create a parental consent exception to Senator \nFeinstein's bill, which would have prevented juveniles from obtaining \nsemiautomatic assault weapons. At the hearing, Senator Ashcroft also \ntestified that the assault weapons ban, the Brady law, licensing and \nregistration of guns, and mandatory child safety locks are all \nconstitutional.\n  Although Senator Ashcroft's testimony was intended to ease our \nconcerns about his willingness to enforce gun control laws, it is \ndifficult to reconcile what he said last week with his rhetoric and his \nrecord. Contrary to his testimony, Senator Ashcroft has previously \nstated that individuals have a virtually unconditional right to bear \narms under the second amendment. In a 1998 hearing, he commented on \ncourt decisions, which noted that the second amendment does not \nguarantee individuals unrestricted rights to keep and bear arms. \nSenator Ashcroft expressed his disagreement with the view accepted by \nevery federal appellate court and the Supreme Court, that the second \namendment was intended to protect state-regulated militias, but does \nnot entitle individuals to possess or use weapons connected with \nparticipation in private militias. He criticized these court decisions, \nstating, ``The argument makes no sense to me.'' At the 1998 hearing, \nSenator Ashcroft went on to say:\n\n       Indeed, the second amendment--like the First--protects an \n     important individual liberty that in turn promoted good \n     government. A citizenry armed with the right to possess \n     firearms and to speak freely is less likely to fall victim to \n     a tyrannical central government than a citizenry that is \n     disarmed from criticizing government or defending themselves.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's extreme view of the second amendment parallels his \nrhetoric comparing today's elected officials with the despots of the \n18th century. The pro-gun Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and \nBear Arms reported that Senator Ashcroft compared ``today's power \nbrokers and policy wonks'' in the Federal Government to the ``European \ndespots from whom our Founding Fathers fled.'' He has explained that \nindividuals should be allowed to ``keep and bear arms'' because ``I am \nfearful of a government that doesn't trust the people who elected \nthem.'' Are we talking about our system of government? Are we talking \nabout that?\n  Unfortunately, Senator Ashcroft's rhetoric and record lend undeserved \ncredibility and legitimacy to the views espoused by anti-government \nmilitia groups in our Nation. Members of these groups believe the \nsecond amendment gives them the right to form private armies as a check \nagainst federal power. These militia groups point out that guns are not \nfor hunting or even protecting against crime. Rather, they say, the \nsecond amendment was intended to safeguard liberty forever by ensuring \nthat the American people should never be out-gunned by their own \ngovernment. Ruby Ridge and Waco are two recent violent episodes in \nwhich groups holding these views came into armed conflict with federal \nlaw enforcement. The Department of Justice has the all-important \nresponsibility to enforce the laws against such extremist groups. Yet \nSenator Ashcroft's past rhetoric has supported these extremist views \nand causes legitimate concern that his views are so outside the \nmainstream of American thought that as Attorney General he will be \nunable and unwilling to enforce the gun laws and pursue prosecutions \nagainst militia groups for violations of Federal laws.\n  Although Senator Ashcroft testified that he believes in the \nconstitutionality of the assault weapons ban, the Brady law, gun \nlicensing and registration, and mandatory child safety locks on guns, \nhe voted to oppose legislation in these areas. He voted against the ban \non the importation of high ammunition magazines. He voted against \nclosing the gun show loophole. He voted for a measure to impede \nimplementation of the National Instant Check System. He voted twice to \nweaken existing law by removing the background check requirements on \npawnshop redemptions and by allowing dealers to sell guns at gun shows \nin any state. He voted twice against bills to require child safety \nlocks, and he voted against regulating firearms sales on the Internet.\n  Senator Ashcroft testified that he supported funds for gun \nprosecution initiatives. However, he has voted to reduce funding in \nother areas vital to gun law enforcement. For example, he voted against \nfunding to implement background checks under the Brady law, named after \nformer Reagan Press Secretary James Brady. Indeed, Senator Ashcroft has \nreferred to James Brady, a brave and patriotic American, as ``the \nleading enemy of responsible gun owners.'' When provided the \nopportunity to express regret for making such an unjustified statement, \nSenator Ashcroft declined.\n  Senator Ashcroft is also closely tied to the gun lobby and he has \noften accepted contributions from these organizations and supported \ntheir agendas. During the hearing, he told us that keeping guns out of \nthe hands of felons is a ``top priority'' of his. Yet, in 1998, this \ndid not seem to be a top priority for him. He supported an NRA-\nsponsored ballot initiative that would have allowed almost anyone to \ncarry concealed guns in Missouri. The proposal was so filled with \nloopholes that it would have allowed convicted child molesters and \nstalkers to carry semi-automatic pistols into bars, sports stadiums, \ncasinos, and day care centers. The proposal was opposed by numerous law \nenforcement groups and many in the business community. Proponents of\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nthe measure say Senator Ashcroft volunteered his help to support the \nreferendum, even recording a radio ad endorsing the proposal. Senator \nAshcroft stated in response to written questions that ``Although [he \ndid] not recall the specific details, [his] recollection is that \nsupporters of the referendum approached [him] and asked [him] to record \nthe radio spot.'' The fact remains that Senator Ashcroft did support \nthe referendum and did record the radio spot. Few can doubt that as a \nseasoned politician, Senator Ashcroft made himself fully aware of the \ncontents of the referendum before lending his name to it. And if he did \nnot, there is even greater reason to question his judgment and \nsuitability for such a high and important position in our federal \ngovernment.\n  Senator Ashcroft championed the NRA's concealed weapon proposition in \n1998. But in 1992, while governor of Missouri, he had voiced his \nconcerns about such a measure. As Governor, he stated he had ``grave \nconcerns'' about concealed carry laws. He stated, ``Overall, I don't \nknow that I would be one to want to promote a whole lot of people \ncarrying concealed weapons in this society.'' He further stated, \n``Obviously, if it's something to authorize everyone to carry concealed \nweapons, I'd be concerned about it.'' When asked about his change of \nview in deciding to support the 1998 initiative, Senator Ashcroft said \nhe changed his position because of ``Research plus real-world \nexperiences.'' However, Senator Ashcroft's research was so flawed that \nhe responded to written questions that ``[t]o the extent there were \nloopholes in Missouri law'' that would permit convicted child molesters \nand stalkers to carry concealed weapons, he was ``unaware of those \nprovisions at the time.'' Later, it was reported that the gun lobby \nspent $400,000 in support of Senator Ashcroft's Senate reelection \ncampaign. He became ``the unabashed celebrity spokesman . . . for the \nNational Rifle Association's recent attempts to arm citizens with \nconcealed weapons in Missouri,'' according to a column by Laura Scott \nin the Kansas City Star.\n  The Citizens' Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms gave \nSenator Ashcroft the ``Gun Rights Defender of the Month'' Award for \nleading the opposition to David Satcher's nomination to be Surgeon \nGeneral. The group objected to Dr. Satcher because he advocated \ntreating gun violence as a public health problem.\n  Based on his close ties to the gun lobby and his strong support for \ntheir agenda, it is difficult to have confidence that Senator Ashcroft \nwill fully and fairly enforce the nation's gun control laws and not \nseek to weaken them.\n  Senator Ashcroft has shown time and time again that he supports the \ngun lobby and opposes needed gun safety measures. Given the important \nlitigation in the federal courts, it is imperative to have an Attorney \nGeneral who will strongly enforce current gun control laws such as the \nBrady Law, the assault weapons ban, and other statutes. It is also \nimportant to have an Attorney General with a responsible view of \nproposed legislation when the Department of Justice is asked to comment \non it.\n  Senator Ashcroft's handling of judicial and executive branch \nnominations also raises deep concerns. In four of the most divisive \nnomination battles in the Senate in the 6 years he served with us, \nSenator Ashcroft was consistently involved in harsh and vigorous \nopposition to the confirmation of distinguished and well-qualified \nAfrican Americans, an Asian American and a gay American.\n  When President Clinton nominated Judge Ronnie White of the Missouri \nSupreme Court to be a federal district court judge, Senator Ashcroft \nflagrantly distorted the record of the nominee and attacked him in the \nstrongest terms. He accused Judge White of being ``an activist with a \nslant toward criminals.'' He accused him of being a judge with ``a \nserious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty.'' He \naccused him of seeking ``at every turn'' to provide opportunities for \nthe guilty to ``escape punishment.'' He accused him of voting ``to \nreverse the death sentence in more cases than any other [Missouri] \nSupreme Court judge.''\n  When questioned about Judge White's nomination, Senator Ashcroft did \nnot retreat from his characterization of Judge White's record, although \na review clearly demonstrates that Senator Ashcroft's charges were \nbaseless.\n  Judge White is not an ardent opponent of the death penalty. He voted \nto uphold death penalty convictions in 41 cases, and voted to reverse \nthem in only 17 cases. His votes in death penalty cases were not \nsignificantly different from the votes of the other members of the \nMissouri Supreme Court--judges whom Senator Ashcroft appointed when he \nwas Governor. In more than half of the 17 cases in which Judge White \nvoted to overturn a death sentence, he was voting with the majority--\nwith Ashcroft appointees. Seven of these cases were unanimous \ndecisions. There were only three death penalty reversals in which Judge \nWhite was the only judge who voted to overturn the conviction. In fact, \nfour of the justices whom Senator Ashcroft named to the court have \nvoted to overturn more death penalty convictions than Judge White. That \nrecord is not the record of ``an activist with a slant toward \ncriminals.''\n  In fact, Judge White's record in death penalty cases shows him to be \nin the Missouri mainstream. Four of his colleagues who were appointed \nto the bench by Governor Ashcroft have voted to overturn between 22 \npercent and 25 percent of the death penalty convictions they \nconsidered. Judge White voted to reverse the convictions in 29 percent \nof the death penalty cases he heard. By contrast, his predecessor Judge \nThomas, also an Ashcroft appointee, voted to reverse 47 percent of the \ndeath sentences he reviewed. There is no significant difference between \nJudge White's record on the death penalty and the records of his \ncolleagues on the court.\n  Some law enforcement officials in Missouri did oppose the White \nnomination. But many Missouri police officials supported Judge White. \nHe had the support of the State Fraternal Order of Police. The head of \nthe FOP said, ``The record of Justice White is one of a jurist whose \nrecord on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the rights \nof victims than the rights of criminals.'' Judge White was also \nendorsed by the chief of police of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police \nDepartment. The president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association \ndescribed Judge White as ``an upright, fine individual.''\n  In Senator Ashcroft's statements on the Senate floor on the \nnomination, he focused on a small number of Judge White's opinions. A \nreview of Judge White's entire record suggests that those cases were \ntaken very much out of context. In two of them, there were serious \nquestions about the competency of the defendant's trial counsel. In the \nthird, there was evidence of racial bias by the trial judge. Those \ncases were not disagreements about the death penalty. The issue was \nwhether the defendant had received a fair trial. Judge White's dissent \nin one of those cases makes this point in the clearest terms:\n\n       This is a very hard case. If Mr. Johnson was in control of \n     his faculties when he went on this murderous rampage, then he \n     assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given . . . I am \n     not convinced that the performance of his counsel did not rob \n     Mr. Johnson of any opportunity he might have had to convince \n     the jury that he was not responsible for his actions. This is \n     an excellent example of why hard cases make bad law. While I \n     share the majority's horror at this carnage, I cannot uphold \n     this as an acceptable standard of representation for a \n     defendant accused of capital murder.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's statements on the White nomination strongly \nsuggest that Senator Ashcroft has a misguided view of the role of \njudges in our constitutional system. To label a judge ``pro-criminal'' \nbased on isolated opinions over the course of an entire career is \nwrong. Judges are obliged to decide individual cases according to the \nrequirements of law, including the Constitution. Judge White has \nfrequently voted to affirm criminal convictions, including 41 capital \ncases. The fact that he reached a contrary position in a few cases \nshould not disqualify him to be a federal judge.\n  What is most noteworthy about Senator Ashcroft's attacks on Judge \nWhite is the extraordinary degree to which Senator Ashcroft distorted \nthe record in order to portray Judge White's confirmation as a \nreferendum on the death penalty. This is a judge who had voted\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nto uphold more than 70 percent of the death penalty convictions he had \nreviewed. Yet Senator Ashcroft never questioned Judge White about these \nissues at the committee hearing on Judge White's nomination, and he \nnever gave Judge White an opportunity to explain his reasons for \ndissenting in the three cases before unfairly attacking his record.\n  It appears that Senator Ashcroft had decided to use the death penalty \nas an issue in his campaign for re-election to the Senate, and to make \nhis point, he cruelly distorted the honorable record of a distinguished \nAfrican American judge and denied him the position he deserved as a \nfederal district court judge. As I said at the hearing, what Senator \nAshcroft did to Judge White is the ugliest thing that has happened to a \nnominee in all my years in the Senate.\n  Senator Ashcroft was also asked about the nominations of Bill Lann \nLee to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Dr. David \nSatcher to serve as Surgeon General of the United States, and James \nHormel to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n  Senator Ashcroft told the committee that he could not support Mr. Lee \nbecause he had ``serious concerns about his willingness to enforce the \nAdarand decision'' on affirmative action. In truth, however, Mr. Lee's \nposition on affirmative action was well within the mainstream of the \nlaw, and he repeatedly told the committee that he would follow the \nSupreme Court's ruling in the Adarand case. As Senator Leahy said \nduring the Ashcroft confirmation hearings.\n\n       Mr. Lee testified on a number of occasions--in fact, \n     testified under oath, including, incidentally, directly in \n     answer to your questions, that he would enforce the law as \n     declared in Adarand. And he also said, in direct answer to \n     questions of this committee, he considered the Adarand \n     decision of the Supreme Court as the controlling legal \n     authority of the land, that he would seek to enforce it, he \n     would give it full effect . . .\n\n  Similarly, Senator Ashcroft said he did not support Dr. Satcher to be \nSurgeon General because he:\n\n       Supported a number of activities that I thought were \n     inconsistent with the ethical obligations of a medical doctor \n     and a physician, particularly the surgeon general . . . for \n     example he supported an AIDS study on pregnant women in \n     Africa where some patients were given placebos, even though a \n     treatment existed to limit transmission of AIDS from the \n     mother to the child . . . I, secondly, believed his \n     willingness to send AIDS-infected babies home with their \n     mothers without telling their mothers about the infection of \n     the children was another ethical problem that was very \n     serious.\n\n  In fact, at the time of the debate on the Satcher nomination in 1997, \napproximately 1,000 babies were born with HIV every day. Most of the \nbirths were in developing countries, where the U.S.-accepted regimen of \nAZT treatment is not practical because of safety and cost concerns. In \n1994, the World Health Organization had called a meeting of \ninternational experts to review the use of AZT to prevent the spread of \nHIV in pregnancy. That meeting resulted in the recommendation that \nstudies be conducted in developing countries to test the effectiveness \nand safety of short-term AZT therapy that could be used in developing \ncountries and that those studies be placebo-controlled to ensure safety \nin areas with various immune challenges. Approval was obtained by \nethics committees in this country and the host countries and by the \nUNAIDS program. The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \nDisease Control agreed to support the studies in order to save lives in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Many leaders in the medical field supported the studies. Dr. Nancy \nDickey, AMA president-elect at the time, said that the studies in \nAfrica and Asia were ``scientifically well-founded'' and carried out \nwith ``informed consent.'' Those who did not support the studies still \nsupported Dr. Satcher's nomination. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, Director of \nPublic Citizen's Health Research Group, said that while he had for many \nmonths expressed opposition to the AZT experiments, it represented an \nhonest difference of opinion with Satcher. He said he fully supports \nthe nomination. ``I think he'd make an excellent surgeon general,'' \nWolfe said. ``I have known him and I admire him.''\n  Senator Ashcroft also mis-characterized Dr. Satcher's role in the \nsurvey of HIV child-bearing women. In 1995, seven years after the \nsurvey began during the Reagan administration, Dr. Satcher, as acting \nCDC director, and Dr. Phil Lee, former Assistant Secretary for Health, \nhalted the HIV survey. They did so because of a combination of better \ntreatment options for children with HIV, the discovery of a therapeutic \nregimen to reduce mother-to-infant HIV transmission, and a greater \nability to monitor HIV trends in women of childbearing age in other \nways.\n  The HIV tests had begun in 1988, five years before Dr. Satcher joined \nthe CDC. The tests were supported by public health leaders at every \nlevel of government as a way to monitor the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These \nsurveys were designed to provide information about the level of HIV in \na given community without individual information. The Survey of Child-\nBearing Women was one of the HIV surveys conducted under the program. \nIt was funded by the CDC and conducted by the states. Forty-five \nstates, including Missouri while Senator Ashcroft was Governor, \nparticipated in the survey and requested and received federal funds \nfrom the CDC to conduct it. The survey was important to public health \nofficials at the time, because it was the only unbiased way to provide \na valid estimate of the number of women with HIV and their demographic \ndistribution. Dr. Satcher's participation in the survey was justified, \nand it was not a valid reason for Senator Ashcroft to deny him \nconfirmation as Surgeon General.\n  The case of James Hormel is also especially troubling. When Mr. \nHormel was nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to \nLuxembourg, Senator Ashcroft and Senator Helms were the only two \nmembers of the Foreign Relations Committee to oppose the nomination. \nAlthough Senator Ashcroft voted against Mr. Hormel, Senator Ashcroft \ndid not attend the confirmation hearings, did not submit written \nquestions, and refused Mr. Hormel's repeated requests to meet or speak \nby phone to discuss the nomination.\n  In 1998, when asked about his opposition to Mr. Hormel's nomination, \nSenator Ashcroft stated that homosexuality is a sin and that a person's \nsexual conduct ``is within what could be considered and what is \neligible for consideration.'' Senator Ashcroft also publicly stated in \n1988 that: ``[Mr. Hormel's] conduct and the way in which he would \nrepresent the United States is probably not up to the standard that I \nwould expect.''\n  Senator Leahy asked Senator Ashcroft at the Judiciary Committee \nhearings whether he opposed Hormel's nomination because of Hormel's \nsexual orientation. Senator Ashcroft responded ``I did not.'' Instead, \nSenator Ashcroft claimed that he had ``known Mr. Hormel for a long \ntime''--Mr. Hormel had been a dean of students at the University of \nChicago law school when Senator Ashcroft was a student there in the \n1960s. Senator Ashcroft repeatedly testified that he based his \nopposition to Mr. Hormel on the ``totality of the record.''\n  Mr. Hormel was so troubled by Senator Ashcroft's testimony that he \nwrote to the committee and said the following:\n\n       I want to state unequivocally and for the record that there \n     is no personal or professional relationship between me and \n     Mr. Ashcroft which could possibly support such a statement. \n     The letter continued, I have had no contact with him \n     [Ashcroft] of any type since I left my position as Dean of \n     Students . . . nearly thirty-four years ago, in 1967 . . . \n     For Mr. Ashcroft to state that he was able to assess my \n     qualifications . . . based upon his personal long-time \n     relationship with me is misleading, erroneous, and \n     disingenuous . . . I find it personally offensive that Mr. \n     Ashcroft, under oath and in response to your direct \n     questions, would choose to misstate the nature of our \n     relationship, insinuate objective grounds for voting against \n     me, and deny that his personal viewpoint about my sexual \n     orientation played any role in his actions.\n\n  We should all be deeply concerned about Senator Ashcroft's \nwillingness to mislead the Judiciary Committee about his reasons for \nopposing the Hormel nomination. As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted on \nJanuary 22, 2001. ``[T]he most disturbing part of Mr. Ashcroft's \ntestimony was the way in which he misstated important parts of his \nrecord.''\n  In conclusion, the Attorney General of the United States leads the \n85,000 men and women who enforce the nation's laws in every community \nin the\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\ncountry. The Attorney General is the nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer and a symbol of the nation's commitment to justice. Americans \nfrom every walk of life deserve to have trust in him to be fair and \njust in his words and in his actions. He has vast powers to enforce the \nlaws and set priorities for law enforcement in ways that are fair or \nunfair--just or unjust.\n  When a President nominates a person to serve in his Cabinet, the \npresumption is rightly in favor of the nominee. But Senator Ashcroft \nhas a long and detailed record of relentless opposition on fundamental \nissues of civil rights and other basic rights of vital importance to \nall the people of America, and the people of this country deserve \nbetter than that. Americans are entitled to an Attorney General who \nwill vigorously fight to uphold the law and protect our constitutional \nrights. Based on a detailed review of his long record in public \nservice, Senator Ashcroft is not that man. I urge the Senate to vote no \non this nomination.\n  Mr. President, since I see a number of my colleagues, I will take the \nopportunity, when there is a pause in the Senate, to complete my \nstatement. At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I consider it an honor and \nprivilege to stand here today in support of the nomination of John \nAshcroft to be Attorney General of the United States. Contrary to some \nof the rhetoric we have been hearing from the other side, everybody in \nthis institution knows he is one of the finest people who ever served \nhere. He is a man of great religious faith, a moral man. Yet as we \nlisten to this debate, if it wasn't for the fact that it was so \npersonally destructive and so vindictive, it would be humorous.\n  We have a man who served 6 years in the Senate, served two terms as \nGovernor, two terms as attorney general of the State of Missouri. Yet \nto hear the debate, he is anti-child, anti-woman, anti-black, anti-gay, \nanti-Catholic. What else can possibly be said?\n  One thing we can certainly be assured of--the left knows how to play \npolitics. They do it well, and I commend them for it. Unfortunately, \nthough, sometimes in politics, one destroys unfairly the reputations of \npeople who don't deserve it. That is what offends me the most. I will \nnot use the term ``anger,'' but it does offend me that this kind of \npersonal destruction has to be used.\n  I recall the comments earlier in the debate today of Senator Leahy \nwhen he said there are 280 million Americans with divergent ethnic \nbackgrounds and political views. Out of that 280 million Americans, \naccording to the left, if there are any of those 280 million Americans \nwho are conservative and happen to be pro-life or pro-gun, they can't \nbe Attorney General. If they are pro-choice or if they are anti-gun, \nthen they can be.\n  I again remind my colleagues that the vote on Janet Reno was 98-0. \nMost of us on this side of the aisle would agree that her views and \nours were quite different, but we supported her nomination because the \nPresident of the United States has a right to pick his or her Cabinet. \nThat is a fact.\n  I will respond directly to this anti-Catholic charge. It is so \noutrageous, I don't know how people can look in the mirror, to be \ncandid about it, and do this kind of personal destruction.\n  Let me read from a copy of a letter I just received from Senator \nKennedy's own cardinal, Cardinal Law. I will read it into the Record:\n\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: Let me begin by expressing my deep \n     dismay at the unfounded and scurrilous charge that you could \n     possibly harbor anti-Catholic feelings. I was astounded to \n     hear that anyone was making such a ridiculous accusation.\n       From any time as Bishop of Springfield/Cape Girardeau until \n     today, I have always found you to be a man of honor, \n     integrity and deep faith. I recall with great fondness the \n     many opportunities we had to work together on many issues \n     affecting the lives of the good people of the State of \n     Missouri. In a particular way, I recall how kind and \n     thoughtful you were to invite me to address The Governor's \n     Annual Prayer Breakfast on January 9, 1992 when you were \n     serving as the Governor of Missouri. On that same day you \n     also honored me with an invitation to address The Governor's \n     Leadership Forum on Faith and Values. College students, then \n     and now, are beneficiaries of your generous love and concern \n     for them and their futures. I do not recall that you made any \n     distinctions between black and white, Protestant, Catholic or \n     Jew in your desire to instill in them a love for their faith, \n     their families and one another as brothers and sisters in the \n     human family.\n       Let me assure you, John, of my prayers.\n       Asking God to bless you, Janet, the children and all whom \n     you hold dear and with warm personal regards. I am\n           Sincerely yours in Christ,\n                                                   Bernard F. Law,\n                                             Archbishop of Boston.\n\n  Mr. President, there are a long line of people on the basis of their \nposition on life who couldn't be Attorney General. We could start with \nJesus Christ himself. We could also add to that list the Pope, Mother \nTeresa, all the cardinals in the United States. We are going to have to \neliminate a whole lot of people. It is so outrageous and, frankly, \npathetic, it really exposes the left for what they are.\n  It exposes the left for what they are.\n  Let me read part of a comment made by Bill Bennett:\n\n       What you are seeing is the true face of the Democratic \n     Party. What you are seeing is them saying to a man ``you are \n     perfectly decent, everything you have done is within the law, \n     you haven't harbored any illegal aliens, you have never left \n     the scene of a crime, you led an exemplary life, but we don't \n     approve of your views. You dare to say you are pro-life, you \n     dare to say you are opposed to reverse discrimination and for \n     that you will pay. For that we will make this experience \n     something you will never forget.'' I hope they do it. I hope \n     the American people watch it. If you want to see the haters, \n     you'll see them in these press conferences behind the attempt \n     to kill the Ashcroft nomination.\n\n  You can't say it any better than that. People should be ashamed of \nthemselves. Who did our side oppose on a Cabinet appointment in the \nClinton administration? They all were approved by voice vote, with the \nexception of Janet Reno. That was 98-0.\n\n       The activist Democrats shooting at John Ashcroft in his bid \n     to become America's next Attorney General have revealed the \n     ugliness about themselves, not the nominee.\n\n  So said Betsy Hart of Scripps Howard. That is the truth. There is the \nugliness. It is not John Ashcroft. John Ashcroft sat on that committee \non a panel and took those questions and took that abuse. He was decent, \nrespectful, honorable, gracious, and took it all.\n  He is above them all. He showed it on national television. He is \nabove them all. His critics couldn't tie his shoe laces or even shine \nhis boots.\n  Betsy Hart also said:\n\n       Apparently these folks are so comfortable with using \n     cabinet offices to create law instead of to enforce existing \n     laws and so content to see judges write new law instead of \n     interpret existing law, they can't fathom a responsible \n     officeholder who will honor the rule of law.\n\n  You cannot say it any better than that, if you are prepared for 10 \nyears. That sums it up in a nutshell. They are so used to using these \npositions to create law, they can't believe a person such as John \nAshcroft, who will say to you: I worked as hard as I could as a Member \nof the Senate to create laws for what I believe in. So does everybody \nelse on the left, and you have every right to do that. But there is a \ndifference between that John Ashcroft and the John Ashcroft, however \nreluctant he may be, who will step up to the plate as the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States and enforce the law--yes, even the laws he \ndoesn't like. His record proves he did it over and over and over and \nover and over again. There is not one shred of evidence to indicate \nthat he didn't do it.\n  I am sick and tired of the hypocrisy in this place. Much was made \nabout another issue; when you start getting into the racial charges, \nthat hits right below the belt. I am going to answer it. It deserves to \nbe answered. Is there anybody in here whose spouse taught for several \nyears at a predominantly black school? Is that racist? In the news \ntoday is speculation that his No. 2 person may, in fact, be black. So \nwhat. The most qualified person should be who he picks. Then the issue \nof desegregation in the St. Louis matter before the Governor and the \nattorney general. During that suit, the job of the attorney general and \nthe Governor was to support the State's position, to defend the State. \nIt wasn't about segregation. It was about taxes. It was about busing. \nIt was a very controversial issue. Those who opposed busing or imposing \ntaxes by the courts on the citizens were not racists.\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n  Anyone who implies that is flat out wrong. If John Ashcroft is guilty \nof segregation because he defended the State, then why is Jay Nixon, \nwho is the attorney general, himself, not guilty of the same thing? Why \nis it that two prominent Members of this body--I will introduce this \ninto the Record--Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin--invite you to a \nbreakfast ``to meet and support Missouri Senate candidate, Attorney \nGeneral Jay Nixon, Tuesday, March 31, 1998, at The Monocle for a \ncontribution of $5,000 or finish your max-out?'' He did the same thing \nas Ashcroft did. And it is hypocrisy to stand here and say this to \ndestroy the reputation of one of the finest people who ever served \nhere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this announcement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         SENATOR TED KENNEDY &\n\n                           SENATOR TOM HARKIN\n\n              Intite You for Breakfast To Meet and Support\n\n                       MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE\n\n                       ATTORNEY GENERAL JAY NIXON\n\n                        TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1998\n\n                              THE MONOCLE\n\n                            8:30 AM-9:30 AM\n\n                   RSVP to Jill Gimmel--202-546-9494\n\n                      or Don Erback--202-546-9292\n\n              Contribution: $5,000 or Finish Your Max-Out\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Kay James said it about as well as you \ncan say it. ``Religious profiling,'' that is what it is. You can't be a \nman of faith or a woman of faith. You can't be that. You can't have \nviews that differ with the left. Otherwise, you can't serve. That is \nit.\n  Bipartisanship? I will tell you how far it reaches when we agree with \nthat. That is when we get bipartisanship. They never come over to agree \nwith us. That is what this debate is about. It is about the \ncontinuation of the election. The election is over. Hello, the election \nis over, folks.\n  The President of the United States should pick his Cabinet. That is \nthe right thing to do, and every one of you knows it. To get into this \ncharacter assassination of racism, anti-Catholic, antigay, anti-this, \nanti-that--there is not a shred of evidence about John Ashcroft that \nwould indicate that, and you ought to examine your conscience before \nyou vote.\n  John Ashcroft is well qualified to be Attorney General, maybe one of \nthe most qualified ever to even be put up for nomination.\n  During the debate on Janet Reno, I recall her views against the death \npenalty. I happen to support the death penalty. I voted for Reno \nbecause Reno said she would enforce the law, and if the law of the land \nis the death penalty, she said she would enforce it. That is fine.\n  Do I agree with everything Janet Reno did? No. Bill Clinton won the \nPresidency and had the right to pick his Attorney General. That is the \nsituation right now. George Bush is the President, and he has the right \nto pick. If you think John Ashcroft is not going to enforce the law, \nthen say so. If you think he is a racist, say so. But there is not one \nshred of evidence that indicates otherwise.\n  This business about Ronnie White is so outrageous that it really just \ndefies logic to talk about it.\n  The National Sheriffs' Association wrote a letter, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the National Sheriffs' \n     Association (NSA), I am writing to offer our strong support \n     for the nomination of Attorney General Designate John \n     Ashcroft. As the voice of elected law enforcement, we are \n     proud to lend our support to his nomination and look forward \n     to his confirmation by the Senate.\n       As you know, NSA is a non-profit professional association \n     located in Alexandria, Virginia. NSA represents nearly 3,100 \n     elected sheriffs across the Nation and has more than 20,000 \n     members including deputy sheriffs, other law enforcement \n     professionals, students and others.\n       NSA has been a long time supporter of John Ashcroft and in \n     1996, he received our prestigious President's Award. After \n     reviewing Senator Ashcroft's record of service, as it relates \n     to law enforcement, we have determined that he will make an \n     outstanding Attorney General and he is eminently qualified to \n     lead the Department of Justice. NSA feels that Senator \n     Ashcroft will be an outstanding Attorney General for law \n     enforcement and the U.S. Senate should confirm him.\n       I look forward to working with you to ensure that the U.S. \n     Senate confirms Attorney General Designate Ashcroft.\n           Sincrely,\n                                          Jerry ``Peanuts'' Gains,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The National Sheriffs' Association wrote \na letter on behalf of John Ashcroft for Attorney General.\n  On this business about Ronnie White, the truth of the matter is the \nindividual accused of that crime, Mr. Johnson, went on a 24-hour crime \nspree, killed three sheriffs, killing the wife of another one at a \nparty during the Christmas holidays, and he was given all kinds of \nlegal defenses. Ronnie White argued that Johnson's defense team, a \ngroup of three private attorneys with extensive trial experience, had \nprovided ineffective assistance. Fine; he has a right to do that. \nRonnie White was a judge. He had a right to say this guy deserves some \nmore help. But he also has to expect that if you make those kinds of \ndecisions, somebody may hold that against you when you go up for \nanother judgeship somewhere.\n  That is all it was. That is what that was about. It wasn't about \nracism; it was about a judge who some of us thought--55 of us, as a \nmatter of fact--thought shouldn't be on the court because of his views \non crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to rethink their positions and understand it is \nimportant that we understand that a President should pick his nominee \nand that this nominee is a fine man--one of the finest who ever served \nhere. He should be confirmed, and I hope he will be confirmed, as the \nnext Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, as we consider the nomination of John Ashcroft for \nAttorney General, I would like to compliment the Judiciary Committee on \ntheir process and deliberation in bringing this nomination to the \nfloor.\n  On my side of the aisle, I would like to be particularly \ncomplimentary of the leadership provided by Senator Patrick Leahy and, \nof course, the work done by Senator Orrin Hatch. I believe the \ndeliberations were fair, rigorous, thorough, and conducted in a tone \nthat was really becoming of the U.S. Senate. I would like to \ncongratulate my colleagues on that.\n  As I consider the nomination of all the Cabinet members, particularly \nthis one, I want to speak first about the statement that said a \nPresident is entitled to his nominees. The nominations to head up the \nexecutive branch are not entitlement programs. There is nothing \nentitlement about it. In fact, we were given a constitutional mandate \nto examine each and every nominee and to give our advice and consent to \nthe President of the United States. The founding fathers were very \nclear that the Senate should not be a rubber stamp in terms of a \nPresidential set of nominees. The President is entitled to fair \nconsideration of those nominees, but not for us to be a rubber stamp.\n  On each and every one of those nominees, I have given my independent \njudgment and have voted for most of President Bush's nominations \nbecause I think they meet three tests: Competency, integrity, and a \ncommitment to the mission of the agency.\n  President Bush in his inaugural address pledged to ``work to build a \nsingle nation of justice and opportunity.'' Yet one of his first acts \nwas to choose John Ashcroft to lead the Department of Justice, someone \nwho has had an extreme ideological agenda on civil rights, on a woman's \nright to choose, on gun control, his positions are far outside the \nmainstream. Often, his rhetoric has been harsh and wounding. As \nattorney general and Governor of Missouri; he pushed systematically and \nregularly for the disempowerment of people of color and the \ndisempowerment of women to have access to health services related to \ntheir own reproduction.\n\n  Can anyone be surprised that this nomination is divisive? This is not \na time in our history for further division.\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n  My wonderful colleague from New Hampshire left the floor. I want to \nsay something. I don't have a litmus test on nominations. I don't have \na single issue by which I judge any and of all the nominees. He raised \nthe issue, and appropriately, that if you are not pro-choice, can you \nbe confirmed in the Senate, or can you get Democratic votes? The answer \nis yes, and right here.\n  I will give you an example. Governor Thompson has now been appointed \nour Secretary of HHS. I am pro-choice. Governor Thompson is not. I did \nnot hesitate to vote for Governor Thompson because I looked at the \npattern of the way he governed. He is a champion of welfare rights and \ntruly a compassionate conservative--one of the first to have a State \nversion of a woman's health agenda, a real commitment to dealing with \nthe tragedy of long-term care and extra support to care givers. This is \na Cabinet member I want to work with in constructive dialog.\n  I had no litmus test. I don't believe my colleagues do. I believe \namong our own side of the aisle there are people about which it is not \nwhether you are pro-choice or pro-life, it is, are you committed to \nsome of the central values of our society?\n  Do you believe America is a mosaic, that all people come with \ndifferent heritages and different beliefs and have a right to equal \nopportunity and justice under the law? Do you believe the social glue \nis access to courts that you believe are fundamentally fair. Do you \nbelieve that an Attorney General's Office at the State or Federal level \nwill embrace the fundamental principles of our U.S. Government? That is \nour criteria.\n  When I looked at the nomination of John Ashcroft, I had to say, Is he \ncompetent? Yes. You can't dispute that. His whole education and \nrecord--yes, he is competent. On integrity? Until the confirmation \nhearing, I believed him to be a man of great integrity. I had no doubt. \nBut all of a sudden, there were two John Ashcrofts. The prehearing John \nAshcroft who was Attorney General, as Governor of Missouri, here on the \nSenate floor had one set of beliefs. I respect those beliefs. People \nare entitled to their beliefs. But all of a sudden in the confirmation \nhearing, his beliefs no longer mattered to him. If you fundamentally \nopposed, as he did, issues of civil rights, the access of women to have \nreproductive services, how is it you could have such passionate beliefs \none day and then say they didn't matter, you would put them on the \nshelf?\n  I respect the passion Senator Ashcroft has of his beliefs. Though he \nis entitled to his beliefs, I don't believe his beliefs entitle him to \nbe Attorney General of the United States. I don't know how you can \nbelieve something so passionately one day and then say you will put \nthem on the shelf. Beliefs are not something like the surplus that you \ncan put in a lockbox. Beliefs cannot be put in a lockbox.\n  When I looked at John Ashcroft and his record as attorney general and \nas Governor, I was deeply troubled. What I was troubled about was how \nhe enforced issues, his record on civil rights, on a woman's right to \nchoose, on enforcing the laws.\n  On civil rights, the Attorney General of the United States decides \nhow vigorously we enforce existing civil rights laws. The Civil Rights \nDivision monitors and ensures that school districts comply with \ndesegregation. Yet as attorney general, John Ashcroft strenuously \nopposed a voluntary court-ordered desegregation plan agreed to by all \nparties. He even tried to block this after a Federal court found that \nthe State was acting unconstitutionally and then went on to vilify the \ncourt for their position.\n  One of the fundamental civil rights is the right to vote. Didn't we \njust go through that in the most closely contested election? Every vote \ndoes count, and everybody who can should be registered. Yet as \nGovernor, he vetoed the Voter Registration Reform Act which would have \nsignificantly increased minority voter registration and was endorsed by \nsuch groups as the League of Women Voters. I believe there has been a \npersistent pattern of opposing opportunity in the areas of civil \nrights.\n  On the protection of rights of individuals, the right to choose, the \nAttorney General has great power to undermine existing laws and the \nconstitutional protection of a woman's right to choose. As attorney \ngeneral, John Ashcroft used his office to limit women's access to \nhealth care, particularly reproductive health care, filing an amicus \nbrief in a case that sought to prevent nurses from providing routine \nGYN services and also giving out on a voluntary basis usual and \ncustomary methods of contraceptives, saying they were practicing \nmedicine. What they were doing was practicing public health.\n  Based on his record and other statements, I can only conclude that \nJohn Ashcroft would use his position to undermine existing laws, \nincluding the constitutional protection of a woman's right to choose \nand access to reproductive health services, after these services have \nalready been affirmed by law and the Supreme Court.\n\n  Sexual orientation. The Attorney General is charged with enforcing \nantidiscrimination laws, which include protections for homosexuals. Yet \nJohn Ashcroft opposed the nomination of James Hormel to be Ambassador \nto Luxemburg simply because he is gay. Now, hello, what does that mean \nwould happen in his own department? Will this be an issue with his own \nhiring at the Department of Justice?\n  The Justice Department advises the President on proposed legislation; \nfor example, hate crimes prevention, another part of the social glue of \nAmerica. John Ashcroft voted against this legislation. How does he feel \nabout hate crimes now? Will he enforce existing hate crime laws? Will \nhe recommend that the President expand them?\n  The Justice Department is called upon to enforce other laws. One of \nthe big flashing yellow lights is racial profiling. By the way, the \nformer Governor of New Jersey was called into question about the way \nshe enforced racial profiling, but I voted for her to be EPA \nAdministrator because that is not the issue in being an EPA \nAdministrator. Again, no litmus test and no listening to the so-called \nleft-wing groups they talk about. Please let's end this demeaning of \ngroups.\n  The NAACP, People for the American Way, the ACLU, these are part of \nAmerica. Senator Ashcroft could have acted in racial profiling, but he \nheld it up in committee. He was quite passive. Is he going to be \npassive when it comes to this as Attorney General? I wonder.\n  Then we have activism. Bill Lann Lee was nominated for the Assistant \nSecretary for Civil Rights--a compelling story, a man of great talent, \na man who worked his way up, not unlike some of the nominees given to \nus by President Bush, such as Mr. Martinez, Ms. Chao, whose stories are \ncompelling. Bill Lann Lee had a compelling story, but he also had one \nother thing on his resume. He happened to have been a civil rights \nlawyer for the NAACP. This made him, in the Ashcroft analysis, a \nradical activist. What is wrong with being a lawyer for the NAACP? I \nthought Thurgood Marshall once had that job--not a bad place to earn \nyour spurs. But, oh, no.\n  So what is it that John Ashcroft is going to look for in his \nAssistant Secretary for Civil Rights? Passivity? Let's get somebody \npassive? I don't think so, because it really goes against what we \nrequire in that job, because in that job you have to be proactive.\n  I don't believe John Ashcroft is a racist. I also don't believe he is \nanti-Catholic. I believe those rhetorical charges were not only \nexaggerated but I truly believe they are unfounded. At the same time, \nhe does have a record of insensitivity. I look at that pattern where he \nroutinely blocked the nomination of women and minorities; he opposed 12 \njudicial nominees, 8 of whom were women and minorities.\n  Others have spoken about his position on gun control. As a fervent \nopponent of even the most basic gun control measures, how can we expect \nhim to vigorously enforce the gun safety laws that are already on the \nbooks?\n  Let me conclude. The President does have the right to name his \nCabinet, but the Senate has the constitutional requirement to give \nadvice and consent on these nominations. My advice to President Bush \nis: I am sorry you gave us such a divisive nominee. Other nominees are \nexcellent. Others I will look forward to working with, and to starting \na constructive dialog with. I am so sorry this happened. I am sorry it \nhappened to John Ashcroft. If John Ashcroft had been nominated for \nSecretary of Agriculture, I would have\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\nprobably voted for him. But I cannot vote for him to be Attorney \nGeneral because I do believe that beliefs matter and the beliefs that \nyou show over a record of a lifetime show the true way you will conduct \nyour office. Beliefs are not in a lockbox.\n  I cannot consent to the nomination of John Ashcroft. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing this nomination. I also urge my \ncolleagues, let us not have demeaning rhetoric on the floor or try to \ndemonize either a group or a nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am prepared to speak at this moment. If \nthere is a Republican Senator on the floor, I will be happy to yield \ntime so we take turns.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will wait, I understand Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison is coming over. Here she is now. I appreciate that courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee for having this nomination go forward and for \ngiving us the opportunity to talk. I think the debate is very \nimportant. I think it is important that we talk about the John Ashcroft \nwe know because when I hear some of the other people talking about John \nAshcroft, it is not the same person with whom I served for 6 years. I \nwould like to set the record straight on a couple of points.\n  I have known John and Janet Ashcroft since long before they came to \nthe Senate because he was a leader for his State and our country for \nmany years before he represented his State in the Senate. He has been a \nGovernor. He has been elected chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation. He has been the attorney general for the State of \nMissouri. And he served as chairman of the Attorneys General \nAssociation of the United States. So he has been in a position of \nleadership for our country many times.\n  I think he is the most qualified person to have been nominated for \nAttorney General in many years. He has served in the capacity of \nattorney general as well as Governor and in the U.S. Senate.\n  The people of America saw the true heart of John Ashcroft when his \nopponent, Mel Carnahan, died near the end of their race for the Senate. \nI was there for John Ashcroft after that tragic accident. I think John \nAshcroft did not know what to do, just like everyone else. He had no \nintention of campaigning against a man who had just died, a man who had \nalso served the State of Missouri so well. He had no intention of \ncampaigning against his widow when she made the decision that she would \ntake the appointment of the Governor if Mr. Carnahan won the election.\n  John Ashcroft kept his word. He kept his word and has never uttered a \nword about Mrs. Carnahan. So I think when he was ultimately defeated, \nhis magnanimity in defeat also showed that he is a person of character \nfirst--character above public servant, character above partisan, \ncharacter above everything else. He showed it at a time when he had \nnothing to gain, when he thought he probably would not be in public \noffice again. But he did what was right from his heart. That is why I \nam supporting him for Attorney General of the United States.\n  He also brings an impressive academic background to this office. He \nis a graduate of the University of Chicago School of Law. He attended \nYale University.\n  I also want to mention, because I think she is very much a part of \nthis team, his wife Janet and their joint commitment to education in \nour country. When she moved up here with Senator Ashcroft, she decided \nshe wanted to teach. She chose to teach at Howard University, one of \nour Nation's historically black colleges. Howard University is where \nshe has taught for 5 years. I think she has shown her commitment to \neducation by going the extra mile to share her experiences and her \nknowledge with the students at Howard University. Janet, by the way, is \nalso a lawyer.\n  I am very proud to support both Janet and John Ashcroft.\n  We have heard a lot of John Ashcroft's record, things which he said \nwhich have also been refuted. In my experience with John Ashcroft, he \nwas the cosponsor of my legislation to eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty, which has the effect of taxing so many couples just because \nthey get married--not because they make higher salaries individually \nbut because they get married--and throwing them into a higher bracket. \nJohn did not just cosponsor the bill and walk away; he fought with me \non the floor, day after day, week after week. We passed marriage \npenalty relief. It was because John Ashcroft worked as hard as I did to \nmake that happen. It was vetoed by the President. But eventually we are \ngoing to pass marriage penalty relief in this country, and the \nPresident is going to sign it, and people will not have to pay the \naverage $1,400 a year just because of their married status.\n  John did this because he believes in family values and he believes \nmarriage is one of the ways people can live a good life. Statistics \nshow that married people are the least likely to be on welfare or to \nget into any kind of criminal trouble. I think we should be encouraging \nmarriage, not discouraging it. John Ashcroft agrees with that.\n  He worked with me on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. We \nintroduced legislation to amend current stalking laws to make it a \ncrime to stalk someone across State lines. Also, cyberstalking has \nbecome a more common crime in recent years, as the use of the Internet \nhas increased. Young people are lured into a situation in which \ncriminal conduct becomes part of an association. That happens when you \nhave Internet chatrooms. Internet chatrooms often cause people to start \nthinking they want to meet, and that has facilitated criminal acts when \nit has not been monitored correctly. So to try to discourage it, we \nmade that against the law.\n  John also played a role in allowing hourly wage workers, particularly \nworking mothers, to have flextime in the workplace so they could take \noff at 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon and make up for it on Monday by \nworking 2 extra hours so they could see their child's football game or \nsoccer game.\n  These are things that are very important in John's background.\n  He also voted to prohibit anyone convicted of domestic violence from \nowning a firearm. This is very important to try to curb domestic \nviolence in our country.\n  I think we need to bring John's full record to the forefront in order \nto make the decision on whether he would be fit to serve as Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Almost everyone in this body supported every Clinton appointee to the \nCabinet. That has been the tradition in the Senate. Very few times do \nwe deny the right of the President to have his own Cabinet and the \npeople he trusts and wants to work with around him. I think it would be \na major step in the wrong direction to not affirm the appointment of \nJohn Ashcroft. I also think it will be a major setback if John Ashcroft \nis the victim of scurrilous statements that will keep him from having \nthe ability to do his job and the mantle to do his job.\n  So I hope my colleagues will show discretion. I hope they will \nunderstand that John Ashcroft is likely to be confirmed. So if they \nhave something to say against him, it is their absolute right to do it, \nbut I hope they stick to the facts and give their views in a way that \nwill not hurt John Ashcroft's ability to do the important job of \nenforcing the laws of this country.\n  When John Ashcroft becomes Attorney General, he will no longer be an \nadvocate for laws; he will be the enforcer of laws. He has said on many \noccasions that he will enforce those laws to the letter because he sees \nthat as his job.\n  Furthermore, he has shown by his record as attorney general of \nMissouri that he will do that. He deserves not only our support now but \nalso our support after he gets the job to make sure the laws of our \ncountry are fairly and reasonably enforced and targeted to people who \nbreak those laws.\n  The rhetoric, if it gets too hot, is going to auger against his \nability to do the job that all of us need for him to do and want him to \ndo.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Durbin. I yield \nthe floor.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nTexas for her kind words. I will be happy to yield to the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Hatch, so we can continue this dialog about this \nimportant nomination.\n  While in my office, I listened to one of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side earlier in the debate raise the question whether the \nopposition to John Ashcroft was really based on his religious belief. I \nthink that is an extraordinarily serious charge to make.\n  I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Together with my \nstaff, we have worked for the last several weeks analyzing the public \nrecord and public career of John Ashcroft. I am aware of his religious \naffiliation because he made a point of stating with pride his religious \naffiliation during the course of the hearing. I can tell you quite \ncandidly that I do not know a single precept or tenet of his religious \nfaith, nor did I take the time to ask. That is totally irrelevant. In \nfact, if someone tried to raise that during the course of this debate, \nI would be the first to defend John Ashcroft's right to practice the \nreligion of his conscience.\n  I do not know anything about his religion, nor have I based any of my \ndecisions on his nomination on that fact. As I said during the course \nof the hearing, he has said--and it has been a matter of some \namusement--that he does not drink or dance. But I will tell you I do \nnot know whether Janet Reno drinks or dances, nor do I think it is \nimportant to the job of Attorney General.\n  During the course of the hearings, the Republicans brought forward a \nlady by the name of Kay Coles James who works for the Heritage \nFoundation. After her testimony, I had a conversation with her on two \ndifferent occasions. At the end of the second conversation, she said: \nYou and I agree on a lot more than we disagree when it comes to \nreligion in public life. I liked her.\n  She said something in her testimony on this same issue that caused me \ngreat concern. At one point she said John Ashcroft was a victim of \n``religious profiling.'' That was her term. It is not in her written \nstatement, but it is what she said before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In her written statement and repeated at the hearing, she said:\n\n       Unfortunately that faith Senator Ashcroft's faith--has been \n     dragged into the public debate and has been used to call into \n     question his fitness for public service. Senator Ashcroft's \n     opponents have veered perilously close to implying that a \n     person of strong religious beliefs cannot be trusted with \n     this office.\n\n  As a result of that statement in the hearing, I called Ms. James over \nafterwards and said: I am going to ask you very specifically tomorrow \nto name the Senators who have crossed this line and raised questions \nabout John Ashcroft's religious belief. I did not have time the second \nday when the panel returned. I sent a letter to her in writing.\n  On January 23, Ms. James replied to my letter. This is basically what \nshe said:\n\n       On Thursday, I testified that ``several members of the \n     Senate have questioned whether or not a man of strong \n     personal faith and conviction can set aside his personal \n     beliefs and serve as the Attorney General for all citizens.'' \n     You ask me to identify these several senators. As I told you \n     after the hearing, this summary came directly from Senator \n     Ashcroft's testimony on January 16th.\n\n  And then she relates the transcript of the session which reads as \nfollows:\n  Senator Leahy asked of Senator Ashcroft:\n\n       Have you heard any senator, Republican or Democrat, suggest \n     that there should be a religious test on your confirmation?\n\n  John Ashcroft:\n\n       No Senator has said ``I will test you.'' But a number of \n     senators have said, ``Will your religion keep you from being \n     able to perform your duties in office?''\n\n  Senator Leahy went on to say:\n\n       All right, well, I'm amazed at that.\n       And that was the end of the transcript.\n       Ms. James goes on to say:\n\n       As we further discussed, I think when you put it into the \n     context of substituting another qualifier for ``religion'' \n     that the offensiveness of such thinking is apparent. I find \n     this as troubling as asking whether being a ``woman'' or \n     being an ``African-American'' would prevent someone from \n     doing a job.\n\n  I believe that is a fair characterization of her reply. We still do \nnot know the name of any Senator who raised either personally or \nprivately to Senator Ashcroft or certainly publicly any question about \nhis fitness for office based on his religious belief. I do not know the \nreligions of any of the nominees to President Bush's Cabinet, nor do I \nthink it is an important question.\n  What we have focused on during the course of this investigation of \nJohn Ashcroft is his public career, his public record. There have been \nthose who always want to say: What about his private life? His private \nlife should be private. It is his life and his family's life. I have \nresisted any efforts by critics of John Ashcroft to even follow that \nline of questioning. It is irrelevant, unimportant.\n  What is important is what he has stood for publicly, what it tells us \nabout his view of politics and policy and the kind of job he would do \nif he is confirmed as Attorney General.\n  I considered John Ashcroft and his public record and my dealings with \nhim as a fellow Senator over 4 years, and I came to the conclusion that \nI cannot support his nomination as Attorney General.\n  I listened to his testimony before the committee, and I heard him say \nso frequently that public positions on issues which he had held for his \nadult life would, frankly, not encumber him as Attorney General. I \ncannot really base my vote on John Ashcroft on what he has claimed he \nwill do in the future when his public record is so clear and in many \nways so inconsistent with what he said to the committee.\n  I say to those who raise the question about whether the Judiciary \nCommittee or any committee is being fair to President Bush by having a \nthorough investigation of John Ashcroft or any other nominee, I think \nthe agenda for considering these nominees is not the creation of any \nSenator, nor certainly of the Democratic side in the Senate. It is the \ncreation of the Founding Fathers in article II, section 2, of the \nConstitution where they gave to the Senate the power to advise and \nconsent to the President's nominees.\n  The critics of this process ignore our sworn responsibility to defend \nthe Constitution. Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist Paper No. \n76 on ``The Appointing Power of the Executive'' wrote this of the \nadvice and consent provision which brings us to the floor today:\n\n       It is not easy to conceive a plan better calculated than \n     this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the \n     offices of the Union. . . .\n\n  Please forgive Alexander Hamilton for just referring to men, but that \nwas the style of the day. I would certainly expand on Alexander \nHamilton's sentiment to include women, but otherwise I agree \nwholeheartedly. There was and is enormous wisdom in the constitutional \nprovision to provide to the legislative branch, in this case the \nSenate, the ability to exercise oversight of the nominations made by \nthe President.\n  The Founding Fathers believed, and I think they were right, that the \npower to appoint people to high office in the United States should not \nbe vested in the hands of a single individual.\n  The President deserves clear and broad latitude in making the \nappointments of his choice, but just as clearly, the Senate has a \nresponsibility to ensure that these appointments will serve expertly, \nbroadly, and fairly in a manner that will benefit all Americans, and \nthe Senate has the power to, if necessary, reject the nomination.\n  My colleague, Senator Feingold, in his statement yesterday before the \ncommittee, noted that this is a rare situation when the Senate rejects \na nomination, but I will tell you, during the course of our Nation's \nhistory, there have been literally hundreds of names withdrawn when it \nwas clear they would not pass with approval before the Senate.\n  Alexander Hamilton thought such rejections would occur rarely and \nonly when there were ``special and strong reasons for the refusal.'' I \nbelieve we have before us one of those rare instances that Hamilton \nforesaw. There exists today just such ``special and strong reasons'' to \nreject the nomination of John Ashcroft to the position of Attorney \nGeneral. I would like to outline my reasons that necessitated my vote \nagainst his nomination.\n  During his testimony, Senator Ashcroft did a masterful job of \npainting a portrait of his vision of the job of Attorney General. He \ndescribed himself as a man who would evenhandedly enforce and defend \nthe laws of the land no\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\nmatter how strong his personal disagreement with those laws, but his \npublic career paints a much different picture.\n  When I look at the public record of John Ashcroft and compare it, \npoint by point, with his testimony, I find I am looking at two \ncompletely different portrayals, two completely different people. \nDuring the hearings, Senator Ashcroft promised fairness in setting the \nagenda for the Department of Justice and vowed to protect vulnerable \npeople whose causes he has seldom, if ever, championed in his public \nlife.\n  Which picture tells the story? If John Ashcroft were to become \nAttorney General, would it be John Ashcroft, the defender of a woman's \nconstitutional right to choose, or John Ashcroft, passionate opponent \nof Roe v. Wade? John Ashcroft, the defender of sensible gun safety \nlaws, or John Ashcroft, who opposed every significant gun safety \nmeasure that came before the Senate during his tenure? John Ashcroft, \nas defender of civil rights, or John Ashcroft, who, as Governor of \nMissouri, opposed a voluntary--I repeat, voluntary--school \ndesegregation plan and efforts to register minorities to vote.\n  We all heard Senator Ashcroft's testimony, but his public record \nspeaks with clarity and consistency.\n  Let us consider the question of discrimination against a person \nbecause of their sexual orientation. Consider whether those with a \ndifferent sexual orientation who were victims of a hate crime could \nexpect the protection of John Ashcroft's Department of Justice.\n  I cannot speak for all of America--maybe only a small part of it--but \nI think, regardless of your view towards sexual orientation, the vast \nmajority of Americans oppose discrimination against anyone because of \ntheir sexual orientation. The vast majority of Americans think it is \nfundamentally unfair to be intolerant of people with a different sexual \npersuasion.\n  Recently at Georgetown University, Professor Paul Offner stated that \nin a 1985 job interview, then-Governor Ashcroft asked him pointblank \nabout his sexual orientation. Mr. Offner related that the Governor \nasked him: ``Do you have the same sexual preference as most men?'' \nSenator Ashcroft, through his spokespeople, has denied this. In fact, \nthey brought witnesses to say that it did not happen.\n  Perhaps the story would be nothing more than the typical Washington \nversion of ``yes, you did; and, no, I didn't,'' were it not for the \nmatter of Senator Ashcroft's troubling record on the issue of tolerance \nfor people of different sexual orientations.\n  Senator Ashcroft opposed the nomination of James Hormel as Ambassador \nto Luxembourg because Mr. Hormel, in Senator Ashcroft's words, ``. . . \nhas been a leader in promoting a lifestyle . . . . And the kind of \nleadership he's exhibited there is likely to be offensive to . . . \nindividuals in the setting to which he will be assigned.''\n  For the record, Mr. Hormel's lifestyle is that he is an openly gay \nman.\n  I know the appointment of any Ambassador is important. Certainly, the \nappointment to a nation such as Luxembourg, which has been a friend of \nthe United States for a long time, is important. But to single out \nJames Hormel because he is an openly gay man, and to oppose his \nnomination because of that, I think, is not fair.\n  Senator Ashcroft said he opposed Mr. Hormel's nomination based on the \n``totality of the record.'' When he was asked by Senator Leahy if he \nopposed Mr. Hormel because he was gay, Senator Ashcroft denied that. He \nsaid: ``I did not.''\n  Senator Ashcroft had very little contact with Mr. Hormel before his \nnomination. He refused to meet with Mr. Hormel after he was nominated \ndespite Mr. Hormel's request.\n  At a recent press conference, Mr. Hormel had this to say. I will \nquote him:\n\n       I can only conclude that Mr. Ashcroft chose to vote against \n     me solely because I am a gay man.\n\n  He had concluded that his sexual orientation was the cause of Senator \nAshcroft's opposition ``not only from his refusal to raise any specific \nobjection to my nomination, but also from Mr. Ashcroft's public \ncomments at the time of my nomination and his own long record of \nresistance to acknowledging the rights of all citizens, regardless of \ntheir sexual orientation.''\n  I have before me a letter dated December 3, 1997, from James Hormel, \nof San Francisco, CA, to Senator Ashcroft at the Hart Senate Office \nBuilding. He wrote:\n\n       I am aware that you voted against my nomination, when it \n     was considered by the Foreign Relations Committee, and \n     understand that you may have concerns about my \n     qualifications. I want you to know that I am available to \n     meet with you at your convenience in either Washington or \n     Missouri, to address and--I trust--allay your concerns.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft never agreed to such a meeting.\n  Could we expect Attorney General Ashcroft to defend tomorrow's \nMatthew Shepard if he can't show tolerance for today's James Hormel?\n  The second issue that is of importance to me relates to an \noutstanding individual who came before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwhen I served on that committee 2 years ago. His name was Bill Lann \nLee. He was being considered as an Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights. Senator Ashcroft joined in an effort to block his nomination.\n  I remember this because I remember what Bill Lann Lee told about his \nlife's story. Maybe I am particularly vulnerable when I hear these \nstories, but they mean so much to me, when a person such as Bill Lann \nLee comes and tells us about the fact that his mother and father were \nimmigrants from China to the United States. They came to New York City \nand started a small laundry, and raised several children, including \nBill Lann Lee.\n  His mother is with him. His father passed away. He said his mother \nused to sit in the window of the laundry every day at her sewing \nmachine. His father was busy in the back ironing and preparing the \nlaundry. Bill Lann Lee said that they worked every day--hard-working \npeople--raising a family. When World War II broke out, Bill Lann Lee's \nfather was old enough to escape or avoid the draft, but he volunteered \nbecause he was proud of this country and he was willing to serve.\n  Bill Lann Lee also told us that his father refused to ever teach him \nhow to run the laundry. He told him, from the beginning: This is not \nyour life. You will have a different life. We will work hard here. You \nare going to do something different. And, boy, was he right, because \nBill Lann Lee applied for a scholarship to one of the Ivy League \nschools. He received a scholarship and went on and graduated from law \nschool.\n\n  He then went to work for the NAACP. He really dedicated his \nprofessional life not to making money as a lawyer but to fighting for \ntolerance against discrimination.\n  He was a quiet man, a humble man; but when it came to the cause of \ncivil rights, he clearly believed in it. For that reason, he faced \nwithering criticism from the Senate Judiciary Committee. In fact, \nSenator Ashcroft openly opposed his nomination.\n  When Bill Lann Lee was asked about a specific Supreme Court case, and \nwhether he would enforce it, Bill Lann Lee, under oath, said: Yes, I \nwill enforce it. Senator Ashcroft rejected that sworn statement. He \nsaid, in opposing Bill Lann Lee, that Bill Lann Lee was an ``advocate'' \nand was ``willing to pursue an objective . . . with the kind of \nintensity that belongs to advocacy, but not with the kind of balance \nthat belongs to administration.''\n  Obviously, Senator Ashcroft felt that advocacy and effective \nadministration do not mix. ``He has obviously incredibly strong \ncapacities to be an advocate,'' Ashcroft said of Bill Lann Lee. ``But I \nthink his pursuit of specific objectives that are important to him \nlimit his capacity to have a balanced view of making judgments that \nwill be necessary for the person who runs that division.''\n  I was saddened by the treatment of Bill Lann Lee by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and Senator Ashcroft. This good man--this great \nAmerican story--was subjected to what I considered an unfair standard \nby the man who now wants to be our Attorney General, who now wants to \nbe entrusted with enforcement of civil rights laws.\n  But this was not the only nominee that Senator Ashcroft zeroed in on; \nanother was Judge Margaret Morrow of California. He joined in blocking \nher nomination for a lengthy period of time with a little Senate device \nknown as a ``secret hold,'' where you hold up a\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\nnominee and you never disclose that you are the person holding it. \nEventually, he admitted he was the person holding Margaret Morrow back \nfrom her appointment to the Federal bench.\n  Was Margaret Morrow qualified to be a Federal district court judge? \nWitness after witness said she was. They all said she had extraordinary \nqualifications. She was the first woman to be president of the \nCalifornia State Bar Association. But she didn't meet Mr. Ashcroft's \ntest. Because of that, she waited years before this Senate before she \nhad a chance to serve in the State of California.\n  The reason why Senator Ashcroft opposed her? She was an advocate in \nhis mind. Should I accept that John Ashcroft, himself, an impassioned \nadvocate for his entire political life, will surrender his advocacy in \nthe role of Attorney General? He certainly didn't accept those \narguments from Bill Lann Lee and Margaret Murrow when they raised their \nhand to give the same oath he did.\n  If we apply the Ashcroft standard to his own nomination, would he \nhave a chance of being confirmed in the Senate? Fairness requires more \nthan a simple test as to whether a nominee has advocated views with \nwhich we disagree. Fairness requires that we judge on balance whether \nthat nominee can credibly set aside those views and be evenhanded.\n  At this moment in our Nation's history, our need for that type of \nleadership is compelling. We are a politically divided Nation with one \nof the closest elections in modern memory. Landmark civil rights and \nhuman rights laws hang in the balance. We need an Attorney General who \nwill be fair and impartial in administering justice.\n  No issue in the United States is more divisive than civil rights or \nmore in need of enlightened leadership. Yet throughout his career, \nSenator Ashcroft repeatedly turned down opportunities to reach out \nacross the racial divide. There was, of course, a lot of attention \ngiven to the fact that Senator Ashcroft appeared at Bob Jones \nUniversity, received an honorary degree, and delivered the commencement \naddress. It did deserve attention. It became an issue in the last \nPresidential campaign.\n  After President Bush appeared there during the course of his \ncampaign, he was so troubled by the public reaction to his appearance \nat Bob Jones University that he sent a letter to the late Cardinal \nO'Connor in New York assuring the cardinal that he did not agree with \nthe prejudicial statements of Mr. Jones and regretted that he did not \ndistance himself from them.\n  Let me quote a few words from George Bush's letter to Cardinal \nO'Connor in reflecting on his appearance before Bob Jones University, a \nletter of February 25, 2000:\n\n       Some have taken--and mistaken--this visit as a sign that I \n     approve of the anti-Catholic and racially divisive views \n     associated with that school. As you know from a long \n     friendship with my family--and our own meeting last year--\n     this criticism is unfair and unfounded. Such opinions are \n     personally offensive to me and I want to erase any doubts \n     about my views and values.\n       On reflection, I should have been more clear in \n     disassociating myself from anti-Catholic sentiments and \n     racial prejudice. It was a missed opportunity causing \n     needless offense, which I deeply regret.\n\n  I accept President Bush at his word. I believe he was embarrassed \nwhen he reflected on some of the statements that have been made at Bob \nJones University: Their ban on interracial dating among students; some \nof the cruel statements made about people of the Catholic and Mormon \nreligions; of course, their decision, when a gay alumnus said he was \ngoing to revisit his campus at Bob Jones University, and they \nstated publicly if he came on campus, they would have him arrested for \ntrespassing. I can understand the embarrassment of people as they \nreflect on those sorts of statements. But I cannot understand, after \nPresident Bush has made this acknowledgment, that when John Ashcroft \nhad the same opportunity before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he \ndidn't take that opportunity. He offered no apologies for his \nappearance at Bob Jones University.\n\n  I said: If you become Attorney General, would you return to Bob Jones \nUniversity? He wouldn't rule that out.\n  He said: If I go back, I might talk to them about some of the things \nthey have said and what they stand for.\n  I am sorry. I view that particular episode as troubling. It has \nlittle to do, if anything to do, with religion and more to do with \ntolerance. If elected officials don't take care as to where they speak \nand what they say, what comfort and encouragement they give to others, \nthen I think we are derelict in our public responsibilities.\n  I think President Bush learned an important lesson. It is hard to \nimagine that his choice for Attorney General of the United States \ncouldn't learn the same lesson from him, couldn't say before this \ncommittee exactly what President Bush said to the late Cardinal \nO'Connor, but he did not.\n  On the issue of school desegregation, my colleague, Senator Kennedy, \nlaid out the issue quite clearly before the Senate within the last hour \nor two in the course of the debate. I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, \nacross the river from St. Louis. I associated myself more with St. \nLouis than most other cities as a child. I know, having grown up in \nthat area on both sides of the river, that there have always been \nracial problems, sometimes bitter and violent, and sad situations \narising because of it.\n  When there was an effort made in Missouri to deal with segregated \nschools, there was a voluntary desegregation plan that was agreed to by \nthe students and their parents, by the administrators and the teachers, \npeople living in the community, of how they would voluntarily \ndesegregate schools and give children an opportunity for a good \neducation. We have heard during the course of the committee hearing, we \nheard again on the floor of the Senate, John Ashcroft used every tool \nin his tool box to try to stop this voluntary desegregation plan. \nFrankly, that is a poor reflection on what John Ashcroft would do as \nAttorney General.\n  He labeled the efforts of the Federal courts to desegregate \nMissouri's schools as a ``testament to tyranny.'' Again, Governor \nAshcroft missed an important opportunity to bridge the racial divide.\n  Then he had two bipartisan bills presented to him as Governor to \nexpand voting rights in the city of St. Louis, which is predominantly \nAfrican American. He vetoed the first saying: It doesn't help St. \nLouis. It should be a broader based and statewide bill.\n  The next year, the General Assembly of Missouri sent him the broader \nbased statewide bill. He vetoed that as well, saying: This is too broad \nbased and too general.\n  I think it is pretty clear that he was intent on not expanding an \nopportunity for voter registration and efforts for people to involve \nthemselves in the voting process. What possible assurance could we have \nfrom his record that Attorney General John Ashcroft would dedicate \nhimself to eliminating racial prejudice in America?\n  The next issue which I take with John Ashcroft is one which was \nprobably the most important to me. On the day that President Bush \nnominated John Ashcroft, the leading radio station in St. Louis, KMOX, \ncalled me and asked for a comment. I told them that before I could vote \nfor John Ashcroft, I had to have answers to several questions. First \nand foremost was the treatment of Judge Ronnie White. Of course, that \nis something I will speak to and an issue that came up time and again \nduring the course of the hearings.\n\n  Within an hour or two, John Ashcroft called me after I made this \nradio statement and said: I want to talk to you. I need your vote.\n  I said: Senator, I will be happy to meet with you any time and \ndiscuss this, but let me make it clear, the first question I will have \nto you is about what happened to Judge Ronnie White, when he had an \nopportunity to become a Federal district court judge and you blocked \nthat opportunity.\n  He said: That is fine. We will have to get together.\n  I said: My door is open.\n  John Ashcroft never called for such a meeting. I asked several \nquestions of Senator Ashcroft at the hearing about the White \nnomination. I listened carefully to the testimony of Judge White \nhimself. I understand why Senator Ashcroft did not ask for a meeting.\n  The story of Judge Ronnie White is one that bears repeating. This is \nnot just another nominee for Federal\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\ncourt. There are some fine men and women who have been nominated and \nconfirmed. Let me tell you a little bit about Judge Ronnie White.\n  He was the first African American city counselor in the city of St. \nLouis. That, in and of itself, does not sound very impressive, but when \nJudge White explained his childhood growing up in one of the poorest \nsections of St. Louis, in one of the poorest homes and struggling \nthroughout his life to earn an education and to go to law school--he \nwas bused as a young student to one of these newly integrated schools. \nHe recalled other children throwing food and milk at him and the other \nAfrican American students coming off the bus. Life was not easy. He \nwasn't looking for sympathy. He was looking for a chance, and he got \nthe chance. He went to law school, became the first African American \ncity counselor in St. Louis. He became the first African American in \nMissouri history to be appointed to the appellate court of the State, \nand he became the first African American in the history of the State to \nserve on the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  If you visit St. Louis, you can't miss the arch. That is really the \nthing you think of right away. But within the shadow of the arch is a \nbuilding which is historically so important to that city, State, and to \nour Nation. It is the St. Louis courthouse. It is a white, stone \nbuilding, very close to the Mississippi River. The reason why this \nbuilding is so historically significant is that it was in this \ncourthouse that the Dred Scott case was argued and tried twice. It was \non the steps of this courthouse before the Civil War that African \nAmericans were sold as slaves.\n  When Ronnie White was appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court, he \nchose that old courthouse in St. Louis to take his oath of office. The \nSt. Louis Post Dispatch, in commenting on that setting and his \nselection as the first African American to the Missouri Supreme Court, \nsaid:\n\n       It is one of those moments when justice has come to pass.\n\n  It certainly was. And as you listen to Judge White's testimony, you \nunderstand that this wasn't a matter of pride for his family in being \nnominated to the Federal district court. It wasn't just a matter of \npride for his colleagues on the Missouri Supreme Court. It had to be a \nsource of great pride for thousands of African Americans to see this \nman overcome such great odds to finally get a chance to serve on the \nFederal district court.\n  He never had that chance. The reason he didn't have that chance was \nthat after 2 years of having his nomination pending before this Senate, \nafter being approved twice by the Senate Judiciary Committee, after \nfinally finding his name on the calendar of the Senate to be voted on \nto become a Federal district court judge, John Ashcroft decided to kill \nhis nomination.\n  And he did it. He did it. He came to the floor, after speaking to his \ncolleagues on the Republican side, and said that Judge Ronnie White was \npro-criminal. He cited several decisions made by the judge and said \nthat they were ample evidence that this man did not have appropriate \nsensitivity to become a Federal judge with a lifetime appointment when \nit came to enforcing our laws. Judge Ronnie White's name was then \ncalled for a vote.\n  It was defeated on a partisan vote. Every Republican voted against \nit. This is rare in the history of the Senate. It doesn't happen very \noften. Our review said it hadn't happened for 40 years, that a nominee \nwas brought to the floor, subjected to that kind of public criticism, \nand defeated.\n  Frankly, it wasn't necessary. If John Ashcroft had decided that he \nwanted to stop Ronnie White, there were a variety of ways for him to do \nit, quietly and bloodlessly. But he didn't choose those options. He \nchose instead to attack this man and to attack him on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  When we were interrogating John Ashcroft about his criticisms, he \nsaid, the law enforcement groups are the ones who really told me that \nRonnie White was not a good choice.\n  It is true that there was a local sheriff, whose family had been \ninvolved in a murder in a case where Judge Ronnie White had handed down \na dissenting opinion, who sent a letter to John Ashcroft saying they \nobjected to him. That is true. But it is also true that the largest law \nenforcement community in the State of Missouri, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, endorsed Ronnie White, and that the vast majority of law \nenforcement officials in that State endorsed Ronnie White for this \nFederal district courtship.\n  Sadly, he was defeated and, in the process, I am afraid, faced the \nkind of humiliation which no one should ever have to face--certainly \nnot on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am troubled by John Ashcroft's willingness to distort a good \njudge's record beyond all recognition, to attack his character and \nintegrity and to deliver this unjust condemnation on the floor of the \nSenate without ever giving Judge White an opportunity to respond and \ndefend his name.\n  When Judge White appeared before the Judiciary Committee, it was \nclear to many of us that he deserved an apology for what had happened \nto him.\n  Why is this important in choosing a man to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States? When given the power as a Senator, I don't believe that \nJohn Ashcroft used it appropriately. The victim was a very good man.\n  There have been a lot of questions asked about the issue of \nreproductive rights of women and what the new Attorney General, John \nAshcroft, would do with that authority. I know John Ashcroft's \nposition. I respect him for the intensity of his belief in opposing Roe \nv. Wade for his entire public career. There are people in my State of \nIllinois and his State of Missouri who feel just as passionately on one \nside or the other side of the issue. It worries some that he would be \nentrusted with the authority and responsibility to protect a woman's \nright to choose and what he would do with it. He tried to set the issue \naside in his opening statement by saying he accepts Roe v. Wade and \nCasey v. Planned Parenthood, two Supreme Court cases, in Ashcroft's \nwords, as the ``settled law of the land.'' That, of course, raises \nquestions. If it is the settled law of the land, what will he do in \nenforcing it?\n  One of the things that troubles me--and Senator Mikulski of Maryland \nraised this earlier--was the decision John Ashcroft made as attorney \ngeneral of Missouri when there was an effort to have nurses provide \nwomen's health services in one of the poorest medically underserved \nsections of Missouri.\n  John Ashcroft attempted to block the nurses. He joined in filing a \nlawsuit against the nurses at their women's health clinic. These nurses \nwere providing gynecological services, including oral contraceptives, \ncondoms, and IUDs, Pap smears, and testing for venereal disease. He \njoined in suing these nurses to stop them from providing vital \nreproductive health services to low-income women in his home State.\n  As Governor in 1986, Senator Ashcroft signed a bill that defined life \nas beginning at fertilization, providing a legal basis to ban some of \nthe most common and effective methods of contraception. In 1998 and \n1999, Senator Ashcroft wrote letters to Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell \nopposing a Senate amendment to require the FEHBP, the federal health \ninsurance plan, to cover the cost of FDA-approved contraceptives, \nciting concerns that funding certain contraceptives was equivalent to \nfunding abortifacients.\n  Nearly forty million women in America use some form of contraception. \nWould Attorney General John Ashcroft work to protect their right of \nprivacy and their right to choose the medical services best for them \nand their families?\n  On the question of the ``settled law of the land''--Roe and Casey--we \nhave had this contentious debate on the floor of the Senate for years \nabout a partial-birth abortion ban. Many of us have said we can agree \nto a ban so long as it not only protects the life of the mother but \nwomen who face grave health risks. Those who introduced the amendment--\nSenator Santorum of Pennsylvania and others--have refused to include \nthat second phrase ``health risk'' as part of the bill. Recently, in a \nSupreme Court case, they considered a Nebraska partial-birth abortion \nban, and the Supreme Court concluded that unless you protect the health \nof the mother, protecting the mother's life is not enough on a partial-\nbirth abortion ban. They cited as the reason for it the same Casey \ndecision which Senator Ashcroft described as the ``settled law of the \nland'' to make certain that it was clear.\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\n  Senator Schumer of New York and I asked Senator Ashcroft as Attorney \nGeneral, if the Santorum partial-birth abortion ban comes to him by \neither the President asking whether he should veto it or Senator \nAshcroft as Attorney General trying to decide whether to defend it, and \nit does not include the protection of a woman's health, what will he \ndo. The answer to me seems fairly obvious. If the Casey decision is the \nsettled law of the land, he would have to say the Santorum bill we \nconsidered before the Senate is unconstitutional, inappropriate, and \ninconsistent with Supreme Court decisions. That seems obvious to me.\n  Senator Ashcroft would not answer the question.\n  The clarity of his statement, his opening statement, disappeared. His \nanswers were tentative and, unfortunately, very unsettling. The \nAttorney General must diligently protect women's rights in America--\nrights repeatedly confirmed in the Supreme Court. Senator Ashcroft's \npublic record and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee leave \nthat in doubt.\n  Senator Ashcroft has made troubling, at times shocking statements \nregarding the lynchpin of our American system of justice, the judicial \nbranch of government. He is fond of the phrase ``judicial despotism'' \nand even used this as the title of a speech he gave before the Heritage \nFoundation. In it he vows to ``fight the judicial despotism that stands \nlike a behemoth . . .'' over our great land. He tells us that \n``people's lives and fortunes'' have been ``relinquished to renegade \njudges,'' judges the labels ``a robed, contemptuous intellectual \nelite.'' He speaks of America's courts as ``out of control'' and the \n``home to a `let-them-eat-cake elite' who hold the people in the \ndeepest disdain.''\n  Senator Ashcroft went on to say: ``Five ruffians in robes'' on the \nSupreme Court ``stole the right of self-determination from the people'' \nand have even directly ``challenged God. . . .'' So grievous are the \nactions of the Federal Judiciary, according to Senator Ashcroft, ``the \nprecious jewel of liberty has been lost.''\n\n  These statements come from a speech Senator Ashcroft gave on judicial \ndespotism. I suggest to my colleagues who have not read it that they \ndo. Is this a person with such a deep mistrust of the character of \njustice in our great land that we should entrust him with the office of \nAttorney General?\n  Many years ago, during the Roosevelt administration, Supreme Court \nJustice Frank Murphy served as Attorney General and created the Civil \nLiberties Union to prosecute local officials who abused and even \nmurdered blacks and union organizers. He summed up his constitutional \nphilosophy in one sentence: ``Only by zealously guarding the rights of \nthe most humble, the most unorthodox and the most despised among us, \ncan freedom flourish and endure in our land.'' Could Senator Ashcroft \nrise to this awesome and often unpopular standard as our Attorney \nGeneral?\n  We recently celebrated again the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. It was a huge gathering in the city of Chicago. Mayor Daley has an \nannual breakfast. I attended another breakfast sponsored by Rev. Jesse \nJackson. Literally thousands of people came out to pay tribute to Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. I am old enough to remember when Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., was alive, and I can recall in the midsixties that \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s visit to the city of Chicago was not \nwelcome. He announced he was coming to Chicago to march in the streets \nof Cicero and other neighborhoods to protest racial segregation. Many \npeople--Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike--were saying: \nWhy is he doing this? Why is he stirring things up?\n  It is easy today to forget how unpopular Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nwas with the majority of Americans during his life. It was only after \nhis assassination and our reflection on the contribution he made to \nAmerica that the vast majority of Americans now understand that \nalthough he was unpopular, he was right. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \nlife, fighting for civil rights, tells an important story. When you are \nfighting for the rights of those discriminated against because of \nsexual orientation, when you are fighting for the rights of women, poor \nwomen in particular, when you are fighting for the rights of African \nAmericans and Hispanics, it is often unpopular. But it is the right \nthing to do.\n  The Attorney General, more than any other Cabinet officer, is \nentrusted with protecting the civil rights of Americans. We know from \nour history, defending those rights can be controversial. I find no \nevidence in the public career of the voting record of Ashcroft that he \nhas ever risked any political capital to defend the rights of those who \nsuffer in our society from prejudice and discrimination.\n  As I said in the committee yesterday, it is a difficult duty to sit \nin judgment of a former colleague, but our Nation and our Constitution \nask no less of each Member of the Senate. That is why I will vote no on \nthe nomination of John Ashcroft to serve as Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Michigan will yield, I think we were \ngoing to go back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Alabama has concluded, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was looking for Senator Warner. In the absence of \nSenator Warner, I will mention a couple of things.\n  How long will the Senator from Michigan speak?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might, the agreement the distinguished Senator from \nUtah and I had--obviously an informal agreement--was that following the \nnormal procedure in such a debate, we would be going from side to side. \nThe distinguished Senator from Illinois has just spoken; the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama was going to speak. The normal \nrotation would go back to this side, and it would be the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Michigan. That is without time agreements for any \nSenator.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Alabama will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. As I said this morning, we want to try to wrap up this \ndebate in the near future. I know how fervently the Senator from \nAlabama feels about this issue, but I do say every time someone says \nsomething, we are not going to finish this debate. The Senator from \nAlabama has already spoken very eloquently--which was referred to this \nmorning by Senator Nickles, about what a great statement he made, and I \nheard part of his statement, and it was extremely good.\n  My point is, if the people on the other side of the aisle want us to \nfinish this debate sometime tomorrow, we are going to have to be cut a \nlittle bit of slack and be able to proceed with our statements. \nOtherwise, we are going to go over until next week.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand that is the position of the other side, \nthat they would like this side to hush and have their full say all day.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia is here. I yield to the Senator from \nVirginia such time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could enter into a unanimous consent request \nsequencing the next two Senators: The Senator from Virginia be \nrecognized, and after the Senator from Virginia has finished, then I be \nrecognized, which is a modification of a previous unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am happy to accommodate the leadership \nand the floor managers. Would the Senator care to modify it now and \ntake that time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We were alternating.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator want to modify a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We just did.\n  Could the Senator from Virginia give us a time indication.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will take not more than 10 minutes if that is agreeable \nto my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join the many Members today to support\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nthe nomination of our former colleague--our friend, indeed--John \nAshcroft, to serve as the Attorney General of the United States.\n  Article II, section 2, of the Constitution provides that the \nPresident shall name and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, \nshall appoint judges of the Supreme Court and all other officers of the \nUnited States.\n  Thus, the Constitution provides a role for both the President and the \nSenate in this process. The President has the power to nominate; the \nSenate has the power to render advice and consent on the nomination.\n  In fulfilling the constitutional role of the Senate, throughout my \ncareer--some 23 years I have been privileged to represent the \nCommonwealth of Virginia--I have always tried to give fair and \nobjective consideration to both Republican and Democratic Presidential \nCabinet-level appointees; as a matter of fact, all appointees.\n  Traditionally, a President, especially after taking office following \na national election, should be entitled to select individuals who he \nbelieves can best serve this Nation and his goals as President. It has \nalways been my policy to review Cabinet nominees to ensure that the \nnominee has the basic qualifications and the basic experience to ensure \nthat nominee can perform the job to which he has been nominated, to \nensure that the nominee also will enforce the laws of the land that are \nkey--and that is instrumental--in the consideration now being given to \nthis important post of the Attorney General of the United States, and \nto ensure that the nominee possesses a level of integrity and character \nthat the American people deserve and expect from public officeholder.\n  Therein, perhaps, rests the widest margin of discretion that should \nbe exercised by the Senate. All 100 members have brought to bear in \nthis Chamber, and in other areas in which we daily work to serve the \nSenate, experience that has enabled us to win the public office as \nSenator. That experience has fine-honed every Member of this Chamber in \none way or another, such that he or she can judge facts, nominees, and \nthe entirety of the situation to determine, does that individual have \nthe integrity or do they not have that integrity?\n  That is a very important function we perform.\n  I say to my colleagues, and to my constituents, and to those who are \ninterested in my views, that John Ashcroft has the qualifications and \nthe experience and the integrity to undertake this important office.\n  Former Senator John Ashcroft from Missouri recently lost his election \nbid to the Senate under most unusual circumstances, not unlike the \ncircumstances that faced my State at one time, when we lost one of our \nmost valued public servants, a public servant who was contending for \nthe office of the U.S. Senate, who had beaten me fairly and squarely in \nbasically a convention or modified primary type situation. I was in \nstrong support of that individual. Then his light plane one night \ncrashed.\n\n  I have had that experience. I shared it with my friend, John \nAshcroft, because he was so deeply shaken by this tragedy. There is not \na one of us who couldn't say, ``Well, it could have been me,'' the way \nwe have to travel across our States, across our land, in these small \nplanes and many other modes of conveyance at all hours of the day and \nnight.\n  John Ashcroft approached that tragic situation in a very balanced and \nfair manner. To some extent, he counseled with several of us. But it \nwas a very difficult decision as to how he should conduct himself for \nthe balance of that campaign. I think he did it admirably. He did it \nwith great courage and respect for the tragedy that had befallen his \nState.\n  If I ever had any doubts about John Ashcroft, the manner in which he \nhandled that tragic situation will forever place in my mind that this \nman has the integrity, not only to be Attorney General but to take on \nany public office of this land.\n  Our colleague served in the Senate from 1994 to 2000, serving as a \nleader in the passage of welfare reform legislation and fighting for \nlower taxes, strong national defense, greater local control of \neducation, and enhanced law enforcement.\n  Prior to his service in the Senate, John Ashcroft served as Governor \nof Missouri from 1985 to 1993 and attorney general of Missouri from \n1976 to 1985. He dedicated over 28 years of his life to public \nservice--over a quarter of a century. If he had flaws in his integrity, \nthey would have been carefully documented, I am sure, in that period of \ntime.\n  I would like to add this, again based on having the privilege of \nserving in this Chamber many years and having gone through many \nhearings for Cabinet nominees and other nominees, this was a very \nthorough hearing. Legitimate questions can be asked as to how fair it \nmight have been in some instances, but it was unquestionably thorough. \nIt was prolonged--there is a question of the necessity of the length of \nit--but anyway, it was thorough.\n  In my opinion--and I say this with the deepest respect to the members \nof the committee and most especially to this nominee, John Ashcroft, \nand I say to my good friend, the ranking member, whom I have admired \nthese many years in the Senate--John Ashcroft emerges as a better, a \nstronger, a more deeply committed man as a consequence of this process. \nI feel that ever so strongly. Each of us who has gone through these \nstressful situations that we confront from time to time in our public \noffice--those of us who go through those situations--and withstand the \nrigors of such an examination, in all likelihood emerge a stronger \nperson.\n  I see my friend standing. Does he wish to comment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could, and I do not wish to interfere \nin any way in the Senator's time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think this is an important point, \ncertainly to this Senator. I value the views of my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I respect the views of the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, who has been my friend from day 1 in this place. I knew him \nbefore in his other capacities, such as Secretary of the Navy. I have \ncherished, at home, a souvenir from the bicentennial year which I \nreceived from him. He has been a man to whom I have gone for counsel on \na number of issues. I refer to him as my Senator away from home because \nI spend the week in Virginia when we are in session.\n  He and I, of course, disagree on this nomination. I understand he \nstated his strong views on it. I have stated mine. I promised two \nthings to both the then President-elect and Senator Ashcroft. I \npromised them two things when they called me to tell me they were going \nto nominate him: No. 1, that there would be questions, tough questions, \nbut I would conduct a fair hearing. I believe I did. The nomination \nactually came to the Senate Monday of this week, the official papers. \nWe are moving to go forward with this. Everybody in the Senate knows \napproximately how the vote will come out.\n  I tell the Senator from Virginia of a conversation I had. As he can \nimagine, prior to my announcing my opposition to Senator Ashcroft, I \ncalled Senator Ashcroft to tell him what I was going to say and \nnotified the White House what I was going to say. But I suggested one \nthing. I don't think I divulge any confidence with Senator Ashcroft who \nspoke about what he has gone through. It might have been the same thing \nthe Senator from Virginia said. I suggested what he do after he is \nsworn in is that he meet quietly and privately with a number of \nSenators and House Members of both parties--those who have an interest \nin law enforcement issues, interests that affect the Justice \nDepartment--meet on a private, off-the-record basis, hear their \nsuggestions or their criticisms, and vice versa. He assured me that he \nwould.\n  He asked me also if I would be willing to help bring Members who had \nvoted against him or spoken against him to those meetings. I assured \nhim I would do that, too. The Senator from Virginia makes a good point.\n  I think the debate is good. I hope Senators on both sides of the \naisle will listen to the debate.\n  Again, I use this opportunity to mention one more time how much I \nhave enjoyed the friendship and the wise counsel of my friend from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. If I \nmay say with deep respect to him as a friend first, and as a Senator \nsecond, I\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nthink he agrees with my basic proposition that he emerges from this \nprocess a stronger and a more deeply committed public servant.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly from that standpoint, that alone would give \neveryone a basis on which to cast a vote in favor of this nomination.\n  For those who are concerned about Senator Ashcroft's nomination, it \nis important to remember that once John Ashcroft is confirmed as our \nnext Attorney General, he will serve at the pleasure of the President.\n  This time honored phrase, ``At the pleasure of the President,'' has \nbeen used by Presidents throughout American history to show the \nAmerican people that the President is the final arbiter of \naccountability for his Cabinet members.\n  And, also, I'd like to remind my colleagues in the Senate, and more \nbroadly the American people, of the promises John Ashcroft has made and \nthe oath that he will take. John Ashcroft has promised to every \nAmerican that he will uphold the law of the land whether he disagrees \nwith such a law or not. Once confirmed as Attorney General, John \nAshcroft will raise his right hand and swear to uphold the law of the \nland.\n  When John Ashcroft makes a promise that he will uphold the law of the \nland, and when he takes that oath of office to uphold the law of the \nland, I take him at his word.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 225 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on whether or not \none of our former colleagues and friend, Senator John Ashcroft, should \nbe confirmed to the position of Attorney General of the United States. \nIn the vast majority of Cabinet nominations, the decision is an obvious \none. Most of a President's nominees to his Cabinet receive \noverwhelming, if not unanimous, support by the Senate, and that is as \nit should be. When it comes to Cabinet appointees, we as a Senate are \nwilling to give the President wide berth in his choice, knowing that, \nunlike the lifetime appointment of Federal judges, the President must \nbe able to choose appointees who can carry out his program during his \nterm, people who share his values, his vision and his ideals. But the \nConstitution also requires us to exercise our judgment. The deference \nowed the President is due deference, not unlimited deference.\n  In his inaugural address to the Nation, President Bush laid out the \nvision and ideals he will seek to carry out, visions and ideals which I \nbelieve most of us share. He said:\n\n       The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American \n     promise that everyone deserves a chance, that no \n     insignificant person was ever born.\n\n  And he called on Americans ``to enact this promise in our lives and \nour laws.'' He then made this pledge: ``I will work to build a single \nnation of justice . . .'' The Department of Justice is the place above \nall where the chance to further the vision of ``a single nation of \njustice'' resides.\n  Like the rest of my colleagues, I know Senator Ashcroft in his role \nas Senator from, and as advocate for, the State of Missouri. I consider \nhim a friend. But today we are not called upon to judge Senator \nAshcroft as a friend or colleague, as a Senator representing his home \nState, or as a nominee for any other post but Attorney General of the \nUnited States--at this time in our history and keeping in mind the goal \nof building a ``single nation of justice.''\n  The Attorney General does not mechanically enforce the law. His job \nis not a matter of simply applying a specified law to a specified set \nof facts. Great discretion resides with the Attorney General and the \nproper functioning of the Department of Justice requires that the \npublic--all the public--feels that discretion will be exercised with \nbalanced and deliberative judgment.\n  There are many times when a prosecutor has within his grasp the power \nto prosecute or take a pass, and in that decision lies the lives of the \npeople involved and their families. A commitment to enforce the law of \nthe land is the beginning point, not the ending point. The discretion \nexercised by the Attorney General is not critical in the easy or \nobvious matters that do not require the Attorney General's most \nconsidered judgment, but in the complex and unclear ones where a \ncommitment simply to enforce the law does not resolve the complexities, \nand where balanced deliberation is essential.\n  If America is to build a ``single nation of justice,'' the Department \nof Justice should have as its head someone whose record demonstrates \nevenhandedness and whose rhetoric seeks to assure the American people \nof fair and balanced consideration, rather than division and distrust. \nMore than 25 years ago, at his swearing-in ceremony, Edward Levi, \nAttorney General under President Ford, reflected this sentiment by \nstating if we are going to achieve ``our common goals: among them \ndomestic tranquility, the blessings of liberty and the establishment of \njustice'' through the enforcement and administration of law, then it \ntakes ``dedicated men and women to accomplish this through their zeal \nand determination, and also their concern for fairness and \nimpartiality.''\n\n  While Senator Ashcroft's rhetoric over the years reveals his zeal and \ndetermination, it has not reflected the same concern for impartiality \nand fairness. I have concluded that his record and his rhetoric are so \ndivisive and polarizing that his nomination will not provide the \nnecessary confidence all Americans are entitled to have in the fairness \nand impartiality required of the Department of Justice. Here are four \nexamples:\n  First is his position and his effort with respect to the nomination \nof Judge Ronnie White as a Federal District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri. It was unfair and inappropriate to maintain Judge \nWhite, a distinguished jurist on the Missouri Supreme Court, had ``a \nslant toward criminals'' and was ``against . . . the culture in terms \nof maintaining order,'' as Senator Ashcroft did in his speech to the \nSenate on October 4, 1999. It was unjust to say Judge White practices \n``procriminal jurisprudence'' and will use his ``lifetime appointment \nto push law in a procriminal direction.'' It was an unfounded and \nunfair characterization of Judge White to assert that Judge White ``has \nbeen very willing to say: We should seek, at every turn, in some of \nthese cases to provide an additional opportunity for an individual to \nescape punishment.'' It was a significant distortion of Judge White's \nrecord for Senator Ashcroft to say in the same speech to the Senate \nthat Judge White's ``opinions, and particularly his dissents, reflect a \nserious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty,'' given \nthe fact that Judge White voted with then-Governor Ashcroft's \nappointees in death penalty cases 95 percent of the time.\n  Moreover, it was unfair that Senator Ashcroft did not raise any \nreference to the death penalty or any of his concerns about Judge \nWhite's record before or at Judge White's confirmation hearing. Judge \nWhite was not given the chance to respond to these allegations during \nthe consideration of his nomination. Rather, these personal attacks \ncame well after Judge White had appeared before the Judiciary \nCommittee. When asked at his own confirmation hearing whether he \ntreated Judge White fairly, Senator Ashcroft said:\n\n       I believe that I acted properly in carrying out my duties \n     as a member of the committee and as a member of the Senate in \n     relation to Judge White.\n\n  In responding in that fashion, he neither defended his \ncharacterizations, qualified them or withdrew them. Senator Ashcroft's \nresponse therefore left standing as his current view his claims and \nstatements with respect to Judge White.\n  Second is Senator Ashcroft's interview with Southern Partisan \nmagazine, a publication which has been described as a ``neo-\nconfederate.'' Senator Ashcroft not only granted an interview to \nSouthern Partisan magazine, he commended the magazine for helping to \n``set the record straight.'' He said:\n\n       We've all got to stand up and speak in this respect, or \n     else we'll be taught that these people were giving their \n     lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to \n     some perverted agenda.\n\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\n\n  While in that interview Senator Ashcroft expressed support for \nSouthern Partisan's message, he later said that he did not know much \nabout Southern Partisan and did not know what it promoted. Fair enough.\n  But since his interview with Southern Partisan, much has been said \nabout the magazine in the media and at Senator Ashcroft's own \nconfirmation hearing. Southern Partisan was described as a \n``publication that defends slavery, white separatism, apartheid and \nDavid Duke'' by a media watch group.\n  In 1995, Southern Partisan offered its subscribers T-shirts \ncelebrating the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In the same year, an \nauthor of an article in that publication alleged ``there is no \nindication that slavery is contrary to Christian ethics.'' In 1990, \nanother article praised former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke as \n``a Populist spokesperson for a recapturing of the American ideal.''\n  In 1996, an article in the magazine alleged ``slave owners . . . did \nnot have a practice of breaking up slave families. If anything, they \nencouraged strong slave families to further the slaves' peace and \nhappiness.'' In 1991, another writer printed in the publication wrote, \n``Newly arrived in New York City, I puzzled, `Where are the Americans?' \nfor I met only Italians, Jews, and Puerto Ricans.''\n  I take Senator Ashcroft at his word that he did not know much about \nSouthern Partisan magazine when he praised them for helping to ``set \nthe record straight,'' in his words. I take him at his word. But where \nwas the immediate disgust and repudiation when he learned what he had \ninadvertently praised? And, after the inquiries of others, why not make \na prompt inquiry to satisfy himself that he had not inadvertently \nadvanced the purpose of a racist publication? Even in his written \nresponses to the Judiciary Committee, he said he only rejects the \npublication ``if the allegations about [the] magazine are true.''\n  More than 2 years after the original interview he gave to that \nmagazine, it appears he never took it upon himself to inquire about the \nmagazine's purpose, to see for himself if the allegations were true, \nand, if so, to correct the record.\n  A person being considered for the office of Attorney General--the \nsingle most important person charged with enforcing our Nation's civil \nrights laws in a fair and just manner--should accept the obligation to \nmake that inquiry if the American people are to have faith that their \nAttorney General will ``build a single nation of justice.''\n  As a third example, I am troubled by Senator Ashcroft's previous \nspeeches on drug treatment. In 1997, Senator Ashcroft told the \nClaremont Institute:\n\n       A government which takes the resources that we should \n     devote toward the interdiction of drugs and converts them to \n     treatment resources . . . is a government that accommodates \n     us at our lowest and least instead of calls us to our highest \n     and best.\n\n  During the same year, he addressed the Christian Coalition Road to \nVictory and said:\n\n       Instead of stopping drugs at the border, we're investing in \n     drug treatment centers. Instead of calling America to her \n     highest and best by saying ``no'' to drugs, we're \n     accommodating drug users with treatment. . . .\n\n  Again, it is not just Senator Ashcroft's views on drug treatment that \nare troublesome--although they are--it is his choice of words, his \nrhetoric, that is so divisive and so polarizing. To suggest, as Senator \nAshcroft does, that those who are crippled by addiction to drugs and \nwho seek treatment are somehow the ``lowest and least'' violates \nPresident Bush's own inaugural promise that ``no insignificant person \nwas ever born\" and that we will ``build a single nation of justice.''\n  When I asked Senator Ashcroft in a written question what he meant by \n``lowest and least,'' to give him an opportunity to comment or to \nexplain or to confirm the clear impression that those words create, his \nresponse was a nonresponse.\n  A fourth example is Senator Ashcroft's opposition to James Hormel's \nnomination for Ambassador to Luxembourg. Senator Ashcroft stated in \npress accounts that he opposed Mr. Hormel's nomination because Mr. \nHormel ``actively supported the gay lifestyle.'' Senator Ashcroft also \nsaid a person's sexual orientation ``is within what could be considered \nand what is eligible for consideration'' with respect to the \nqualifications to serve as an Ambassador.\n  To suggest that a person could not represent America's interests or \nshould be judged professionally because of sexual orientation is \ninappropriate and divisive.\n  When pressed on this issue by the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Ashcroft further responded in writing:\n\n       I did not believe [Hormel] would effectively represent the \n     United States in Luxembourg, the most Roman Catholic country \n     in all of Europe.\n\n  To suggest that Luxembourg would not welcome Mr. Hormel's nomination \nis not true. Luxembourg has outlawed discrimination based on sexual \norientation, and its Government specifically said they would welcome \nJames Hormel as Ambassador. And, most importantly, to fail to retract \nsuch contentious statements about a person because of his sexual \norientation adds further doubt that all our people will have confidence \nthat this nominee will strive to build that single nation of justice \nfor which the President has called.\n  In summary, I am deeply troubled by Senator Ashcroft's record of \nrepeatedly divisive rhetoric and sometimes simply unfair personal \nattacks, such as what he has said and done about Judge White, his \npassive acceptance of the message of Southern Partisan, his statements \nabout drug treatment as accommodating the ``lowest and least,'' and his \nstatements about Mr. Hormel's qualifications to serve his country \nbecause of his sexual orientation.\n  Senator Ashcroft has frequently engaged in ``us versus them\" \nrhetoric. He frequently rejects moderation and has even criticized some \nmembers of his own party for engaging in what he characterized as \n``deceptions'' when they ``preach pragmatism, champion conciliation \n[and] counsel compromise.''\n  Senator Ashcroft, in his confirmation hearings, in his written \nanswers to questions posed by a number of Senators, including myself, \neither reaffirmed some of his divisive statements or simply did not \nexplain the extreme language. His refusal to comment on some of the \nmost troubling past statements leaves them standing as his current \nviews.\n  His language and his approach to issues in terms of ``us versus \nthem'' would not prevent me from voting for his confirmation for most \npositions in the Cabinet. But more than any other Cabinet member, the \nAttorney General, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United \nStates, is charged with the responsibility of assuring that the \nDepartment of Justice's goal is equal justice under the law for all \nAmericans. And although I consider John Ashcroft a friend, I will vote \nno on the nomination of John Ashcroft for Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJohn Ashcroft. I have had the opportunity, for the last several weeks, \nas a member of the Judiciary Committee, to listen to the testimony and \nto listen to what has turned out to be fairly extensive hearings.\n  The John Ashcroft I have known for 6 years, and whom most of us have \nknown for 6 years--some have known a lot longer--does not really bear \nmuch resemblance to the individual who has been described by those who \nhave attacked him during this process. I must say, he does not bear \nmuch resemblance to the individual whom some of my colleagues have \npictured, both in debate on the Senate floor and in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The truth is that the John Ashcroft on whom we are going to vote, \nwhose nomination we are taking up, whose nomination we will vote on \ntomorrow, is the same John Ashcroft we have known for 6 years.\n  He is a man of integrity, a man of honesty, and a man of courage. He \nis also a man who has taken controversial positions, a man who has cast \nin his lifetime thousands of votes. I don't think it should come as a \nshock to us that someone who has been in public office for a quarter of \na century would have taken controversial positions. We would worry if \nhe had not.\n  This is a man who served as assistant attorney general of the State \nof Missouri, who served for 8 years as their\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nelected attorney general, who served for 8 years as Missouri's elected \nGovernor and then, for 6 years, as Missouri's elected U.S. Senator. He \nis a man who served as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  It should come as no surprise that he has taken positions on many \nissues. It should come as no surprise that he has cast thousands of \nvotes. And, yes, he clearly does have a long track record.\n  It should not come as a surprise that a record of a quarter of a \ncentury would generate criticism, or that it would generate a lot of \ncriticism.\n  I said, when the Judiciary Committee hearing started, I sometimes get \nthe feeling that the longer someone is in office, the more positions \nthey have taken and, frankly, the better qualified they are, the more \ncontroversial their nomination probably is. And if you wanted someone \nwith no controversy, the President would find someone to nominate who \nhad virtually no track record to shoot at.\n  The fact is, this Attorney General nominee, this individual, John \nAshcroft, after he is confirmed, will ultimately be judged as Attorney \nGeneral not by any one particular position he will take or any one \nparticular decision he will make.\n  If you look back over the last half a century, look at the Attorneys \nGeneral and look at how history judges them. It is not the day-to-day \ndecisions. It is probably a handful of big decisions to which we look. \nBut even more important than that is probably the perception that we \nhave about what type of person the Attorney General was: How did they \nconduct their office? What kind of respect did they have? Did they \nbring honesty and integrity and courage to that job?\n  The job of Attorney General is different. It is different in many \nrespects than any other Cabinet position. It is different because this \nindividual has to be adviser to the President, has to be able to give \nthe President confidential, good advice. But he or she is more than \nthat. He or she is the person who stands for law enforcement and, in a \nsense, is the chief law enforcement officer of this country.\n  The Attorney General has to be someone who can tell the President yes \nwhen the President needs to be told yes, but also, much more \nimportantly, can look the President in the eye and tell the President \nno when the President has to be told no.\n  The Attorney General is ultimately someone who on certain occasions \nwill disagree with the President. How that person conducts the office \nunder those circumstances may define that person's tenure as Attorney \nGeneral and how history judges that individual. It ultimately comes \ndown to is the person a person of integrity, someone of honesty, \nsomeone of courage, someone who brings honor to the office, someone who \ncares passionately about justice.\n  My experience with John Ashcroft over the last 6 years is that \nclearly he is such an individual. I have not always agreed with John. \nJohn and I have voted differently on certain issues--some high profile; \nsome not so high profile. I don't think that is relevant.\n  What is relevant is, does this President have the right to have his \nnominee--I think he does--and is this a nominee who will conduct the \noffice with integrity and with honesty. I have no doubt that history \nwill judge John Ashcroft in a favorable light. As they look back on his \ntenure as Attorney General of the United States, people will say: I may \nhave agreed with him; I may have disagreed with him on different \nissues. He may not always have been right, but I think he was a man of \nhonesty, a man of goodwill, and he brought honor to the office.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to vote for John Ashcroft, a man \nwho I believe will be a very excellent Attorney General at a time in \nour country's history when we need someone who will carry out the \nduties of that job with all the problems that we face as a country, all \nthe challenges that we have, and who will, in fact, bring the expertise \nthat that particular job needs.\n  I believe John Ashcroft has the experience, has the background, and \nhas the integrity to be a very excellent Attorney General.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for their statements. This is what the Senate is \nsupposed to do on very important issues of the day--deliberate as \ncarefully as possible. We are doing that, and we are doing that very \ncarefully in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of John \nAshcroft to be Attorney General of the United States. I do this with no \nglee or exultation. I do this without any feeling of joy. In fact, I \nbelieve this is a sad day in so many ways. In a certain sense, it is a \nsad day for John Ashcroft and his family. They have been through a lot \nin these past weeks. It is sad because while so many of us have \ndisagreed with John Ashcroft's views and at times we thought his \nmethods were untoward, he has devoted himself to public service, which \nI believe is a noble calling. In the heat of battle, it is not easy for \nthose who speak against him and, certainly for Senator Ashcroft and his \nfamily, to hear people speaking against him.\n  It is a sad day for me because it is never easy opposing a nominee \nand a former colleague. I believe that one gives the President the \nbenefit of the doubt in terms of appointments. It is the President's \nCabinet. He won the election. Yes, it was close. But I said then and \nbelieve every bit as much today that the closeness of the election \nshould do nothing to undermine the legitimacy of the Presidency. I \nexplained that I wanted to give the President his choice. And to have \nto oppose somebody, no less a colleague, is not easy and requires some \nthought and fortitude. So it is a sad day for me as a Senator. It is a \nsad day for the Senate because we are so divided on this nomination.\n  One of the things I have greatly appreciated since moving from the \nother body is the comity that still reigns here to a significantly \ngreater extent than it does in the House and perhaps than it does in \nthe body politic. We still are friends across the aisle. We fight hard. \nBut when we can agree, we are much happier than when we disagree. That \nis the whole tone of the body. The Senator from West Virginia, more \nthan probably any other person here, has made it clear to all of us \nthat is what we aspire to be.\n  It is a sad day when the Senate is so staunchly and strongly divided \nwhen we would all, I think, prefer to be united. I don't believe \ndivision is coming from this side of the aisle. If we were truly \nbipartisan, we all would have supported Senator Ashcroft. No. I believe \nthat when the President nominated Senator Ashcroft, he was well aware \nthat someone of Senator Ashcroft's hard-right views would stir \nopposition, or should stir opposition. I don't accept in any way what \nsome have said--that if this body were truly bipartisan, Senator \nAshcroft would be confirmed 100-0.\n  You could argue that if the President were truly bipartisan, he might \nnot have nominated Senator Ashcroft. For that reason, I think it is a \nsad day for the President. He has, in my judgment, had a good beginning \nto his term. He is reaching out. The message he sent during the \ncampaign that he wished to work with people from both sides of the \naisle in large part has been met, at least in these very early days of \nhis administration.\n  One of my roommates was George Miller, one of the stronger Democrats \nin the House. And he spent some time with the President and is utterly \namazed and pleased with the President's attitude.\n  But this is particularly a sad day for the Presidency because this is \nthe one place, more than any other, in the early morning of his \nadministration where he has sent a nomination that is not, in my \njudgment, one that reaches out to the middle of the country, one that \nsays I do want to be bipartisan.\n  At his inauguration the President said, ``While many of our citizens \nprosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own \ncountry.'' Unfortunately, this choice for Attorney General has given \nmany in our country even more reason to doubt this promise of justice.\n  Finally, it is a sad day for our country. The elections we went \nthrough created a lot of pain for a lot of people. There is a good \nportion of America that feels disenchanted and even\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\ndisenfranchised. This nomination, in my judgment, is the one position \nin the Cabinet where unity and ability to reach out to every part of \nthe American people is called for and, more than any other, this \nnomination, sadly, threw salt on the wounds of those who felt \ndisenfranchised.\n  It is a sad day--a sad day for Senator Ashcroft, a sad day for those \nof us who feel an honor-bound duty to oppose him. It is a sad day for \nthe Senate. It is a sad day for the new President. It is a sad day for \nAmerica.\n  With that said, it is important that we all recognize what the \nopposition to this nomination is not based on. It is not based on \nSenator Ashcroft's religion. It makes no difference whether he be \nChristian, or Jew, or Muslim, or Zoroastrian. His faith is a gift. As a \nperson of faith myself, and a different faith than his, but deep and \nabiding faith, I respect his faith. I think it is a wonderful faith.\n  I think all things being equal, I would like to see a nominee for any \nhigh position in this land hold such a position of faith. But his \nfaith, while it is a wonderful thing, and wonderful for many, respect \nfor his faith does not mean one simply supports him. I wouldn't do that \nfor anybody because of their own personal belief. I think it is unfair \nfor some to say that because of one's faith, one should adopt an issue.\n  As many of my colleagues have said, this is a significant and \nimportant nomination. I think I should give my view of this. It is time \nto set the record straight that those of us who are taking issue with \nSenator Ashcroft's years of activist opposition to causes and ideals in \nwhich we believe so deeply, are basing that on his record as Governor, \nas State attorney general, and as Senator, and, emphatically, not on \nhis religious faith.\n  About a month ago, when the process of this nomination first got \nunderway, there was a lot of anger and even fury in our country. It \ndidn't come from the leaders of a few groups; it came from citizens of \ndifferent walks of life, of different races, of different genders, and \nof different sexual orientation, who, once they became familiar with \nSenator Ashcroft's record, said, How is this man going to be as \nAttorney General?\n  Given the view I stated earlier, I like to give the President the \nbenefit of the doubt and am willing to support Cabinet members with \nwhom I disagree ideologically if nominated by the President.\n  I decided to jot down on a piece of paper what I thought the hearings \nand ultimately the vote on the Ashcroft nomination should really be \nabout. Frankly, I was concerned that with the torrent of opposition \ncharges, countercharges, and a whirlwind of politics, the real issues \non which we should focus would be obscured or consumed by other forces. \nI sat down at my kitchen table in Brooklyn on a Saturday morning and \ntried to formulate what this nomination debate should boil down to, at \nleast in the opinion of one Senator. This is what I wrote:\n\n       We should carefully analyze the functions of the Attorney \n     General and then closely scrutinize Senator Ashcroft's record \n     to determine whether he can fully, impartially, and \n     adequately perform all of those functions. But merely asking \n     if he can do the job is unhelpful. The hearings must probe \n     into the nominee's positions on each of the many different \n     areas of law that the Attorney General must enforce. These \n     range from antitrust and environmental laws to drug and gun \n     laws to hate crimes, voting rights, and clinic protection \n     laws.\n\n  After 3 weeks of statements, questions, answers, hearings, and now \nvotes, I still think this statement cuts to the heart of the matter and \nhas guided me ever since this process began.\n  What are the functions of the Attorney General? And what is the \nAshcroft record? These are the two essential questions.\n  The duties of the Attorney General primarily involve: (1) enforcement \nof all Federal laws, both civil and criminal; (2) litigating the \nconstitutionality of all Federal laws and regulations, including before \nthe Supreme Court; (3) advising the President, the agencies, and even \nCongress on the constitutionality of laws and various federal actions; \n(4) judicial vetting and selection; (5) representing all of the federal \nagencies in litigation; and (6) supervising the U.S. attorneys.\n  This job is the most sensitive and one of the most powerful positions \nin the Cabinet.\n  Importantly, all of these complicated duties require the Attorney \nGeneral to exercise enormous judgment and enormous discretion. Much of \nthe power of the Attorney General adheres in this discretion, which is \nnot constrained by law. Following law, to me at least, isn't enough--\nalthough it is an important threshold question.\n  I think it is fair and reasonable to examine Senator Ashcroft's \npublic positions over the years, as well as how he has exercised the \njudgment and discretion and power vested in him. When we look at that \nrecord--and we did very closely in the hearings--we see a very stark \npicture of a man on a mission, a man who with passion and with zeal \nsought to advocate and enact the agenda of the far right wing of the \nRepublican Party.\n  On civil rights, as Governor he fought voluntary desegregation--that \nis, voluntary desegregation--and vetoed bills designed to boost voter \nregistration in the inner city of St. Louis. More recently, as Senator, \nhe opposed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which would have \nstrengthened the Federal response to hate crimes motivated by race, \ncolor, region, or national origin, and would have extended the law to \ncover crimes targeting gender, sexual orientation, and disability.\n  We all know about the Bob Jones speech and the Southern Partisan \nReview and the Ronnie White debacle. I do not believe John Ashcroft is \na racist. I don't just say that. He has appointed people of color to \njudicial and executive positions. His wife teaches at Howard \nUniversity. But I think when you put all these pieces together, what \nyou see is a pattern of insensitivity to the long and tortured history \nour country has had with race.\n  When several of my colleagues on the committee asked him for some \nfeeling of remorse, given this record, we didn't see any. There wasn't \nany new sensitivity that showed itself.\n  The Attorney General of our country should not be insensitive. He \nshould be just the opposite. The Attorney General, more than any other \nCabinet minister, should be acutely aware and sensitive on the issue of \nrace, which de Tocqueville, over 150 years ago, said would be the one \nthing that would stop America from greatness.\n  I do not believe this nomination for Attorney General meets that \ncriteria.\n  On choice, Senator Ashcroft has been at the helm for decades leading \nthe drive to overturn Roe v. Wade and eviscerate a woman's right to \nchoose. His beliefs are heartfelt; they are sincere. However, in my \njudgment, they are wrong. He has led the charge to enact new abortion \nhurdles and restrictions. I am not saying that Senator Ashcroft should \nbe rejected for being pro-life. I was happy to vote for Tommy Thompson \nto be the Secretary of HHS despite the fact that I disagree with his \nviews on choice. And I believe that a pro-life position is not at all a \ndisqualification for Attorney General, as much as I would prefer to see \nsomeone pro-choice.\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if \nsomeone was nominated for Attorney General who was vehemently pro-\nchoice, who simply did not just espouse a pro-choice position, but in \nhis or her career spent decades trying to find ways of expanding the \nlaw so that, say, abortion on demand, for 9 months, would be perfectly \nlegal, wouldn't Members be more upset and raise a louder voice than \nagainst a nominee who was simply pro-choice? Of course. Thus we who \nbelieve in the pro-choice side say it is not because Senator Ashcroft \nis pro-life that we oppose him but because of the vehemence and extreme \nposition of his views. He hasn't been just anti-choice. He has been one \nof the most outspoken anti-choice crusaders in the country. It is not \nhis belief that abortion is murder that makes me oppose him. It is his \npast willingness to bend and torture the law to serve his desire to \neliminate, totally eliminate, even in rape and incest, a woman's right \nto choose that makes me oppose him.\n\n  This is not simply what he said but what he did when he had executive \npower, when he became the attorney general of Missouri. He didn't \nrelinquish his role of a passionate advocate against choice, as he says \nhe will now do. He joined in a suit against nurses who dispensed \ncontraceptives. He sued\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nthe National Organization of Women under the antitrust laws to muzzle \ntheir attempt to pass the ERA. He tried to pass statutes that end \nabortion. He tried to pass constitutional amendments to do the same.\n  For John Ashcroft, at least when he was Senator, ending abortion by \nany means necessary was the end all and be all of his political career.\n  There was some discussion in the hearings that some of the groups \nopposing this nomination were doing it to raise money and raise their \nprofiles. I resent that. Let me say when you sit down with people in \nthese groups and look them in the eye, what you see is fear, fear that \nwe will start moving back to the days before Roe v. Wade, fear that \nback-alley abortions will again be the norm, fear that equal rights for \nwomen will become a figment of the past. Some may feel these fears are \nunfounded, but the motivation is not mercenary or crass, it is as deep \nand as heartfelt as the speeches I have heard from some of my \ncolleagues supporting Senator Ashcroft.\n  Senator Ashcroft also, Mr. President, has been a leader in the charge \nagainst gun control. He has fought to kill legislation that would have \nmade it easier to catch illegal gunrunners dealing with the issue of \nenforcement. He has vociferously opposed even the child safety locks \nand the assault weapons ban. These were some of the main issues with \nJohn Ashcroft's record that were examined at the Judiciary Committee \nhearings. To be fair, Senator Ashcroft took us on. He directly \nconfronted many of those issues and unequivocally asserted that as \nAttorney General, he would uphold and enforce and defend all the laws \nof the land whether he agreed with them or not.\n  At the start of the hearings, I asked Senator Ashcroft the following \nquestion: When you have been such a zealot and impassioned advocate for \nso long, how can you just turn it off?\n  His answer was: I'll be driving a different car. There's nothing to \nturn off.\n  And our hearings in the committee revolved around this question: \nGiven his past, what kind of future as Attorney General would he have? \nAs I said at the committee vote yesterday, after all these hearings, \nall the witnesses, all the studying of the record, and Senator \nAshcroft's testimony, the conclusion for me is clear. I do not believe \nthat Attorney General Ashcroft can stop being Senator Ashcroft. I am \nnot convinced that he can now step outside the ideological fray he has \nbeen knee-deep in, set his advocacy to one side and become the balanced \ndecisionmaker with an unclouded vision of the law that this country \ndeserves as its Attorney General.\n  Ironically, I don't think Senator Ashcroft disagrees we need a \nbalanced Attorney General. That is why he went to great lengths during \nthe hearing to portray himself as now being different than the Senator \nAshcroft we all knew. He was not saying that someone of such vehement \nand strong opposition, he was not saying that somebody so far to the \nright should be Attorney General, but he was saying he was a different \nperson or would be a different person as Attorney General than he was \nas Senator. Every Senator will have to judge for himself or herself \nwhether he can do that, even if he should want to. I do not think he \ncan. In my opinion, John Ashcroft's unique past will indelibly mark his \nfuture, making his nomination a source of anger and fear to so many in \nthe country.\n\n  I have one other point in this area. John Ashcroft, at least to so \nmany in this country, has had the appearance of not being concerned \nabout these issues, even if you do not agree with the reality. Many \nwould dispute that. They would say the reality is there, too. I would \nmyself. John Ashcroft has the appearance of not being concerned about \nissues of deep concern to these groups: to African Americans, to \nLatinos, to women, to gay and lesbian people. Just the appearance of \nsuch unfairness would make it much harder for him to be Attorney \nGeneral. That ``appearance'' argument to me is not dispositive, but it \nweighs into the mix.\n  Let's assume for a minute, let's just accept on its face the argument \nthat Senator Ashcroft can devote himself solely to the administration \nof existing law. Let's assume he will not challenge Roe--which he did \nsay at the hearing. He said he would not roll back civil rights \nenforcement; he would not do away with the assault weapons ban. This is \nan appealing way to look at the nomination. Our better angels want to \nbelieve this will be the future of the Justice Department.\n  But in reality when you really explore it and don't avoid it, this is \na naive perspective on the powers of the Attorney General. Just saying \nthat Senator Ashcroft will enforce and respect existing law ignores the \nreality that the Attorney General has vast power and discretion to \nshape legal policy in the Federal judiciary, unhindered by any devotion \nto existing law.\n  My good friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, has argued that \nsimply enforcement of the law is enough, and he will give Senator \nAshcroft the benefit of the doubt that he will enforce the law.\n  I would argue, no, that while you certainly give the President the \nbenefit of the doubt in terms of an appointment, ideology has to enter \ninto it because the Attorney General does so many things that are not \nsimply enforcing the law but are rendering opinions in choosing judges, \nareas of discretion. I do not think even if one ascribed to Senator \nFeingold's argument--and I say it with due respect; he is a man of deep \nprinciple and I respect his decision. He argued eloquently in committee \nyesterday, and I know he thought long and hard about it. But even if \nyou assume someone would enforce the law fully, you could never rule \nout ideological disposition. If Bull Connor had been nominated for \nAttorney General, my guess is we would all say, even if we were certain \nhe would enforce existing law, we would be certain he should not be \nAttorney General, based on his past, based on his ideology.\n  Senator Ashcroft is not Bull Connor; he was a bigot. Senator Ashcroft \nis not. But we all have to draw the line at some point. And we all do.\n  It is easy to say ideology will never enter into our decision, voting \nfor a nomination. In reality, that principle is virtually impossible to \nmaintain when given nominees of ideologies to the far side, one way or \nthe other--far left or far right. It is logical because the job of \nAttorney General is not just enforcing the law, as important as that \nis. As I mentioned before, it contains vast discretion. For example, \nthe Attorney General will decide what cases will or will not be pursued \nin the Supreme Court. That is not just following the law.\n\n  He will help draft new legislation and give influential commentary on \nproposals circulating in Congress. That is not just enforcing existing \nlaw.\n  He will, perhaps, be the most significant voice in the country when \nit comes to filling vacancies, particularly on our court of appeals.\n  Regarding the Supreme Court, most of us believe the President, with \nadvice from the Attorney General, will make each decision. But at least \nif the past is prologue, for court of appeal judges, in the vetting \nprocess, the bringing of them forward, the Attorney General has \nenormous say and weight.\n  It is an enormous power. Every one of these is an enormous power. And \nnone of them will be hindered at all by Senator Ashcroft's newfound \ndevotion to existing law.\n  The argument that concerns me the most is the selection of Federal \njudges, or the one of these arguments, because these Federal judges \nwill serve for decades. They often have the last word on some of the \nmost significant issues our society faces. It is safe to expect that \nthe principles that have guided Senator Ashcroft's views on judicial \nnominations in the Senate will be the exact same principles that will \nguide him as Attorney General. This is not ``following the law.''\n  Assuming, arguendo, that we believe Senator Ashcroft will follow \nexisting law in his law enforcement capacity, there is no reason to \nbelieve in this capacity what he did in the Senate will be any \ndifferent than what he does as Attorney General. And, as Attorney \nGeneral, of course, he will have significantly more power and the same \nlargely unbounded discretion in influencing who becomes a Federal \njudge--much more than he did as a Senator. As a Senator, he was willing \nto fully flex his ideological muscle and use power over nominations in \na disturbing and divisive way.\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\n  In my 2 years in the Senate, the Ronnie White vote, led by Senator \nAshcroft's decision to use the Republican caucus to kill the \nnomination, was the bleakest, most divisive and destructive moment I \nhave experienced in my short stay in the Senate. It was a moment \nutterly lacking in--to use our President's words in his inaugural--\ncivility, courage, compassion, and character.\n  But the Ronnie White nomination was just the most visible attempt by \nSenator Ashcroft to kill a nomination. The list goes on and on: \nFletcher, Satcher, Lann Lee, Morrow, Sotomayor, Paez, Dyk, Lynch, \nHormel--and there are others.\n  In just one term in the Senate, Senator Ashcroft devoted himself to \nopposing--and when possible scuttling and derailing--any nominee, no \nmatter how well qualified and respected, who was in some way \nobjectionable to his world view. It is virtually an inescapable \nconclusion that with the new power he would have over the selection of \njudges, Senator Ashcroft would seek out those who agree with his \npassionate views on choice and civil rights, on a separation of church \nand state, and gun control, among other issues, when he reviews judges.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the short article called ``Judicial \nDespotism'' that Senator Ashcroft wrote a few short years ago. This was \nnot something written 25 years ago when he was a young man forming his \nviews. In ``Judicial Despotism,'' he vows to stop any judicial nominee \nwho would uphold Roe v. Wade. Nothing could be more results oriented. \nIn the hearings, Senator Ashcroft said he would be law oriented, not \nresults oriented, but this is as results oriented as it gets.\n\n  If he is confirmed, I pray that more moderate souls prevail in the \nselection of judges. But as it now stands, this nomination poses an \nenormous threat to the future of the Federal judiciary, and I would \noppose the nomination for that reason alone.\n  As I said when I started, this is a sad day--not a day for \nexultation, for happiness, for parades. It is sad when the Nation is \ndivided. It is sad when a man who has served so long is the focal point \nof such intense opposition. It is sad when those of us who want to \nsupport a new President cannot. It is sad when, as a nation, a nation \ntrying to bind itself together, we find salt thrown in those wounds.\n  I just hope, and I believe, that we will have better days to look \nforward to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH.

The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I daresay that each of us has received an enormous \namount of correspondence and a plethora of phone calls about the \nnomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  The favorable correspondence tends to emphasize support for the \nSenator's policy priorities and appreciation of his reputation for \nhonesty and integrity.\n  The unfavorable correspondence tends to emphasize concern about the \nSenator's policy priorities and disapproval of the standards that he \napplied as a United States Senator and in previous offices that he \nheld, but particularly to the standards he applied with regard to the \ndisposition of Presidential nominations.\n  Mr. President, I speak today for myself as a Senator from the State \nof West Virginia, as one who has sworn an oath 16 times to support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies \nforeign and domestic.\n  I have heard arguments pro and con with respect to this nomination. I \nam not here to argue the case at all. I am here merely to express my \nsupport for the nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of \nthe United States. I will not fall out with anyone else who differs \nfrom my views. As I say, I am not here to debate my views. I know what \nmy views are. I am going to state them, and they will be on the record. \nI do not fault anyone else on either side of the aisle or on either \nside of the question. This is for each Senator to resolve in his or her \nown heart and in accordance with his or her own conscience.\n  With respect to that provision in the U.S. Constitution, investing in \nthe U.S. Senate the prerogative, the right, and the duty of advising \nand consenting to nominations, I find no mandate as to what a standard \nmay be. I am not told in that Constitution that I can or cannot apply a \nstandard that is ideological in nature. I have no particular guidance \nset forth in that Constitution except exactly what it says. And I am \nconfident, without any semblance of doubt, that as far as ability is \nconcerned to conduct the office of Attorney General, there can be no \nquestion about Senator John Ashcroft's ability to conduct that office.\n  He has held many offices. He has been a Governor of the State of \nMissouri. He has been a United States Senator. He has been an attorney \ngeneral of the State of Missouri and, as I understand it, he has been \nthe chairman--I may not have the title exactly right--of the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General of the United States. These are very \nimportant offices. They are high offices. They are offices that reflect \nhonor upon the holder thereof.\n  To have been selected for these high offices, John Ashcroft must have \nenjoyed the respect and the confidence of the people of Missouri and of \nhis colleagues, other Attorneys General throughout the United States.\n  I, myself, do consider ideology when I consider a nominee, for this \noffice, Attorney General, and in particular for the offices of Federal \ndistrict judgeships or appellate judgeships, and U.S. Supreme Court \nJudgeships; yes, I do. I apply my own standards of ideology, and lay \nthem down beside the record, if there be such, of a nominee. And I may \nreach a judgment based on ideology.\n  I have no problem with others who want to apply the criterion of \nideology. I have no problem with those who say it should not be \napplied. This is for each Senator to determine.\n  It is our understanding, based on Senator Ashcroft's record, \ncertainly based on news reports, and other sources from which we might \nreach a judgment, that Senator Ashcroft is a conservative. I personally \nhave no problem with that. I consider myself a conservative in many \nways; in some ways a liberal.\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\n  This nomination has been heatedly debated. There have been great and \nstrong passions exhibited. That is all right. I do not have any problem \nwith that. I am glad that Members of the Senate take a matter such as \nthis so seriously. We can feel strongly about these things\n  I happen to be a Senator who believes that when it comes to judges, \nthey ought to be conservative. I think that if there is going to be a \ndepartment of our Government that wishes to be liberal, then that is up \nto the people, if they wish to elect persons with liberal outlooks, \nliberal philosophies, to the U.S. Senate or to the House of \nRepresentatives--the legislative branch. It is up to the people.\n  The Chief Executive may be a liberal; he may be a conservative; or he \nmay be both liberal in one instance, conservative in another. Who knows \nwhat liberal is and what conservative is? The beauty is in the eye of \nthe beholder-- in many instances, certainly. But in my own eye, looking \nat Robert Byrd--and who can see Robert Byrd from within?\n  There is a poem--``Just stand aside and see yourself go by.'' I try \nto look at myself every now and then, especially as I pass the mirror.\n\n       When you get all you want in your struggle for pelf\n       And the world makes you ``King'' for a day\n       Then go to a mirror and look at yourself\n       And see what that guy has to say.\n       For it isn't your father, or mother, or wife\n       Whose judgment upon you must pass\n       The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life\n       Is the [man looking] back from the glass.\n\n  But as I see myself, I consider myself to be a liberal on economic \nmatters, generally; and a conservative on social matters. Newspapers \nindicate that the vehemence of the opposition to this nomination is, in \na measure, for the purpose of sending a ``shot across the bow'' of the \nExecutive, so that in the future when it comes to Supreme Court \nnominations, the President will be very careful not to send up a \nconservative.\n  I do not have a very big gun, but my little shot across the bow would \nbe: Mr. President, send us conservative judges. That is the one \ndepartment of the Government that I think should be conservative. It \nshould not make the laws. It should not consider itself a perpetual and \ntraveling constitutional convention. It should construe the \nConstitution and the laws that the legislature makes.\n  The President was elected as a conservative. He did not get my vote, \nbut he was elected as a conservative. I think that when it comes to the \nappointment of Federal judges, I hope he will nominate conservatives. \nThat is what he ought to do. He told the people he was conservative; \nand they should expect that of him.\n  But entirely aside from that--and this Senator speaks only for \nhimself in this regard--I think appointments to the Federal bench \nshould be of a conservative bent. Judges have no business trying to \nmake the laws.\n  As far as I am concerned, any other Senator may apply his own \nstandards and say whatever he wants to. I only have to answer for one \nperson, and that is the old boy looking back from the glass when I \npause in front of the mirror.\n  I have heard no Senator indicate opposition to the nominee on the \nbasis of the nominee's religion. I have heard none. But there have been \na few little insinuations in some newspapers, in the columns, to the \nextent that part of the opposition to this nominee may be on the basis \nof his being a Christian, his adhering to the Christian religion.\n  Mr. President, I salute the nominee for being someone who has a \nreligion. I think more public officials should have a strong religious \nbent, and should be willing to enunciate their faith, whether it be \nMethodist, Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, Baptist, whatever. That is fine.\n  I am glad that there are people who bring to the realms of government \na religious faith. We need more of that. One does not need to be driven \ninto the closet because he has religious faith. One should not allow \nhimself to be driven in the closet. I do not attempt to foist my faith \non others, but I can listen to any of them when it comes to their \nprayers. I can listen--listen--with respect, and I can hear what they \nsay.\n  I have a son-in-law who is from Iran. He grew up in a family of \ndevout Muslims. Five times a day did my son-in-law's father look toward \nMecca and pray. I could have no better son-in-law, none better. I am \nproud of him. It does not matter to me what a man's religion is. It \nmatters more that he has a religion. It is like the rules of the \nSenate. It does not matter so much what a rule of the Senate is. What \nmatters most is that there be a rule to go by.\n  In this regard, I remember the beginning days of the Continental \nCongress in 1774. That First Continental Congress met on September 5, \n1774. The next day, one of the members--it may have been Cushing or \nClark, Cushing of Massachusetts or Clark of New Jersey--stood to his \nfeet and moved that there be prayer at the beginning of each session. \nJohn Jay, who was an orthodox Congregationalist, objected, as did, I \nbelieve, John Rutledge of South Carolina, objected on the basis that \nthis might cause some dissension, some argumentation, so on.\n  Whereupon Samuel Adams--the real firebrand of the Revolution, along \nwith Patrick Henry--stood to his feet and said: I am no bigot. I can \nhear a prayer by any of them.\n  He, too, was a Congregationalist. I could listen to any of them, \nAdams said. ``I move that Mr. Duche, an Episcopalian clergyman, desired \nto rend prayers to the Congress tomorrow morning.''\n  I feel the same as did Samuel Adams. I can listen to any of them. We \nall stand before one God, and he will be our judge. Whether I am a \nMethodist or Baptist or Episcopalian or Catholic or Jew won't put me at \nthe head of the line. It is my belief in that Creator, the use of my \ntalents as he gave them to me, and my own conscience that will count.\n  I am for Mr. Ashcroft. I praise him, if he has a religion that he is \nwilling to stand up for. I am not suggesting that he is going to use \nthat in one way or the other as he has to deal with problems that will \ncome before him as Attorney General, but I would much rather believe a \nman who puts his hand on that Bible and swears to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and \ndomestic, I would feel safer believing that that individual will adhere \nto his oath than I will have faith in an individual who has no \nmanifestation of religion whatsoever or who has no religion.\n  Here is a man who puts his hand on the Bible, the book our fathers \nand mothers read, and swears an oath before Almighty God and man. When \nhe says that while he was a Senator he enacted laws but when he becomes \nAttorney General he won't enact laws any longer, he will enforce the \nlaws, I should think that it would be cynical not to take that man at \nhis word. What else can we demand? A pound of flesh?\n  I take him at his word. He is a conservative. I am a conservative. He \nmay be to my right on some issues. That is neither here nor there. He \nwill have sworn that he will uphold, support, and defend the \nConstitution, that he will enforce the law as he found it. I shall \nbelieve him.\n  I wonder if Hugo Black would be confirmed by the Senate in today's \npolitical environment. He was confirmed by the United States Senate \nprior to the revelation that he had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. \nHe had already been confirmed before that revelation appeared in the \nHearst papers in 1937. That is the year in which I married my wife, \nErma, 1937. He had already been confirmed.\n  But there was an effort to have the Supreme Court reject him after \nthat information came to light, but the Supreme Court denied that \npetition. I am sure that in light of his past, had it been known when \nthe Senate confirmed him, Hugo Black may never have had the opportunity \nto be the great jurist that he became. So we cannot always look at a \nperson's past and make an accurate judgment. And who am I to look at \nanybody's past? Look at my own. Someone has said that no man's past \nwill bear looking into. I think it is probably true.\n  We are talking here in regard to Mr. Ashcroft's past positions on \nvarious issues. But when he took those positions, he took them not as \nAttorney General of the United States, not as one who enforces the laws \nof the United States.\n  As a legislator now for 54 years, going on 55, I have taken many \ncontroversial positions on issues. I think I would be constitutionally \ncapable of\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\nputting aside my opinions, as I have expressed them in the past--and \nmany of mine have been very strongly expressed--I would be capable, I \nwould like to think, of putting those aside and enforcing the laws of \nthe land without fear or favor, hewing to the line, if called upon to \nbe the Attorney General of the United States. It was never a job I \nwould want. I think Mr. Ashcroft can do that.\n  The Constitution merely states that the President shall appoint \npublic ministers with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  As I say, this is not a specific standard, nor even a mandate to \nreview particular features of the nominee's background or \ncapabilities. Rather, we are enjoined to employ our judgment, a faculty \nwhich--however much we may lament it--focuses on different factors in \nconsidering nominees for different public offices and varies its \napproach in response to the needs of the times. Thus, when it comes to \nour duty to provide advice and consent on Cabinet nominations, we are \nplainly in an area where reasonable minds can differ, not only about \nthe criteria, but even about the proper result given particular \ncriteria. No amount of pressure politics--and no slickly packaged \ntalking points--can alter this fundamental fact.\n\n  I do not subscribe to the view that, barring the taint of criminality \nor dishonesty, the President is entitled to have his nominations \nconfirmed. I do not subscribe to that view. That is not what the \nConstitution says. I do subscribe to the view that law enforcement \nofficials of good will and ability can separate their policy \npreferences from the performance of their official duties.\n  There is a distinct difference between the role of a Senator as the \ndrafter of laws and the role of the Attorney General as the enforcer of \nlaws. Once Senator Ashcroft places his left hand on the Bible and \nswears to uphold the laws of the United States, he will be required to \nenforce even those laws about which he harbors serious reservations. \nNot only that, but given the fact that John Ashcroft is as I said, is \nreputed to be a deeply religious man.\n  I know not whether he is or isn't. I have never been one who has been \nclose to Mr. Ashcroft. I never served on any committee with him. My \nconversations with him have been very, very few.\n  He and I have not voted alike on many occasions. So I don't come here \ntoday supporting Mr. Ashcroft because I know him well, or because we \nhave been bosom friends, or because we served on committees together, \nor even because he is a U.S. Senator. But I believe that that solemn \nvow will be taken seriously by him.\n  I am attempting to discharge my duty under the Constitution. That is \nthe way I see it.\n  Let me quote Senator Ashcroft's own words on that subject: ``As a man \nof faith, I take my word and my integrity seriously,'' he said. ``So, \nwhen I swear to uphold the law, I will keep my oath, so help me God.''\n  What more can I ask? Shall I go behind these words and dig up what he \nmight have written on this subject or that subject? Those who feel \ndifferently may do so. But in this case, all things being considered, I \nhave reason to believe that when he says he is a man of strong \nreligious faith, he means what he says when he takes the oath. I \nbelieve him.\n  During his confirmation hearings, he stated that he understands this \nobligation and fully intends to honor it. For example, he indicated \nthat he ``will vigorously enforce and defend the constitutionality'' of \nthe law barring harassment of patients entering abortion clinics, \ndespite any misgivings he might have about that law.\n  I take him at his word. Although, I do not agree with all of Senator \nAshcroft's views, as I have already indicated, I have no cause to doubt \nSenator Ashcroft's word or his sincerity regarding his fealty to an \noath he will swear before God and man.\n  As far as I am personally concerned, it would be an act of supreme \narrogance on my part to doubt his intention to honor such an oath. I \nwill not prejudge him in such a manner.\n  Given Senator Ashcroft's background, the position to which he has \nbeen nominated, and his assurances to the Senate that he will \nfaithfully uphold the laws of the United States, I believe he should be \nconfirmed.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot said by my Republican friends and \nothers that Senator Ashcroft's nomination is opposed by ``hard left'' \nor ``extremist'' groups who are ``far out of the mainstream'' of \nAmerican politics.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when the roll is called on the \nnomination of John Ashcroft to Attorney General of the United States, I \nwill vote ``no.''\n  The position of Attorney General is not comparable to other Cabinet \npositions. As head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General \nhas enormous independent responsibility and authority, neither of which \nis subject directly to direction by the President.\n  The Attorney General also has enormous discretion in choosing where \nto use the power to prosecute and when to go to court to assert the \nrights of the People. Historically, the Attorney General is the officer \nwho has enforced the Voting Rights Act and the other civil rights laws \nwhich have transformed our nation for the better in the last half \ncentury.\n\n  Given the great power which has been lodged in this office, it is \nimportant that the American people have confidence in the fairness and \nimpartiality of the occupant of that office. It is clear to me that \nmany in our country lack that confidence in John Ashcroft. His past \nactions and statements raise legitimate concerns about how he would \ncarry out the duties of Attorney General. It is those legitimate \nconcerns that lead me to oppose his nomination.\n  What are those concerns?\n  Other Senators have cited actions and statements which they find \nobjectionable. I will mention three.\n  First, the decision to oppose Judge Ronnie White's nomination to the \nU.S. District Court for Missouri. In my view, the decision to oppose \nJudge Ronnie White was both unfortunate and unfair. Judge White's \nrecord and views were distorted in the debate on the Senate floor. \nPerhaps even more disturbing was the way in which Senator Ashcroft \ndetermined to oppose Judge White's nomination. Each of us here in the \nSenate knows that we have ample opportunity to voice objections about \njudicial nominees from our own state long before a nomination ever \nreaches the Senate floor. In the case of Judge White, Senator Ashcroft \nchose to delay serious objection to Judge White until the question came \nbefore the full Senate for debate. During that debate, Judge White, the \nhighest ranking African-American jurist in Missouri, was publicly \nhumiliated. This treatment was anything but fair. It was a sad day in \nthe United States Senate.\n  A second reason for my opposition to Senator Ashcroft's nomination is \nhis implacable opposition to the appointment of Bill Lann Lee to head \nup the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department in the previous \nadministration. Senator Ashcroft's opposition was clearly based on Mr. \nLee's support for upholding the nation's laws as they pertain to \naffirmative action. Mr. Lee testified that he would enforce the Supreme \nCourt's rulings on affirmative action, including those that restricted \naffirmative action. Senator Ashcroft opposed Mr. Lee's nomination, \npresumably because he feared that Mr. Lee would actually uphold the law \nof the land in that regard.\n  The third reason for my vote will be Senator Ashcroft's opposition to \nJames Hormel as President Clinton's choice to be Ambassador to \nLuxembourg.\n  I have never met Mr. Hormel. I was not involved in the committee \ndeliberations on that nomination, but as far as I can determine, Mr. \nHormel was opposed because of his admission that he is gay. No other \ncredible explanation for opposing Mr. Hormel has been offered of which \nI am aware.\n  It is my view that the person entrusted with responsibility to fairly \nand evenhandedly administer the law should not be suspected of \ndiscriminating against any nominee on that basis.\n  Other actions and statements could be cited, but I will stop with \nthose three. They are, in my view, legitimate concerns, and in my view \nthose concerns require a vote against Mr. Ashcroft to be our next \nAttorney General. The position of Attorney General is far too important \nto our Nation. Our Nation is one that needs to be united rather than \nfurther divided at this point in our history. I do not believe he is \nthe right person for this job.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a number of editorials regarding his nomination from the New \nYork Times, USA Today, the Akron Beacon Journal, St. Louis Post-\nDispatch, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 27, 2001]\n\n                           What Ashcroft Did\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Boston.--Even some conservatives are embarrassed now by the \n     way Senator John Ashcroft killed the nomination of Ronnie \n     White to be a federal judge. He told his Republican \n     colleagues that Judge White, of the Missouri Supreme Court, \n     had shown ``a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' It \n     was a baseless smear.\n       But it was not just dirty politics. It was dangerous, in a \n     way that casts doubt on Senator Ashcroft's fitness to be \n     attorney general.\n       Judge White was attacked by Senator Ashcroft because, in 59 \n     capital cases before the Missouri court, he had voted 18 \n     times to reverse the death sentence. In 10 of those 18 the \n     court was unanimously for reversal. Senator Ashcroft hit at \n     cases in which Judge White dissented.\n       For appraisal of Judge White's record in those cases I rely \n     on Stuart Taylor Jr. of The National Journal, a conservative \n     who is widely respected as a legal analyst. He wrote: ``The \n     two dissents most directly assailed by Ashcroft in fact exude \n     moderation and care in dealing with the tension between \n     crime-fighting and civil liberties.''\n       One of the dissents was in a horrifying murder case--the \n     murder, among others, of a sheriff. Mr. Taylor wrote that \n     Judge White's ``conclusion was plausible, debatable, highly \n     unpopular (especially among police) and (for that reason) \n     courageous. For John Ashcroft to call it `pro-criminal' was \n     obscene.''\n       In short, a judge who wrote a thoughtful, reasoned dissent \n     in a murder case was told that it disqualified him for a \n     federal judgeship. Think about what that means for our \n     constitutional system.\n       Judicial independence has been a fundamental feature of the \n     American system for 200 years and more. We rely on judges to \n     enforce the Constitution: to protect our liberties. But a \n     judge who does so in a controversial case is on notice from \n     John Ashcroft that he may be punished. The judge must reject \n     the constitutional claim, however meritorious, or face a \n     malicious smear.\n       There is a slimy feel to Senator Ashcroft's behavior with \n     Judge White. One of the Republicans who voted against the \n     judge at Senator Ashcroft's urging, Arlen Specter of \n     Pennsylvania, told Judge White the other day, ``the Senate \n     owes you an apology.'' Commentators have urged Senator \n     Ashcroft to apologize, but he has refused.\n       That same sense of slipperiness is evident in another \n     matter: Senator Ashcroft's role in blocking the nomination of \n     James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg in 1998. Mr. \n     Hormel is gay. Senator Ashcroft explaining his opposition, \n     said Mr. Hormel ``has been a leader in promoting a \n     lifestyle,'' and that was ``likely to be offensive'' in \n     Luxembourg.\n       But 10 days ago, when Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of \n     Vermont, asked whether he had opposed Mr. Hormel because he \n     is gay, Senator Ashcroft replied, ``I did not.'' Why, then, \n     had he opposed the nomination? Senator Leahy asked.\n       ``Well frankly,'' Senator Ashcroft replied, ``I had known \n     Mr. Hormel for a long time. He had recruited me, when I was a \n     student in college, to go to the University of Chicago Law \n     School [where Mr. Hormel was then an assistant dean]. . . . I \n     made a judgment that it would be ill advised to make him an \n     ambassador based on the totality of the record.''\n       After that testimony, Mr. Hormel wrote Senator Leahy that \n     he had not ``recruited'' Mr. Ashcroft or anyone to Chicago, \n     which needed no recruiting; that he could recall no personal \n     conversation with Mr. Ashcroft then and had not seen him for \n     nearly 34 years. He added that he had asked to talk with \n     Senator Ashcroft in 1998 about the Luxembourg nomination but \n     had gotten no response.\n       Trying now to appear as someone who will act equitably to \n     all, Senator Ashcroft was not man enough to admit that he had \n     opposed Mr. Hormel because of his sexual orientation. He \n     resorted instead to the false suggestion that he was well \n     acquainted with Mr. Hormel over decades and his ``record'' \n     was bad.\n       Supporters of Senator Ashcroft say it is improper to object \n     to him because of his ideolgy--a president should be free to \n     have cabinet members of whatever ideology he chooses. Even \n     with the greatest latitude for\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\n     the cabinet, Senator Ashcroft's extreme-right politics make \n     him a dubious choice for attorney general. But what makes \n     him, finally, unfit for the job is that, in Stuart Taylor's \n     words, ``A character assassin should not be attorney \n     general.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Jan. 26, 2001]\n\n             Ashcroft Rights Record Bears Careful Watching\n\n\n       our view: his testimony said one thing; his record another\n\n       When Senate Democrats forced postponement of a vote \n     Wednesday on a confirmation of John Ashcroft, it was less a \n     victory than a delay of the inevitable. Ashcroft will be \n     attorney general. But whether Ashcroft will perform that \n     office's most vital role--protecting citizens against abuses \n     of power they can't combat themselves--remains very much in \n     doubt.\n       History has shown this to be the most lasting \n     accomplishment of many attorneys general. Herbert Brownell \n     Jr., who served Dwight D. Eisenhower, advised federal \n     intervention when the doors to a Little Rock school were \n     barred to the first black students. As John F. Kennedy's \n     attorney general, Robert Kennedy led the government's fight \n     against racial violence in the South. And most recently, \n     Janet Reno worked to assure women their constitutional right \n     to an abortion free from threat or violence.\n       There will be quick and ample opportunity for a confirmed \n     Ashcroft to show such leadership on everything from voting to \n     abortion rights. But the troubling questions remain: Will the \n     nation get the man of measured views portrayed at his recent \n     confirmation hearings? Or the ferocious ideologue who served \n     in the Senate and as Missouri's attorney general and \n     governor?\n       Ashcroft said all of the right things about being willing \n     to uphold the law. But grudgingly upholding it and actively \n     fighting for it are very different. Ashcroft's long public \n     record raises questions about his commitment, which were \n     enhanced at hearings last week when he distorted, evaded and \n     strained credulity in key areas, particularly civil rights:\n       Fighting integration. Ashcroft has shown no inclination to \n     fight for civil rights and indeed battled for years against a \n     voluntary St. Louis busing plan that grew out of a lengthy \n     court case. Assertions at last week's hearings that he favors \n     integration were undercut when he twisted his own record.\n       Ashcroft told senators that Missouri was not a party to the \n     desegregation lawsuit, that it was ``found guilty of no \n     wrong'' and that when ``the court made an order, I followed'' \n     it. All distortions. The state was sued in 1977, Ashcroft's \n     first full year as attorney general. Judges repeatedly found \n     state officials liable, once calling them ``primary \n     constitutional wrongdoers.'' A federal judge threatened \n     contempt proceedings against the state for defying orders. \n     And in 1984, another judge wrote, ``if it were not for the \n     state of Missouri and its feckless appeals, perhaps none of \n     us would be here.''\n       Meanwhile, according to news accounts, Ashcroft rode the \n     case to higher office: He bragged about his unbridled \n     opposition and the threatened contempt citation. And he ran a \n     scathing TV ad suggesting that a GOP primary opponent was too \n     soft on busing.\n       Insensitivity on race. Ashcroft's Missouri history doesn't \n     mean he's an overt racist. Money was at issue as well as \n     integration in the St. Louis case. But he certainly seems \n     indifferent to minority concerns. Given ample opportunity to \n     explain his acceptance of an honorary degree from Bob Jones \n     University, a bastion of racial bias, and his praise for a \n     neo-Confederate magazine, Ashcroft offered limp evasions. He \n     ``should do more due diligence'' on the magazine, he said, \n     and he'll continue to speak at places here he can ``unite \n     people.'' That doesn't sound like a man who would use the \n     power of his office to fight racial bias.\n       Ideology over justice. Ashcroft, who ferociously opposed \n     several Clinton nominees with whom he differed ideologically, \n     displayed no better sense of fairness even as he sought \n     Senate approval.\n       He repeated his harsh attack on an African-American \n     Missouri Supreme Court judge, whom he had labeled ``pro-\n     criminal.'' Ashcroft torpedoed the judge's 1999 nomination to \n     the federal bench even though the judge voted to uphold 70% \n     of the death sentences he reviewed. Also, Ashcroft evaded \n     specific questions about opposition to Clinton nominee James \n     Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. According to news \n     accounts, Ashcroft criticized Hormel, a gay businessman, for \n     supporting ``the gay lifestyle.''\n       Presidents get, and in most cases deserve, wide latitude to \n     pick a top team that reflects their philosophy, but that \n     comes with a price: They bear responsibility for their \n     appointees' actions. President Bush, who can't afford to \n     offend minority voters by abandoning civil rights, may hold \n     tight rein on the Justice Department. Moreover, much will \n     depend on those named to key jobs just below attorney \n     general, particularly the department's civil rights chief. \n     Those nominees deserve particular scrutiny.\n       Ashcroft himself faces several early tests of his \n     commitment to fairness. He'll decide whether the U.S. \n     government pursues allegations of voter discrimination in \n     Florida in the presidential election. He'll help determine \n     whether race has been used wrongly to draw new congressional \n     districts nationwide. He'll play a major role in picking new \n     federal judges and potentially Supreme Court justices. And \n     he'll influence the nation's stand on future restrictions on \n     abortion and on the use of race in government hiring and \n     college admissions.\n       If Ashcroft indulges ideology over fairness, Bush will \n     surely pay the price. But so, too, would Americans who most \n     need the law's protection. That would be the real tragedy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Akron Beacon Journal, Jan. 24, 2001]\n\n  The President's Man--The Ugly Story of the Ronnie White Nomination \n      Reveals What a Disappointing Choice George W.

Bush.\n       A president deserves to surround himself with Cabinet \n     officers and advisers in whom he has confidence. That is part \n     of even the slenderest mandate a president may win. It \n     ensures that responsibility for an administration falls on \n     the person who occupies the Oval Office.\n       Those who've described the confirmation hearings on the \n     Ashcroft nomination as among the toughest ever forget the \n     raucous sessions over Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork, to \n     name just two. The politics involved have been plain. The \n     president hoped to reassure arch conservatives with his \n     choice. Liberal interest groups have kept their own lists, \n     noting the performance of Democratic allies in the Senate.\n       All of the clatter might have been dismissed as business as \n     usual until Ronnie White, the first black man to sit on the \n     Missouri Supreme Court, testified at the confirmation \n     hearing. Bill Clinton appointed White to a position on the \n     federal district court. In 1999, Sen. Ashcroft, a fellow \n     Missourian, almost singlehandedly defeated the White \n     nomination, and the way he did so raises questions about his \n     judgment.\n       Ashcroft misled his colleagues. He rallied law enforcement \n     organizations to oppose the White nominations, all the while \n     leaving the impression they had come forward on their own. He \n     grossly distorted the White record, describing the judge as \n     ``pro-criminal'' and ``with a tremendous bent toward criminal \n     activity.'' He painted the portrait of a judge determined to \n     reverse death sentences.\n       In truth, White voted to uphold the death penalty in 41 of \n     59 cases before the Missouri high court. He sided with the \n     majority in 53 of those cases. Ashcroft defended his \n     opposition last week, arguing that he considered the \n     ``totality'' of the judge's record. If anything, that record, \n     as White quietly and powerfully made obvious, has reflected \n     sound reasoning and a dedication to the law (as many police \n     groups acknowledge).\n       Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, felt the \n     duty to apologize to White for the way he had been treated. \n     The judge framed the issue of Ashcroft's nomination: ``The \n     question for the Senate is whether these misrepresentations \n     are consistent with the fair play and justice that you all \n     would require of the U.S. attorney general.''\n       The White nomination doesn't tell the entire story of John \n     Ashcroft. As a former state attorney general, governor and \n     senator, he is highly qualified to lead the Department of \n     Justice. He has governed from the center and with integrity, \n     enforcing the law whether he has agreed with its direction or \n     not.\n       His zealotry has also been front and center. He has yet to \n     explain clearly his opposition to James Hormel to be \n     ambassador to Luxembourg, except to suggest that he was \n     offended because the nominee was gay. He persisted in playing \n     racial politics with a lengthy school desegregation case in \n     St. Louis.\n       The Ashcroft record raises the question: Why didn't George \n     W. Bush nominate someone else to be attorney general, someone \n     who better reflected the themes of his inaugural address, \n     conservative, yes, but far less polarizing and tempted by \n     expediency? Fair play? Justice? John Ashcroft is the \n     president's man.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 25, 2001]\n\n                         A Question of Fitness\n\n\n                            attorney general\n\n       John D. Ashcroft has spent the better part of his political \n     career at odds with core values of the Constitution--\n     equality, religious freedom, judicial independence and \n     individual autonomy. Now he is nominated to be the people's \n     guardian of those values. The conflict between his record and \n     the duties of the office raises serious questions as to \n     whether John Ashcroft should be confirmed as attorney \n     general.\n       Disagreeing with Mr. Ashcroft is not reason enough to \n     oppose him. Presidents are entitled, generally, to their pick \n     of Cabinet members. if Mr. Ashcroft were the nominee for \n     secretary of agriculture there would be no problem. But the \n     attorney general vets federal judges, enforces civil rights \n     laws, safeguards the reproductive rights of women and \n     determines the legal position of the United States.\n       Can Mr. Ashcroft fairly vet federal judges when he believes \n     the judiciary is full of ``renegade judges'' who have created \n     a ``judicial tyranny'' where courts are ``nurseries for\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\n     vice?'' Can he guard judicial independence when he has \n     repeatedly denied judgeships for political reasons? Can he \n     enforce the civil rights laws when he has doggedly fought \n     school desegregation, affirmative action and gay rights? Can \n     he protect women seeking abortions when he considers abortion \n     murder?\n       John Ashcroft is indisputably a man of principle. The \n     problem is those principles put him at odds with the \n     Constitution, with contemporary notions of equality and with \n     the mainstream of the American public.\n\n\n                         judicial independence\n\n       Judicial independence is the rock that anchors our \n     judiciary. But Mr. Ashcroft has undermined independence with \n     his attacks on judicial nominees.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's hostility to judicial independence is an \n     important lesson of the much-told story about his opposition \n     to Ronnie White as a federal judge. Mr. Ashcroft may have \n     been motivated by a feud with Mr. White over abortion policy. \n     But by basing his attack on Judge White's death penalty \n     decisions, Mr. Ashcroft sent a chill through the ranks of \n     state judges hoping to be promoted to the federal bench. Mr. \n     Ashcroft said Mr. White was ``pro-criminal'' because he had \n     voted to overturn death sentences. In fact, Mr. White had \n     upheld 35 of the 55 death sentences.\n       Mr. Ashcroft focused on Judge White's lone dissent to the \n     conviction of James R. Johnson in the gruesome murder of a \n     sheriff, two sheriff's deputies and a sheriff's wife. Judge \n     White spoke of his ``horror at this carnage'' and said \n     Johnson ``deserved to die'' if he was not insane. But he \n     concluded that Johnson's lawyer was so incompetent that he \n     had not received effective counsel.\n       A lone dissent in the case that arouses such public passion \n     is the essence of judicial independence. Charles Blackmar, a \n     retired Supreme Court judge, called Mr. Ashcroft's attack \n     ``tampering with the judiciary.''\n       Mr. White is not a perfect man, nor is he the nation's \n     keenest jurist. But he upheld the highest values of a judge \n     in his dissent. Will Mr. Ashcroft reject for the federal \n     bench those judges with the temerity to overturn a death \n     sentence?\n       Mr. Ashcroft's record in Missouri raises similar questions. \n     Judicial nominees say that Mr. Ashcroft asked them their \n     views about abortion before deciding whether to nominate \n     them.\n\n\n                              civil rights\n\n       Mr. Bush says that Mr. Ashcroft ``has a strong civil rights \n     record.'' As evidence he cites Mr. Ashcroft's appointment of \n     eight African-Americans to Missouri judgeships, a past \n     commendation from the Mound City Bar Association, an \n     endorsement by the Limelight newspaper, his support of \n     Lincoln University and his signing of bills honoring Martin \n     Luther King and establishing Scott Joplin's home as a \n     historic site.\n       The appointment of eight black judges is a substantive \n     accomplishment. The rest is resume padding. Mr. Ashcroft was \n     only marginally involved in the Scott Joplin house. The \n     Limelight is a free, marginal publication, by no means the \n     largest or most influential African-American newspaper in St. \n     Louis. The Mound City Bar Association, a black lawyers' \n     group, does not support Mr. Ashcroft because of the \n     ``insidious'' way he killed Mr. White's nomination.\n       The actual Ashcroft civil rights record is weak and \n     regressive. As state attorney general he denied that the St. \n     Louis schools were segregated. He lobbied members of the \n     Reagan Civil Rights Division to switch sides in the St. Louis \n     school desegregation case, and eventually became the \n     desegregation plan's chief opponent.\n       That plan offered responsible politicians the chance to \n     support phased, voluntary desegregation. But Mr. Ashcroft \n     insisted on calling it ``mandatory busing'' and leveled a \n     devastating anti-busing TV ad at his opponents in the 1984 \n     governor's race. U.S. District Judge William L. Hungate \n     summed up Mr. Ashcroft's behavior as ``feckless,'' saying he \n     ``voluntarily rode (the desegregation) bus to political \n     prominence.''\n       In 1997 Mr. Ashcroft led the opposition to Bill Lann Lee, \n     the Asian-American head of the Civil Rights Division. First, \n     he distorted Mr. Lee's position on affirmative action, saying \n     he favored quotas. Then, he said Mr. Lee should be rejected \n     for holding a position at odds with the Supreme Court's, when \n     in fact Mr. Lee favored affirmative action in limited cases \n     where the Supreme Court said it could be used.\n       In 1999 Mr. Ashcroft accepted an honorary degree from Bob \n     Jones University, a fundamentalist Christian college that \n     banned interracial dating until last March. Mr. Ashcroft's \n     claim that he did not know about the university's \n     discriminatory policies stretches credulity. The college's \n     tax exempt status was a huge controversy during the Reagan \n     administration.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's civil rights record raises serious doubts \n     about his commitment to ``equal protection'' under the law--a \n     seed of liberty scarified by the flames of the Civil War and \n     brought to fruition by the civil rights movement.\n\n\n                     women and reproductive freedom\n\n       Mr. Bush says Mr. Ashcroft ``has a solid record'' on \n     women's issues, citing his appointment of Ann Covington to \n     the Missouri Supreme Court and his support for money to \n     combat violence against women.\n       But the Women's Political Caucus ranked Mr. Ashcroft last \n     in the nation for appointing women while he was governor of \n     Missouri. As Missouri's attorney general, he opposed the \n     Equal Rights Amendment. When the National Organization for \n     Women boycotted Missouri for opposing the amendment, he \n     stretched antitrust laws to sue the group.\n       In every office that he has held, Mr. Ashcroft has fought \n     abortion. He supported a Human Life Amendment even before Roe \n     v. Wade. In his view, Roe and its ``illegitimate progeny have \n     occasioned the slaughter of 35 million innocents.''\n       As Missouri's attorney general, he personally sought to \n     limit abortion in an argument to the Supreme Court. As \n     governor, he signed the law that led to the 1989 Supreme \n     Court decision that came within one vote of overturning Roe. \n     Mr. Ashcroft has said his top priority is the Human Life \n     Amendment; it would only allow an abortion to save the life \n     of the mother. There would be no exception for rape or \n     incest. Nor could states pass laws permitting abortion. Its \n     tenet that life begins at conception raises questions about \n     the legality of birth control pills, IUDs and the abortion \n     drug RU-486, which Mr. Bush may also seek to restrict.\n       Mr. Ashcroft has supported a partial birth abortion bill \n     that does not include an exception for the health of the \n     mother, even though the Supreme Court says that exception is \n     required.\n       Mr. Bush says he does not think the nation is ``ready'' to \n     overturn Roe and says he will focus on bills such as one \n     outlawing partial birth abortion. Mr. Bush and Mr. Ashcroft \n     have also said they will uphold the law protecting women's \n     access to abortion clinics. But Mr. Ashcroft would have ample \n     room as attorney general to advocate positions that would \n     undermine Roe. And he could help pick Supreme Court justices \n     who would read it out of the Constitution.\n\n\n                           religious freedom\n\n       Organized prayer in the public schools is unconstitutional. \n     The First Amendment says the government can't tell us when or \n     how to worship. Yet Mr. Ashcroft has long supported organized \n     school prayer. He also supports school vouchers, as does Mr. \n     Bush, that would direct large sums of public money to church \n     schools. As attorney general, Mr. Ashcroft would have the \n     lead role in developing the administration's legal arguments \n     in favor of vouchers. His opposition to four decades of \n     Supreme Court decisions raises questions as to whether he \n     believes in the boundary between church and state.\n       Perhaps, in several hours of testimony before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee this week, Mr. Ashcroft can explain why \n     the nation should not feel uneasy with his stewardship of \n     values and principles at war with his own. Perhaps he can \n     reassure the American people that he will enforce principles \n     he has spent a quarter of a century--his entire career in \n     public life--fighting. But how could a man swear to uphold \n     constitutional values he rejects, without betraying his own \n     core beliefs? And who would place his trust in a man willing \n     to do so?\n       Mr. Ashcroft should certainly have a chance to explain how. \n     But if Mr. Bush wanted a uniter, not a divider, he has the \n     wrong man at Justice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Jan. 24, 2001]\n\n  Ashcroft: Still No--Senate Hearings Don't Alter the Case Against Him\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote as early as today \n     on the nomination of former Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft to be \n     U.S. attorney general. Before last week's hearings by the \n     committee, the Post-Gazette suggested that Mr. Ashcroft was \n     the wrong man for the job. Nothing that transpired in the \n     hearings changed our view.\n       It is true that Mr. Ashcroft, who was nominated by \n     President Bush as a gesture to religious conservatives, \n     assured senators he would enforce laws he didn't agree with. \n     He even made a specific commitment not to seek a reversal of \n     Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion, which he called \n     ``settled law.''\n       Almost four years ago, in a lecture to the Heritage \n     Foundation, Mr. Ashcroft had a different description of the \n     high court's abortion rulings. Referring to a 1992 decision \n     reaffirming Roe vs. Wade, he complained that in that ruling \n     ``the Supreme Court challenged God's ability to mark when \n     life begins and ends.'' In the same lecture, he echoed a \n     familiar conservative critique of what he called ``appalling \n     judicial activism.''\n       As we observed before, the question is not whether Mr. \n     Ashcroft can put aside his history of being an extreme critic \n     of the federal courts and of some of the statutes and court \n     decisions he will have to enforce. The question is why the \n     Senate should force him to perform the intellectual \n     contortions that transformation would require.\n       In raw political terms, it made sense for George W. Bush, \n     who received significant support from the religious right in \n     his election campaign, to make what one of his aides called a \n     ``message appointment'' that would please that constituency. \n     Senators who see the world differently--like Pennsylvania's \n     Arlen Specter--are under not obligation to follow suit by \n     confirming Mr. Ashcroft.\n       Yet Mr. Specter went on record early saying he would \n     support Mr. Ashcroft ``unless something extraordinary'' \n     developed in the confirmation hearings. Predictably, no such \n     ``smoking gun'' materialized. Moreover, the witness Ashcroft \n     opponents had most counted on, Missouri Supreme Court Judge \n     Ronnie White, while eloquent, was in some ways a \n     disappointment. Judge White, an African American, declined an \n     opportunity to impute\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\n     racism to then-Sen. Ashcroft's disgraceful derailment of his \n     nomination to the federal bench.\n       But the issue wasn't whether Mr. Ashcroft is a racist. It \n     was that he unfairly distorted Judge White's record by \n     branding him as ``pro-criminal.'' That charge is more \n     understandable in the context of Mr. Ashcroft's general \n     attitude toward judges he considers appalling activists and \n     subverters of the divine will.\n       There is no need to impugn Mr. Ashcroft's integrity or his \n     legal skills to oppose his nomination. Unlike other Cabinet \n     officers, the attorney general is beholden not just to the \n     president who appoints him but also to a body of law that, in \n     many respects, is uncongenial to John Ashcroft but vital to \n     women, minorities and other Americans who find his \n     demonization of the courts bizarre.\n       It was symbolism that led President Bush to nominate Mr. \n     Ashcroft; senators who are uncomfortable with that \n     symbolism--Arlen Specter among them, we hope--should reject \n     the nomination.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since we have a lull, I will take a few \nmoments to make some points I think need to be made in light of some of \nthe statements that have been made. We have been placing matters in the \nRecord all day, and hopefully people will read the Record and realize \nsome of the arguments that have been made are not only inconsequential \nbut really not right.\n  Let me rise today to address some of the most common criticisms \ndirected against Senator Ashcroft.\n  Certain allegations have surfaced again and again, and they \nmisrepresent Senator Ashcroft's record and personal character. I will \naddress some of the most invidious of these charges.\n  The primary criticism cited by my colleagues in opposition to Senator \nAshcroft are his involvement with school desegregation and his actions \ntaken against the nominations of Ronnie White and Bill Lann Lee.\n  First, let me address the criticisms made against Senator Ashcroft's \nrole in the school desegregation cases in St. Louis and Kansas City. \nThere has been a significant distortion of his role in these cases and \nthere are some things that I would like to make clear.\n  First, John Ashcroft supports integration. He is not against \ndesegregation and said so repeatedly during the four days of hearings \nand in response to numerous written questions on the subject. Senator \nAshcroft testified, ``I have always opposed segregation. I have never \nopposed integration. I believe that segregation is inconsistent with \nthe 14th amendment's guarantee of equal protection. I supported \nintegrating the schools.'' Senator Ashcroft is deeply committed to \ncivil rights and has stated that he intends to make this one of his top \npriorities if confirmed as Attorney General.\n  Second, all of Senator Ashcroft's actions with regard to \ndesegregation occurred in his role as attorney general, as the legal \nrepresentative of the State of Missouri. As the State attorney general \nhe was required to defend the interest of the State, his client. The \nState opposed voluntary desegregation because it would lead to \nincredible costs for the State--estimates put the total cost of \ndesegregation at an incredible $1.8 billion to the State. To put this \nin perspective, Missouri's fiscal year 2001 budget is $17 billion. At \nthat time it was much less. In other words, he wanted to prevent, as \ndid virtually everybody in government, a judicial raid on the state \ntreasury, something that all of us ought to be concerned about.\n  Indeed, the combined costs of the St. Louis and Kansas City \ndesegregation plans have been higher than the costs of desegregation in \nall the other states combined, with the exception of California. \nMoreover, the way the plan was structured most of the money was \nfunneled to the white suburbs. In 1996, when the total cost of the \nprogram was $1.3 billion, only between $100 and $200 million went to \nthe St. Louis schools. That doesn't sound like desegregation to me. Yet \nthat is what these liberals have been arguing for.\n  The results of these court-ordered remedies have been truly \nunimpressive. For instance, test scores actually went down from 1990 to \n1995. Scores on the Stanford Achievement Test went from 36.5 to 31.1 at \na time when the national mean was 50. It doesn't sound like very good \ndesegregation to me. The graduation rate has remained around an abysmal \n30 percent. And as far as actual desegregation, the percentage of \nAfrican-American students in the St. Louis schools has remained almost \nidentical to what it was when the plan started, about 80 percent.\n  Yet our liberal friends, both in this body and in the outside groups, \nwould have you believe Senator Ashcroft is doing a terrible thing \nagainst desegregation and against integration. And they just plain \ndon't accept his very honest statements that he has always been for \ndesegregation and for integration. He has never spoken against them.\n  It has been suggested that then-Attorney General Ashcroft's lack of \nenthusiasm for this plan demonstrates insensitivity toward the needs of \nthe students in St. Louis.\n  It has been suggested that then-Attorney General Ashcroft's lack of \nenthusiasm for this plan demonstrates insensitivity toward the needs of \nthe students in St. Louis. But given these unimpressive results and \nextraordinary costs, I think it seems perfectly understandable that \nmany State officials from both political parties have consistently had \ndoubts about this plan. Indeed, Senator Ashcroft's democratic successor \nas attorney general took the same position on behalf of the State of \nMissouri.\n  Third, some of my colleagues have charged that Senator Ashcroft \nmisrepresented his involvement with the desegregation cases. This is \nalso a significant distortion of Senator Ashcroft's responses to a \nflurry of questions. The Missouri school desegregation cases are \nextremely complex and involve a variety of different factual and \nconstitutional issues. Perhaps Senator Ashcroft made some preliminary \nstatements that were incomplete, but when questioned further, he \nclarified his answers. Moreover, in an extended response to a written \nquestion, he fully detailed Missouri's liability and involvement with \nthe case.\n  Senator Ashcroft has acknowledged that the State was found liable for \ndesegregation. However, the State was found liable only for an intra-\ndistrict violation, that is a violation in the one district of St. \nLouis. The State was never at any time adjudged liable for an intra-\ndistrict violation involving the St. Louis suburbs--this is the bottom \nline of a long and somewhat murky legal record.\n  The fact that Missouri was never found to have committed an \ninterdistrict violation is easily proved. Consider that throughout 1981 \nand 1982 the parties and the court were preparing for a trial on the \nvery question of interdistrict liability. It goes without saying that a \ntrial on the point would have been unnecessary if liability had already \nbeen determined.\n  In fact there was never a trial on the interdistrict liability. This \ntrial was averted because the suburban schools and the St. Louis Board \nof Education agreed to a consent decree. In fact, this settlement was \nhastened when the district court announced that it would have to \nconsolidate city and county school districts if at trial liability is \nproved of an interdistrict violation. The threat of consolidating \nsuburban and city school districts was enough to prompt the city and \ncounty to reach a settlement agreement, an agreement to which the State \nwas not a party. The consent decree entered by the district court did \nnot contain the necessary finding of liability for an interdistrict \nviolation. Thus, a settlement was reached in which the State was \nrequired to pay for an inter-district remedy between the city and \ncounty although it had never been found liability of an inter-district \nviolation.\n  Missouri's arguments on appeal against the district court's order had \na strong legal basis. The Supreme Court had previously held in Milliken \nthat a district court must find an interdistrict violation before it \ncan order an interdistrict remedy. Indeed, such a remedy must also be \nnarrowly tailored to fit only the particular constitutional violation. \nThere was no finding of liability here, much less a determination by \nthe court that the settlement met constitutional requirements.\n\n  Moreover, the State did not willfully refuse to comply with the \ndistrict court's orders. What the district court ordered was for the \nparties to the litigation to enter into a voluntary plan for \ninterdistrict transfers of students to suburban schools. But such a \nplan was an impossibility because the suburban school districts were \nnecessary parties who were not before the court. No satisfactory plan \nwas likely to be\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\nproduced under those circumstances. Indeed, no successful plan was \nproduced until the suburban schools were joined and threatened by the \ndistrict court directly with being placed by the court into the same \nschool district as the city schools.\n  The district court did criticize the State, but it did not hold the \nState in contempt. Probably because the court realized that it had \nessentially ordered the State and other defendants to perform an \nimpossibility.\n  Finally, Senator Ashcroft has been criticized for being overly \nlitigious in the desegregation cases. But an electronic search reveals \nthat Senator Ashcroft was actually the least litigious of the attorneys \ngeneral who represented the State during any significant portion of \nthis litigation. During the 8 years that John Ashcroft was attorney \ngeneral, there are 18 entries relating to this case.\n  By comparison, during the 8 years William Webster was attorney \ngeneral, there are 34 entries. And during the 7 years that Jay Nixon, a \ndemocrat, was attorney general, there are 22 entries.\n  Then-Attorney General Ashcroft did bring several appeals to the \ndistrict court's action. But this is understandable given that the \ncourts never found the State liable for an inter-district violation. A \nvery key point, by the way. Senator Ashcroft's position on behalf of \nthe State was eventually vindicated in the Kansas City school \ndesegregation litigation. That line of cases culminated in Missouri \nversus Jenkins--in which the Supreme Court held that an interdistrict \nviolation is required before a Federal court can impose interdistrict \nremedies.\n  In sum, Senator Ashcroft was a faithful advocate for the State of \nMissouri. He defended the interests of all state taxpayers through a \nseries of legally justified appeals. The legal theories he advanced on \nbehalf of the State were eventually vindicated by the Supreme Court. As \nMissouri attorney general he supported improved educational \nopportunities for children, not the failed and extremely expensive \ncourt-ordered remedies developed by the district court. Senator \nAshcroft's actions contesting the details of a complicated court-\nordered busing scheme does not mean that he opposed segregation. Quite \nto the contrary, Senator Ashcroft opposes segregation and supports \nintegration, and he represented his client the State in good faith.\n  Some remarks have been made about some of the judge's crusty remarks. \nFor those of us who have been in litigation before the Federal courts, \nwe are kind of used to those crusty remarks from time to time. Frankly, \nbecause one single Federal judge of the approximately 800 district and \nFederal judges in this country makes a crusty remark, that should not \nbe interpreted as condemnation of John Ashcroft or any other litigant \nbefore the court, nor was there any indication of any kind of censure \nby the court or contempt proceedings. As a matter of fact, it did not \nhappen. Yet there have been allusions here on the floor that there \nshould have been contempt proceedings. Come on, the law is pretty \nclear. This has been distorted. It is really offensive to have it \ndistorted in a way that flies in the way of true civil rights, a man \nwho basically has stood up for civil rights throughout his lifetime.\n  Another topic that has been brought up again and again is Senator \nAshcroft's opposition to Judge Ronnie White. Mr. President, I am \nconcerned that some of my colleagues continue to denigrate Senator \nAshcroft for his involvement in the nomination of Judge Ronnie White. \nIt has been said that Senator Ashcroft distorted Judge White's record \nand wrongly painted him as pro-criminal and antilaw enforcement.\n  But there were many reasons to vote against confirmation for Judge \nWhite. In fact, every Republican did so. I have reviewed Judge White's \nrecord and several of his dissenting opinions in death penalty cases, \nand I can understand Senator Ashcroft's opposition to Judge White's \nnomination to the Federal bench.\n  For instance in the Johnson case, the defendant was convicted on four \ncounts of first-degree murder for killing three officers and the wife \nof the sheriff. Johnson was sentenced to death on all counts. On \nappeal, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the decision, but Judge White \ndissented arguing for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of \ncounsel. Judge White thought that Johnson deserved further opportunity \nto present a defense based on post-traumatic stress disorder. But the \nmajority showed that there was no credible evidence that Johnson \nsuffered from this disorder. Rather, it was clear that defense counsel \nhad fabricated a story that was quickly disproved at trial. For \ninstance, defense counsel stated that Johnson had placed a perimeter of \ncans and strings and had deflated the tires of his car. At trial, \ntestimony revealed that police officers had taken these actions, not \nthe defendant.\n  Further, Congressman Kenneth Hulshof, the prosecutor in the Johnson \ncase testified at Senator Ashcroft's hearings that it was almost \nimpossible to make out an argument for ineffective assistance of \ncounsel because the defendant ``hired counsel of his own choosing. He \npicked from our area in mid-Missouri what . . . I referred to as a \ndream team.''\n  Judge White has every right to pen a dissent in Johnson and other \ncases involving the death penalty. Similarly, every Senator has the \nduty to evaluate these opinions as part of Judge White's judicial \nrecord. And that's just what Senator Ashcroft did. At no time did \nSenator Ashcroft derogate Judge White's background.\n  I consider Judge White to be a decent man with an impressive personal \nbackground. He has accomplished a great deal and came up from humble \nbeginnings. But his record of dissenting in death penalty cases was \nsufficiently troubling to cause Senator Ashcroft and others to oppose \nthe nomination.\n  Some of our colleagues have impugned Senator Ashcroft's motives for \nvoting against Judge White. But Judge White's nomination was strongly \nopposed by many of Senator Ashcroft's constituents and also by major \nlaw enforcement groups, including the National Sheriffs' Association \nand the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs.\n  Sheriff Kenny Jones, whose wife and colleagues were killed by Johnson \ntestified:\n\n       I opposed Judge White's nomination to the federal bench, \n     and I asked Senator Ashcroft to join me because of Judge \n     White's opinion on a death penalty case . . . In his opinion, \n     Judge White urged that Johnson be given a second chance at \n     freedom. I cannot understand his reasoning. I know that \n     the four people killed were not given a second chance.\n\n  Finally, some of my colleagues have alleged that Senator Ashcroft's \nopposition to Judge White was underhanded and done with stealth. Well, \nSenator Ashcroft voted against Judge White's nomination in committee. \nHe expressed his disapproval at that time. If he had held up the \nnomination in committee without allowing it to proceed to the floor he \nwould have been criticized for delay.\n  Indeed, Senator Boxer pleaded during a debate about several judges \nincluding Ronnie White:\n\n       I beg of you, in the name of fairness and justice and all \n     things that are good in our country, give people a chance. If \n     you do not think they are good, if you have a problem with \n     something they said or did, bring it down to the floor. We \n     can debate it. But please do not hold up these nominees. It \n     is wrong. You would not do it to a friend.\n\n  Thus, Senator Ashcroft was between a rock and a hard place as how to \nraise his legitimate concerns about Judge White.\n  Senator Ashcroft is a man of tremendous integrity, one of the most \nqualified nominees for Attorney General that we have ever seen. His \nopposition to Judge White was principled and in keeping with the proper \nexercise of the constitutional advice and consent duty of a Senator. I \nregret that we have needed to revisit this issue at such great length.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me address one final issue that continues to \ncome up. Some critics of Senator Ashcroft have stated that he distorted \nBill Lann Lee's record when he was nominated to head the Civil Rights \nDivision. But this is simply not the case. Mr. Lee had a noted record \nof promoting and preserving race-conscious policies of questionable \nconstitutionality. Opposition to Mr. Lee was not limited to Senator \nAshcroft--nine Republicans on the Judiciary Committee opposed this \nnominee, including myself.\n  Let me say that I have the highest personal regard for Mr. Lee and \nthe difficult circumstances in which his family came to this country, \nworked hard, and realized the American dream.\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\n  Despite this high personal regard, I was deeply concerned about Mr. \nLee's nomination because much of his career was devoted to preserving \nconstitutionally suspect race-conscious public policies that ultimately \nsort and divide citizens by race. At the time of his hearings, it was \nclear that he would have us continue down the road of racial spoils, a \nroad on which Americans are seen principally through the looking glass \nof race.\n  Senator Ashcroft's principled opposition to Mr. Lee was firmly based \nin the record. The signs that Mr. Lee would pursue an activist agenda \nwere clear at his hearings. At that time he narrowly defined the rule \nin Adarand and could not distinguish cases that he would bring as \nAssistant Attorney General from those he brought in the NAACP Legal \nDefense Fund.\n  Some have alleged that Senator Ashcroft's opposition to Mr. Lee was \nbased on mischaracterizations. But Senator Ashcroft did not distort Mr. \nLee's testimony. When Mr. Lee stated the test of Adarand versus Pena he \nsaid that the Supreme Court considered racial preference programs \npermissible if ``conducted in a limited and measured manner.'' While \nthis might be correct in a narrow sense, it purposefully misses the \nmain point of the Court's fundamental holding that such race-conscious \nprograms are presumptively unconstitutional. Mr. Lee might have stated \nthat strict scrutiny was the standard articulated in Adarand; however, \nwhen he described the content of this standard it was far looser than \nwhat the Supreme Court delineated. A ``limited and measured manner'' is \na standard far more lenient than the strict scrutiny standard of \n``narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.'' Mr. \nLee's misleading description can properly be assailed as a fundamental \nmischaracterization of the spirit of the law.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft has stated that he opposed Mr. Lee because of his \nrecord of advocacy and his distortion of precedent. These failures to \nproperly interpret the law would have serious effects on Mr. Lee's \nability to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \nSenator Ashcroft's reasons for opposing Mr. Lee were amply supported by \nthe record.\n  By contrast to Mr. Lee, Senator Ashcroft has repeatedly distinguished \nhis role as a legislator and advocate from that of the Attorney \nGeneral. He understands that his political advocacy gets checked at the \ndoor of the Department of Justice. Senator Ashcroft has repeatedly \nstated that he would enforce the law as it exists to protect the civil \nliberties of all Americans. He is committed to defending the \nconstitutional rights of all individuals and has testified that he will \nmake the enforcement of civil rights one of his topmost priorities. As \nSenator Ashcroft stated,\n\n       My highest priority is to ensure that the Department of \n     Justice lives up to its heritage of enforcing the rule of \n     law, and in particular, guaranteeing legal rights for the \n     advancement of all Americans. . . . [O]ne of my highest \n     priorities at the Department will be to target the \n     unconstitutional practice of racial profiling.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's critics also allege that because Senator Ashcroft \nopposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights, Senator Ashcroft will himself be unable to \ndefend civil liberties. But this is an incredible and illogical leap. \nTo oppose the race-conscious policies favored by Mr. Lee is to value \nthe true principles of the civil rights movement--equality of \nopportunity for all Americans.\n  At the hearings and in supplemental questions, my colleagues have \nraised issues concerning Senator Ashcroft's plans for the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice should he be confirmed as \nAttorney General. Let me say that I am confident that Senator Ashcroft \nwill fight for the civil rights and liberties of all Americans. He \nbelieves that everyone deserves an opportunity to succeed and that \nthose at the bottom of our society may need a helping hand.\n  Senator Ashcroft strongly supports ``affirmative access'' programs. \nAs he testified,\n\n       We can expand the invitation for people to participate \n     aggressively so that no one is denied the capacity to \n     participate simply because they didn't know about the \n     opportunities. We can work on education, which is the \n     best way for people to have access to achievement.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft wants to encourage achievement and access to \nachievement. He wants to avoid what President Bush called the ``soft \nbigotry of low expectations'' that fuels many race-conscious programs.\n  It is true that Senator Ashcroft is skeptical about government \nprograms that categorize people by race. Some of these programs might \nbe unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand \nversus Pena. That decision stated that all governmental racial \nclassifications should be subject to strict scrutiny, that is such \nclassifications must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernmental interest. The Supreme Court made clear that there was no \nsuch things as a ``benign'' racial classification, and that the \ngovernment may treat people differently because of their race for only \nthe most compelling reason. This view of governmental racial \nclassifications comports with the development of constitutional \nprotections for civil liberties. Senator Ashcroft is solidly with the \nSupreme Court on this issue.\n  We have no reason to doubt that Senator Ashcroft will work long and \nhard to defend the civil liberties of all Americans.\n  These are the points that are repeatedly used to denigrate Senator \nAshcroft's character and motivation. But when the facts are examined, \nthese charges simply do not stick. Senator Ashcroft is a man of \ntremendous integrity and probity and I hope that we move quickly to \nconfirm him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware was going to \nspeak, but if I might, just before he does, and on this issue, the \ndesegregation efforts in Missouri in 1992, when Jay Nixon first ran for \nattorney general in Missouri, he did recognize the need to settle the \nSt. Louis and Kansas City desegregation issues. He said the State, the \ncities, and parents needed resolution and certainty after years of \nnonstop litigation. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial summed up the \ndifferences under Jay Nixon. It said:\n\n       Their differences in how the State should respond to the \n     Federal court orders of desegregation for St. Louis and \n     Kansas City schools is instructive. The Republican wants to \n     keep fighting although the State lost the case long ago. The \n     Democrat wants to have a settlement.\n\n  Mr. Nixon then followed through in this agreement. He was the first \nMissouri official to sign a resolution on behalf of the State, and he \nwas a supporter of the law that provided the State funding to settle \nthe St. Louis case. In both the settlement agreement and the law to \nimplement it, then Governor, Governor Carnahan, provided the leadership \nthat Governor Ashcroft did not provide.\n  Senator Ashcroft ran for Governor in 1984 as a strong opponent of the \nsettlement, the settlement finally had in Missouri. He was 8 years as \nattorney general and 8 years as Governor. In those years he denied \nliability, opposed a fair settlement, and litigated the questions over \nand over again.\n  I will put in the Record in a moment a letter from Arthur Benson who, \nsince 1979, has been lead counsel for the schoolchildren in the Kansas \nCity desegregation litigation.\n  What he said in it is:\n\n       While the case proved difficult to settle with the State, \n     it did eventually settle because Jay Nixon and other Missouri \n     officials wanted to settle rather than litigate, and because \n     he wanted to refocus the time and efforts of state officials \n     on improving education.\n  To this Senator's mind, this is a marked difference from what Senator \nAshcroft had done. In any event, Senators have to make up their own \nminds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Arthur Benson & Associates,\n\n                                Kansas City, MO, January 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Since 1979 I have been the lead counsel \n     for the plaintiff schoolchildren in the Kansas City school \n     desegregation litigation, now styled as Jenkins et al., v. \n     Kansas City Missouri School District, case number Case No. \n     77-0420-CV-W-1, United States District Court for the Western \n     District of Missouri.\n       After January 1993 there was a marked change in the manner \n     in which the then defendants of the State of Missouri were \n     represented in this litigation. After January 1993 Attorney \n     General Jay Nixon continued\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\n     to defend the legal positions of the State of Missouri \n     defendants vigorously and well. At the same time, however, he \n     never denied the State's responsibility for eliminating the \n     vestiges of its prior de jure segregation. He also expressed \n     interest in settlement, supported legislative initiatives in \n     the Missouri legislature that would provide necessary \n     underpinning for any settlement, and proposed alternatives to \n     the courts in response to remedial proposals of the \n     plaintiffs, all of which were changes from the litigation \n     tactics of the state defendants in this case before 1993.\n       While the case proved difficult to settle with the State, \n     it did eventually settle because Jay Nixon and other Missouri \n     officials wanted to settle rather than litigate, and because \n     he wanted to refocus the time and efforts of state officials \n     on improving education.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                    Arthur Benson.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, just a few moments ago, I had a phone \nconversation with Senator Ashcroft--it was not an easy call for me, and \nI suspect it was not an easy call for him--in which I shared with him \nmy decision not to vote for his confirmation to be Attorney General for \nour country.\n  Unlike many of my colleagues in this body, I never served with \nSenator Ashcroft. We heard a lot about him today from those who know \nhim better than I ever will. While some are full of praise and others \nare more critical, a number of characteristics about the man emerge. I \nwant to reiterate some of those.\n  Even his critics will acknowledge that John Ashcroft is a person of \nintellect, someone with great energy, someone with a wealth of \nexperience within his own State and here at the Federal level, a person \nof deep faith, someone who was gracious in defeat in his reelection \ncampaign last November. If he were a nominee for Secretary of \nEducation, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Agriculture, or Secretary \nof Housing and Urban Development, my vote would be different; I would \nvote for him. But he is not. He is the nominee for Attorney General for \nour country.\n  Senator Ashcroft and I have some common roots. I share his deep \nfaith. We are both Christians. I have been Governor of my State. He was \nGovernor of his State. He nominated many people to serve in that \ncapacity. I nominated many people to serve in that capacity as well, \njudges and people to serve on my cabinet. Governors of Delaware do not \nnominate the attorney general of our State. The person charged with law \nenforcement and prosecuting criminals in our State is the attorney \ngeneral, who is independently elected.\n  Some have said to me that the President should have the right to his \nchoice of his attorney. We need to remember that the Attorney General \nis not just the President's attorney. The President actually has his \nown attorney, and all Presidents for a long time have had their own \nattorneys. The Attorney General is the Attorney General for the \ncountry.\n  There was a fellow named George Wallace who used to be Governor of \nAlabama. Many of us remember him. When he would run for President, he \nknew he was not going to win. John Ashcroft is going to win. He will be \nconfirmed today. He knows that, and I think we know that.\n  When George Wallace used to run for President, he would say to the \nvoters who were skeptical to spend their vote on a guy who was not \ngoing to win: Send them a message.\n  I am struck by the people in my State, people of color, who have said \nto me in the last month or two since John Ashcroft's name was floated \nand ultimately submitted by President Bush, that even if Senator \nAshcroft is confirmed as Attorney General, we need to send him a \nmessage, and the message is that people in my State, particularly \npeople of color, are uncomfortable with this nomination. They are \nunconvinced that he will be forthright, that he will be consistent, \nthat he will be persistent, that he will be a champion when it comes to \nensuring that their civil rights are protected.\n  John Ashcroft comes from Missouri. It is a show-me State. There are \npeople in my State, especially people of color--and I know there are \nothers in Delaware and in other States--who are concerned about whether \nor not Attorney General John Ashcroft would ensure reproductive rights \nfor women, civil rights for those who may have different sexual \npreferences than others of us, people who may feel differently about \ngun laws. Will this Attorney General enforce the laws of the land and \nprotect those interests as well?\n\n  I have heard from too many people in my State--from the minority \ncommunity--who have said we need to send a message to Washington, to \nthe new administration, that they do not want to be forgotten. They do \nnot want to be left behind. As much progress as we have made in \nproviding a better, equal footing, a level playing field for people of \ncolor, we still have a long ways to go.\n  I regret I have to vote against our new President on this nomination. \nI will vote yes on every other one. This is one on which I have to take \na different course.\n  I thank Senator Ashcroft for the conversation we just had a little \nbit ago. I am hopeful he is prepared to send all of us a message, \nregardless of where we are from, what our color is, what our sexual \npreference is, how we feel about a woman's reproductive right, and that \nis: As Attorney General he will enforce rigorously the laws of this \nland for all of us. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of John \nAshcroft, a person with whom I have had the opportunity to serve in the \nSenate for the 6 years he was here before ending that term after the \nlast election.\n  I think the President of the United States has selected an \noutstanding nominee to head up the Justice Department. I look forward \nto working with him.\n  Despite the campaign that has been launched against him, he will be \napproved by a sizable margin so that he can do his work and do it \nwithout any guilt whatsoever about any of the accusations that have \nbeen made against him. I add my voice in support of his nomination.\n  Despite these well-publicized, well-financed attempts orchestrated by \noutside groups to smear his good name, I am thankful Senator Ashcroft \nwill survive this reckless campaign that has snowballed into an \navalanche of innuendo, rumor, and spin.\n  From the moment President Bush announced his choice for U.S. Attorney \nGeneral, some predictable opponents immediately got to work. They \ncircled their wagons and launched an all-out war on our former \ncolleague and his nomination to be Attorney General.\n  In their zeal to pick a fight with the new administration, the debate \nin the Senate has melted down into a feeding frenzy for the left wing \nwhich sought in the process to lay down markers for their agenda.\n  Ironically, the President's nominee for the Nation's top law \nenforcement office in the country is arguably one of the most qualified \ncandidates this body has ever had the privilege to cast its advice and \nconsent on for the office of U.S. Attorney General. He was twice \nelected Governor of Missouri, served two terms there as the attorney \ngeneral, and was for 6 years our colleague--all of that public service \nis remarkable for a person who will go on to be Attorney General.\n  He has the academic background and the legal background to also be a \ngood Attorney General.\n  From the 6 years I had the privilege of working with John Ashcroft in \nthe Senate, I can unequivocally say he is a man of his word. And what \nis so important about being a man of his word is that the case made \nagainst John Ashcroft is that in the Senate he pursued changes in law, \nhe pursued public policies that maybe some did not agree with. But that \nis the job of a Senator: to vote for or against public policy you think \nis good on the one hand, bad on the other hand; public policy you might \nagree with on the one hand or might disagree with on the other hand.\n  They say he is not qualified to be Attorney General because of a lot \nof things he did in the Senate, representing his constituents--\nforthrightly arguing points he believed in, and voting on those points. \nBut has integrity and honesty. And being a man of his word is so \nimportant because as Attorney General he will take an oath\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\nto uphold the law. He is going to enforce that law, even law with which \nhe does not agree.\n  He could even be in the position of enforcing some piece of \nlegislation against which he voted on the floor of the Senate because \nhe is a man of his word. And with all the criticism people have had of \nJohn Ashcroft, where they disagreed with him as a Senator, and then \nthey criticize him as not being qualified or the right person to be \nAttorney General, they forget that because he is a man of his word, \nthey have nothing to worry about.\n  In fact, he is such a man of his word that if he were to tell a fib, \nyou would know it right away. He is that straight laced, that \nstraightforward, that transparent of an individual, that he would tell \nyou the truth because he could not lie. He couldn't get away with \nlying. And he knows he couldn't get away with lying. That is the sort \nof a person to have as Attorney General of the United States.\n  We are going to have a person who is going to be the chief law \nenforcement officer of the United States. You will never see him being \nthe chief defense counsel for the President of the United States as we \nhave seen over the last 4 or 5 years in the previous administration. \nJohn Ashcroft, put in that position, would resign from being Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  So the people who are making a case against his being Attorney \nGeneral, because of votes and speeches and positions he has taken on \nthe floor of the Senate, are comparing apples and oranges; and they are \nforgetting that a man of his word is going to do what he says, and he \ntakes an oath to uphold the law and enforce that law; and it is going \nto get done. So I say, once again, he is unequivocally a man of his \nword.\n  He testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he will \nenforce the laws of this land, and he is going to do that for all \nAmericans. He said that, and he is going to do it. And his saying that \nmakes me fully confident that he will do so.\n  He has a sharp command of the law, having filled both shoes of \nSenator, Governor and state Attorney General. He understands the \ndifference between advancing legislation as a Senator and enforcing the \nlaws on the books as a state Attorney General. And along this line, he \nhas been recognized by the leaders of other States in this area, \nbecause he was elected by the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, and elected in another position by the National Governors' \nAssociation, to represent and lead their organizations while he was in \nthose two positions for the State of Missouri.\n  As fellow midwesterners, John and I come from States where \nagricultural issues are key components of our economy, our culture, and \nour heritage. We have discussed at length how to address the challenges \nconfronting family farmers in this new century. He shares my concern \nthat we must foster competitive markets and that the family farmer is \nentitled to a level playing field--the same for independent producers--\nand he would say, beyond agriculture, fair competition is important for \nthe small business people of America.\n\n  He would also say that for passengers in my State who pay \nextraordinarily high airline tickets to fly from Des Moines, IA, to \nChicago, there has to be competition in the airline industry, \nparticularly for rural America.\n  Based on my experience with Senator Ashcroft's work here in the \nSenate, I know he is committed to doing what is right for middle \nAmerica as he enforces these laws that are already on the books. He \nknows, of course, that I will keep my lines of communication wide open \nbetween my office and his when it comes to fighting for the interests \nof rural America.\n  In addition to his exemplary professional credentials, there is \nanother issue upon which his supporters and detractors alike agree, and \nthat is, our former colleague, Senator John Ashcroft, is a man of \nprinciple. He is a man of his word. Just ask the people of Missouri \nwho, not once but time and time again, placed their trust in him for \nhigh statewide elected office.\n  Senator Ashcroft's career has been stellar. During his career, \nSenator Ashcroft has worked to establish a number of things to keep all \nAmericans safe and free from criminal activity.\n  For example, last year Senator Ashcroft introduced a bill to prohibit \njuveniles from possessing assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition \nclips. The Senate overwhelmingly passed this Ashcroft legislation. He \nalso voted for the Gun-Free Schools Zone Act that prohibits the \npossession of a firearm within a school zone. Because the Clinton \nJustice Department had not made gun prosecutions a priority, Senator \nAshcroft led the charge in directing the Justice Department to increase \nthe prosecution of crimes committed with guns. In fact, he sponsored \nlegislation to authorize $50 million to hire additional Federal \nprosecutors and law enforcement officers to increase Federal \nprosecution of criminals who use guns.\n  John Ashcroft's efforts against drug abuse and trafficking are \nequally as impressive. A leader in the national fight against the \nscourge of methamphetamine, John Ashcroft won enactment of the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, among other antidrug \nlaws he got passed.\n  Senator Ashcroft has fought hard for the rights of women and to \nprotect them from domestic abuse. He signed into law a bill, when he \nwas Governor, that allowed women accused of homicide to present \nbattered spouse syndrome evidence in the court in that State. He \ncosponsored, at the Federal level, the Violence Against Women Act that \nhelped secure $100 million in increased funding to combat violence \nagainst women.\n  He voted for legislation that prohibits any person convicted of even \nmisdemeanor acts of domestic violence from possessing a firearm.\n  As Governor, Senator Ashcroft appointed women to the State's \nappellate courts, including the first two women to the Missouri Court \nof Appeals and the first woman to the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  In regard to the tactics used against him, deploying distortion and \ndemagoguery to advance their own agenda, groups inside the beltway, who \nprobably have felt very secure for the last years because they had \nsomebody in the White House who would advance their agenda, now feel a \nlittle shut out. They have banded together to engineer a controversy \nabout John Ashcroft where none exists. They rushed to cast judgment, \nand in the process his opponents sought to paint John Ashcroft as a \nracist, as somebody tainted by his principles and unfit to lead the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Obviously, in my view, these critics have been unable to make their \ncase, and I think when this vote is taken, we will find out that they \ndid not make their case.\n  Despite his critics' best efforts, accusations of racism and bias \nhave not stuck. In fact, throughout his career, Senator Ashcroft has \ntried to protect the rights of minorities. He signed the Missouri hate \ncrimes bill into law, and in the Senate he held the first-ever hearing \non racial profiling. As Governor, he appointed a number of minority \njudicial candidates. His by-the-book approach to governing rises above \nand way beyond the decibel level of his detractors, the 200-some \norganizations that have banded together to make this clean-cut, honest \nAmerican, great public servant, out to be some very bad person.\n  It is sad that the aggressive publicity generated by the special \ninterest groups to derail this nomination has painted an unfair image \nof John Ashcroft in the minds of too many Americans. For example, \ncontrary to the controversy surrounding the nomination to the Federal \nbench of Ronnie White, John Ashcroft does not have a racist bone in his \nbody. If his opponents are keeping track of his support for black \njudges, it is ironic that they didn't care to publicize the fact that \nhe, as Senator, voted for 26 out of 28 judges of African American \ndescent. He nominated the first black judge to the appellate court as \nGovernor of Missouri, and the St. Louis Black Bar Association praised \nhim for diversity in his court appointments. The trumped-up charges of \nracism and bias took on a life of their own, but in fact they ring very \nhollow when we pull back the curtain of his opponents' red hot \nrhetoric.\n  In recent years, misrepresentations and baldfaced lies coming out of \nWashington have eroded the electorate's faith and trust in public \nofficials, including all of us. Thankfully, that is not the way the \nmajority of the American people operate. To the majority of\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\nthe American people, the end does not always justify the means. In \nfact, seldom is that true. But in the case of this opposition to John \nAshcroft, any means is justified for the end they want--to let their \ngrassroots members back home know that even though they don't have the \nPresident of the United States always carrying their agenda, as they \ndid the last 8 years, they are going to be a force in this town. And \nthey are a force in this town.\n  They are also telling Members of Congress, particularly left-of-\ncenter Members of Congress: You are on a short leash. We have to be \nreckoned with. Don't toy around with playing with the Republicans too \nmuch or a Republican President. It is also going to help them \ntremendously with their fund-raising. That is what is at stake here.\n  The majority of Americans do not operate that way. Not even a \nmajority of their own rank-and-file members at the grassroots operate \nthat way. I was a member of a labor union from 1961 to 1971. If there \nis one thing I learned as a member of the labor union--and I was \nvoluntarily a member of the labor union because in my State, we have \nthe right-to-work law, you don't have to join--I found out that the \npolitical agenda of the labor union leadership of Detroit or \nWashington, DC, did not represent the political philosophy of my \nmembers on the assembly line at the Waterloo Register Company in Cedar \nFalls, IA. They may have represented our economic interests of \ncollective bargaining, but they did not represent the political \ninterests of the commonsense, conservative blue-collar workers. It is \nthe very same way with a lot of these organizations. When we go back to \nthe grassroots of our States and interact with the rank-and-file \nmembers of a lot of these organizations, they do not treat us in our \nState the way these leaders might treat us out here, as evidenced by \nthe fact of how they treat John Ashcroft. Misrepresentations and \nbaldfaced lies that are used by this group are not the way my friend \nand neighbor, John Ashcroft, has built up an impeccable record of \nhonest public service. His rock-solid integrity, legal background, and \nproven ability to uphold and enforce the law will restore the mission \nof the Justice Department.\n\n  It is clear to me that despite his personal beliefs, Senator Ashcroft \nhas proven his ability to uphold the law without the influence of \npersonal bias. For example, as Missouri attorney general, John Ashcroft \nprotected the confidentiality of abortion records maintained by the \nMissouri Department of Health, even when they were requested by pro-\nlife groups. He has voiced his opposition to violence and his belief \nthat, regardless of his personal views on abortion, people should be \nable to enter abortion clinics safely. That is the law of the land. \nSenator Ashcroft's views on abortion are known. But as Attorney \nGeneral, those laws would not be something that he could change, as one \ncould as a legislator. As a Senator, as a policymaker, he could change \nsome things he might not agree with and I may not agree with. It is \nstill the law of the land, and we live by it.\n  Senator Ashcroft believes that people who commit acts of violence and \nintimidation should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. He \nknows that if you are going to have a civil society, you cannot \ntolerate violence on the part of pro-life people any more than you can \ntolerate violence on the part of union leaders on the picket line.\n  I conclude by saying that everyone in this institution comes to the \nSenate with a set of ideals and principles that serve as their guiding \ncompass. Whether it is based upon conservatism, liberalism, or \nsomething else, or something in between, each of us in this Chamber has \nthe privilege and responsibility to cast votes of conscience. When the \nPresiding Officer calls the yeas and nays on this nomination, I hope \nthat the avalanche of unproven criticism will be put to rest as a \nresult of that vote.\n  I want us to confirm John Ashcroft as our next Attorney General. I \nhave listened to the opponents of John Ashcroft speak here. I have not \nheard every one of the speeches, but I had an opportunity to be on a \ntelevision program with a colleague of mine from the other side of the \naisle who is going to vote against this nomination, the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Bayh, a person of outstanding ethics, honesty, and moral \nvalues. His dad served in this Senate, was an outstanding leader and a \nperson of moral and high ethical values as well.\n  I would vote for Senator Bayh to be Attorney General of the United \nStates, if a Democrat President nominated him, because he is just the \nsort of person who, when you look at him, you just know this guy is not \ngoing to do something that is wrong. You know he is going to enforce \nthe law.\n  I hope all of the people who are upright and of strong conviction on \nthe other side, people who have high moral and ethical values--and I \nknow my colleagues on the other side to be in that category--I hope \nthey vote for John Ashcroft to be Attorney General. I could cast a vote \nfor them as well for Attorney General, not because they are my \ncolleagues, but because of what I have seen in their lives. I hope they \ntruly have seen what is in John Ashcroft's life. And I hope those that \nare against him will have a little guilty feeling about voting against \nhim, unless I see them differently from the way they are and I have \nbeen mistaken about John Ashcroft. But I haven't been mistaken about \nJohn Ashcroft, and I haven't been mistaken about my colleagues from the \nother side as well. I just hope there is a lot of soul searching in the \nnext few hours before we vote because I think this Senator is entitled \nto an overwhelming vote of support to become the next Attorney General \nof the United States.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I regretfully rise today to oppose the \nnomination of John Ashcroft as Attorney General of the United States. \nAs a new Member of the U.S. Senate, I did not have the opportunity to \nserve with former Senator Ashcroft. I have only his record and his \ntestimony on which to make this decision. I come to this judgment after \nsupporting almost all of President Bush's other Cabinet nominees. I \nbelieve that the President should be given broad latitude in choosing \nhis Cabinet, but the Constitution clearly gives the Senate the \nresponsibility of advice and consent. It is our responsibility to \nreview the actions and backgrounds of the nominees and speak on behalf \nof the people we represent.\n  I have listened intently to the judiciary hearings--the questions and \nthe answers--and I would like to commend my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee for the thoughtful and thorough process that was used on this \ncritically important nomination. There is no question that former \nSenator Ashcroft has a long career of public service. It is that career \nand the record that he has created that I feel compelled to evaluate as \nthe most important consideration in making my decision. I have always \nbelieved that actions speak louder than words, especially when there is \na long and consistent public history of questionable actions.\n  This is especially important given the critical responsibilities and \nbroad discretion given to the office of Attorney General. Let me list \njust a few of the actions that I find most disturbing. I was extremely \ntroubled to learn of Senator Ashcroft's record as Missouri's attorney \ngeneral when he strongly opposed a voluntary and court-ordered plan to \ndesegregate many of the public schools in St. Louis. As the Governor of \nthe State of Missouri, this nominee vetoed the Voter Registration \nReform Act, which would have clearly increased the participation of \nminorities in the electoral process.\n  His record on other antidiscrimination issues is equally disturbing. \nFrom his opposition to the ultimately successful appointment of James \nHormel as Ambassador to Luxembourg, simply because he was gay, \nregardless of his qualifications, to his refusal to answer questions \nduring his confirmation hearing about whether he would discriminate \nagainst Americans by denying them the ability to gain security \nclearances simply because of their sexual orientation. His record on \nwomen's rights is just as troubling. He has consistently used every \nopportunity and every power he has had to block reproductive choice for \nwomen including the extreme position of suing public health\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\ncare nurses in the State of Missouri for providing basic gynecological \nand contraceptive services. In addition, his very vocal opposition to \nRoe vs. Wade and the basic reproductive rights of women is an issue \nthat not only continues to worry me, but millions of women across this \ncountry.\n\n  For me personally, one of the most troubling aspects of his record, \nwas Senator Ashcroft's unfair treatment of Judge Ronald White when he \nspearheaded the U.S. Senate's rejection of his nomination to the \nFederal bench. This action was highly unusual and extremely unfortunate \nfor Judge White and for the U.S. Senate.\n  One of the most basic requirements of any nominee to be the U.S. \nAttorney General is an ability to exhibit a strong track record of \nfighting for the constitutional rights of all Americans--black, brown, \nor white, male or female, young or old, rich or poor. In my opinion, \nSenator Ashcroft's record clearly fails to satisfy that most basic \nqualification. To the contrary, he has established a 25-year track \nrecord of opposing equal opportunities and fair play for too many \nAmericans.\n  The basic fact remains that the U.S. Attorney General is the people's \nlawyer, not the President's lawyer. He is the guardian of the \nconstitutional rights of every American citizen. And I cannot in good \nconscience support a nominee who has spent much of the past 25 years \nopposing the constitutional rights of far too many of our citizens.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could engage my friend from Utah, the \nmanager of this nomination, I know our friend from Kansas is here, and \nthe Senator from Iowa spoke for quite a long period of time. The \nSenator from Michigan spoke for just a few minutes. I think it would be \nappropriate to have the Senator from California speak. She will \nprobably speak for about 35 or 40 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe Senator Brownback was next.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could, I have about 10 minutes to \nspeak. If I could, I would like to go in a back-and-forth order.\n  Mr. REID. We just didn't want another 2- or 3-minute speech that took \n40 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rightfully understand that. If the Senator will speak \nfor 10 minutes or less, we would appreciate it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If we could have a unanimous consent agreement that \nfollowing Senator Brownback, Senator Reid would be recognized, and then \nSenator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, very much. I appreciate the opportunity to \nbe here to speak in favor of our colleague, Senator Ashcroft, to be \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  I serve on our Judiciary Committee along with the esteemed Presiding \nOfficer.\n  I wonder sometimes who people are talking about when I hear people \nsaying he is too far this way or that way to be Attorney General. I \nwonder. How did he win statewide elections in a swing State such as \nMissouri for so many different elections. How was he elected president \nof the National Association of Attorney Generals? How was he elected \nhead of the National Governors' Association--bipartisan groups? If this \nguy is so far out there on these issues, how on Earth did he get \nelected to all of these positions? It just baffles me other than to say \nhe is not extreme.\n  In most of his policy issues he has put forward, he cares strongly \nwith passion. But there is a solid core of Americans, and in most cases \na majority of Americans, who strongly believe in and agree with him on \nissues such as partial-birth abortion and other items. But that really \nis neither here nor there. The issue is whether he will enforce the \nlaw. That is what an Attorney General is required to do and is called \nupon to do and in States are elected to do. He has done that at the \nState level as an elected attorney general. He will do that as a \nnational Attorney General, especially for the United States.\n  I am new to the Judiciary Committee with this session. I am looking \nforward to serving on that body. But what I found by this process that \nwe have had in the treatment of John Ashcroft is that it is an \nextraordinarily unfair process, and I think quite undeservedly toward \nJohn.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in a town only about 20 miles from the State \nof Missouri in a small town called Parker, KS. I have had the \nopportunity to follow John's career for a long time. Our States share a \ncommon border. In the Senate, John and I served together on the \nCommerce and Foreign Relations Committee. Our offices were even down \nthe hall from each other. John and I were neighbors here in Washington, \nand he even put me up in his house when my apartment building burned. I \nsubmit that he would do that for anyone who needed a roof over their \nhead. But more important than geography or committee assignments, John \nAshcroft is my friend. A friend who shared with me his honesty and \nintegrity, his devotion to his creator, his principled character, and \nhis steadfast belief that each of us is put here on Earth, to help our \nfellow man, and to leave the world a better place for all of our \nchildren.\n  Contrary to the assertions of those who make a living exacerbating \nthe tensions that divide us as a nation, I know John Ashcroft is \ncommitted to our Nation's promise of equal justice for all.\n  President Bush made an outstanding choice for his Attorney General. \nJohn Ashcroft is one of the most qualified nominees for the office of \nAttorney General in history.\n  But even more impressive than his resume, Mr. President, are John \nAshcroft's words and deeds. Article II, section 3 of the Constitution \nprovides that the President of the United States, ``shall take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed.'' The Department of Justice is \nthe primary government agency charged with the President's \nconstitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United \nStates. John Ashcroft has fulfilled this function as two-time attorney \ngeneral of the State of Missouri. In that role, John Ashcroft upheld \nlaw with which he personally disagreed, and which many of us in this \nbody might disagree with. But as Missouri attorney general, he swore an \noath to uphold the law, and he did. Mr. President, there are many \nissues on which many of us in this body disagree. But we are \nlegislators, we write laws. That is not the role of the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. Mr. President, John Ashcroft raised his \nright hand swore before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would \nfaithfully enforce the laws of the United States, ``So help me God.'' \nAs a person who feels fortunate to call John Ashcroft a friend, I don't \nthink there is a stronger guarantee than that oath he took.\n  Some have called Senator Ashcroft's record on civil rights into \nquestion. This has been a program of distortion. As Missouri Governor, \nJohn Ashcroft signed Missouri's first hate crimes statute into law. As \na U.S. Senator, John Ashcroft supported every African-American judicial \nnominee confirmed by the Senate. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, John Ashcroft convened a \nhearing on racial profiling with Senator Feingold, stating on the \nrecord that racial profiling is unconstitutional. John Ashcroft's \nrecord speaks for itself; he is a man of integrity dedicated to equal \njustice under law. There have been other distortions of Senator \nAshcroft's record.\n  Mr. President, I was heartened by Senator Feingold's remarks in the \nJudiciary Committee executive session yesterday, in which he extended \nan olive branch of peace and cooperation to our side of the aisle, and \nwe have a Senate more evenly divided than we have had for almost 50 \nyears. Senator Feingold has answered President Bush's call to change \nthe tone in Washington. It is a bold step, a step I hope my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will follow. I had the opportunity to \nspeak personally with the witnesses who testified both for and against \nJohn Ashcroft's nomination. Believe me, there is more that binds us \ntogether as a people and a nation than keeps us apart. Let us begin \nthis Congress in that spirit which Abraham Lincoln used to help heal a \nnation, when he warned that ``A house divided against itself cannot \nstand.'' I intend to vote for John Ashcroft's nomination to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. I encourage my colleagues, on both\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nsides of the aisle, to follow the spirit of Lincoln, and help renew the \nties that bind us together, and to resist the temptation to use this \nprocess for political gain, and further divide us as a nation.\n  I think once John Ashcroft is approved as Attorney General of the \nUnited States, he will be an outstanding and extraordinary Attorney \nGeneral for all American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Reid for \nreserving this time for me.\n  As most people know, there were several Members who came out early \nwith a position on John Ashcroft. Most came out for him before the \nhearings, and I came out against his confirmation. The people who came \nout for John Ashcroft before the hearings said they knew enough to know \nthey were for him. I said, after looking at the record and being very \nfamiliar with the record, I could not support him. I actually asked \nthen-President-elect Bush to reconsider his choice because I believed \nhim when he said he wanted to unite the Nation rather than divide the \nNation. I felt this nomination would be very divisive, would raise the \nvery same issues that were raised during one of the most difficult \ncampaigns that I certainly ever remember for President.\n  I think what I said was borne out. This Presidential election was a \nmandate. Many people think if all the votes had been counted, it might \nhave come out a different way. That is not the point. The point is, \nbecause it was so divisive, whoever won, whether it was Al Gore or \nGeorge W. Bush, whoever actually took the office--in this case the \nSupreme Court decided to stop the count, and George W. Bush became \nPresident--whoever was President had to know that this was a very \ndivided Nation and that we needed to put up moderate people--moderate \npeople--for important offices such as Attorney General, Interior \nSecretary, and the like.\n  For me, it is very rare to oppose a Bush Cabinet nominee. Out of all \nof them, I have opposed two. I have supported every other one. One \nthing John Ashcroft said is: I supported 90 percent of President \nClinton's judges.\n  Well, I supported 90 percent of George W. Bush's Cabinet picks. \nTherefore, when I choose to say no, it is because I feel very deeply \nand very firmly that John Ashcroft is not the right choice.\n  President Bush said he picked John Ashcroft because ``he has a \ncommitment to fair and firm and impartial administration of justice.'' \nHe told us that John Ashcroft is ``a man who has a good and decent \nheart,'' and he asked us to look into the heart of John Ashcroft.\n  Believe me, I have done that. And I have looked into the hearts of \npeople who John Ashcroft has hurt. I believe this nomination should be \nrejected. I will be very specific.\n  Judge Ronnie White: Was John Ashcroft's treatment of Judge Ronnie \nWhite fair? Did he have a good heart when it came to dealing with Judge \nRonnie White? Let's revisit it. The American Bar Association gave Judge \nWhite a unanimous qualified rating. Judge White was introduced at his \nnomination hearing for judgeship in front of the Judiciary Committee \nwith glowing remarks by Senator Bond. With no warning, John Ashcroft \nchampioned the defeat of Judge White's nomination on the Senate floor.\n  I have been in elective life for 25 years; certain things you do not \nremember and a lot of things you do. I will never forget the day this \nSenate voted down Judge Ronnie White on a straight partisan vote--the \nfirst time in 50 long years that a judge nominee who had been passed \nfavorably through the Judiciary Committee was so treated.\n  Why would I remember it so clearly? I thought a few people might vote \nno just as we have on many judge nominations. But I never thought that \nJohn Ashcroft would have rounded up and made it a big political issue \nthat all the Republicans would stick with him on this vote. We all \nknow, because we are not children in this body, there are other ways to \ntreat someone who suddenly doesn't look like he will be confirmed. You \nbring it back to the committee, you have another vote. You don't do \nwhat they did to Ronnie White.\n  I remember that Congresswoman Maxine Waters, one of my good friends, \ncame over from the House that day. She was here because she wanted to \ncelebrate the fact that Ronnie White was going to get this judgeship. \nShe and I looked at each other as the nomination went down. It was a \nhumiliating defeat. It was a sad, sad day.\n  I compliment those Senators on the Judiciary Committee who apologized \nto Ronnie White. He never, ever should have been treated that way. It \nwas unnecessary to do that to any human being.\n  So, yes, I have looked into John Ashcroft's heart. And I say how \ncould someone with a good heart do that to another good person? I do \nnot understand it.\n  I hope Senator Feingold will be listening, too, when he says to \nPresident Bush: Why don't you renominate Ronnie White in the spirit of \nreconciliation?\n  During his floor remarks, John Ashcroft pointed to Judge White's \ndissent in a murder case. It was a horrific case. Yet John Ashcroft did \nnot ask any questions of Judge White during the confirmation hearing or \neven afterwards in written follow-up questions about that case. I think \na fundamental guarantee of our system of justice, particularly from \nsomeone who wants to be an Attorney General, is the right to give \nsomeone you are criticizing the right to be heard.\n  Judge Ronnie White did not have that right until the Democrats called \nhim up during this hearing. I appreciate the fact that he had that \nhearing in front of the Republicans and Democrats of that committee. \nThat nomination was sabotaged on the floor of the Senate. It was wrong; \nit was harsh; it was cruel; it was humiliating; and it was not \nnecessary.\n  I think that speaks volumes about John Ashcroft's commitment to \nfairness. On the Senate floor, John Ashcroft said that Judge White was \n``pro-criminal, with a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' In \nthe Judiciary Committee hearings last week, Judge White noted that \nafter a long career in public service, including elective office, he \nhad never, ever heard himself described that way.\n  Judge White got the chance to set the record straight. He told the \nJudiciary Committee that he voted to affirm the death penalty 41 times \nout of 59 cases. And in 10 of the remaining 18, he joined a unanimous \ncourt in reversing. All together, Judge White voted with the majority \nof the court in 53 out of 59 cases. In only 6 cases did he dissent in a \ndeath penalty case, and in only 3 of those was he the sole dissenter. \nWhen you add this all up, it turns out that Judge White voted the same \nway as Ashcroft appointed judges--95 percent of the time.\n  How did Judge White feel about John Ashcroft's pro-criminal label? \nThis is what he said. He told the Judiciary Committee, ``Senator John \nAshcroft seriously distorted my record.'' And he very graciously left \nit up to the Senate to decide whether that kind of treatment is \nconsistent with fair play and justice that an Attorney General is \nexpected to have.\n  Conservative columnist Stuart Taylor of the National Journal has \nwritten that John Ashcroft's treatment of Judge White is enough to \ndisqualify him for the position of Attorney General.\n  Of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in the Ronnie White matter, Mr. Taylor \nwrote that Ashcroft:\n\n       . . . abused the power of his office by descending to \n     demagoguery, dishonesty, and character assassination.\n\n  Those are not my words. Those are the words of Stuart Taylor, a \nconservative journalist for the National Journal.\n  Let's just say you think everybody is entitled to one mistake, to one \nmistreatment of another individual. Let's just say that. Unfortunately, \nin this case, I am going to point to a number of other examples.\n  Take the case of James Hormel. Ambassador Hormel was nominated in \n1997 to be the U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. He was approved by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee by a vote of 16-2. One of those \n``no'' votes was cast by Senator Ashcroft. Why did Senator Ashcroft \noppose Ambassador Hormel, a very well-known businessman, a beautiful \nfamily--why?\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  Let's check the record. In 1998, when asked about the nomination of \nJames Hormel, Senator Ashcroft said:\n\n       His conduct and the way in which he would represent the \n     United States is probably not up to the standard that I would \n     expect.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft continued:\n\n       He has been a leader in promoting a lifestyle. . .and the \n     kind of leadership he's exhibited there is likely to be \n     offensive to. . .individuals in the setting to which he will \n     be assigned.\n\n  This is the comment of John Ashcroft on the nomination of James \nHormel. Clearly, by this statement--\n\n       He has been a leader in promoting a lifestyle. . .and the \n     kind of leadership he has exhibited there is likely to be \n     offensive to. . .individuals in the setting to which he will \n     be assigned.\n\n  To me, you don't have to have a degree in psychology to understand \nwhat John Ashcroft is saying. He is saying he is a leader in promoting \na gay lifestyle. That is what he is saying.\n  This issue came up at the Judiciary Committee. When Senator Leahy \nasked John Ashcroft if he opposed James Hormel because he was gay, \nSenator Ashcroft replied:\n\n       I did not.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I made a judgment that it would be ill-advised to make him \n     an ambassador based on the totality of the record.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I had known Mr. Hormel for a long time.\n\n  Ambassador Hormel responds:\n\n       There is simply no truth in Mr. Ashcroft's statement that \n     he had any objective basis or personal knowledge upon which \n     to vote against my nomination.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       He refused to give any specific example of anything in my \n     record on which to base his opposition. I can only conclude \n     Mr. Ashcroft chose to vote against me solely because I am a \n     gay man.\n\n  Is this fair? I already talked about Ronnie White. Senator Ashcroft \nnever had the courtesy to ask Ronnie White any questions about the case \nthat he said disqualified Ronnie White for a judgeship. And he led a \nfight here on the floor such that we have not seen in 50 long years to \ndefeat Ronnie White. And he refused to meet at that time with \nAmbassador Hormel.\n  Ambassador Hormel said: I want to meet with you, Senator Ashcroft.\n  No. He refused. And Mr. Hormel stated he cannot remember having a \nsingle conversation with the Senator.\n  Then, in his answers to a written follow-up question after the \nJudiciary Committee hearings last week, John Ashcroft changes his \nstory. Ashcroft stated that:\n\n       [B]ased on the totality of Mr. Hormel's advocacy, I didn't \n     believe he would effectively represent the United States in \n     Luxembourg, the most Roman Catholic country in all of Europe.\n\n  So we have different answers. First, it was the totality of his \nknowledge of Mr. Hormel, whom he knew so well. Then Mr. Hormel says: He \ndidn't even want to meet with me. And then he changes his answer again.\n  He hurt James Hormel deeply by not allowing that Ambassadorship to \ncome up for a vote. I think that kind of hurt says to me that when I \nlook at his heart, I don't see the kindness and the caring about other \npeople.\n  So, you would say, OK, that was two. That was Ronnie White and James \nHormel. Do we stop there? Unfortunately, we don't. We go to Margaret \nMorrow. Was John Ashcroft fair to Margaret Morrow, the first woman to \nhead the Los Angeles Bar Association and the California Bar \nAssociation, nominated to the Federal district court in May of 1996, \nand not until 2 whole years later were we able to finally get a vote? \nAnd I must thank Chairman Hatch for that--by February 11, 1998.\n  Why did it take so long? Simple: John Ashcroft placed a secret hold \non Ms. Morrow's nomination. The hold kept Morrow from having a vote on \nthe Senate floor; it kept her from having a fair up-or-down vote.\n  I do not think that is fair. That was hurtful. He said she was an \n``activist judge.'' In fact, Ms. Morrow had overwhelming Republican \nsupport, to the contrary.\n  Robert Bonner, a U.S. attorney appointed by Ronald Reagan, supported \nher. Many Senators from the Judiciary Committee, including Senator \nHatch, supported her. James Rogan supported her. And yet he put this \nhold on her. Finally, we were able to get him to back off. For 2 years, \nthat court ran without Margaret Morrow on it, and now she serves \nproudly after getting a vote of 67-28.\n  He was so out of line on that. A strong majority supported Margaret \nMorrow.\n  You have heard the stories: Ronnie White, James Hormel, Margaret \nMorrow, human beings with faces and hearts and pulses who were hurt by \nJohn Ashcroft, hurt deeply by John Ashcroft. But there is more.\n  Bill Lann Lee, was John Ashcroft fair to him when he was nominated to \nbe Assistant U.S. Attorney for Civil Rights? When he arrived here in \n1997, he had a long record at the NAACP of fighting discrimination. Yet \neven Lee's former corporate opponents came to lobby for him--what a \nwonderful person he is.\n  He supported the law, the law of giving people a chance, affirmative \naction laws. John Ashcroft did not like that law, which, by the way, he \nwill be sworn now to uphold. He blocked Bill Lann Lee's nomination, and \nBill Lann Lee never got an up-or- down vote. He served as an acting \nhead of that division.\n  I know the story of Bill Lann Lee. He is an incredible example of the \nAmerican dream. He worked his way up from the bottom of the economic \nladder. His father ran a laundry where they sweated every single day to \nhelp their son get an education, and this is the way he was treated in \nthe greatest nation in the world. It was hurtful. It was very hurtful \nto Bill Lann Lee. It was very hurtful to the people in this country who \nwere looking to Bill Lann Lee as a role model.\n  This is what John Ashcroft said about Bill Lann Lee:\n\n       We don't need an individual who is trying to go against the \n     Constitution as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court. We \n     need someone who is going to say I'm here to provide the \n     administration.\n\n  Bill Lann Lee said under oath that he would uphold the Constitution, \njust as John Ashcroft is saying he will. Yet he did not give Bill Lann \nLee a chance. He hurt this man deeply.\n  That is a story of looking into the heart of someone. I think you \nhave to be judged by not only your words but your deeds in totality, so \nI have not given one example; I have given four. I could give more. I \nwill not.\n  I want to talk about the Southern Partisan. I want to talk about the \nfact that John Ashcroft as a Senator in 1998 gave an interview to the \nSouthern Partisan magazine. Put in a most straightforward way, this \nmagazine promotes racism.\n  This is a picture of a T-shirt that is advertised in this magazine. \nThis is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and they sell this on a T-shirt. \nThis is Latin. It says: ``Thus be it to tyrants.'' It is a picture of \nLincoln: ``Thus be it to tyrants.'' Those are the words that were \nuttered by the assassin of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was quoted \nby Senator Brownback, and he made a beautiful speech. This is sold by \nthis magazine. The words of John Wilkes Booth are underneath: ``Thus be \nit always to tyrants.''\n\n  In his interview, John Ashcroft praised the magazine and its mission:\n\n       Your magazine also helped set the record straight. You've \n     got a heritage of doing that, of defending southern patriots. \n     Traditionalists should do more. I've really got to do more. \n     We've all got to stand up and speak in this respect or else \n     we will be taught that these people were giving their lives, \n     ascribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to some \n     perverted agenda.\n\n  Now he says he did not know about the magazine. Let's look at that.\n  First of all, there was an amazing exchange in the committee between \nSenator Biden and John Ashcroft. Senator Biden gave John Ashcroft the \nopportunity to denounce this magazine. He said: What do you think of it \nnow that you know what they do, what they stand for, the T-shirt, and \nthe rest? John Ashcroft basically did not answer him. Senator Biden was \ntaken aback because he had the opportunity to say: This is a racist \nmagazine; I'll never talk to them. He did not say it. He said: I \ndeplore what is deplorable. That was his response to Senator Biden.\n  He had a chance. He said:\n\n       On the magazine, frankly, I can't say that I knew very much \n     at all. . . . I've given magazine interviews to lots of \n     people . . . and I regret that speaking to them is being used \n     to imply that I agree with their views.\n\n  If you go back to what he said when he spoke to them, he said:\n\n       Your magazine also helped set the record straight. You've \n     got a heritage of doing that, of defending southern patriots. \n     . . .\n\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\n\n  So how does he say he never heard of the magazine when you look at \nhis quote and he knows of the magazine, because he says:\n\n       Your magazine also helped set the record straight. You've \n     got a heritage of doing that, of defending southern patriots. \n     . . .\n\n  And it goes on. It does not ring true.\n  He had a chance in simple language to say: I will never talk to them \nagain. He did not do it.\n  We could look at Bob Jones University, and I will not go into the \ndetails of that, but we have to believe that he knew about the racist \npolicies when he accepted their degree because those policies were the \nsubject of a huge Supreme Court case that was decided when he was \nattorney general of Missouri.\n  The case was Bob Jones v. the United States. It was on the front page \nof the major newspapers when it was decided. In that case, the Supreme \nCourt reversed the university's tax exempt status because of the racist \npolicy that John Ashcroft said he did not know about. But he was an \nattorney general at the time that decision came down.\n  Again, I think he could have said more at the hearings to distance \nhimself from the university's policies.\n  These are the things that say to me, out of the 280 million Americans \nin our country, there has to be someone who is better suited for this \njob.\n  We have heard a lot about a woman's right to choose. Regardless of \nyour feelings on it--I happen to be of a mind that the Government has \nno business telling a woman about her reproductive health care in the \nbeginning of a pregnancy, which is Roe v. Wade; that is the law of the \nland--I would hope we could come together when it comes to preventing \nunwanted pregnancies by contraception. That seems to be an area of \ncommon ground where both sides could come together. Because if you do \nnot get pregnant, if you do not want a child, you do not have to have \nan abortion. It works. It will lower the number of abortions.\n  But when John Ashcroft was attorney general, he sued nurses who were \ngiving contraception to women. Let me repeat that. He went against \nsettled law in Missouri when he was attorney general. He tried to stop \nnurses, through the courts, from handing out contraception. It was \nsettled law that those nurses could do it, but John Ashcroft argued \nthat Missouri law did not allow for it.\n  The Missouri Supreme Court ruled against John Ashcroft. It strongly \npointed out his interpretation was out of step with settled law. This \nis what the Missouri Supreme Court had to say:\n\n       We believe the acts of the nurses [providing \n     contraceptives, breast and pelvic exams] are precisely the \n     types of acts the legislature contemplated. . . .\n       The Court believes that it is significant that while at \n     least forty states have modernized and expanded their nursing \n     practice laws during the past fifteen years, neither counsel \n     nor the Court have discovered any case challenging nurses' \n     authority to act as the nurses herein acted.\n\n  In other words, in 40 States, not one other attorney general ever \nsued nurses and tried to stop them from providing these services to \nwomen. On this occasion, it was in rural clinics. So when John Ashcroft \nsays he is going to uphold settled law, I am sure he said that when he \nwas the attorney general of Missouri.\n  Then, if we look at other issues concerning women, he also sued the \nNational Organization for Women. When he was an attorney general in the \n1980s, he sued NOW to stop their campaign to win ratification of the \nEqual Rights Amendment. Now, maybe he does not agree with the Equal \nRights Amendment, he does not want women to be equal through the Equal \nRights Amendment. Maybe he does not believe it is necessary, for \nwhatever reason. But to sue a woman's organization for 3 years--losing \nat every step but never giving up; taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court \nafter the Circuit Court of Appeals, and they all rejected his \narguments--it seems to me, since that was also settled law in a case \nfrom 1961, we have to question: What does he mean when he says he will \naccept settled law?\n  Voluntary desegregation: Others have spoken about this. How do you \nfight a voluntary desegregation plan that everyone came together and \nsaid was a good way to help our kids? Well, he figured out how to do \nit. And I will tell you, his rhetoric was very strong. He called the \nvoluntary plan an ``outrage against human decency'' and an ``outrage \nagainst the children of this State.''\n  The conservative Economist magazine described Ashcroft this way--and \nit turned out he and his opponent were both arguing:\n\n       The campaign quickly degenerated into a context over who \n     was most opposed to the plan for voluntary racial \n     desegregation . . .\n\n  The court roundly criticized then-Attorney General Ashcroft. They \nsaid:\n\n       The court can only draw one conclusion . . . the state has, \n     as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the \n     authority of this court.\n\n  From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1982, Ashcroft was ``making \nhimself a familiar advocate before the Supreme Court, most often as the \nantagonist of civil rights interests.''\n  So here you have a nominee, who is supposed to firmly uphold the \ncivil rights laws, being called an antagonist of civil rights interests \nin an article in 1982.\n  This was an election where many African American voters believed they \nwere disenfranchised. They are looking at this Senate and thinking they \ncannot believe that this is the individual George Bush would put before \nus. Why do I say that? Because there is a case on point about voter \nregistration. While John Ashcroft was Missouri Governor, he vetoed a \nbill that would have allowed volunteers to register voters in the \nlargely African American city of St. Louis; in other words, a bill to \nallow the League of Women Voters to encourage voter registration.\n  The very interesting bottom line of this case is, in the white parts \nof the county he allowed this voter registration to go on. When he \nvetoed the first bill, he said he had a problem with it. But then he \nvetoed it again. It seems to me that anyone who believes that we ought \nto have our voting rights be sacred in this Nation would have problems \nvoting for this nominee.\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted at the time:\n\n       Gov. John Ashcroft has decided that [some citizens] . . . \n     should continue to be treated differently from others on the \n     matter of voter registration.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I am sure you are glad to hear I am about to sum \nup, to finish. What I have tried to do in this presentation is to speak \nfrom my heart because that is what George Bush asked me to do. He said: \nLook in your heart and look in the heart of John Ashcroft. I believe \nthat he meant for me to do that.\n  In my advise and consent responsibility, I have looked into the heart \nof John Ashcroft. And how can I do it? By looking at the way he treats \nother people. My mother taught me to do that. You can say a lot of \nthings in life. You can tell your kids, be good to your neighbor, but \nif they see you walk past your neighbor, if your neighbor is lying on \nthe street, they know something is not right.\n  When I talk to people and see people such as Ronnie White--a \nbeautiful family man, qualified, the American dream personified--\nhumiliated on the Senate floor, I cannot look away from that. When I \nsee Margaret Morrow hanging and twisting in the wind for 2 years \nbecause John Ashcroft put a secret hold on her, I have to look at that. \nWhen I see James Hormel, a distinguished man, humiliated, hurt, turned \ndown for an Ambassadorship because he happened to be a gay man, I \ncannot look away from that. And when I see Bill Lann Lee, whose father \nand mother sweated in a laundry so that he could get the American \ndream--when I see him hurt and humiliated--I cannot look away from \nthat.\n  Maybe my colleagues can, and they see other things that I do not see. \nI respect them so much. And I respect their right to feel strongly, \njust as I do on the other side of this issue. But I have taken this \ntime because I feel so deeply about this.\n  The Attorney General is the Nation's guardian of civil rights, of \nhuman rights, of women's rights, of the environment, of sensible gun \nlaws. He or she must be moderate to bring the country together. What \ndid John Ashcroft say about moderates? He said:\n\n       There are two things you find in the middle of the road: A \n     moderate and a dead skunk, and I don't want to be either.\n\n  Mr. President, I have looked into the heart of John Ashcroft. I do \nnot think he is the right person for this job.\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, another topic that keeps being brought up \nagain and again is Senator Ashcroft's opposition to Judge Ronnie White. \nI am concerned that some of my colleagues continue to denigrate Senator \nAshcroft for his involvement in the nomination of Judge Ronnie White. \nIt has been said that Senator Ashcroft distorted Judge White's record \nand wrongly painted him as pro-criminal and anti-law enforcement.\n  But there were many reasons to vote against confirmation for Judge \nWhite. In fact, every Republican in the Senate did so. I have reviewed \nJudge White's record and several of his dissenting opinions in death \npenalty cases, and I can understand Senator Ashcroft's opposition to \nJudge White's nomination to the federal bench.\n  For instance in the Johnson case, the defendant was convicted on four \ncounts of first-degree murder for killing three officers and the wife \nof the sheriff. Johnson was sentenced to death on all counts. On \nappeal, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the decision, but Judge White \ndissented arguing for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of \ncounsel. Judge White thought that Johnson deserved further opportunity \nto present a defense based on post-traumatic stress disorder. But the \nmajority showed that here was no credible evidence that Johnson \nsuffered from this disorder. Rather, it was clear that defense counsel \nhad fabricated a story that was quickly disproved at trial. For \ninstance, defense counsel stated that Johnson had placed a perimeter of \ncans and strings and had deflated the tires of his car. At trial, \ntestimony revealed that police officers had taken these actions, not \nthe defendant.\n  Further, Congressman Kenneth Hulshof, the prosecutor in the Johnson \ncase testified at Senator Ashcroft's hearings that it was almost \nimpossible to make out an argument for ineffective assistance of \ncounsel because the defendant ``hired counsel of his own choosing. He \npicked from our area in mid-Missouri what . . . I referred to as a \ndream team.''\n  Judge White has every right to pen a dissent in Johnson and other \ncases involving the death penalty. Similarly, every Senator has the \nduty to evaluate these opinions as part of Judge White's judicial \nrecord. And that's just what Senator Ashcroft did. At no time did \nSenator Ashcroft derogate Judge White's background.\n  I consider Judge White to be a decent man with an impressive personal \nbackground. He has accomplished a great deal and come up from humble \nbeginnings. But his record of dissenting in death penalty cases was \nsufficiently troubling to cause Senator Ashcroft and others to oppose \nthe nomination.\n  Many of my colleagues have impugned Senator Ashcroft's motives for \nvoting against Judge White. But Judge White's nomination was strongly \nopposed by many of Senator Ashcroft's constituents and also by major \nlaw enforcement groups, including the National Sheriffs' Association \nand the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs.\n  Sheriff Kenny Jones, whose wife and colleagues were killed by \nJohnson, testified, ``I opposed Judge White's nomination to the federal \nbench, an I asked Senator Ashcroft to join me because of Judge White's \nopinion on a death penalty cease. . . in his opinion, Judge White urged \nthat Johnson be given a second chance at freedom. I cannot understand \nhis reasoning. I know that the four people killed were not given a \nsecond chance.''\n  Finally, many of my colleagues have alleged that Senator Ashcroft's \nopposition to Judge White was underhanded and done with stealth. Well, \nSenator Ashcroft voted against Judge White's nomination in committee. \nHe expressed his disapproval at that time. If he had held up the \nnomination in committee without allowing it to proceed to the floor he \nwould have been criticized for delay.\n  Indeed, Senator Boxer pleaded during a debate about several judges \nincluding Ronnie White,\n\n       I beg of you, in the name of fairness and justice and all \n     things that ace good in our country, give people a chance. If \n     you do not think they are good, if you have a problem with \n     something they said or did, bring it down to the floor. We \n     can debate it. But please do not hold up these nominees. It \n     is wrong. You would not do it to a friend.--Cong. Rec. S. \n     11871, Oct. 4, 1999.\n\n  Thus, Senator Ashcroft was between a rock and a hard place as to how \nto raise his legitimate concerns about Judge White.\n  Senator Ashcroft is a man of tremendous integrity, one of the most \nqualified nominees for Attorney General that we have ever seen. His \nopposition to Judge White was principled and in keeping with the proper \nexercise of the advice and consent duty of a senator. I regret that we \nhave needed to revisit this issue at such great length.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to have an op-ed piece, which \nresponds to one of the points that Senator Boxer was raising, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    John Ashcroft, American Partisan\n\n                          (By Thomas G. West)\n\n       Frustrated by the absence of any real dirt on Senator John \n     Ashcroft, his ideological enemies have descended into \n     dishonesty and distortion. He is being attacked as a racist \n     and a defender of slavery. A quotation from his 1998 \n     interview with ``Southern Partisan'' magazine has been \n     denounced with particular venom.\n       Those circulating that quotation suggest that Ashcroft was \n     praising the confederate cause, including slavery. But in \n     context he was praising the antislavery principles of \n     America's Founding Fathers. I should know, because he was \n     talking about my book.\n       Here is how the full quotation reads in the original: \n     ``Ashcroft: Revisionism is a threat to the respect that \n     Americans have for their freedoms and the liberty that was at \n     the core of those who founded this country, and when we see \n     George Washington, the founder of our country, called a \n     racist, that is just total revisionist nonsense, a diatribe \n     against the values of America. Have you read Thomas West's \n     book, ``Vindicating the Founders''?\n       ``Interviewer: I've met Professor West, and I read one of \n     his earlier books, but not that one.\n       ``Ashcroft: I wish I had another copy: I'd send it to you. \n     I gave it away to a newspaper editor. West virtually \n     disassembles all of these malicious attacks the revisionists \n     have brought against our Founders. Your magazine also helps \n     set the record straight. You've got a heritage of doing that, \n     of defending Southern patriots like [Robert E.] Lee, \n     [Stonewall] Jackson and [Jefferson] Davis. Traditionalists \n     must do more. I've got to do more. We've all got to stand up \n     and speak in this respect, or else we'll be taught that these \n     people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred \n     fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda.''\n       Ashcroft's language is telling. It is a clear reference to \n     the final words of the Declaration of Independence, where the \n     signers ``pledge to one another our lives, our fortunes, and \n     our sacred honor.'' The ``perverted agenda'' to which \n     Ashcroft alludes is the ideology of proslavery, which he is \n     utterly rejecting here.\n       ``Southern Partisan'' has been described, correctly, as a \n     magazine that defends the South in the Civil War. But \n     Ashcroft has just pointed out, correctly, that ``liberty''--\n     not slavery--was ``at the core'' of the founding, and that \n     Washington was not a racist. His praise of the three \n     Confederate leaders, therefore, must be taken in context as \n     an expression of respect for men of honor and talent, but in \n     no way for the proslavery policies of the Confederacy.\n       Ashcroft was deploring, quite sensibly, that people are \n     being taught to despise and hate the Founders, instead of \n     respecting them for creating the first country in history \n     dedicated to the principle that ``all men are created \n     equal.''\n       My ``Vindicating the Founders'' shows that this dedication \n     led directly to the abolition of slavery in the northern \n     states, and to the 1787 law banning slavery from the \n     territories north of the Ohio River. These states became the \n     American heartland that later, following Lincoln's lead, \n     stood up for the founding principles, won the Civil War, and \n     abolished slavery throughout the country.\n       Contrary to opponents of his nomination, taken as a whole \n     this interview shows that Ashcroft is an admirer of the \n     ``liberty that was at the core'' of the American founding. He \n     is therefore likely to be especially respectful toward the \n     original meaning of the Constitution, which was designed to \n     secure ``the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our \n     posterity.''\n       The deeper point that Ashcroft was pointing to is this: \n     Liberals today generally agree with Bill Clinton, who said in \n     a 1997 speech that Thomas Jefferson's view of equality meant \n     that ``you had to be white, you had to be male, and . . . you \n     had to own property.'' Because Clinton and other liberals \n     misunderstand the founding so badly, they believe in a \n     ``living Constitution'' whose meaning changes to keep up with \n     the times. Or, as Clinton put it in the same speech, our \n     history is the story of ``new and higher definitions--and \n     more meaningful definitions--of equality and dignity and \n     freedom.''\n       John Ashcroft believes in the original definition of \n     equality and liberty: that all human beings deserve to be \n     free and to keep the property they earn with their own \n     hands, rather than have it taken away by a government that \n     pretends to know better than they do what to do with that \n     property.\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n       In the incoming Bush administration, with Ashcroft as \n     Attorney General, perhaps America has a chance to go back to \n     the genuine principles of the Founders, without trying to \n     come up with ``new and higher definitions'' of them, as has \n     been the habit of the past eight years.\n       Ashcroft has also been unjustly vilified for a speech at \n     Bob Jones University in 1999. His words, ``We have no king \n     but Jesus,'' have been denounced as narrow and bigoted--as if \n     the Constitution had some sort of religious test that \n     excludes serious Christians from public office. Yet in that \n     speech, as in the ``Southern Partisan'' interview, Ashcroft \n     singled out for his highest praise the Founders' inclusive \n     vision of equal rights for all.\n       To his Bob Jones audience, Ashcroft quotes with reverence \n     the Declaration's famous phrases, including ``endowed by our \n     Creator with certain inalienable rights.'' He celebrates the \n     fact that Christians, indeed most Americans, believe these \n     rights come from ``our Creator,'' not from a merely ``civic \n     and temporal'' source in ``Caesar'' or ``the king.'' For, as \n     Ashcroft knows, if our rights come merely from government, \n     then government may one day decide to take them away.\n       In this conviction he expresses his agreement with the \n     greatest statesmen and heroes of the past, from Washington \n     and Jefferson to Lincoln and Reagan.\n       Based on these two Ashcroft pronouncements--his ``Southern \n     Partisan'' interview, and his Bob Jones speech--a fair-minded \n     reader would conclude that Ashcroft is just the kind of man \n     that America needs as its next Attorney General: a man \n     devoted, to the depth of his heart, to the great principle of \n     the equality of men that has made America the greatest nation \n     on earth.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to discuss some civil rights issues \nsurrounding the nomination of Senator Ashcroft to be Attorney General. \nAt the hearings and in supplemental questions, my colleagues have \nraised issues concerning Senator Ashcroft's plans for the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice should he be confirmed as \nAttorney General. Let me say that I am confident that Senator Ashcroft \nwill fight for the civil rights and liberties of all Americans. He \nbelieves that everyone deserves an opportunity to succeed and that \nthose at the bottom of our society may need a helping hand.\n  Senator Ashcroft strongly supports ``affirmative access'' programs. \nAs he testified, ``We can expand the invitation for people to \nparticipate aggressively so that no one is denied the capacity to \nparticipate simply because they didn't know about the opportunities. We \ncan work on education, which is the best way for people to have access \nto achievement.''\n  Senator Ashcroft wants to encourage achievement and access to \nachievement. He wants to avoid what President Bush called the ``soft \nbigotry of low expectations'' that fuels many race-conscious programs.\n  It is true that Senator Ashcroft is skeptical about government \nprograms that categorize people by race. Many of these programs would \nbe unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand v. \nPena. That decision stated that all governmental racial classifications \nshould be subject to strict scrutiny, that is such classifications must \nbe narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The \nSupreme Court made clear that there was no such thing as a ``benign'' \nracial classification, and that the government may treat people \ndifferently because of their race for only the most compelling reason. \nThis view of governmental racial classifications comports with the \ndevelopment of constitutional protections for civil liberties. Senator \nAshcroft is solidly with the Supreme Court on this issue.\n  Some of my colleagues and certain special interest groups have \nespecially questioned Senator Ashcroft's ability to support and defend \ncivil liberties because he opposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to \nbe Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Well, all but one \nRepublican in the Judiciary Committee opposed this nominee. Let me say \nthat I have the highest personal regard for Mr. Lee and the difficult \ncircumstances in which his family came to this country, worked hard, \nand realized the American dream.\n  Despite this high personal regard, I was deeply concerned about Mr. \nLee's nomination because much of his career was devoted to preserving \nconstitutionally suspect race-conscious public policies that ultimately \nsort and divide citizens by race. At the time of his hearings, it was \nclear that he would have us continue down the road of racial spoils, a \nroad on which Americans are seen principally through the looking glass \nof race. As the Supreme Court has held, that would be unconstitutional.\n  Indeed, it is now clear that we were right to oppose the nomination \nof Mr. Lee. Over the Senate's objections, President Clinton made a \nrecess appointment of Mr. Lee to head the Civil Rights Division. His \nrecord has been one of pursuing constitutionally suspect, race-based \npolicies at great cost to civil liberties.\n  Under Mr. Lee's leadership, the Civil Rights Division has waged a war \nagainst testing standards in public sector employment based on what he \nconsiders to be the ``adverse impact'' of such testing. He has \nrepeatedly sought to replace objective hiring processes with devices \ndesigned to boost minorities.\n  In 1998, a federal judge, a Carter-appointee, assessed an \nunprecedented $1.8 million attorney fee award against the Civil Rights \nDivision for a lawsuit against the city of Torrance, California. The \nJudge found the suit ``frivolous, unreasonable and without \nfoundation.'' Despite this embarrassment, the Division continues to \nargue that using test results and hiring those who score best on the \ntest is, in the words of one civil rights division deputy, ``the worst \npossible way to select applicants.''\n  Furthermore, under Mr. Lee, the Civil Rights Division has continued \nthe legal challenge to Proposition 209, a measure that prohibited \ngovernment discrimination of Californians on the basis of race, gender, \nor national origin. These suits continue despite the fact that \nProposition 209 has repeatedly been upheld by federal courts.\n  Finally, under Bill Lann Lee, the Division continued to defend the \nfederal contract set-aside struck down by the Supreme Court in Adarand.\n  At the time of Mr. Lee's nomination I made a lengthy speech on this \nfloor. I regret that Mr. Lee's tenure has shown that my concerns were \nnot unfounded. Mr. Lee's actions show that he was unable to distinguish \nthe substantive role of being a law enforcer for all citizens from \nbeing a private activist litigator charged with pushing the limits of \nthe law.\n  Senator Ashcroft's principled opposition to Mr. Lee has been \nvindicated over time. Not only was Mr. Lee an activist, but he \ncontinued to pursue his activist agenda once in a position of trust for \nall Americans. The signs that he would do this were clear at his \nhearings at which he narrowly defined the rule in Adarand and could not \ndistinguish cases that he would bring as Assistant Attorney General \nfrom those he brought in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n  By contrast, Senator Ashcroft has repeatedly distinguished his role \nas a legislator from that of the Attorney General. He understands that \nhis political advocacy gets checked at the door of the Department of \nJustice. Senator Ashcroft has repeatedly stated that he would enforce \nthe law as it exists to protect the civil liberties of all Americans. \nHe is committed to defending the constitutional rights of all \nindividuals and has testified that he will make the enforcement of \ncivil rights one of his topmost priorities. As Senator Ashcroft stated, \n``My highest priority is to ensure that the Department of Justice lives \nup to its heritage of enforcing the rule of law, and in particular, \nguaranteeing legal rights for the advancement of all Americans. . . . \n[O]ne of my highest priorities at the Department will be to target the \nunconstitutional practice of racial profiling.''\n  Senator Ashcroft will be a faithful guardian of our civil liberties, \nand it is for this reason and many others that I wholeheartedly support \nhis nomination to be Attorney General.\n  Mr. President, some claim that Senator Ashcroft will not uphold the \nlaw with regard to abortion.\n  I think it would be appropriate at this time to set the record \nstraight on John Ashcroft's record and commitments regarding abortion--\nan issue we have heard a lot about during this confirmation process.\n  While Senator Ashcroft's critics have spared nothing in their \nattempts to distort his record and create fear, Senator Ashcroft's \nrecord over 25 years as a public servant, and his testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing, demonstrate his \nlifelong commitment to the rule of law and his respect for the uniquely\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\ndifferent roles of a legislator and a law enforcer. Senator Ashcroft \nhas proven that he can objectively interpret and enforce the law--even \nwhere the law may diverge from his personal views on policy. His record \nand character demonstrate that he can be, as he has pledged, ``law \noriented and not results oriented.''\n  Contrary to the fear-mongering of his critics, Senator Ashcroft will \nenforce the law protecting a woman's right to an abortion. He was very \nstraightforward in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee when he \nstated that, in his view, Roe versus Wade is settled law and that the \nSupreme Court's decisions upholding Roe ``have been multiple, they have \nbeen recent and they have been emphatic.'' He said he would enforce the \nlaw as interpreted by the Supreme Court.\n  When asked whether he would seek to change the Supreme Court's \ninterpretation of the law, Senator Ashcroft stated that ``it is not the \nagenda of the President-elect to seek an opportunity to overturn Roe. \nAnd as his Attorney General, I don't think it could be my agenda to \nseek an opportunity to overturn Roe.'' He also stated that as Attorney \nGeneral, it wouldn't be his job to ``try and alter the position of the \nadministration.''\n  Senator Ashcroft clearly recognized the importance of not devaluing \n``the currency'' of the Solicitor General's Office by taking matters to \nthe Supreme Court on a basis the Court has already stated it does not \nwant to entertain. He noted that in this way, ``accepting Roe and Casey \nas settled law is important, not just to this arena, but important in \nterms of the credibility of the Department.''\n  He said he would give advice based upon sound legal analysis, not \nideology or personal beliefs. He made a commitment that ``if the law \nprovides something that is contrary to my ideological belief, I would \nprovide them with that same best judgment of the law.''\n  From Senator Ashcroft, those are not just words. Throughout his \ncareer, he has demonstrated that he can do just that.\n  For example, as Missouri Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft did not \nlet his personal opinion on abortion cloud his legal analysis. He \nprotected the confidentiality of abortion records maintained by the \nMissouri Department of Health--even when they were requested by pro-\nlife groups.\n  Likewise, when asked to determine whether a death certificate was \nrequired for all abortions, regardless of the age of the fetus, \nAttorney General Ashcroft--despite his personal view that life begins \nat conception--issued an opinion that Missouri law did not require any \ntype of certificate if the fetus was 20 weeks old or less. His legal \nanalysis was fair and objective and unaffected by what his policy views \nmay have been.\n  There has also been, what I consider, unfounded skepticism over \nwhether Senator Ashcroft would vigorously enforce clinic access and \nantiviolence statutes. Being pro-life is not inconsistent with opposing \nviolence at clinics. The primary focus of the opposition has been the \nFreedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of ``FACE''. Senator Ashcroft \nsupports the FACE law, and always has.\n  Senator Ashcroft testified specifically on how he would enforce FACE \nand other clinic access and antiviolence laws. He stated clearly that \nhe would enforce these laws ``vigorously'', that he would investigate \nallegations ``thoroughly'' and that he would devote resources to these \ncases on a ``'priority basis.''\n  He further stated that he would maintain the appropriate task forces \nwhich have been created to facilitate enforcement of clinic access and \nantiviolence statutes.\n  These statements are totally consistent with Senator Ashcroft's long \nrecord of speaking out against violence and his belief that the first \namendment does not give anyone the right to ``violate the person, \nsafety, and security'' of another.\n  Senator Ashcroft has always spoken out against clinic violence and \nother forms of domestic terrorism. He has written to constituents about \nhis strong opposition to violence and his belief that, regardless of \nhis personal views on abortion, people should be able to enter abortion \nclinics safely. He voted for Senator Schumer's amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill that made debts incurred as a result of abortion clinic \nviolence non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft has always condemned criminal violence at abortion \nclinics--or anywhere for that matter--and believes people who commit \nthese acts of violence and intimidation should be punished to the \nfullest extent of the law. As Attorney General he'll do just that.\n  Access to contraceptives is another area that I think Senator \nAshcroft has been unfairly criticized. His critics make dire \npredictions about the future that are totally unsupported by Senator \nAshcroft's testimony. Senator Ashcroft could not have testified any \nmore clearly on the issue of contraception. He stated that: ``I think \nindividuals who want to use contraceptives have every right to do so . \n. . [and] I think that right is guaranteed by the Constitution of the \nUnited States.'' He also testified that he would defend current laws \nshould they be attacked. What more can he say? Is there anything a pro-\nlife nominee could say to please the pro-abortion interest groups?\n  Senator Ashcroft's opponents take great pains to say that they do not \noppose him on ideological grounds. Well you could have fooled me. Their \nargument is that someone who has been active in advocating a particular \npolicy position cannot set that aside and enforce the law fairly. I \ndon't believe they can be serious. Does this mean that a person of \ncharacter and integrity who had been active in the pro-choice movement \ncould never be Attorney General? And what about the death penalty? \nCould we have no future Attorney General, regardless of how honest and \nwell-qualified, who opposed the death penalty? Of course not. In fact, \nRepublicans voted to confirm Janet Reno, despite her personal \nopposition to the death penalty, because she said she could still \nenforce the law even though she disagreed with it.\n  If this is not about ideology, then we should get to the business of \nconfirming Senator Ashcroft. He has given strong and specific \nassurances to the Senate on abortion and other questions. These \nassurances are backed up by his proven record as Missouri attorney \ngeneral and Governor. Most importantly, they are backed up by Senator \nAshcroft's personal integrity and decency--characteristics he holds as \nis known personally by almost every Member of this body.\n  Members know John Ashcroft is a man of his word--it's time that they \nact on it and confirm him as Attorney General.\n  Mr. President, some have criticized Senator Ashcroft's handling of \nvoter registration in Missouri. Some of my colleagues have charged that \nas Governor, John Ashcroft essentially blocked two bills that would \nhave required the city of St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners to \ndeputize private voter registration volunteers. These bills were \nopposed by both Democrats and Republicans in St. Louis. Opposition \nincluded the bipartisan St. Louis County Board of Election \nCommissioners, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen President Tom Villa, and \nSt. Louis circuit attorney George Peach. Tom Villa was a noted \nDemocratic leader, and St. Louis circuit attorney George Peach was a \nDemocrat who was the prosecutor in the St. Louis area. All of these \npeople opposed the legislative plan. The recommendations of these \nofficials was one of the reasons that John Ashcroft vetoed the bills.\n  It was insinuated during the hearings that these actions were taken \nout of some kind of partisan or racial motivation, because the city of \nSt. Louis is predominantly black and Democratic. But this implication \nis seriously discredited by the history of voter registration in St. \nLouis and earlier Federal court cases.\n  The city board has a long history of refusing to deputize private \nvoter registration deputies, long before John Ashcroft appointed anyone \nto that board. Indeed, in 1981 a lawsuit was filed against the members \nof the St. Louis board concerning the failure to deputize voter \nregistration deputies. The Federal District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri explicitly rejected charges of racial animus. The \ncourt found that the board properly refused to deputize volunteers to \nprevent\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nfraud and ensure impartiality and administrative efficiency. Moreover, \nthese conclusions were sustained by the eighth circuit, in an opinion \nby Judge McMillan, a prominent African-American jurist.\n  Some have also claimed that then-Governor Ashcroft refused to appoint \na diverse group of commissioners to the election board. This is simply \nuntrue. Mr. Jerry Hunter, the former labor secretary of Missouri, \ntestified that Senator Ashcroft worked hard to increase black \nrepresentation on the St. Louis City Election Board, but his efforts \nwere stalled by State senators.\n  Mr. Hunter testified that, ``Governor Ashcroft's first black nominee \nfor the St. Louis City Election Board was rejected by the black State \nsenator, because that person did not come out of his organization.'' \nWhen then-Governor Ashcroft came up with a second black attorney, this \ncandidate was also rejected by two black State senators. As Mr. Hunter \nstated, ``[F]rom the beginning, any efforts to make changes in the St. \nLouis City Election Board were forestalled because the state senators \nwanted people from their own organization.'' Apparently for these State \nsenators the political spoils system was more important than the voters \nof St. Louis.\n  Finally, my colleagues imply that these voter registration issues \nwill make Senator Ashcroft less able to deal with allegations of voting \nimproprieties resulting from the Florida vote in the Presidential \nelection. Yet Senator Ashcroft has repeatedly testified, ``I will \ninvestigate any alleged voting rights violation that has credible \nevidence. . . . I have no reason not to go forward, and would not \nrefuse to go forward for any reason other than a conclusion that there \nwasn't credible evidence to pursue the case.''\n  Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have continued to express \nconcerns about Senator Ashcroft's actions with regard to conducting a \ntelephone interview with a magazine called Southern Partisan. Their \nconcern is what message that interview might have sent to the country. \nIt is clear, however, that Senator Ashcroft has forthrightly and \nforcefully condemned racism and discrimination, and he has left no \ndoubt or ambiguity regarding his views on that matter.\n  During his confirmation hearings, Senator Ashcroft said, ``Let me \nmake something as plain as I can make it. Discrimination is wrong. \nSlavery was abhorrent. Fundamental to my belief in freedom and liberty \nis that these are God-given rights.'' And in his responses to written \nquestions, he said, ``I reject racism in all its forms. I find racial \ndiscrimination abhorrent, and against everything that I believe in.'' \nIt is clear to me that John Ashcroft believes in equal treatment under \nthe law for everyone. He believes in it, and he has committed to fight \nto make it a reality for all Americans.\n  Now, as to the magazine itself, Senator Ashcroft contritely admitted \nthat he does not know very much about it. He confessed that he should \nhave done more research about it before talking to them. And he said \nthat he did not intend his telephone interview--or any other interview \nhe has participated in during his career--as an automatic endorsement \nof the editorial positions of those publications. John Ashcroft went \neven further than that. He said, ``I condemn those things which are \ncondemnable'' about Southern Partisan magazine. This was a strong \nstatement against any unacceptable ideas discussed in that publication. \nAnd it was the strongest statement possible from someone who did not \npersonally know the facts.\n  Despite Senator Ashcroft's contriteness and strong words, some \nSenators and interest groups have demanded that Senator Ashcroft go out \non a limb and add his derision based upon an acceptance at face value \nof all the negative allegations concerning that magazine. In my \nopinion, Mr. President, this led to one of the most profound moments of \nthe confirmation hearings. A member of the committee pushed Senator \nAshcroft to label the Southern Partisan magazine as ``racist''--even \nafter Senator Ashcroft explained that he did not know whether that was \ntrue. The profound part was John Ashcroft's response. He said, ``I know \nthey've been accused of being racist. I have to say this, Senator: I \nwould rather be falsely accused of being a racist than to falsely \naccuse someone else of being a racist.'' This exchange tells volumes \nabout Senator Ashcroft's moral character, deep sense of fairness, and \nhis fitness for the office of Attorney General. It would have been a \nlot easier for him just to say, ``Yes, I agree with anyone who uses \nthat term about someone else.'' Doing so would have saved him from \nfurther bashing by the committee and the press. It would have been \npolitically expedient. But John Ashcroft choose to take the high road, \nnot to heap disdain onto something he didn't know about just because it \nwould have suited his interests to do so. This was a vivid example of \ngood judgment and good character.\n\n  This is not to say that John Ashcroft defended anything about the \nmagazine. Clearly he did not. In fact, when Senator Biden asked him \nwhether the magazine was condemnable because it sells T-shirts that \nimply that Lincoln's assassin did a good thing, he answered: ``If they \ndo that, I condemn'' it. And he clarified that ``Abraham Lincoln is my \nfavorite political figure in the history of this country.'' What John \nAshcroft did was state his absolute intolerance for racism and bigotry, \nand he did so honestly without creating a straw man, a scapegoat, or a \nfall guy.\n  I think we need to ask anyone who is not satisfied with John \nAshcroft's answers what they really want. What do his accusers think \njustice is? I surely hope that no one in this body would say that \njustice means the knee-jerk condemnation of things they do not know \nabout, so long as that condemnation is politically expedient.\n  Mr. President, I think this issue has shed light on why John Ashcroft \nwill be a fair and principled Attorney General. As he told the \nJudiciary Committee, ``I believe racism is wrong. I repudiate it. I \nrepudiate racist organizations. I'm not a member of any of them. I \ndon't subscribe to them. And I reject them.'' These are straightforward \nwords from an honest man. I look forward to having such a man running \nour Department of Justice.\n  Mr. President, I heard one of my colleagues today criticize Senator \nAshcroft's view of the second amendment. While I disagree with these \nvague criticisms, I do believe that one of the biggest challenges that \nSenator Ashcroft will face as Attorney General is to increase the \nprosecution of federal gun crimes. Where there is little consensus in \nCongress regarding new gun control legislation, there is widespread \nconsensus that current gun laws can and should be prosecuted more \nvigorously.\n  While the Clinton administration has increased the regulation of \nlicensed gun dealers, it has not increased the prosecution of Federal \ngun crimes in a like manner. For example:\n  Between 1992 and 1998, prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm \nin the commission of a felony dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7.045 to \napproximately 3,800.\n  It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school grounds, but the \nClinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight cases under this law \nin 1998, even though more than 6,000 students brought guns to school. \nThe Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only five such cases in 1997.\n  It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a juvenile, but the \nClinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases under this law in \n1998 and only five in 1997.\n  It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a semiautomatic assault \nweapon, but the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only four cases \nunder this law in 1998 and only four in 1997.\n  As his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee made clear, \nSenator Ashcroft will reverse this trend and make gun prosecutions a \npriority. In the Senate, John Ashcroft was one of the leaders in \nfighting gun crimes. For example, in response to the decline in gun \nprosecutions by the Justice Department, Senator Ashcroft sponsored \nlegislation to authorize $50 million to hire additional Federal \nprosecutors and agents to increase the Federal prosecution of criminals \nwho use guns.\n  In addition, Senator Ashcroft authored legislation to prohibit \njuveniles from possessing assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition \nclips. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Ashcroft juvenile assault \nweapons ban in May of 1999.\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\n  Senator Ashcroft voted for legislation that prohibits any person \nconvicted of even misdemeanor acts of domestic violence from possessing \na firearm, and he voted for legislation to extend the Brady Act to \nprohibit persons who commit violent crimes as juveniles from possessing \nfirearms.\n  In order to close the so-called ``gun show loophole,'' Senator \nAshcroft voted for legislation, which I authored, to require mandatory \ninstant background checks for all firearm purchases at gun shows.\n  Senator Ashcroft sponsored legislation to require a 5-year mandatory \nminimum prison sentence for Federal gun crimes and for legislation to \nencourage schools to expel students who bring guns to school.\n  Senator Ashcroft voted for the Gun-Free Schools Zone Act that \nprohibits the possession of a firearm in a school zone, and he voted \nfor legislation to require gun dealers to offer child safety locks and \nother gun safety devices for sale.\n  As a former state attorney general and president of the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, Senator Ashcroft knows that criminal \nlaws are useless if not enforced. Given his proven commitment to \nfighting gun violence, there can be little doubt that Attorney General \nAshcroft will make gun prosecutions a priority for the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address one more issue concerning \nSenator Ashcroft's position on gun enforcement. Some special-interest \ngroups have made the ridiculous assertion that an Ashcroft Justice \nDepartment would not defend the constitutionality of certain gun laws. \nAs Senator Ashcroft noted at his hearing, there is a longstanding \npolicy for the Solicitor General's office to defend Federal statutes in \ncourt if there is a reasonable basis for doing so. In other words, the \nJustice Department will defend Federal statutes even if that particular \nadministration does not agree with the statute as a matter of policy. \nThis longstanding policy applies to all Federal statutes, except those \nwhich infringe on the prerogatives of the President. This longstanding \npolicy promotes the integrity and the consistent administration of \nFederal law.\n  At his confirmation hearing, in response to Senator Kennedy, Senator \nAshcroft pledged to ``vigorously defend'' the constitutionality of the \nban on possession of firearms by persons convicted of domestic \nviolence. In fact, Senator Ashcroft voted for the legislation that \nprohibited persons convicted of domestic violence from possessing \nfirearms. And in response both to Senators Feinstein and Kennedy, \nSenator Ashcroft pledged to maintain the Justice Department's position \nof defending the constitutionality of the assault weapons ban. In \nshort, Senator Ashcroft made clear that the Justice Department would \ndefend and enforce Federal gun laws whether or not he agreed with such \nlaws as a matter of policy.\n  Senator Ashcroft's record as Missouri attorney general supports his \npledge to defend and enforce gun laws regardless of his personal \nbeliefs. For example, as the attorney general of Missouri, John \nAshcroft issued an opinion which interpreted state law to prohibit \nprosecuting attorneys from carrying concealed weapons, even though some \nprosecuting attorneys conducted their own investigations and faced \ndangerous situations. This is a classic example of John Ashcroft \nupholding the law even when he did not agree with it.\n  In short, John Ashcroft is a man of integrity and great ability. With \nJohn Ashcroft as Attorney General, I am confident that the Justice \nDepartment will enforce Federal gun laws with unprecedented zeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, as many of my colleagues \nhave done, in support of my friend and our friend, Senator John \nAshcroft, to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  It is always interesting, as the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia has indicated, to look at people's views in a situation such \nas this. And I must say that while I respect the Senator's views and \nher comments, I guess what I will describe as allegations, I do have a \ndifferent view. This does not add up to the John Ashcroft I know as a \nneighbor.\n  We have heard the debate. It has been considerable. We have all heard \nthe charge that Senator Ashcroft is somehow not fit to serve as \nAttorney General. But that really does not square with the John \nAshcroft I know.\n  We in Kansas have watched our neighbor and observed his record for a \ngreat number of years. We think we know this man. Again, I don't think \nthe record really squares with the charges and the allegations that \nhave been tossed about for the last several weeks.\n  As Missouri attorney general, John Ashcroft strictly enforced laws \nthat differed from his own beliefs. I repeat that. That seems to be the \ncrucial issue here. He strictly enforced laws that actually differed \nfrom his own beliefs, including firearms--we have heard a lot of talk \nabout firearms--whether prosecuting attorneys could actually carry \nconcealed weapons; here is one on abortion and that dealt with the \nconfidentiality of hospital records on numbers of abortions that were \nperformed; whether a death certificate was legally required for fetuses \nunder 20 weeks; church and state; the availability of funds for private \nand religious schools, and the distribution of religious materials in \npublic schools; quite a few environmental regulations; and also in \nregard to affirmative action.\n  If Senator Ashcroft could not honestly enforce the law, wouldn't \nsomebody have documented such an instance by now in relation to these \nlaws he did enforce that involved strong beliefs with which he did not \nagree? I don't think they have, despite the rhetoric.\n  I will talk a little bit about experience. John Ashcroft, regardless \nof your view about his stance on the issues or his ideology or selected \nquotes, is the most experienced Attorney General nominee in American \nhistory. Boy, that is a strong statement, but consider the facts. Of \nthe 67 persons who have served in that office since the founding of the \nRepublic, only one, John Ashcroft, has served as State attorney \ngeneral--that is two terms--and Governor of his State--two terms--and \nas a U.S. Senator with service on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  As Missouri AG, John Ashcroft was elected the president of the \nNational Association of Attorneys General. As Missouri Governor, he was \nelected chairman of the National Governors' Association. If John \nAshcroft's execution of these earlier public trusts was as far ``out of \nthe mainstream'' as his critics now claim, wouldn't his fellow State \nattorneys general or Governors, including Democrats, have noticed and \nsaid something?\n  His colleagues universally admire his devotion to his faith. Mr. \nByrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, spoke to that \nearlier today and made some excellent comments. Does that not imply he \nis then a man of conscience, that he will do what he says he will do? \nJohn Ashcroft himself said:\n\n       My primary personal belief is that the law is supreme; that \n     I don't place myself above the law, and I shouldn't place \n     myself above the law. So it would violate my beliefs to do \n     it.\n\n  He will enforce the law.\n  Perhaps the most serious of the charges against the Senator, our \nformer colleague, is that he is somehow--and I don't like to use this \nterm, but it has been bandied about--a racist because of his opposition \nto Justice Ronnie White. I do not think, in knowing the man and in \nlooking at the record very carefully, there is any evidence of racial \nbias in Senator Ashcroft's record.\n  Among other initiatives--and this has been said before on the floor, \nand it deserves repeating--this is a man who signed Missouri's first \nhate crimes statute into law. He signed into law the bill establishing \na Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday in Missouri. He appointed the first \nAfrican American woman to the Missouri Court of Appeals. He has been a \nleader in opposition to racial profiling.\n  In my personal view, there were good reasons that Senator Ashcroft \nopposed the White confirmation and that every Republican Senator then \nvoted no. Justice White, during his tenure on the Missouri Supreme \nCourt, was notable for his anti-death-penalty and procriminal bias, \nwhich led to strong bipartisan opposition from the law enforcement \ncommunity to his lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\n  Let me point this out. More than 70 percent of all elected officials \nin Missouri, including sheriffs, are Democrats; and 77 of the 114 \nMissouri sheriffs, including many Democrats, were on record in \nunprecedented opposition to Justice White's confirmation. The Missouri \nFederation of Police Chiefs and the National Sheriffs Association were \nalso against that confirmation. I voted no. I did not know at the time \nwhen I cast that vote of Justice White's African American status. I \ndidn't know that. As a matter of fact, in talking with fellow \nRepublicans, many of us did not know that. John Ashcroft never \nmentioned that. That wasn't the reason we opposed him.\n  Senator Ashcroft's opponents accuse him of being out of the \nmainstream and in support of private ownership of firearms. They say \nhis support of firearms as a guard against government tyranny is ``talk \nof a madman.'' I think we ought to look at the record.\n  As State attorney general and Governor, John Ashcroft conscientiously \nenforced both State and Federal gun laws, even those with which he \ndisagreed. That again is the crucial issue. His record does contrast \nsharply with the Clinton Justice Department's failure to enforce \nexisting Federal gun laws, even while calling for new ones.\n  The second amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted to preserve \na traditional right of the people as a guard against government \nencroachment, and that point is beyond dispute. If John Ashcroft is ``a \nmadman'' or ``out of the mainstream,'' so were James Madison, Alexander \nHamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Noah Webster, Abraham Lincoln, Hubert \nHumphrey, and other notable Americans who held that same view.\n  Despite the harsh words being hurled in Washington about this \nnomination, many in our Nation's heartland, in Kansas and Nebraska, \nOklahoma, Missouri, know, understand, have seen him up close and \npersonal as neighbors. We know he is an outstanding public servant and \nwill make an outstanding Attorney General.\n  Listen to what the Atlanta Journal and Constitution has to say about \nthis nomination:\n\n       Ashcroft is certainly conservative, and he is certainly \n     religious. But 88 percent of his fellow citizens report \n     that religion is important or very important in their \n     lives, a figure that has barely varied over the past 20 \n     years. Seventy percent or more believe the nation would be \n     better off if it were more religious, and 79 percent favor \n     prayer or at least a moment of silence in the public \n     schools. So who's out of the mainstream?\n       Ashcroft strongly opposes abortion on moral grounds; 55 \n     percent of the people say it is ``morally wrong most of the \n     time.'' The nominee would like to see sharp restrictions on \n     when an abortion would be legal; only 28 percent of Americans \n     think it should be legal under any circumstances. He \n     absolutely opposes partial-birth abortion; so do 66 percent \n     of Americans. Who are the extremists on this issue?\n       Actually, none of these attacks on Ashcroft's beliefs has \n     much real meaning because he has already demonstrated, as \n     Attorney General of Missouri, that he is perfectly capable of \n     following the law as it is, rather than as he might wish it \n     were.\n\n  Again, that is the basic point I make.\n\n       Maybe it is difficult for his opponents to believe that he \n     could so carefully separate his personal views from his task \n     as chief enforcer of the nation's laws because they have so \n     much trouble doing that themselves. But we believe he can and \n     will do so and that the American mainstream which was invoked \n     so frequently at his hearings will be well served and \n     satisfied with the job that he will do.\n\n  I certainly agree that America will be well served with Senator \nAshcroft's confirmation by the Senate. I intend to vote for him. I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  One other thing: John Ashcroft and I spent a little time together--3 \ndays--up in the wilds of Alaska. We were up there at the invitation of \nSenator Ted Stevens. There is a fishing contest up there. The Presiding \nOfficer is very skilled, by the way, in taking part in that whole \nfishing contest. The proceeds are used to improve the habitat on the \nKenai River.\n  We had a great deal to say to each other, both Senator Ashcroft and \nmyself, when we were fishing in that kind of circumstance. We didn't \ntalk about anything that involved racism, or Bob Jones University, or \nselected quotes, or whatever; we talked as individuals and as friends. \nI did not hear a bitter or prejudicial word. We talked about what \nthings mean in life basically. We talked about family and of the Lord's \ncreation. We talked as fellow men. We talked about the privilege to \nserve in the Senate. We told a lot of stories about human beings, we \ntalked a lot about fishing, and we talked a lot about friendship. I \nthink when we can spend time with a man in that kind of circumstance, \nwe really get to know him.\n  Personally, I just want to say I am having a lot of trouble figuring \nout whom the critics are talking about in regard to the John Ashcroft I \nknow and respect. I think he will make a great Attorney General. And, \nquite frankly, I think at the end of the day when he reaches out in an \nact of friendship and trust across the aisle to many of his critics, we \nare going to be just fine.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I gather that the order set is that Senator \nDodd will speak and then Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order at this point.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order be \nas follows: That following Senator Dodd, Senator Cochran speak, and \nthat I be permitted to speak following Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, at the outset I commend my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee, the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat, and the \nrespective members of the committee for the manner in which they \nconducted the confirmation hearing for the position of Attorney General \nof the United States and for the manner in which they treated John \nAshcroft, President Bush's nominee for this position.\n  It is a difficult job, particularly when the nomination is \ncontroversial. I think the members of the Judiciary Committee, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, conducted themselves with great dignity, and \nI commend them for it.\n  Mr. President, I am going to vote to confirm John Ashcroft as U.S. \nAttorney General. I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's \ntime to explain my reasons.\n  Let me say at the outset that I hope Mr. Ashcroft will listen to what \nI have to say here this afternoon. My comments are delivered primarily \nfor the benefit of my colleagues and my constituents. But they are also \ndirected to John Ashcroft.\n  It is important that John Ashcroft understand that my support of his \nnomination is not unqualified. It is given, rather, only upon extensive \nreflection and despite concerns about what kind of Attorney General he \nwill make.\n  I have listened attentively to the comments of our colleagues both in \nsupport of and in opposition to this nomination. I respect immensely \ntheir views. I have considered the practices and precedents of the \nSenate in deferring to presidential cabinet appointments. And I have \nreflected upon my own practices over the past two decades in the Senate \nin considering such appointments. During that time, I have supported an \noverwhelming number of Cabinet nominees. But I have, on the rarest \noccasions, opposed Cabinet nominees supported by the majority of \nmembers of the Senate and by a majority of my own party. It also bears \nmentioning that I have supported nominees opposed by most members of my \nparty and, in one instance, also opposed by a majority of the Senate.\n  My concerns about this particular nominee can be reduced to three in \nparticular:\n  First, whether he will uphold and vigorously enforce our laws--\nespecially those with which he personally disagrees.\n  Second, whether he will treat other people in public life as he \nwishes to be treated--particularly those with whom he may disagree.\n  And third, whether he will seek to unify rather than divide our \nnation on critical issues facing our nation, especially the issue of \nracial justice.\n  Let me address these concerns in order.\n  First, as to John Ashcroft's disposition to enforce the law. The \nAttorney General, as we all know, is our nation's\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\nprimary law enforcement officer. This is an office of unique \nimportance.\n  Except perhaps for the president himself, no other individual can or \nshould do more to protect the public's safety, and to promote the ideal \nof equal justice that is the North Star in our constellation of laws.\n  Like many others in public life, John Ashcroft is a man of strong \nconvictions. He should be commended, not faulted, for that fact. But \nthe question that arises with respect to his nomination for this \nparticular office is whether those convictions--on matters such as a \nwoman's right to choose and gun safety--might well preclude him from \nenforcing laws on those and similar issues with which he may disagree.\n  This is a threshold question. If the nation's top law enforcement \nofficer cannot enforce the law, how can anyone say he should \nnevertheless assume the office? If the public cannot know with \nreasonable assurance that their Attorney General will uphold our laws \nvigorously and free of personal bias, then how can we be confident that \nrespect for the law will not be weakened?\n  If minority Americans, women, and others cannot rely on the Attorney \nGeneral to safeguard their liberties, how can other--indeed, all--\nAmericans not worry that their rights might one day be placed at risk, \nas well?\n  John Ashcroft has minced no words about his positions on issues like \na woman's right to choose and gun safety. He has advocated positions \ncontrary to current law. That is his record. It is also, I might add, \nhis right--just as any of us has the right to advocate legal change.\n  But that is far from saying that he cannot faithfully enforce the \nlaw. There is more to his record that deserves consideration. This is a \nman who was elected not once, but five times by a majority of the \npeople of his state--as their attorney general, governor, and Senator. \nHe has devoted nearly three decades of his life to public service. He \nhas, as far as anyone knows, upheld the public's trust throughout that \ntime.\n  If his nomination were to be decided on the basis of experience \nalone, he would have been among the first, rather than the last, of the \nPresident's Cabinet nominees to be considered by the Senate.\n  As Attorney General and Governor, the record suggests that he did, in \nfact, uphold and advocate laws with which he disagreed. He endorsed \nDemocratic proposals to fund new roads and schools. He signed \nlegislation to increase the penalties for crimes motivated by bigotry. \nHe supported additional resources for legal services for the indigent.\n  During his confirmation hearing, he swore under oath that he would \nuphold the law ``so help me God.'' He did so repeatedly and fervently. \nHe swore that he would respect Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey as the law of the land. He swore to uphold the federal law that \nprevents violence and intimidation at family planning clinics. He \ntestified that the Brady law and the assault weapons ban are \nconstitutional.\n  He also testified that mandatory trigger locks, gun licensing and gun \nregistration are all constitutional. And he vowed to hire without \nregard to sexual preference (although he did not, I should add, pledge \nto continue Attorney General Reno's policy of excluding sexual \npreference from security clearance decisions).\n  I do not expect that John Ashcroft will change his views as Attorney \nGeneral. But I do, have every right to expect, based upon his \ncommitment to God Almighty, before the Judiciary Committee that he will \nkeep his word to uphold the laws of the land, even those with which he \nprofoundly disagrees.\n  Mr. President, I would love to have the complete and total assurance \nhe would do that. I cannot honestly conclude that he would not. Thus, \nit compels me to give him the benefit of the doubt because he has taken \nthat oath fervently, before God Almighty, and members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  A second concern I have about Senator Ashcroft's nomination is how he \nhas treated other people. I refer very specifically to his conduct \ntoward Judge Ronnie White, Ambassador James Hormel, and Bill Lann Lee, \nformer head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division.\n  Other colleagues have spoken and will speak about these cases in \ngreater detail. Suffice it to say his treatment of their nominations \nwent beyond the bounds of good manners and common decency. Too often, \nJohn Ashcroft refused to meet with these people; he failed to give them \nan opportunity to respond to the allegations, and he distorted, in my \nview, their records.\n  In the case of Mr. Hormel, he deemed the wholly private matter of \nsexual orientation to be a factor ``eligible for consideration'' in \nwhether he ought to be nominated.\n  In the case of Judge White, he actively worked for his defeat--\nwithout first giving him a chance to respond to misleading statements \nmade against him on the Senate floor.\n  His treatment of these men was cavalier at best--callous and \ncalculated at worst. It is particularly troubling because my own \nlimited experience with Senator Ashcroft was of a quite different \nnature.\n  We worked together on only one issue that I recall--ending the \nembargo on food and medicine to Cuba. In that effort, he took a \nposition that engendered considerable opposition in his own caucus. At \nall times, I found him reasonable and trustworthy.\n  But there is nevertheless a record here of going after people in a \nharsh and unfair manner. I have always been suspicious of people who \ntry to build a political career in part on the bones of their personal \nadversaries. Attacking motives, using people as political scapegoats, \nacting with reckless disregard to the reputations of others--these are \nthe kinds of actions that I find contemptible, and that unfortunately \nhave become all too common in public life today.\n  I hope John Ashcroft will change and turn away from such behavior in \nthe future. I believe that he can. As the saying goes, ``There is no \nsinner without a future, and no saint without a past.'' I believe John \nAshcroft is a decent human being, and I take him at his word.\n  If his flaws loom large, it is at least in part because they have \nbeen aired and examined in the magnifying light of public life.\n  And while I will not excuse these flaws--particularly in his \ntreatment of others as a public official--I will not engage in the same \nform of pay-back politics that seems to have a growing currency in our \ntime. That is not to suggest that those who oppose him will have \nengaged in such tactics. On the contrary, I can well understand the \nprincipled basis of their opposition.\n  That said, I will not do to John Ashcroft what has been done to too \nmany people in recent years--including people like Ronnie White, James \nHormel, and Bill Lann Lee. These individuals do not deserve the \ntreatment they received. No one does. Not even John Ashcroft.\n  My third and final concern is closely related to the first: whether \nhis views on the critical domestic issues of our day would preclude him \nfrom using his office not just to uphold the law, but to uphold the \nspirit of freedom and equal justice that permeates every one of our \nlaws.\n  I find it not a little ironic that our new President, who calls \nhimself a ``uniter, not a divider'', nominated for Attorney General a \nman who throughout his career has plunged so divisively into the most \ndivisive issues of our time: civil rights, women's rights, equal \nrights, gun safety.\n  On a different level, I am not in the least surprised. The President \nchose a nominee who reflects his own views on many of these same \nissues. I did not expect him to nominate a Democrat.\n  Like nearly all of our colleagues, I have time and again supported \nCabinet and other nominees with whom I disagreed on critical issues.\n  Like them, I have a high degree of tolerance for differences of \nopinions when such nominations come before us--including on such issues \nas choice and guns. Indeed, I supported the nomination of Governor \nThompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services, despite our strong \ndifferences on issues related to a woman's right to choose.\n  There are certain differences that, I would argue, none of us should \ntolerate. And in that respect, the issue in John Ashcroft's public \nrecord that concerns me the most is the issue of race.\n  If I thought John Ashcroft was a racist, I would oppose him as \nstrongly as\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nI possibly could on any other issue I have ever faced in my 25 years of \npublic service. I urge each of our colleagues to do the same. We must \nnot tolerate intolerance. But I do not believe that such a potent word \napplies to John Ashcroft. And it is lamentable, to say the least, that \nsome outside of the Senate have used it to describe him.\n  We of all people here in the Senate appreciate that words have \nmeaning. So when someone uses a word such as ``racist'' to describe \nactions that, however objectionable, are not racist, then they reduce \nthe impact of that word at those moments when it is most applicable.\n  While by no means a path-breaker, as governor, John Ashcroft \nappointed more African-American jurists to the bench than any of his \npredecessors. He appointed a number of women, as well. His wife has \ntaught at Howard University, a predominantly black institution. People \nof color testified in support of his nomination. Even Judge Ronnie \nWhite--about whom I will say more in a moment--said that he does not \nbelieve Senator Ashcroft's opposition to his nomination was racist in \nnature.\n  In the Senate, he held a hearing on and condemned the practice of \nracial profiling. He supported twenty-six judicial nominees of African-\nAmerican descent.\n  And it should not go unmentioned that at least one member of his \nSenate staff--a devout Jew--has written that he found Senator Ashcroft \nnot only tolerant, but supportive of his religious beliefs and the \npractical demands that those beliefs placed upon his time.\n  Nevertheless, I am deeply troubled by many of his actions in this \narea. Most notably, he vehemently and persistently opposed efforts to \nintegrate the St. Louis public schools. In fact, his actions were so \nvexatious that he was nearly cited for contempt for failing to comply \nwith court orders to submit a plan to desegregate the schools of that \nfine city. He walked up to the line of disobeying the law--even \nappearing to boast of that fact when he ran for Governor for the first \ntime. Those actions trouble me deeply.\n  The record suggests that in times past John Ashcroft has submitted to \nthe temptation to divide Americans along racial lines.\n  The same record also suggests that he is someone without personal \nbias on matters of race, who has tried to heal rather than deepen our \nnation's ancient racial wounds. I hope that it is that John Ashcroft \nwho, if confirmed, will lead the Department of Justice. Our nation has \ntraveled too far--and we have too far still to go--to relent for even a \nmoment in the struggle for equal justice.\n  I realize that my vote for John Ashcroft may not be decisive. But I \nhope that it will be informative--informative most of all to John \nAshcroft. Listen well, John Ashcroft. There are those of us here today \nwho could easily vote against your confirmation, but have decided to \ngive you a second chance--an opportunity that you denied to Ronnie \nWhite, Bill Lann Lee, James Hormel, and others.\n  I hope this vote will not be in vain. I hope that John Ashcroft will \nuphold his pledge to enforce the laws of our land. I fervently hope \nthat he will work to unite rather than divide our nation. And I hope, \nfor the sake of our nation and this institution, that this vote will in \nsome small measure help bring about an end to the growing predilection \nto treat nominations as ideological battlefields.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Senate \nconfirmation of John Ashcroft as Attorney General of the United States. \nHe is well qualified for the job, having served as attorney general of \nMissouri, as Governor of Missouri, and with distinction as United \nStates Senator.\n  I first met John Ashcroft in 1992 at the Missouri Republican \nConvention in Springfield, MO, when I was a surrogate for the campaign \nof President George Bush.\n  Two years later, John invited me and our colleague from New Mexico, \nPete Domenici, to come to Missouri and campaign with him when he was a \ncandidate for the Senate.\n  I was very impressed with John Ashcroft on both occasions. He was an \narticulate and intelligent advocate for commonsense solutions to our \ncountry's problems. He impressed me as a serious-minded, dedicated, and \nenergetic force in shaping public opinion on issues that should be \naddressed by our Government.\n  I enjoyed very much being a part of his campaign effort and I was \ndelighted when he was elected to the Senate.\n  In the Senate he has been very active in the legislative process. He \nhas initiated reforms in trade sanctions policy and juvenile justice \nwhich I have been pleased to support and cosponsor. He is one of the \nmost sincerely respected members of our Republican Conference, and I \nconsider him to be one of my best friends in the Senate.\n  I take issue with the critics who have questioned his candor and his \ncharacter. There is no basis whatsoever for those charges. I am \nsurprised and disappointed that he has been characterized so unfairly \nby some in this body.\n  I am confident he will prove by his exemplary service as Attorney \nGeneral that he is fair minded, thoughtful, and true to his word, and \nhis oath, as he carries out his important duties.\n  The President has selected a good man to be Attorney General. He has \nwithstood the slings and arrows of his opponents, and he is still \nstanding.\n  When I was elected to Congress, I was given by my mother a poem by \nJosiah Gilbert Holland, which I have kept close to my desk for the past \n28 years. It says in part:\n\n       God give us men! A time like this demands\n       Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands;\n       whom the lust of office does not kill;\n       whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n       who possess opinions and a will;\n       who have honor;\n       who will not lie;\n       who can stand before a demagog and damn his treacherous \n     flatteries without winking!\n       Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog, in public \n     duty and in private thinking.\n\n  That poem describes my friend and fellow Senator, John Ashcroft. I am \nproud of his service in the Senate, and I am confident he will make me \njust as proud as he serves our Nation as Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, contrary to what some people may believe, \nthinking about how people make this choice and given some of the \narguments that have surfaced in the course of this nomination, I \nsuppose some people might think this is sort of automatic for some \nfolks on different sides of the aisle. I want to make clear that I do \nnot feel that way at all. I think there are many different \ncrosscurrents with respect to anybody's nomination, and I certainly do \nnot disagree with the comments of my good friend and colleague, Senator \nDodd, who spoke a few minutes ago about what has happened to the \nnomination process, or to the review over the course of the last years \nhere in this city.\n  While I certainly raised questions early on with respect to this \nnominee, I tried, in the course of this process, to refrain from making \nany final judgments until the hearings were held, until questions were \nasked, until Senator Ashcroft himself had an opportunity to lay out the \nrecord, so to speak.\n  I listened very carefully to what Senator Dodd said a moment ago \nabout not making choices on ideology. I agree with that. My opposition, \nwhich I announced yesterday, to Senator Ashcroft's nomination, is not \nbased on ideology. I might say, however, that our friends on the other \nside of the aisle in the Republican Party have certainly made ideology \na significant component of their opposition to many people in the last \nyears. Even Senator Ashcroft himself has engaged in a process of making \njudgments about people's fitness to be judges, people's fitness to be \nin the Attorney General's office--Bill Lann Lee--on a matter of \nideology.\n  In fact, I am told by some members of their party that they, \nthemselves, have been the victims of ideological decisionmaking with \nrespect to positions they might or might not be able to fill within the \nparty itself. Perhaps there is the deepest irony at all, that people \nsuch as Tom Ridge, Governor of Pennsylvania, or Governor Keating, were \nthemselves the subject of bitter dissension within the Republican Party \nover whether or not they might be fit to\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\nserve as Vice President of the United States, or hold some other office \nof importance, on the basis of ideology.\n  So we need to be careful and thoughtful about who comes to that part \nof this debate with clean hands. But I am confident that all of us \nwould agree with Senator Dodd, that we would like to see an end to that \nkind of division.\n  There is another reason why this is difficult. It is because Senator \nAshcroft comes to this question with all the advantages of a colleague. \nWe know him. Many of us know him well enough to consider him a friend \nin the context of the Senate and like him personally. We certainly \nrespect his conviction and his dedication to public service.\n  As colleagues have noted, he was elected by the citizens of his State \nas attorney general, as Governor, and as Senator.\n  But the truth is, in the final analysis this is not a vote or a \ndecision about those personal relationships. This is not a vote about \npersonality. And it is certainly not a vote that calls on us to somehow \nratify the traditional expectations of the Senate, which are understood \nby everyone in the Senate and often are found very confusing to many \npeople in the country who measure us and what we do by a different \nstandard.\n  The office of Attorney General is obviously not a political reward, \nleft simply to the victors of national elections or to the \ncrosscurrents of ideology within a particular party. It is one of the \nmost sensitive positions of public trust. It is an office in which all \nAmericans must have a deep and abiding faith that its occupant will \nenforce the laws with equal justice, with fairness, and impartiality.\n  In other words, the person who comes to that office must come to it \nwith a level of acceptance by the public at large about their moral and \nlegal bonafides that they bring to the office in a way that is beyond \ndispute.\n  It is very clear that there were others whom a uniting, not a \ndividing, President might have chosen for this job. I think everyone in \nthe Senate would agree that if our colleague, former Senator John \nDanforth, had been chosen, you would have had a person who espoused all \nthe ideology, the full measure of conservative views--he is an \nEpiscopalian minister; he is pro- life--but he would have brought \nabsolutely none of the controversy that has come with this nominee, \nwhich raises doubts--I am not saying certainties but doubts--in the \nminds of many people about this nominee's either willingness or \ncapacity to apply the law in the way he has suggested he would in the \ncourse of these hearings.\n  In fact, after closely examining the record set forth in those \nhearings, and the record as attorney general of the State of Missouri, \nI conclude that record makes him the wrong person for this job at this \ntime.\n  This is, without any question--I think everybody in the Senate would \nagree--a special time in our history. We have a President of the United \nStates who was elected not with the popular vote of the country but for \nthe third time in history by the electoral college. We have a President \nwho was elected effectively by one vote, some would argue by the one \nvote in the electoral college, but there are many others in the country \nwho would argue it was the one vote in the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. There are many in the country, whether legitimately or not, who \nhave a deep sense of alienation and outrage over what happened in the \napplication of law in the course of the last months in our Nation.\n  Because this election was so divisive, because the President himself \nhas come to office saying that he acknowledges the deep need for him to \nbe a unifier and not a divider, I believe, therefore, this nomination \nis particularly troubling.\n  Senator Ashcroft's record reveals a series of actions--not beliefs; I \nwant to distinguish this. I heard colleagues defending Senator Ashcroft \nagain and again saying he should not be held accountable for his deep-\nrooted beliefs that reflect those who elected him. I am not holding him \naccountable, per se, for those beliefs. I believe, however, there are a \nseries of actions that ignore the kind of need we face at this point in \ntime to have an Attorney General come to office not needing to prove \nthat the years in the past were somehow an aberration or a mistaken \nimpression but, rather, who brings the full force of their history of \ncommitment to civil rights, a commitment to a series of issues that are \nthe law of the land.\n  In effect, we are being asked to accept the nomination of an \nindividual who, by definition, will have to wake up every single \nmorning and curb his natural political instincts in order to do this \njob. I do not think that is an unfair statement because on all of those \nkey issues where the Attorney General is so critical, whether it is \nguns or the law of the land with respect to Roe v. Wade, women's \nchoice, or the law of the land with respect to civil rights in many \nareas, Senator Ashcroft again and again in his political life has been \non the other side of those particular issues.\n  There is a very simple question to ask yourself: Is that really what \nyou want in an Attorney General of the United States?\n  In my judgment, reviewing the record of the hearings and reviewing \nthe record of Senator Ashcroft's stewardship as Attorney General, there \nare occasions where the Senator took actions that do not call to \nquestion today his ideology but call to question his judgment in \npursuit of that ideology.\n  Yes, Senator Ashcroft testified that he would enforce the laws with \nwhich he disagrees. But take, for instance, the voluntary school \ndesegregation case in St. Louis, or the nomination of Judge Ronnie \nWhite, or the nomination of James Hormel to be Ambassador to \nLuxembourg, or the nomination of David Satcher for Surgeon General. \nEach of these, in my estimation, reveals a response by Senator Ashcroft \nthat exhibited an exercise of judgment that I believe calls into \nquestion his ability to provide for the kind of moral and legal force \nnecessary in the job of Attorney General.\n  I am not convinced that you can simply dismiss each and every one of \nthe instincts that led to the exercise of that judgment in each of \nthose cases. Let me be very specific about each and every one of those.\n  When he was Missouri attorney general, as we know--others have talked \nabout it--Senator Ashcroft opposed the court-appointed voluntary \ndesegregation plan for St. Louis. We know school desegregation is a \ncontroversial public policy, and there are many people who \nappropriately at various times in the country, in one place or the \nother, found fault with certain approaches to various voluntary \ndesegregation plans. That is not the measure of my concern.\n  What is deeply troubling to me is that despite the problems with the \nexisting law and despite the problems that were found with the proposed \nvoluntary remedy, Senator Ashcroft, in a position of leadership on this \nissue, duty bound to bring people together and to try to lead the \ncommunity through this difficult time, failed to come up with an \nalternative that would have ameliorated the divisions of the community \nand, most importantly, would have addressed the segregated conditions. \nWhen children are trapped in schools that do not work, when cities are \ndivided by racial lines, there is a choice that can be made: You can be \na voice for reconciliation or you can be a voice for division.\n  When Senator Ashcroft chose to politicize the issue beyond all \nproportion, which is what many people in the community have testified, \nhe chose the latter, and that is a matter of judgment, not belief.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing element in his record was the treatment \nof Judge Ronnie White. Many people have brought those facts to the \nfloor, and I obviously am not going to go through all of them again. I \nremember that debate well. I remember the language which characterized \nthis good person. He was called procriminal. It was said that he had a \ntremendous bent towards criminal activity--a judge had a tremendous \nbent toward criminal activity. It was claimed that he was the court's \nmost liberal judge on the death penalty and did not care ``how clear \nthe evidence of guilt.''\n  That is not true. Those words are simply not true. Of course he cared \nabout guilt, and if you read his decision, his decision said nothing \nabout whether or not he was not guilty or whether or not he should not, \nif guilty, be subjected to the death penalty. He did not think this man \nhad a fair trial.\n  I do not believe an Attorney General of the United States should \ninterpret\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nsome judge's opposition to the lack of a fair trial to become on the \nfloor of the Senate a rationale for a party-line vote, fully divided by \nvirtue of his leadership on his protestations and characterizations of \nthis judge.\n  As is now well known, Judge White had a strong record of supporting \ncapital punishment and often voted with Mr. Ashcroft's own appointees \non the Missouri Supreme Court. Indeed, he had a tougher record on the \ndeath penalty than some of Senator Ashcroft's own nominees. Judge White \nvoted for the death penalty in 41 of 59 cases that came before him, and \nhe voted with the majority 53 times, including cases in which he \nfavored reversal.\n  So that is not an issue of ideology. That is not a matter of belief \non which I choose to cast my vote. It is because I believe that Judge \nWhite was inappropriately characterized on the floor of the Senate. I \nbelieve that was a reflection of a judgment about another human being, \nabout our politics, about life in our country. I do not believe, as \nsome have claimed, at all--and I hope we would never insinuate--that \nSenator Ashcroft is racist. I do not think there is any evidence of \nthat. I do not believe that he is. I think that is inappropriate to \nthis debate. But I do think that it was an unfair distortion of Judge \nWhite's record branding him as procriminal. And the handling of that \nnomination in itself raises serious questions about judgment, about \nfairmindedness, and about fair play.\n  Judge White, quite eloquently, made that very point during his \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee when he said: I believe that \nthe question for the Senate is whether these misrepresentations are \nconsistent with fair play and justice that you would require of the \nU.S. Attorney General. That is not a matter of ideology; that is a \nmatter of judgment.\n  I am also troubled that when David Satcher's nomination for Surgeon \nGeneral came before the Senate with great bipartisan support, again, \nSenator Ashcroft filibustered and described him as a ``promoter of \npartial-birth abortion.''\n  David Satcher had led the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta with \ndistinction. He had been a leader at a medical college in Tennessee. He \nhad the full backing of Senator Frist and Senator Thompson, both of \nwhom are people of enormous integrity. They told us that David Satcher \nwould not promote abortion. They told us that you could not question \nhis character or his integrity. But John Ashcroft said that this \nindividual would ``promote a heinous act, partial-birth abortion.'' \nWhy? Simply because David Satcher believed that a ban on the procedure \n--which he was in favor of--ought to include an exception for the life \nand health of the mother.\n  The kind of distortion we saw for David Satcher raises a question, \nnot about ideology but about judgment and fairness and fair play.\n  I am also troubled by Senator Ashcroft's judgment about the so-called \nalleged ``totality of the record'' with respect to a good man named \nJames Hormel. I regret to say it, but I can only interpret the \n``totality of the record'' as a code word for opposition to James \nHormel because he was gay.\n  Why do I draw that conclusion? Because in the course of debate, and \nin the course of comments publicly, Senator Ashcroft, at the Foreign \nRelations Committee, never doubted that Mr. Hormel was a competent \nbusinessperson, never doubted or questioned his record of philanthropy \nor commitment to his community, never doubted or questioned his \neffectiveness as a dean, or the job he had done prior to entering the \nbusiness at the University of Chicago. Senator Ashcroft was only one of \ntwo people on the Foreign Relations Committee to vote against him.\n  During the confirmation hearings a couple weeks ago, he again \nreiterated it was the ``totality of the record'' but, once again, \nwithout any explanation.\n  As we know, Mr. Hormel was finally appointed by a recess appointment. \nBut in my judgment, Mr. Hormel was opposed for a status offense. \nSenator Ashcroft did raise questions about the propensity or likelihood \nMr. Hormel might have about ``promoting a certain kind of lifestyle.'' \nI think every single one of us understands that is a code word in and \nof itself for his sexuality.\n  I would add that the people of Luxembourg, far from raising this \nquestion themselves, did not share that concern. And so it was that \nSenator Ashcroft sought to deny Luxembourg an Ambassador that they were \nasking to have appointed.\n  I do not believe the American people should have an Attorney General \nwho leaves even doubts--even doubts--about whether or not being gay is \na status offense.\n  I am also troubled by the lack of sensitivity that was displayed, \neven in the aftermath of the interview that took place with Southern \nPartisan magazine in 1998. Another colleague has gone into that at \ngreat depth on the floor, and I will not spend a lot of time on it.\n  It is one thing to have done the interview and, I suppose, to have \nsuggested later that you did not know what the magazine did or who they \nspoke to or what audience they talked about. It is another thing when \nyou are a nominee for Attorney General not to acknowledge that there \nare, indeed, questions that would arise in an interview of this nature \nwith that kind of magazine.\n  This is a magazine that praises John Wilkes Booth for assassinating \nAbraham Lincoln. It has editorials against interracial dating. When you \nread the interview itself, and you recognize the folks the Senator was \ntrying to talk to, and what he was appealing to, it seems to me that \nthere are serious questions, again, about judgment, about the judgment \nof what the message is to a large part of America who sees that \nmagazine and those who adhere to its philosophy as those who have never \ngotten over the fact that slavery was ended in the South.\n  I would have liked--I think many of us would have liked--to at least \nhave heard a disavowal of those views or an expression, recognition \nthat some of the views are, in fact, inappropriate and appeal to some \npeople's worst instincts rather than best instincts.\n  I think those are the kinds of expressions that ought to come from \nsomebody who is going to try to represent the healing of the divisions \nthat have occurred over the course of the last years. I might add, they \nare not just the healings from the difficulties of the election. They \nare the healings from the problems of racial profiling. They are the \nhealings from the problems of discrimination in housing. They are the \nhealings from the problems of so many people of color who wind up in \nprison instead of in college. They are the divisions that occur because \nso many in this country still believe that the law is stacked against \nthem rather than working for them.\n  The choices that an Attorney General will make are obviously critical \nto our ability to move forward and not backward with respect to those \nkinds of divisions. It is these particular acts of personal judgment \nthat I believe raise the most serious questions about the \nappropriateness of Senator Ashcroft assuming this remarkably sensitive \nposition.\n  As a former prosecutor--I see Senator Reid is on the floor; and he \nshares that prior occupation--I think for many of us there is an acute \nsensitivity to the judgments that an Attorney General makes on a daily \nbasis: what cases will be taken on; what particular task forces might \nbe created in order to try to address people's sense of grievance in \nthe country; certainly, obviously, the power of the Solicitor General; \nthe power of choosing who will sit on what courts; the power of \ndeciding what you will appeal to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates; and, most importantly, what you will investigate and how. All \nof these are issues of judgment, too.\n  I believe the issues I have raised put before the Senate serious \nquestions about the exercise in that judgment. I believe that in the \nend, notwithstanding what I have said, there is always a feeling by \neach of us with respect to a colleague that these votes are difficult. \nI don't pretend that it is not in this regard. That is true for all of \nus on our side. We have to make a choice. It is our responsibility and \nit is our oath to the Constitution to make the best judgments we can \nabout the choices that are put in front of us.\n  I believe the important thing at this moment in time in this \nparticular position, above all, is to have a nominee who is free from \nthis kind of controversy, who comes to this job not with the questions \nthat have been raised in the Senate and this revisitation of the kind \nof divisiveness that so\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\nmany of us are tired of. That is not something we asked for. That is \nsomething we were given by virtue of the President's choice to send us \nthis nominee.\n  With this nominee comes these questions about his ability to assume \nthis job that requires such a special sensitivity, such a special sense \nof the need to bring the country together and to be able to apply the \nlaw equally and fairly to all.\n  It may well be that every concern I have expressed is wiped away when \nJohn Ashcroft takes this job on, as we know he will. There is no \nquestion about whether he is going to be confirmed. But there is a \nquestion about whether or not we will ever, in the next few years, \nagain have to revisit some of the questions that have been raised in \nthe course of these hearings and in the course of this debate.\n  My prayer is that we won't, and nothing, obviously, would please me \nmore than to say to John Ashcroft: I am glad I sounded my warning \nbells, but I am equally glad that you proved us wrong and were the kind \nof Attorney General that the country needed at this moment.\n  It may well be that all of our colleagues are absolutely correct in \npredicting that that is what we will have. If it is, so much the better \nfor the Nation and so much the better for John Ashcroft. It is \nimportant for us to place as part of the record, as he assumes this \njob, the concerns that we have on behalf of so many people in this \ncountry who need to see the law applied more fairly and need to have a \nbetter sense of due process and of equal justice under the law. I hope, \nin the end, this administration and this Attorney General will produce \nthat.\n  Mr. HATCH. Finally, Mr. President, I wish to speak about John \nAshcroft's ability, if and when he becomes Attorney General, to enforce \nlaws that he spoke against or even voted against as a legislator.\n  As you know, Mr. President, opponents of Senator Ashcroft are \naccusing him of being unable to set aside his opinions on certain laws \nsufficiently in order to enforce those laws.\n  And I have to give those opponents credit for their creativity. They \nhave developed a brand new test for cabinet appointees. Eight years \nago, when the Senate unanimously confirmed an Attorney General whose \npersonal views opposed the death penalty and the imposition of \nmandatory minimum sentences for convicted criminals, none of the anti-\nAshcroft crusaders accused Janet Reno of being unable to set aside her \npersonal views.\n  But while I admire the creativity of this new approach, I am deeply \ntroubled by the substance beneath it. What's being proposed is to \ndisqualify from high office anyone who has previously taken a side on a \nlegislative proposal.\n  It is simply not true that a legislator is so tainted by efforts to \nchange laws that thereafter he or she cannot perform the duties of \nattorney general. Outside this Chamber, and outside of the Washington \nBeltway, Americans understand that people can take on different roles \nand responsibilities when they are given different positions. Americans \nknow that lawyers can become judges, welders can become foremen, \nengineers can become managers, and school teachers can become school \nboard leaders. And Americans know that a Senator, whose job is to \npropose and vote on new laws, can become an Attorney General, whose job \nis to enforce those laws that are duly passed.\n  There aren't many people who know as much about the different roles \nin government as John Ashcroft. He has been in the executive branch--as \nan Attorney General for 8 years. He has been chief executive as \nGovernor for 8 years. And he has been in the legislative branch as a \nUnited States Senator for 6 years. Each of these positions have \nrequired an understanding of the differing roles assumed by the three \nbranches of government.\n  It is in this context that John Ashcroft told the Senate what he will \ndo as Attorney General. He said he will enforce the laws as written, \nand uphold the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court. This \nis a concise yet profound statement about the proper role of the \nAttorney General. And it is more than just a statement, because it is \nbacked up by the unquestioned integrity of John Ashcroft, a man who \nwill do what he says. He will enforce the law as it is written, even in \nthose instances where he would have written it differently.\n  Still, some members of this body are unconvinced. They apparently \nthink that John Ashcroft will not do what he said. Of course they would \nnot call him a liar--at least not explicitly, anyway. They are saying \nthat, try as he might, he simply cannot enforce the law because he \nwants so badly for the law to say something other than what it actually \nsays.\n  Some who have adopted this view are accusing John Ashcroft of \nchanging his views. They accuse him of having a ``confirmation \nconversion.'' By this they mean that people who take off their \nlegislator's cap, and put on an attorney general's hat, cannot adapt \nfrom the role of law writer to law enforcer without being insincere. \nThis is a ludicrous proposition. John Ashcroft has not undergone a \nconfirmation conversion; he has been the victim of an interest group \nillusion.\n  Members of this body know something that the public may not: There is \nan unspoken rule that a nominee does not answer questions in public \nbetween their nomination and their confirmation hearing. This is done \nout of respect for the Senate--whose job it is, after all, to listen to \nthe nominee rather than the media. But savvy special interest groups \ntake advantage of the time in between to wage a war of words against \nnominees they dislike. Many of those words are exaggerated or \nunsubstantiated attacks. The result can be the fabrication of a false \npublic record.\n  Mr. President, I am asking my fellow Senators to resist the \ntemptation to label it a ``conversion'' when a nominee simply corrects \nthe misperceptions created by special interest groups. I am asking my \ncolleagues to look at John Ashcroft's real record, and at own words--in \nhis confirmation hearings, and in his answers to the voluminous written \nquestions--rather than relying on the press releases of issue \nadvocates.\n  If you only listen to interest groups, you might conclude that John \nAshcroft would bend or ignore the law in order to put more guns in \npeople's hands. But you would be wrong. As Missouri's Attorney General \nin 1977, John Ashcroft wrote Attorney General Opinion No. 50, in which \nhe interpreted state law to prohibit prosecuting attorneys from \ncarrying concealed weapons even while engaged in the discharge of \nofficial duties. This is hardly the kind of decision that someone bent \non eliminating gun laws would want to reach.\n  The special interest groups also want us to believe that John \nAshcroft cannot enforce abortion laws because of his personal view that \nlife begins at conception. But 20 years ago, as Missouri Attorney \nGeneral, John Ashcroft had--and did not take--the opportunity to bend \nthe law to favor his view. His 1981 Attorney General Opinion No. 5 \nbarred the Missouri Division of Health from releasing statistics \nrevealing the number of abortions performed by particular hospitals--\neven though such statistics would help the pro-life movement make its \ncase. Similarly, in Attorney General Opinion No. 127, dated September \n23, 1980, Attorney General Ashcroft determined that a death certificate \nwas not required for all abortions, despite his personal view that \nabortion terminates human life. Are these the kind of decisions that \nyou would expect from an unrestrainable zealot?\n  But the special interest groups do not stop there. They have also \nattacked John Ashcroft for his religious views, inferring that he would \nuse his position to blur the lines between church and state. The fact \nis, however, that John Ashcroft has turned down several opportunities \nto do just that. In a 1977 Attorney General Opinion, No. 102, Ashcroft \nforbade public school districts from using federal education funds to \nbenefit nonpublic including parochial school children. He did so even \nthough the federal grant in question specifically allowed private and \nparochial school children to benefit. In similar decisions, Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft prevented the State of Missouri from providing \ntransportation for nonpublic school students [Attorney General Opinion \nNo. 148], and determined that a board of education lacked legal \nauthority to allow the distribution of religious material on school \nproperty [Attorney General Opinion\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nNo. 8, February 8, 1979]. Don't expect to see these decisions listed in \nthe press releases concerning John Ashcroft's ``extremist views.''\n  Another area of falsification concerns John Ashcroft's record on the \nenforcement of environmental laws. To hear some interest groups talk, \nyou would think John Ashcroft wants to allow polluters to ignore the \nregulations that protect the planet. Again, his record shows the \nopposite. In Attorney General Opinion No. 123-84, Ashcroft declared \nthat underground injection wells constitute pollution of the waters and \nare therefore subject to regulation by the Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources. He also opined that it would be unlawful to build or \noperate such a well without a permit from the Clean Water Commission. \nAnd in another opinion, Ashcroft decided that operators of surface \nmines must obtain a permit for each year that the mine was unreclaimed. \nIn reaching this opinion, Ashcroft concluded that a continuous permit \nrequirement facilitated Missouri's intention ``to protect and promote \nthe health, safety and general welfare of the people of this state, and \nto protect the natural resources of the state from environmental \nharm.'' This settlement was echoed in an opinion concerning recycling \nthat John Ashcroft wrote in 1977. In Attorney General Opinion No. 189, \nAshcroft decided that Missouri's cities and counties could require that \nall solid waste be disposed of at approved solid waste recovery \nfacilities, rather than landfills. That opinion was based on the \narguments that ``recycling of solid wastes results in fewer health \nhazards and pollution problems than does disposal of the same types of \nwastes in landfills'' and that ``public welfare is better served by \nburning solid wastes for generation of electricity, thus conserving \nscarce natural resources.'' I suggest, Mr. President, that these are \nnot the words of a man who is intent on ignoring the law and destroying \nthe environment.\n  My final example, Mr. President, is on the topic of minority set \nasides. As you know, among the tactics of the anti-Ashcroft forces has \nbeen to bring baseless racial allegations. And, again, this is being \ndone in indirect and subtle ways, implying that there is something \nhidden and unrestrainable about John Ashcroft that should concern \nminorities. Thus my colleagues will be pleased to learn that, as \nMissouri's Attorney General, John Ashcroft issued an opinion which \ncleared the way for the Missouri Clean Water Commission to award a 15 \npercent state grant to the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District to \nestablish a minority business enterprise program.\n  These examples--all of which pre-date the public smear campaign \nagainst John Ashcroft--demonstrate that Mr. Ashcroft has a record of \nenforcing the law. John Ashcroft has not undergone a confirmation \nconversion. Rather, he is a victim of interest group illusion. The \nartists behind the lobbying groups aligned against him have made his \ntrue record disappear in a cloud of smoke. And they are attempting to \nconvince the public that his distinguished record of advocacy as a \nlegislator is a straitjacket from which he cannot escape. But let me \ntell you what I see in the crystal ball. John Ashcroft is going to be \nan excellent attorney general. He is going to enforce the laws of this \nland fairly and forcefully. He will do so even when he might have \nwritten the law differently as a legislator.\n\n  Mr. President, the issues that have been raised in objection to \nSenator Ashcroft's nomination are largely policy issues. There is no \nobjection on his qualifications, his credentials, or his integrity. The \nattempt to paint him as extremist on policy grounds is countered \neffectively by his five elections to statewide office in Missouri, and \nhis elections to head the National Association of Governors and the \nNational Association of Attorneys General.\n  Mr. President, John Ashcroft is qualified, not extreme on policy, but \nhis policy positions are largely irrelevant because he has demonstrated \nthat he understands his role as law enforcer, as distinguished from \nthat of a policy advocate.\n  I hope we will give him the benefit of the doubt if any doubt exists. \nI believe he will enforce the laws even-handedly and be a fine Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to respond to the issue of whether \nthere have been religious attacks on Senator Ashcroft.\n  Article VI of our Constitution, while requiring that Officers of the \ngovernment swear to support the Constitution, assures us that ``no \nreligious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office \nor public Trust under the United States.'' I fear that with regard to \nthe nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of the United \nStates, we are coming very close to violating the spirit, if not the \nletter of that assurance.\n  Mr. President, John Ashcroft has been attacked as a dangerous zealot \nby many of his opponents, who suggest that his faith will require him \nto violate the law, or as a liar who cannot be trusted when he says he \nwill uphold the law, even when he disagrees with it, as he has in \nsimilar circumstances in the past.\n  I think the corrosive attacks on a qualified nominee because of his \nreligious beliefs not only weakens our constitutional government, but \nalso undermines the ability of citizens in our democracy to engage in a \nmeaningful dialog with each other. When such attacks are made on the \nground that a man's faithful conviction will prevent him from \ndischarging the duties of his office, whole segments of our democracy \nare disenfranchised, and the American heritage of religious tolerance \nis betrayed.\n  Let me point to just a few instances of these amazing attacks on \nSenator Ashcroft, made on largely religious grounds, since he was \nnominated.\n  Let me begin with the testimony of Professor James M. Dunn, who \ntestified at our Senate hearings as an expert on religion issues. I \nbegin here because Professor Dunn is the most explicit in his religious \nattack on Senator Ashcroft.\n\n  Professor Dunn says explicitly what others have coyly and carefully \nimplied. He says, and I quote what is essentially the thesis statement \nof his testimony before the Judiciary Committee: ``the long history of \nSenator Ashcroft's identification with and approval of the political \nagenda of religious, right-wing extremism in this country convinces me \nthat he is utterly unqualified and must be assumed to be unreliable for \nsuch a trust.''\n  Let me quote that point again, ``the long history of Senator \nAshcroft's identification with and approval of . . . religious, right-\nwing extremism in this country convinces [Professor Dunn] that he is \nutterly unqualified and must be assumed unreliable for such a trust.''\n  That is about as baldly as the matter can be put, John Ashcroft is \n``utterly unqualified'' and ``unreliable'' because of his ``religious, \nright-wing extremism.''\n  As if the name-calling were not enough, to make this an even more \nstunning assertion, the case Professor Dunn offers to prove this \nperceived ``extremism'' is that John Ashcroft was the ``principal \narchitect'' of the so-called ``charitable choice'' legislation which \nwas passed by the Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996.\n  To suggest that duly passed legislation, adopted by two branches of \ngovernment controlled by different political parties is outside the \nmainstream is simply ludicrous, and suggests that the one outside the \nmainstream is not Senator Ashcroft, but rather his critics. This is a \npoint that could be made on a number of policy fronts.\n  Well, I am disappointed when policy disagreements deteriorate into \nname-calling, but considering the source I am particularly \ndisappointed. I would hope that the United States Senate would never \ncountenance such attacks in the consideration of this, or any other, \nnominee. I hope no weight will be given to such intemperate vitriol, \nnor more guarded attacks made in the same spirit. And I hope that none \nof my colleagues would join in such attacks, whether explicitly stated \nor couched in more careful language.\n  But I am glad that at least Professor Dunn's clear statement can put \nto rest the question of whether Senator Ashcroft is being attacked in \npart on his religious beliefs. Dunn is not alone, either. For example, \nBarry Lynn, of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, in \nattacking Senator Ashcroft's nomination also cites charitable choice--\nagain, a law adopted by two branches of government controlled by two \ndifferent parties--as an\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\ninstance of Ashcroft's ``extreme views.'' And to underscore the broader \npoint, Lynn points to the apparently decisive fact that ``Religious \nRight leaders find Ashcroft's fundamentalist Christian world view and \nhis far-right political outlook appealing.'' Let us be clear here: the \ncharge is guilt by association with religious people.\n\n  As a number of my colleagues have suggested that the nominee might \nwant to apologize for some of his associations or take the opportunity \nto dissociate himself from them, I would invite my colleagues to show a \nsimilar indignation for these attacks on people of faith, and \ndissociate themselves from these intolerant statements, unless they too \nwould like their silence to be considered approval of such intolerance. \nPerhaps there needs to be greater sensitivity shown here.\n  In addition to such explicit attacks, others attack Senator Ashcroft \nbecause his religious beliefs can be viewed as diverging from the legal \nresults favored by far left liberal interest groups.\n  For example, in the area of abortion, Ms. Gloria Feldt, the president \nof Planned Parenthood Federation of America criticized Senator Ashcroft \nfor ``his belief that personhood begins at fertilization,'' saying that \nhis view is ``one of the most extreme positions among those who oppose \na woman's right to make her own reproductive choices, John Ashcroft \nactually believes that personhood begins . . . at the moment that sperm \nmeets egg, the moment of fertilization.'' Well, call it extreme if you \nwill--that word is a hobby horse of the far left liberal groups who \noppose this nominee--but I understand that is the position of a number \nof churches, including the Catholic church. What is striking and \nchilling about this attack is the implication that anyone who holds \nthis belief, including believing members of many churches, including \nthe millions of believing Catholics, are unfit for the office of \nAttorney General because of their ``extreme positions.'' Surely, the \nSenate cannot take the position that faithful Americans who adhere to \nthe pro-life doctrines of their churches, or even those who are pro-\nlife on secular grounds, are unfit for office because of this view.\n  Besides undermining our basic assumptions supporting the rule of law, \nthis critique leads to a second, and more chilling result for religious \ntolerance, namely that of Senator's judging a nominee on the basis of \ntheir views of the nominee's religious faith and that faith's \npriorities. John Ashcroft responds to those who criticize him for his \nbeliefs about abortion and the beginning of life, for example, by \nstating that his religion requires him to follow the law as written \nwhen he is filling an enforcement role, and his oath to do that will be \nbinding on him. Those who challenge his veracity on this point are \npicking and choosing which of Senator Ashcroft's religious beliefs they \nfeel are genuine or which religious principle has priority for him. I \nthink this moves dangerously close to the line of imposing a religious \ntest on a nominee.\n\n  Perhaps we can ask a nominee the general question whether there is \nanything that would keep them from fulfilling their duties, but I do \nnot think it appropriate to assume that someone is unfit for a job \nbecause we have preconceptions about what their sect believes and then \ncriticize them if their answers do not fit our preconceptions of what \nthey should believe. We need to tread very carefully here. And we would \ndo well in such matters to give the benefit of the doubt to the \nnominee. We have certainly given the benefit of the doubt to the last \nPresident when we had qualms about the quality or credentials of some \nof his nominees, or their policy positions. But we owe a special duty \nto resolve doubts in favor of a nominee when questions stem from our \nassumptions about a nominee's religious beliefs, especially in the face \nof the nominee's contradiction of our assumptions.\n  Mr. President, I think we would all do well to remember what we know \nabout John Ashcroft, and not be influenced by a caricature painted by \nthose extreme groups whose distortions of this honorable man are driven \nlargely by their own narrow political interests. We know John Ashcroft \nis the sort of person whose word is his bond. And if his religion is \nrelevant, it speaks for him as a person who will discharge the office \nof Attorney General with honor and dignity, with impartiality, \naccording to the law.\n  I think if we examine our hearts, we will find nothing that \ndisqualifies John Ashcroft to be Attorney General. And we cannot, in \ngood conscience, say that all those Americans who believe as he does \nare outside the mainstream of American opinion. No, they are solidly \nwithin the history of American pluralism and freedom, including \nreligious freedom. We know John Ashcroft will faithfully discharge his \nduties and honor his oath of office no matter what the liberal pressure \ngroups assert. I hope we will similarly honor our oaths, rejecting what \nhas become in essence a religious test for this nominee, and vote to \nconfirm this honorable man to the post of Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak \nnow. He has indicated he will take about 10 minutes. Following that, I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak and, following that, \nSenator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise in support of John Ashcroft in \nhis nomination as our Nation's Attorney General.\n  This nomination debate and the consideration of John Ashcroft's \nnomination is much different for me than my consideration of all the \nother nominees to President Bush's Cabinet. It is different for the \nreason that in the case of most other nominees, I do not know those \nindividuals personally. Of course, I did know Senator Abraham who \nserved well with us and has now been confirmed as our Nation's Energy \nSecretary. But with the exception of Senators Abraham and Ashcroft, \nmost of the nominees come to me just from what I have heard, what I \nhave seen in the newspapers, what others have written about those \npeople. I do not have the personal experience that I have had in the \ncase of John Ashcroft.\n  I knew John Ashcroft before I joined the Senate over 2 years ago. I \ngot to know him a little bit during the time I was running for Senator \nfrom Illinois. Then, of course, once I was sworn into office, I had the \nprivilege of working with John Ashcroft on a regular basis. I worked \nwith him for 2 years side by side, sometimes day in and day out.\n  My State of Illinois is right next door to the State of Missouri, so \nperhaps I have had the privilege of getting to know John Ashcroft and \nworking with him more closely than many of the other Members of this \nbody.\n  We, of course, have many issues that Illinois and Missouri share in \ncommon. We have a similar agricultural economy where corn and beans are \nthe prevailing crop. We also have the Mississippi River that divides \nour two States. We are frequently working together on issues of concern \nto the Mississippi River. We also share the Greater St. Louis \nmetropolitan region. Most of that region is in John's State \nof Missouri, but a large portion of it, maybe 20 percent of it, \nactually is across in the eastern part of the Mississippi River and in \nmy State of Illinois. We were constantly discussing issues of job \ncreation and economic opportunities in the Greater St. Louis region.\n\n  In addition, I had the opportunity to work closely with John insofar \nas he was a supporter of a bill that I sponsored last year to improve \nthe standards on child safety seats in this country. The bill went \nthrough the Senate Commerce Committee. In fact, I believe John was \nchairman of the subcommittee in which that issue was first taken up.\n  I also worked very closely with Senator Ashcroft on the issue of \nsanction reform. Both John and I and many others, representing \nparticularly midwestern States, were very concerned that some of the \nsanctions our Government put on other countries, banning the sale of \nproducts from our country to other countries around the world that may \nhave bad records in one regard or another, were hurting people that \nthey were not intended to hurt and were not affecting the governments. \nAt the same time, they were shooting our own farmers in the foot.\n  I supported John's efforts to lift the sanctions with respect to food \nand medicine that our country had placed\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\non a number of nations around the world.\n  There are many other issues. In fact, my staff gave me two pages of \nissues that I worked very closely on with John Ashcroft. I am not going \nto go through and rebut one by one all the little points that have been \nmade. In fact, I think many people have already done a good job \nrebutting some of the disinformation that has been put out. I think \nSenator Ashcroft did an outstanding job defending his own record before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Of the people I have known over the course of my public life, I would \nhave to tell my colleagues that John Ashcroft has few equals in terms \nof character and integrity. John Ashcroft is a man of utmost character \nand integrity--as much, if not more so, than anyone else I have ever \nmet in public life.\n  When I heard that President Bush had nominated John Ashcroft to be \nAttorney General, I knew that I had disagreed with John Ashcroft on \nmany issues during the course of the last 2 years. I had voted \ndifferently than he on any number of issues, maybe some of which have \nbeen used as an argument against John Ashcroft. But I thought: Thank \nGod that President Bush has had the wisdom to put someone who is \nabsolutely unimpeachable, irreproachable, and an absolute straight \narrow in that office of Attorney General.\n  I believe character and integrity are, hands down, the most important \nqualifications for that job and, indeed, just about any job in public \nlife. Many people have raised the question, Will John Ashcroft enforce \nthe laws? Clearly, there are many laws on the books that he would not \nhave voted for and did not vote for, or, if they came up again, would \nnot vote for. There are many laws on the books that many of us would \nnot have voted for.\n  But when the question comes up about John Ashcroft enforcing the \nlaws, the thought that has gone through my head is, I know John \nAshcroft well enough to believe with wholehearted confidence that if \nJohn Ashcroft says he will enforce the laws, he will enforce the laws. \nHe is so stellar, so 24-carat is his honor and integrity, that I \nbelieve him without question.\n  One of the other things that really has not been discussed or brought \nup in adequate defense of John Ashcroft--as bright as all my colleagues \nare in this illustrious body, the Senate, so many of whom are brilliant \nand had brilliant academic careers--is that I have to say John Ashcroft \nis one of the brightest and most articulate public servants with whom I \never had the privilege of serving. I think you can see that if you look \nat his early career and his undergraduate degree from Yale. He attended \nthe University of Chicago Law School, a renowned institution in my home \nState. And many people do not even know that this man, who has spent \nmost of his life in public office in so many different elected posts in \nthe State of Missouri, was in fact a coauthor, I believe, with his wife \nof a business law textbook. It is hard to imagine when he found the \ntime to do that. But so brilliant, so talented, and hard-working is \nJohn that he has a remarkable degree of accomplishment in academics, in \npublic service, and in music and other areas. He is a wonderful, \noutstanding man.\n  Finally, without belaboring this subject on which I think the points \nand counterpoints have been made now thoroughly on both sides of the \naisle, the final thought with which I would like to leave the Senate is \nthat the attacks that have been made on John Ashcroft simply don't \ncompute with the John Ashcroft from my neighboring State whom I knew \nand served with day in and day out for 2 years.\n  I don't think even the people of Missouri would recognize the \ncharacterizations of this man whom they elected to be their attorney \ngeneral, their Governor, and their Senator and who has had such a long \nand distinguished career. And even before he was an elected officer, he \nwas the State auditor of the State of Missouri. He is one of the most \nqualified people ever to be nominated for the office of Attorney \nGeneral.\n  I urge my colleagues, some of them who may disagree with votes John \nAshcroft may have taken in his many years in the Senate, to reconsider \nand think about how important is his character and integrity, and just \nthe fact that we can all sleep well at night knowing we have an \nabsolute straight arrow in the highest law enforcement position in this \ncountry.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that beginning at 9 \na.m. on Thursday, the Senate resume the Ashcroft nomination in \nexecutive session and the time be allocated in the following fashion: 9 \na.m. to 9:15 under the control of the majority party; 9:15 to 9:30 \nunder the control of Senator Harkin; from 9:30 to 9:45 under the \ncontrol of Senator Johnson; from 9:45 to 10 a.m. under the control of \nthe majority party; from 10 a.m. until 10:15 under the control of \nSenator Sarbanes; from 10:15 to 10:30 under the control of the majority \nparty; from 10:30 to 10:45 under the control of Senator Lieberman; from \n10:45 to 11 a.m. under the control of the majority party; from 11 \no'clock to 11:10 under the control of Senator Edwards; from 11:10 to \n11:15 under the control of Senator Gramm of Texas; from 11:15 to 11:45 \na.m. under the control of Senator Wellstone; Senator Leahy or his \ndesignee from 11:45 to 12:15; Senator Hatch or his designee in control \nfrom 12:15 to 12:45 in the afternoon; and Senator Daschle or his \ndesignee from 12:45 in the afternoon to 1:15; Senator Bond in control \nfrom 1:15 to 1:30; and Senator Lott in control from 1:30 to 1:45.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if I \ncould ask the distinguished leader, this locks in the vote at 1:45. Is \nit his assumption that should everybody have used up their time prior \nto that, there may be a new request to move the vote time earlier?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe this would indicate that the vote will be not \nlater than 1:45. If Senators yield back their time or don't use the \nentire time, and we could finish at an early hour--11:30 or 12:00--I \nwould be very appreciative of that. I would be willing to yield some of \nmy own time to accomplish that. If we see we are ready to proceed to a \nvote at noon tomorrow, certainly, I would like to be able to do that.\n  I thank Senator Leahy, and especially Senator Reid, for working this \nagreement out, and to all Senators who have been willing to accomplish \nit so we can complete this debate and get a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement, the next vote will occur on the \nconfirmation of our former colleague, Senator John Ashcroft, not later \nthan 1:45 p.m. tomorrow, and earlier if the time has been yielded back \nand we are ready to proceed to a final vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. After Senator Kennedy, I will make a statement, and Senator \nGraham from Florida will make a statement. I say to all the Senators, \neither with the majority or the Democratic side, if they feel they \nstill want to talk, they can come and talk tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we have some Senators committed to speak after \nthat, at least two more within the next hour, interspersed with other \nspeakers.\n  Mr. REID. The point I make, no one should complain they don't have \nthe ability to talk.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is not that late by Senate time. I believe we have one \nspeaker who will speak at 7:50 or so, and if other Senators who haven't \nspoken would like to get in the queue, we would like them to do that, \nor Senators who were thinking they want to wait until tomorrow, I think \nit would be well received if they could go ahead and speak tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nspeakers be reversed and that Senator Kennedy precede the Senator from \nNevada.\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the leaders. I will just take a \nfew moments to respond to some points that were made earlier in the day \nby my friend and colleague, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  Earlier this morning I took the time to review the history of the \nchallenges that were there for St. Louis in terms of desegregation of \nthe schools and the actions that were taken or failed to be taken by \nthe nominee, Mr. Ashcroft. I took a considerable amount of time to \nreview the whole history and review the cases there. I drew the \nconclusion that there was a gross failure of, I think, judgment in \nterms of taking the necessary steps to protect the interests of the \nchildren. Those cases were later challenged during the course of the \nafternoon, and I would like to respond very briefly and then to \nconclude with the remainder of my remarks that I had this morning, \nwhich, because others were here on the floor, I did not have the time \nto do.\n  My food friend from Utah talked earlier about the St. Louis \ndesegregation case. Unfortunately, he continued the pattern on the \nother side of expressing outrage about the fact that desegregation can \nbe expensive, without being outraged by the injustice being done to the \nAfrican American children in St. Louis.\n  The simple fact is that Senator Ashcroft spent his career as attorney \ngeneral denying the facts of discrimination and segregation. He \ncontinued to deny them at his confirmation hearing, and many of our \ncolleagues are attempting to deny them on the floor of the Senate.\n  The facts are clear. The state of Missouri was found guilty by the \ncourts of segregating the schools and keeping them segregated all the \nway through the 1970s. The court's findings in 1980 made very clear \nthat the state was aggressively maintaining segregation. Even black \nfamilies who had moved out to the suburbs saw their children bused back \ninto the inner-city to black schools. As the court ruled in 1982:\n\n       We held . . . that the state had substantially contributed \n     to the segregation of the public schools of the City of St. \n     Louis . . . the state defendants are primary constitutional \n     wrongdoers and, therefore, can be required to take those \n     actions which will further the desegregation of the city \n     schools, even if the actions required will occur outside the \n     boundaries of the city school district.\n\n  Yet Senator Ashcroft continued to insist that the state was ``found \nguilty of no wrong.''\n  Some of our colleagues claimed that Senator Ashcroft's position was \nvindicated by the Supreme Court in Missouri v. Jenkins. But the Jenkins \ncase was from Kansas City. It had nothing to do with St. Louis.\n  The Supreme Court rejected every one of Ashcroft's three appeals in \nthe St. Louis case. He also complained that some of the money went to \nthe suburban schools. It went for the students who transferred to the \nsuburban schools; that is Public School Choice. He said that the test \nscores went down in St. Louis in the nineties.\n  What is clear, is that the students who transferred had consistently \ntwice to three times the graduation rate, and in some districts, 90 \npercent of the graduates went on to college.\n  Defenders of Senator Ashcroft also claimed that desegregation in \nMissouri was more expensive than anywhere except California. We all \nknow what made it expensive--the unrelenting 16 year fight against \ndoing anything to fix the problem by Senator Ashcroft when he was \nAttorney General and Governor of the State.\n  If Senator Ashcroft was simply protecting the state's treasury he \ncould easily have proposed a cheaper alternative to the court. If he \nwas concerned that the courts was ordering desegregation, he could \neasily have supported a state law to correct the problem.\n  In fact, the state is not paying for the plan anymore, and that's \nbecause Senator Ashcroft successors, Attorney General Jay Nixon and \nGovernor Mel Carnahan, provided the leadership needed to settle the \ncases and start improving education for all the children in St. Louis.\n  Earlier, I spoke at length about Senator Ashcroft's record on civil \nrights--especially, school desegregation and voting rights--and his \nrecord on women's rights and gun control. At this time, I intend to \ndiscuss Senator Ashcroft's treatment of judicial and executive branch \nnominees.\n  I know others have referenced some of them, but I want to underscore \nmy own reaction and response to the handling of these nominations by \nSenator Ashcroft.\n  Senator Ashcroft's handling of judicial and executive branch \nnominations raises deep concerns. In four of the most divisive \nnomination battles in the Senate in the six years he served with us, \nSenator Ashcroft was consistently involved in harsh and vigorous \nopposition to the confirmation of distinguished and well-qualified \nAfrican Americans, an Asian American, and a gay American.\n  When President Clinton nominated Judge Ronnie White of the Missouri \nSupreme Court to be a federal district court judge, Senator Ashcroft \nflagrantly distorted the record of the nominee and attacked him in the \nstrongest terms. He accused Judge White of being ``an activist with a \nslant toward criminals.'' He accused him of being a judge with ``a \nserious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty.'' He \naccused him of seeking ``at every turn'' to provide opportunities for \nthe guilty to ``escape punishment.'' He accused him of voting ``to \nreverse the death sentence in more cases than any other [Missouri] \nSupreme Court judge.''\n  When questioned about Judge White's nomination, Senator Ashcroft did \nnot retreat from his characterization of Judge White's record, although \na review clearly demonstrates that Senator Ashcroft's charges were \nbaseless. It's clear that Senator Ashcroft distorted the record in \norder to portray Judge White's confirmation as a referendum on the \ndeath penalty.\n  Senator Ashcroft had decided to use the death penalty as an issue in \nhis campaign for re-election to the Senate, and to make his point, he \ncruelly distorted the honorable record of a distinguished African \nAmerican judge and denied him the position he deserved as a federal \ndistrict court judge. As I said at the hearing, what Senator Ashcroft \ndid to Judge White is the ugliest thing that has happened to a nominee \nin all my years in the Senate.\n  Senator Ashcroft was also asked about the nominations of Bill Lann \nLee to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Dr. David \nSatcher to serve as Surgeon General of the United States, and James \nHormel to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n  Senator Ashcroft told the committee that he could not support Mr. Lee \nbecause he had ``serious concerns about his willingness to enforce the \nAdarand decision'' on affirmative action. In truth, however, Mr. Lee's \nposition on affirmative action was well within the mainstream of the \nlaw, and he repeatedly told the committee that he would follow the \nSupreme Court's ruling in the Adarand case. As Senator Leahy said \nduring the Ashcroft confirmation hearings,\n\n       Mr. Lee testified on a number of occasions--in fact, \n     testified under oath, including, incidentally, directly in \n     answer to your questions, that he would enforce the law as \n     declared in Adarand. And he also said, in direct answer to \n     questions of this committee, he considered the Adarand \n     decision of the Supreme Court as the controlling legal \n     authority of the land, that he would seek to enforce it, he \n     would give it full effect . . .\n\n  That wasn't sufficient for Senator Ashcroft and he continued to \noppose, and oppose strongly, this extraordinarily well-qualified, \ncommitted, and dedicated public servant.\n  Similarly, Senator Ashcroft said he did not support Dr. Satcher to be \nSurgeon General because he:\n\n       . . . supported a number of activities that I thought were \n     inconsistent with the ethical obligations of a medical doctor \n     and a physician, particularly the surgeon general * * * for \n     example he supported an AIDS study on pregnant women in \n     Africa where some patients were given placebos, even though a \n     treatment existed to limit transmission of AIDS from the \n     mother to the child * * * I, secondly, believed his \n     willingness to send AIDS-infected babies home with their \n     mothers without telling their mothers about the infection of \n     the children was another ethical problem that was very \n     serious.\n\n  In fact, at the time of the debate on the Satcher nomination in 1997, \napproximately 1,000 babies were born with HIV every day. Most of the \nbirths were in developing countries, where the U.S.-accepted regimen of \nAZT treatment is not practical because of safety\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nand cost concerns. In 1994, the World Health Organization had called a \nmeeting of international experts to review the use of AZT to prevent \nthe spread of HIV in pregnancy. That meeting resulted in the \nrecommendation that studies be conducted in developing countries to \ntest the effectiveness and safety of short-term AZT therapy that could \nbe used in developing countries and that those studies be placebo-\ncontrolled to ensure safety in areas with various immune challenges. \nApproval was obtained by ethics committees in this country and the host \ncountries and by the UNAIDS program.\n  The studies were supported by many leaders in the medical field, and \nthe facts undermine Senator Ashcroft's criticism of Dr. Satcher.\n  Senator Ashcroft also mischaracterized Dr. Satcher's role in the \nsurvey of HIV child-bearing women. In 1995, seven years after the \nsurvey began during the Reagan Administration, Dr. Satcher, as acting \nCDC director, and Dr. Phil Lee, former Assistant Secretary for Health, \nhalted the HIV survey. They did so because of a combination of better \ntreatment options for children with HIV, the discovery of a therapeutic \nregimen to reduce mother-to-infant HIV transmission, and a greater \nability to monitor HIV trends in women of childbearing age in other \nways.\n  Dr. Satcher's participation in the survey was justified, and it was \nnot a valid reason for Senator Ashcroft to deny him confirmation as \nSurgeon General.\n  It was a gross distortion of his record in this situation. To \ncriticize him for taking actions which were inconsistent with ethical \nconsiderations in that case was a complete distortion of the record.\n  The case of James Hormel is also especially troubling. When Mr. \nHormel was nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to \nLuxembourg, Senator Ashcroft and Senator Helms were the only two \nmembers of the Foreign Relations Committee to oppose the nomination. \nAlthough Senator Ashcroft voted against Mr. Hormel, Senator Ashcroft \ndid not attend the confirmation hearings, did not submit written \nquestions, and refused Mr. Hormel's repeated requests to meet or speak \nby phone to discuss the nomination.\n  Generally, as a matter of courtesy, if a nominee asks individual \nmembers to meet with them to explain their positions, respond to \nquestions, as long as it have been in the Senate that has been a \nprivilege that has been extended. But not by Mr. Ashcroft to Mr. \nHormel, in spite of repeated requests.\n  In 1998, when asked about his opposition to Mr. Hormel's nomination, \nSenator Ashcroft stated that homosexuality is a sin and that a person's \nsexual conduct:\n\n       is within what could be considered and what is eligible for \n     consideration.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft also publicly stated in 1998 that:\n\n       [Mr. Hormel's] conduct and the way in which he would \n     represent the United States is probably not up to the \n     standard that I would expect.\n\n  Senator Leahy asked Senator Ashcroft at the Judiciary Committee \nhearings whether he opposed Hormel's nomination because of Hormel's \nsexual orientation. Senator Ashcroft responded ``I did not.'' Instead, \nSenator Ashcroft claimed that he had ``known Mr. Hormel for a long \ntime''--Mr. Hormel had been a dean of students at the University of \nChicago law school when Senator Ashcroft was a student there in the \n1960s. Senator Ashcroft repeatedly testified that he based his \nopposition to Mr. Hormel on the ``totality of the record.''\n  Mr. Hormel was so troubled by Senator Ashcroft's testimony that he \nwrote to the committee and said the following:\n\n       I want to state unequivocally and for the record that there \n     is no personal or professional relationship between me and \n     Mr. Ashcroft which could possibly support such a statement.\n\n  The letter continued:\n\n       I have had no contact with him [Ashcroft] of any type since \n     I left my position as Dean of Students . . . nearly thirty-\n     four years ago, in 1967 . . . For Mr. Ashcroft to state that \n     he was able to assess my qualifications . . . based upon his \n     personal long-time relationship with me is misleading, \n     erroneous, and disingenuous . . . I find it personally \n     offensive that Mr. Ashcroft, under oath and in response to \n     your direct questions, would choose to misstate the nature of \n     our relationship, insinuate objective grounds for voting \n     against me, and deny that his personal viewpoint about my \n     sexual orientation played any role in his actions.\n\n  We should all be deeply concerned about Senator Ashcroft's \nwillingness to mislead the Judiciary Committee about his reasons for \nopposing the Hormel nomination. As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted on \nJanuary 22, 2001:\n\n       [T]he most disturbing part of Mr. Ashcroft's testimony was \n     the way in which he misstated important parts of his record.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's efforts to derail the nominations of these four \ndistinguished men was grounded in a distortion of the facts. In every \ncase, He twisted events to suit his purposes and held the nominees to a \nstandard by which he could not be confirmed.\n  Sadly, the facts surrounding these nominations represent the tip of \nthe iceberg. Year after year, Senator Ashcroft worked to prevent the \nconfirmation of talented women and minorities--Marsha Berzon, Richard \nPaez, Margaret McKeown, and others. In some instances he was successful \nand--fortunately--in others, he was not. But, what is most disturbing \nis Senator Ashcroft's unfair treatment of well-qualified men and women, \nand, what appears to be, a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of \na federal jurist or the role of a member of the President's Cabinet.\n  I want to mention Senator Ashcroft's decades-long opposition to gun \ncontrol legislation.\n  Senator Ashcroft is closely tied to the gun lobby and he has often \naccepted contributions from these organizations and supported their \nagendas. During the hearing, he told us that keeping guns out of the \nhands of felons is a ``top priority'' of his. Yet, in 1998, this did \nnot seem to be a top priority for him. He supported an NRA-sponsored \nballot initiative that would have allowed almost anyone to carry \nconcealed guns in Missouri. The proposal was so filled with loopholes \nthat it would have allowed convicted child molesters and stalkers to \ncarry semi-automatic pistols into bars, sports stadiums, casinos and \nday care centers. The proposal was opposed by numerous law enforcement \ngroups and many in the business community. Proponents of the measure \nsay Senator Ashcroft volunteered his help to support the referendum, \neven recording a radio and endorsing the proposal. Senator Ashcroft \nstated in response to written questions that:\n\n       Although [he did] not recall the specific details, [his] \n     recollection is that supporters of the referendum approached \n     [him] and asked [him] to record the radio spot.\n\n  The fact remains that Senator Ashcroft did support the referendum and \ndid record the radio spot. Few can doubt that as a seasoned politician, \nSenator Ashcroft made himself fully aware of the contents of the \nreferendum before lending his name to it. And if he did not, there is \neven greater reason to question his judgment and suitability for such a \nhigh and important position in our Federal Government.\n  Senator Ashcroft championed the NRA's concealed weapon proposition in \n1998. But in 1992, while governor of Missouri, he had voiced his \nconcerns about such a measure. As governor, he stated he had ``grave \nconcerns'' about concealed carry laws. He stated:\n\n       Overall, I don't know that I would be one to want to \n     promote a whole lot of people carrying concealed weapons in \n     this society.\n\n  He further stated:\n\n       Obviously, if it's something to authorize everyone to carry \n     concealed weapons, I'd be concerned about it.\n\n  When asked about his change of view in deciding to support the 1998 \ninitiative, Senator Ashcroft said he changed his position because of \n``Research plus real-world experiences.''\n  However, Senator Ashcroft's research was so flawed that he responded \nto written questions that ``[t]o the extent there were loopholes in \nMissouri law'' that would permit convicted child molesters and stalkers \nto carry concealed weapons, he was ``unaware of those provisions at the \ntime.'' Later, it was reported that the gun lobby spent $400,000 in \nsupport of Senator Ashcroft's Senate reelection campaign. He became:\n\n     the unabashed celebrity spokesman . . . for the National \n     Rifle Association's recent attempts to arm citizens with \n     concealed weapons in Missouri.\n\n  That is according to a column by Laura Scott in the Kansas City Star.\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n  The Citizen's Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms gave \nSenator Ashcroft the ``Gun Rights Defender of the Month'' Award for \nleading the opposition to David Satcher's nomination to be Surgeon \nGeneral. The group objected to Dr. Satcher because he advocated \ntreating gun violence as a public health problem.\n  Based on his close ties to the gun lobby and his strong support for \ntheir agenda, it is difficult to have confidence that Senator Ashcroft \nwill fully and fairly enforce the nation's gun control laws and not \nseek to weaken them.\n  Senator Ashcroft has shown time and time again that he supports the \ngun lobby and opposes needed gun safety measures. Given the important \nlitigation in the Federal courts, it is imperative to have an Attorney \nGeneral who will strongly enforce current gun control laws such as the \nBrady law, the assault weapons ban, and other statutes. It is also \nimportant to have an Attorney General with a responsible view of \nproposed legislation when the Department of Justice is asked to comment \non it.\n  In conclusion, the Attorney General of the United States leads the \n85,000 men and women who enforce the Nation's laws in every community \nin the country. The Attorney General is the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer and a symbol of the Nation's commitment to justice. \nAmericans from every walk of life deserve to have trust in him to be \nfair and just in his words and in his actions. He has vast powers to \nenforce the laws and set priorities for law enforcement in ways that \nare fair or unfair--just or unjust.\n  When a President nominates a person to serve in his Cabinet, the \npresumption is rightly in favor of the nominee. But Senator Ashcroft \nhas a long and detailed record of relentless opposition on fundamental \nissues of civil rights and other basic rights of vital importance to \nall the people of America, and the people of this country deserve \nbetter than that. Americans are entitled to an Attorney General who \nwill vigorously fight to uphold the law and protect our constitutional \nrights. Based on a detailed review of his long record in public \nservice, Senator Ashcroft is not that man. I urge the Senate to vote no \non this nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Kennedy continues to \nmischaracterize Senator Ashcroft's record with regard to school \ndesegregation. First, let me say that I do not in the least condone \nsegregation in St. Louis or Kansas City or anywhere else. It is a \nshameful legacy that must be dealt with appropriately.\n  Second, while the costs of the desegregation program were exorbitant \nthis is not the only criticism to be made of the plans. The primary \nargument repeatedly made by Senator Ashcroft is that the state was \nnever found liable for an inter-district violation.\n  Senator Kennedy refers to an 8th circuit decision that he argues \nfound the State of Missouri guilty of an inter-district violation. But \na circuit court cannot make such a factual finding. Rather this is a \nfinding that must be made by the trial court.\n  The fact that the State was never found liable for an inter-district \nviolation is shown by the fact that throughout 1981 and 1982 the \nparties were preparing for a trial on the very question of inter-\ndistrict liability.\n  So again, I emphasize that it is true and correct to say that the \nState was never found liable for an inter-district violation.\n  Although the State was not found liable for an inter-district \nviolation it was required by the district court to pay for a settlement \nreached by the suburbs and the City of St. Louis. This order by the \ndistrict court was likely unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Milliken.\n  Opposing these court orders for a plan that was constitutionally \nsuspect, expensive, and ineffective, does not make Senator Ashcroft an \nopponent of desegregation.\n  Indeed, the plan as implemented has been a dismal failure. Test \nscores actually declined from 1990 to 1995. Scores on the Stanford \nAchievement Test went from 36.5 to 31.1 at a time when the national \nmean was 50. And the graduation rate has remained around a dismal 30 \npercent.\n  He has repeatedly stated the opposite position.\n  To question Senator Ashcroft's integrity over such a complicated and \ncontroversial issue is to seriously distort his record and disbelieve \nhis sworn testimony.\n  Senator Ashcroft acted with great probity as representative for the \nState of Missouri. He supports integration and deplores racism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Department of Justice is the \nrepresentative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a \nsovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as \nits obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, is that justice \nshall be done.\n  That obligation of impartiality, oft repeated by the Supreme Court, \ncourses as the lifeblood through all departments of any fair and \nrepresentative government. From it springs the confidence in government \nwhich is the presupposition central to the Founding Fathers' basic \npremise; that government derives its proper power only from the consent \nof the governed.\n  When George W. Bush campaigned for the presidency, when he took his \noath of office, he promised the American people that he would not \ndivide our house against itself. I took him at his word.\n  When he nominated John Ashcroft as Attorney General I kept an open \nmind and determined that I would, as I have always tried to do in the \npast, judge the nominee upon the evidence presented regarding his \nfitness for office, and that I would give the chief executive what \nleeway I could in his choice of people to carry out his plans and \npolicies. That license, however, is not unlimited, for it is also my \nobligation to pass upon the nominee; to weigh the evidence of his or \nher past and determine how it will affect our country's future.\n  I have weighed the facts revealed before the Judiciary Committee to \nthe best of my ability. The evidence has convinced me that Mr. Ashcroft \nhas demonstrated real and substantial biases against women, people of \ncolor, gays and lesbians, and anyone else who does not meet his \npersonal definition of what constitutes a true American. Not only has \nhe shown that pervasive bias, he has repeatedly acted upon it as \nattorney general and Governor of Missouri and as a member of this body.\n  It is with sadness I stand here tonight to say that the facts have \nforced me to two conclusions. First, John Ashcroft, while he has many \nfine qualities, he is not the person to be this country's chief law \nenforcement officer. Second, while President George W. Bush may wish to \nbe a unifier, he is not willing to put unity above partisan appeal to \nthe most extreme elements in the Republican Party.\n  To President Bush I say this. Please remember that it was the first \nRepublican President, Abraham Lincoln, who quoted from the Bible these \nwords, ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.'' You, President \nBush, campaigned on a platform of unification of this Nation. I will \nsupport every effort of yours to do so, but unification does not mean \nthat we abandon our commitment to fairness and impartiality and \nessential decency in government.\n  To John Ashcroft, I say that I cannot confirm to an office whose \nobligation to govern impartially is as compelling as his obligation to \ngovern at all; and whose interest, is that justice shall be done a man \nwho has repeatedly and pervasively demonstrated that he is not \nimpartial, and that he judges individuals not by the content of their \nsouls but rather by the tint of their ideology. I cannot confirm a man \nwho allows his bias against another's most personal lifestyle choices \nto effect his decision on whether that individual is fit to enter \npublic service. I cannot confirm a man who prevents women from options \nto which they should be entitled. I cannot confirm as Attorney General \nanyone who will not confer upon that office the impartiality it demands \nand, most importantly, deserves.\n  Mr. President, I cannot for the women of Nevada, for the people of \nNevada, vote to confirm John Ashcroft as Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  So when my name is called by the clerk of the Senate, I will respond \nwithout hesitation ``No.''\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, many of my Democratic \ncolleagues rose today and expressed their\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\nobjections to the nomination of former Senator Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. I do not wish to recapitulate their \narguments, but I share many of their concerns regarding his nomination. \nI believe former Senator John Ashcroft has been a dedicated public \nservant who has acted in what he felt was the public's best interest. \nBut his record has stirred controversy on a wide-range of issues. The \nposition of attorney general is one of great importance to the people \nof the United States. An Attorney General must unite the citizens. \nUnfortunately, Senator Ashcroft's record has tended to be divisive \nrather than unifying.\n  Most importantly, many Floridians are afraid that Senator Ashcroft \nwill turn back the clock on civil rights after all the progress that \nhas been made over the years. Based on his record and his testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, I share their concern.\n  An Attorney General, of all the Cabinet officers, must be perceived \nto be the most vigilant enforcer of the law, an attorney who will \nrepresent all the people's interest. I am afraid this nomination does \nnot meet that test. Thus, I am voting against confirmation.\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I truly believe that a President is \nentitled to his, or her, cabinet. I am aware that virtually all of \nPresident Clinton's cabinet was approved by voice vote, with one \nexception, which was a roll call vote, and that nominee was \noverwhelmingly approved.\n  However, the background record of this nominee is not mainstream on \nthe key issues. I know he is strong and tough on law and order issues. \nHowever, his views on certain issues--civil rights and desegregation, a \nwoman's right to choose and guns--make him an enormously divisive and \npolarizing figure.\n  This record can best be characterized as ultra-right wing. That is \nnot where most of the people in this nation are.\n  Senator Ashcroft's commitment to enforce the law in view of the \nextremeness of his record, as well as, on occasion, the harshness of \nhis rhetoric, makes it difficult to believe that he can, in fact, \nfairly and aggressively enforce laws he deeply believes are wrong.\n  When Senator John Ashcroft opposed Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head \nthe Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, he argued that \nLee was ``an advocate who is willing to pursue an objective and to \ncarry it with the kind of intensity that belongs to advocacy, but not \nwith the kind of balance that belongs to administration . . . his \npursuit of specific objectives that are important to him limit his \ncapacity to have the balanced view of making the judgments that will be \nnecessary for the person who runs [the Civil Rights] Division.''\n  If the Senator's own standard is applied to this nomination, he would \nnot be confirmed.\n  Last week, this committee held four days of hearings into the \nnomination of Senator Ashcroft. During that time, we witnessed a man \nwho had undergone a major transformation on many key issues of \nimportance to the people of my State and the nation. The question that \neach Senator must now ask, is whether that transformation is plausible \nafter more than 25 years of advocating the other side.\n  On a woman's right to choose, for example, the new John Ashcroft \nwould have us believe that he fully accepts Roe v. Wade as the law of \nthe land, and he will do nothing to try to overturn it. He would fully \nfund task forces to protect women as they enter abortion clinics, and \nstated firmly that ``no woman should fear being threatened or coerced \nin seeking constitutionally protected health services.''\n  Contrast that with the John Ashcroft of the past 25 years, who has \nlong argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion at all, \nthat Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, and in 1998 wrote that ``If I had \nthe opportunity to pass but a single law. I would . . . ban every \nabortion except those medically necessary to save the life of the \nmother.'' This John Ashcroft supported a constitutional amendment to \nban virtually all abortions, even in the cases of rape and incest--an \namendment that would also likely ban some of the most common forms of \nbirth control, including the pill and the IUD.\n  The John Ashcroft of 25 years once stated, ``Battles (for the unborn) \nare being waged in courtrooms and state legislatures all over the \ncountry. We need every arm, every shoulder, and every hand we can find. \nI urge you to enlist yourself in that fight.'' The new John Ashcroft \nclaims to have laid down his arms entirely.\n  On gun control, the new John Ashcroft says he supports background \nchecks at gun shows, says that he voted to deny the right to bear arms \nto domestic violence offenders, and says he would support re-\nauthorizing the assault weapons ban when it expires in 2004, although \nhe has called it ``wrong-headed.''\n  The old John Ashcroft, on the other hand, voted against mandatory \nbackground checks at gun shows, trigger locks on guns sold, and a ban \non large capacity ammunition magazines. He supported a concealed \nweapons law that would allow the people of Missouri to carry a \nconcealed firearm into a grocery store, a church, or on school grounds \nor on a school bus, superceding the Federal Gun Free Schools Act. He \nwas, and still may be, an active member of the National Rifle \nAssociation.\n  On civil rights, the old John Ashcroft strenuously fought a \ndesegregation plan in Missouri. In fact, the judge in the case stated \nthat Attorney General Ashcroft, ``as a matter of deliberate policy, \ndecided to defy the authority of this court.''\n  The old John Ashcroft spoke at Bob Jones University, that to this day \nremains highly questionable for its religious and racial bias; at the \nhearing he demurred when Senator Biden urged him to return the honorary \ndegree and did not rule out returning to the college in the future.\n  And the old John Ashcroft, in stating his reasons for voting against \nJames Hormel as Ambassador for Luxemburg, stated that Hormel had \n``actively supported the gay lifestyle,'' and that a person's sexual \nconduct is ``within what could be considered and what is eligible for \nconsideration'' for ambassadorial nominees.\n  Yet the new John Ashcroft promises never to discriminate against gays \nor lesbians for employment and said the reason for voting against \nAmbassador Hormel was because he knew him personally. Mr. Hormel called \nto tell me that he not only does not know Mr. Ashcroft, but that the \nSenator had refused to meet with him prior to his confirmation.\n  For over a quarter-century of public life, John Ashcroft has \nestablished a record of right-wing conservatism, and of views far to \nthe right of the average American, and even of many in his own party. \nSenator Ashcroft has spent a career fighting against a woman's right to \nchoose. He obstructed the nominations of several women and minority \ncandidates to the federal bench.\n  Senator Aschcroft said just two short years ago that `There are \nvoices in the Republican Party today who preach pragmatism, who \nchampion conciliation, who counsel compromise. I stand here today to \nreject those deceptions. If ever there was a time to unfurl the banner \nof unabashed conservatism, it is now.''\n  In 1997, Senator Ashcroft remarked that ``People's lives and fortunes \n[have] been relinquished to renegade judges--a robed, contemptuous \nintellectual elite.'' He continued that ``Judicial despotism . . . \nstands like a behemoth over this great land.''\n  In a speech entitled ``Courting Disaster: Judicial Despotism in the \nAge of Russell Clark,'' Senator Ashcroft reveals deep and antagonistic \nfeelings toward the courts of our country with this sentence: ``Can it \nbe said that the `people govern'? Can it still be said that citizens \ncontrol that which matters most? Or have people's lives and fortunes \nbeen relinquished to renegade judges--a robed contemptuous, \nintellectual elite that has turned the courts into `nurseries of vice \nand the bane of liberty'?''\n  And in the case of Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White's \nnomination to the federal bench, Senator Ashcroft was responsible for a \ndark day in the Senate. When a home-state Senator objects to a nominee, \nit is very unlikely that the nomination will go forward. But instead of \nquietly objecting early on and allowing White to withdraw his \nnomination with dignity if he so wished, John Ashcroft waited until the \nnominee reached the floor of the Senate--after waiting for two full\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\nyears--to derail the nomination and humiliate the nominee by stating, \n``We do not need judges with a tremendous bent toward criminal \nactivity.''\n  Whatever Senator Ashcroft's problem with Ronnie White, there was no \nneed to destroy White's reputation on the floor of the Senate, with no \nwarning and no chance for Judge White to either defend himself or \nwithdraw. This one act has become a stumbling block to my support, \nwhich I have not been able to get around. It says to me that it was \ndone for political purposes.\n  Taken as a whole, Senator Ashcroft's positions and statements, in my \nview, do not unite, but rather divide. They send strong signals to the \ndispossessed, the racial minorities of our country, and particularly to \nall women who have fought long and hard for reproductive freedom that \nthis Attorney General will not be supportive of laws for which they \nfought, no matter what he has said in the past weeks.\n  How can our citizens feel that this man will stand up for them when \ntheir civil rights are violated? How can the left out, the rape victim \nwho needs an abortion have faith that this man would enforce their \nrights?\n  In the end, every Senator must live with his or her own vote, and for \nthis Senator, that vote will be ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as a Senator, I do not serve on the \nJudiciary Committee, but I have watched nearly every hour of their \nhearing on the confirmation of John Ashcroft to be our next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  I have watched while men and women of good will, while attempting to \nspeak in soft and mellow tones, have been intimidated and bludgeoned by \nthe far left to such a point that we now hear them come to the floor of \nthe Senate and reach to find excuses to vote against a man of good \nfaith and a man of good will.\n  I am not an attorney, nor have I ever claimed to be, but as a human \nbeing who has served in public life for a good number of years and \nassociated with a great many people, I believe I am a reasonable judge \nof character.\n  This afternoon, I heard a speech from one of my colleagues about \nseeing into the heart of John Ashcroft. That particular Senator said \nthat once she had viewed the heart of John Ashcroft, she could not \nsupport him.\n  I suggest to that Senator that I have not seen into the heart of John \nAshcroft, but I know it because I have lived near it and around it for \nthe last 6 years. I know of its sincerity and its compassion. I know of \nits love of people and love of this institution. I know of its great \npatriotic pride for its country. I know of a heart that has served as a \nState attorney general, a Governor, a Senator, and who will soon serve \nas the U.S. Attorney General.\n  No, I have not seen the heart. I know the heart, and I know it to be \na heart of compassion, but I also know it to be a heart of truth, one \nwho, when he looks into the eyes of his colleagues and says, ``I will \nenforce the laws of this Nation,'' he and he alone is telling the \ntruth.\n  Why could we assume he would tell the truth when others in past years \nhave failed that test? Because he is a moral and ethical Christian.\n  That is a very valuable and important definition to understand \nbecause if you meet that definition, you must enforce the law; it is \nwithin your character and your being that you do such. Lawmakers and \nlaw enforcers are different types of people, but within the character \nof the definition I have just given, they are people who, by their very \nbeing, must enforce the law. They cannot arbitrarily, they cannot \nphilosophically, nor can they politically, adjust the law as we have \nseen it for 8 long years be adjusted to meet the politics of the day.\n  Quite the opposite happens with a man of the character of John \nAshcroft; for if he does not like the law, if he does not feel it \ncomports to his belief of what the culture and the character of our \ncountry ought to be, does he not enforce it? No. He turns to the \nlawmaking body, us, and says: You ought to change the law. It does not \nfit the character or the essence of the American way of life. But while \nit is here, I will enforce it as your Attorney General. You see, I \nmust; it is my responsibility. I have taken the oath of office, and in \ntaking that oath, I must uphold the law.\n  Yes, John Ashcroft is a Christian. He is a man of faith. My wife \nSuzanne and I know John and Janet Ashcroft well and personally. We have \ntraveled around the country and around the world with them. He is a \nclose, personal friend. In all of those times that we have traveled \ntogether, I have never heard him once speak ill of another human being. \nNot once have I ever heard him impugn the character of another human \nbeing.\n  Oh, John Ashcroft is a passionate man. He believes strongly in \ncertain ``isms.'' But most importantly, he believes in Jesus Christ. He \nis a Christian. That is a character valuable to the culture of our \ncountry.\n  What I have seen or what I have felt over the last several weeks is \nthe ultimate test coming down on John Ashcroft. While it has not been \nspoken, I sincerely believe it has been implied, that if you are a \nChristian, if you are a person of faith, you cannot serve in public \nlife and in public office in this country because it, in some way, \n``taints'' the way you think, the way you act, the way you respond.\n  I offer that challenge up to all of my colleagues because if that is \nwhat is being implied by the far left today, then shame on them, for it \nis outside the character of this country and it is outside the \nConstitution of this country.\n  Let me read from article VI. The last full paragraph of that article \nsays:\n\n       The Senators, and Representatives before mentioned, and the \n     Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive \n     and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the \n     several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to \n     support this constitution; but no religious Test shall ever \n     be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust \n     under the United States.\n\n  That is the Constitution of the United States. That is the hallowed \nvoice of our Founding Fathers. Yet by implication and innuendo, the far \nleft of this country has implied, time and time again over the last \nseveral weeks, that a Christian person, a person of faith, cannot be \ntrusted to serve and render the just and appropriate interpretation of \nthe laws of this country. That is not only wrong for our country; that \nis wrong under our Constitution. That test can never be allowed to be \napplied, whether on the right or on the left or down the center. It is \na test of character that we have prohibited in this country for all \ntime. And because we have prohibited it, our country is a sanctuary for \nall the world to seek.\n\n  Mr. President, I am confident, because I know John Ashcroft--I know \nhis heart, that he is a man of unquestionable character who will do as \nhe has said he will do before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate--\nthat he will enforce the laws of this land, so help him God.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nJohn Ashcroft to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  I spent 15 years of my professional career as a prosecutor, as a U.S. \nAttorney, in the Department of Justice. It is an institution for which \nI have the highest respect that I can express. The goal of equal \njustice under law is one of the highest and most valuable ideals any \nnation can have. I am convinced that this Nation's strength is because \nof our legal system, our pursuit of truth and accuracy and fairness in \ngiving everybody their day in court.\n  We need to give nominees here their day in court. And if we do, John \nAshcroft will be found to be a sterling nominee. The complaints that \nare made against him collapse in the face of the facts. And I believe \nthat is plain and accurate. I think that is an accurate statement. It \ndisappoints me to hear people persist in pursuing objections and \ncomplaints that, if fairly looked at and considered objectively, are \nnot meritorious.\n  Before I make my general remarks--and I will just respond to a few \nthings that have been said--I would like to\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\nhave printed in the Record a letter that was published in the \nWashington Post today. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 2001]\n\n                         Confirm John Ashcroft\n\n\n                                               Alamerica Bank,\n\n                                 Birmingham, AL, January 31, 2001.\n       To Members of the United States Senate: I am an African-\n     American from Birmingham, Alabama. I live in a state known \n     around the world for its long and ugly history of racial \n     segregation and pervasive discrimination.\n       I am a former National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People (``NAACP'') and Southern Christian Leadership \n     Conference (``SCLC'') trial attorney and a staunch supporter \n     of each organization's mission and goals. After graduating \n     from law school in 1973, I spent the next two decades \n     litigating and winning landmark school desegregation, fair \n     housing and equal employment opportunity cases for the NAACP \n     and SCLC. In 1976, I obtained a full and complete pardon from \n     the State of Alabama for Mr. Clarence Norris, the last known \n     surviving ``Scottsboro Boy''.\n       I voted for former President Bill Clinton twice and \n     supported him in his fight against impeachment. I also voted \n     for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman last Fall. I am a political \n     independent who assesses a political candidate or appointee's \n     fitness for office based upon the content of his character--\n     NOT his party affiliation.\n       I believe it is time for the United States Senate to \n     confirm John Ashcroft as Attorney General. Here is why:\n       1. As a former Governor and U.S. Senator, John Ashcroft may \n     have played political hardball, but he is not a racist.\n       When John Ashcroft was first nominated to be Attorney \n     General, I read the newspaper stories about his successful \n     effort to defeat the federal judgeship nomination of Missouri \n     Supreme Court Justice, Ronnie White. I was highly concerned. \n     I watched the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. There, I \n     saw a different story. I learned that Messrs. White and \n     Ashcroft were skillful and brilliant players at the game of \n     legislative hardball.\n       Mr. White, while a state legislator, used his powerful \n     committee chairmanship position to engage in political \n     jousting with then Governor Ashcroft. Years later, Mr. \n     Ashcroft continued the jousting by using his influence as a \n     Senator to defeat Mr. White's nomination to become a federal \n     district judge.\n       The defeat of Justice White was hardball, not racism. Mr. \n     White himself testified that John Ashcroft was not a racist.\n       2. It is time for America to have an Attorney General who \n     will enforce the law equally and fairly for all Americans.\n       As Black Americans, we see the problem of crime in America \n     up close and personal. Black Americans are among its greatest \n     victims. For us, it is particularly important that the \n     enforcement of our law be strong, effective and fair.\n       Mr. Ashcroft has also promised to investigate all alleged \n     voting rights violations, particularly those lodged in \n     Florida in the aftermath of last Fall's election. We expect \n     him to prosecute any criminal violations if federal laws \n     protecting voting rights were broken in Florida.\n       3. It is time to restore civility and dignity to the Senate \n     confirmation process.\n       Americans have watched the Senate confirmation process \n     deteriorate over the years since the Robert Bork nomination \n     in 1987. What used to be a calm exploration of a nominee's \n     qualifications often now becomes a trial by ordeal. Both \n     political parties decry the so-called ``politics of personal \n     destruction'' and then eagerly employ it. Special interest \n     groups on all sides regard a confirmation battle as a \n     fundraising opportunity and a test of strength, regardless of \n     its impact on the nominee. A vote for John Ashcroft will not, \n     in itself, restore civility to the confirmation process, but \n     it will help.\n       It is time for all Americans to stop fighting the outcome \n     of last Fall's election and give President Bush a chance to \n     govern. President Bush has selected a diverse and inclusive \n     cabinet. We must give his team an opportunity to lead this \n     nation. If Mr. Ashcroft does not live up to his commitment to \n     enforce our federal laws on an even-handed basis, we can deal \n     with that in the political arena at a later date. Until then, \n     we should respect President Bush's choice for Attorney \n     General.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Donald V. Watkins,\n                                             Founder and Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the letter was paid for by Donald V. \nWatkins of Birmingham, Alabama. He is one of Alabama's most prominent \nAfrican American leaders, and he is an attorney. I went to law school \nwith Don.\n  He has been an active Democrat. He says in his letter that he \nsupported the Gore-Lieberman ticket this time. He has been a lawyer for \nthe NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a trial \nattorney, and ``a staunch supporter of each organization's missions and \ngoals.''\n  Don says it is time for us to restore civility and dignity to the \nSenate confirmation process. In effect, he says that President Bush has \nbeen elected. He made some promises. He promised to have a more diverse \nCabinet. This civil rights advocate, this skilled lawyer says that he \nhas followed those commitments and that what the African American \ncommunity should do is to insist that he follows the other commitments \nhe made and judge him on what he does, because he is the President, and \nwe should give him a fair chance to succeed.\n  He says John Ashcroft should be confirmed. Quoting from the letter:\n\n       Americans have watched the Senate confirmation process \n     deteriorate over the years since the Bork nomination in 1987. \n     What used to be a calm exploration of a nominee's \n     qualifications now often becomes a trial by ordeal. A vote \n     for John Ashcroft will not, in itself, restore civility to \n     the confirmation process, but it will help.\n\n  Don Watkins says:\n\n       It is time for all Americans to stop fighting the outcome \n     of last Fall's election and give President Bush a chance to \n     govern. President Bush has selected a diverse and inclusive \n     cabinet. We must give his team an opportunity to lead this \n     nation. If Mr. Ashcroft does not live up to his commitment to \n     enforce our federal laws on an even-handed basis, we can deal \n     with that in the political arena at a later date. Until then, \n     we should respect President Bush's choice for Attorney \n     General.\n  I think that says it well. I had no advance notice of this. I had no \nidea this would appear from this fine and skilled advocate for equal \nrights in America.\n  I want to share a few matters that are important to correct. They \nhave been repeated so often; I believe they are so incorrect that they \nought to be responded to. First, in this town, people know who are \nhonest and truthful--people who tell the truth, people who are straight \nshooters--it is pretty well known. And it is known those who cannot be \ntrusted. There are not many you would trust on almost any matter \nwhatsoever. John Ashcroft, though, is that kind of person. You have \nheard people say that repeatedly today and in days past. They know him. \nThey respect him. He is a man of integrity, a man of religious faith, \nyes, a leader in his denomination, a man who is broadly respected all \nover America for the very qualities that are so much in need today.\n  If anybody reads my mail and listens to the comments I am receiving \nfrom people with a longing and a deep concern about their country, that \na man of this quality is beaten up and attacked and dismembered, in \neffect, while at the same time we have the same Members of this body \nwho have been steadfastly and tenaciously defending the kind of spin \nthat has gone on in this town that led to impeachment and other \nmatters, they are having a difficult time comprehending that.\n  Anyway, we are here. People have had their day. They have been able \nto appear at the hearing and present their charges. We, as Senators, \nare supposed to weigh them. It is all right. I believe in free debate. \nNobody should be stifled--they ought to have their say. But we are not \nrun here by special interest groups. Handgun Control does not control \nin this body. We take an oath to obey the law and to do justice here, \nnot to kowtow to every group who builds up a campaign to pressure \nMembers of this body to vote the way they want, threaten them that they \nwon't support them in primary elections in the future, and otherwise \nmake their lives miserable in every way they possibly can to get them \nto vote a certain way. They have a right to write and threaten and say \nthey are not going to vote for somebody. It is a free country. But we, \nas Senators, have a right and a duty and a responsibility to do the \nright thing.\n  I know there are some conservative groups who tried to pressure \nChairman Hatch on some issues. He said: We are willing to listen to you \nand have your input, but I am a Senator. I happen to chair this \ncommittee. As long as I chair the committee, we are going to do this \nfairly and above board and no interest group is going to have an undue \ninfluence in how I do my job.\n  That is a fact. People know that here. We need to remember that as we \ngo forward with this process.\n  One of the charges that has been made that is somewhat complicated, \nbut at bottom is very simple, is this charge that John Ashcroft opposed \nintegration. That is a bad thing to say. He came before the committee \nand\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\nlooked us all in the eye and said: I support integration; I do not \noppose integration. He said what he opposed was a Federal court plan \nthat was extreme, in my view and in the view of a lot of legal \nscholars, to create a massive Federal intervention in the educational \nsystems of Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri. In fact, the Federal \ncourt plans ordered an additional $3 billion in funding to be spent to \ncarry out these plans. A lot of it was for busing; a lot of it was for \nother activities.\n  This was a big deal. His predecessor opposed that court activity. His \nsuccessor opposed it. His second successor opposed it. His second \nsuccessor as attorney general was Jay Nixon, with whom I served when I \nwas Attorney General of Alabama. Jay Nixon opposed this. He is a \nDemocrat and was supported by two Members of this body in his effort to \nrun for the U.S. Senate while he was resisting this litigation in the \nState. Why would we want to oppose that?\n\n  The wording the complainers have used is that he opposed voluntary \ncourt desegregation or voluntary desegregation in Missouri.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how that happens. I was Attorney General of \nAlabama. I have been through this. It is a common thing in America, as \nwe try to deal with the vestiges of segregation. Some of it was legal. \nSome of it has been by just the nature of the residences that \nsegregation occurred, and various efforts have been made to deal with \nthis.\n  It has been said: How did he oppose voluntary desegregation?\n  This is what happened. Plaintiffs sued St. Louis and Kansas City. \nThey sued the suburbs, and they got to court and claimed the school \nsystem is segregated by design, in effect. They object to it. They want \nit to end. The school systems resist, and the litigation goes on. And \nthe judge in this case essentially suggested or indicated that he just \nmight render an order that would eliminate all the suburban cities and \nmerge them--at least their school systems--merge them with the St. \nLouis school system. We would just have one big school system. That is \njust what he might do, he said.\n  So threatened with their very educational system at stake, they \nvoluntarily, under those kinds of threats, agreed to a plan to spend a \nmassive amount of money to bus students around in an effort to achieve \nracial balance, which the judge was pushing to make happen.\n  They said: By the way, state of Missouri, you pay for it. We run our \nschool system here, the city of St. Louis runs theirs, but we want you \nto pay the cost of this.\n  The Attorney General of the State of Missouri was the one person who \nhad a responsibility and a duty, the lawyer for all the people of \nMissouri, to question whether or not citizens all over the State ought \nto pay for this kind of massive plan.\n  He objected to that. He resisted as did two of his successors who \nresisted it. In fact, one of the most infamous of all court plans was \nbecause a Federal judge ordered one of the school districts to raise \ntaxes to pay for his idea of the school.\n  That is what we are talking about--a consent decree. I have seen \nthem. They will sue the prison system. The prison system will put up a \nlittle defense, or the mental health system, or the school system will, \nand they will go in and say: Judge, I guess you are right. Order the \nState of Alabama to give more money to run the prison. Order the State \nof Alabama to give more money to the mental health system because these \nare the people who would like to have more money because it is their \nsystem they are running, and they don't have an objective position. The \nattorney general is the one who has to represent the entire State and \nto question what is happening.\n  Let me tell you why an attorney general has a particular duty to \nresist. He has a particular duty because this unelected lifetime-\nappointed Federal judge who is saying he is going to abolish the school \ndistrict and consolidate them into one, who is taking an action that \nviolates the Constitution of the State of Missouri--violates the \nstatutory laws of the State of Missouri, violates the duly elected \nschool boards and districts, and the school boards' authority given to \nthem by the people of the State of Missouri and people in that \ndistrict. And he is going to rip all of that apart and impose his will \non how education ought to be conducted in the targeted community in \nthat state.\n  Do you see how important this is for a principal attorney general. He \nshould resist and defend unless it is absolutely clear that there is no \nother way that a constitutional deprivation can be ended. He should \nresist the compromise of the Constitution and laws of his State, as did \nhis predecessor and as did his two successors. To say those acts of \nprincipal resistance to a Federal evisceration of the local educational \nscheme demonstrates lack of concern for children or somebody who wants \nto maintain segregation is just plain wrong. We ought not to twist \nthose kinds of things today into that sort of mentality. I don't like \nthat.\n  There is one more thing I will mention--the Bill Lann Lee nomination, \nalthough I could do this on almost every allegation that is before us.\n  Bill Lann Lee was opposed not just by John Ashcroft. He failed to \ncome out of the Judiciary Committee on a tie vote, 9-9. I am not aware \nthat John even spoke about it. Perhaps he did, but I do not know what \nhe said. I do remember that I spoke against the Lee nomination. I \nremember Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee made an eloquent \nargument against Mr. Lee.\n  I would like to mention a couple of things about that. Oh, Mr. Lee, \nis so terribly pitiful, that he has just been put upon and he has been \nabused, is what they would say.\n  But let me tell you. We had a full hearing on the Adarand case. We \nhad a hearing on that. Mrs. Adarand even came. Adarand, for purposes of \nbackground, is the case that sets out the law for quotas in America. \nThey said you can't have racial set-asides and quotas. Mr. Lee refused \nto acknowledge the real meaning of Adarand.\n  He said he would support Adarand, but when questioned in detail, he \ndefined it in such a way that it was clear that the chief of the Civil \nRights Division would not support the principle that Adarand stated. \nThat is why the chairman of the Judiciary Committee opposed it. He made \nsomething like a 15-page speech on this floor and delineated in high \nstyle and with great legal expertise why this was important and why he \nreluctantly opposed this nomination. He did not attack--nor did any of \none of us at any time attack--the character of Bill Lann Lee. We simply \nsaid that we believed he did not understand the meaning of that case \nand would not follow the law of the United States and, as such, that he \nshould not be confirmed.\n  That is what happened. To suggest that John Ashcroft went out of his \nway to block this nominee is just one more statement that is inaccurate \nand unfair to the good and decent man whom I believe will soon be \nAttorney General and whom I am confident will be one of the greatest \nAttorneys General in the history of this nation. People are going to \nappreciate him. He will restore dignity. He will restore integrity. He \nwill bring personal probity and decency to that office and will, I \nbelieve, be greatly respected when he concludes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair. I commend the articulate, \nknowledgeable, and eloquent Senator from Alabama for his remarks on a \nvariety of issues.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have received a statement from the \neditor of the Southern Partisan magazine that has been attacked here to \nsome degree. I have never read the magazine. But it is a refutation of \nmany of the statements made about the magazine. It certainly is proof \nthat the magazine is in a much better light than it has been reported \nto be here on the floor.\n  I note that Senator Ashcroft, when he was interviewed by it, simply \ndid a telephone interview with the magazine. There was no evidence he \never read it, or saw it, or knew much about it.\n  I think it would be healthy for the statement of Chris Sullivan, \neditor of the Southern Partisan, to be made part of the Record in which \nhe flatly denies that he favored, or the magazine favored, segregation \nor other kinds of racially--discriminatory activities.\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Southern Partisan,\n\n                                                 January 11, 2001.\n     FROM: Chris Sullivan, Editor\n     RE: Refutation of false reports now being circulated about \n         Southern Partisan magazine in an effort to damage John \n         Ashcroft\n       A number of false reports are circulating in the national \n     press, alleging that Southern Partisan is a ``racist,'' \n     ``segregationist,'' ``secessionist,'' or ``white-\n     supremacist'' magazine. This is part of an orchestrated \n     effort to embarrass Senator John Ashcroft for having once \n     been interviewed by our magazine.\n       Most of the distortions can be traced to an article by \n     Benjamin Soskis in the New Republic which contained a series \n     of factual errors and distortions extracted from any sense of \n     fair or accurate context, some of which were clearly \n     malicious. People for the American Way subsequently loaded \n     all of those gross distortions onto their web-page. After \n     that, reporters and editorial writers for mainstream outlets \n     covering the presidential primary reported the errors as if \n     they were factual.\n       For those who may be interested in the facts, I have \n     assembled the following item-by-item refutation of these \n     false reports:\n       1. Senator Joe Biden said on Meet the Press that Southern \n     Partisan is ``a white-supremacist magazine, or so I've been \n     told.'' Others have labeled us ``neosegregationist'' and \n     ``racist.''\n       Those charges are absolutely false. In 20 years of \n     publication, our journal has never advocated segregation, \n     white-supremacy or any form of racism. Indeed one of our \n     central purposes is to defend the South against such \n     stereotypical and reactionary attacks. Our editors and \n     contributors have included highly respected writers, \n     academics and journalists like Russell Kirk, Aleksandr \n     Solzhenitsyn, Murray Rothbard, Walter Williams, Anthony \n     Harrigan, Kenneth Cribb, J.O. Tate, Andrew Lytle, Cleanth \n     Brooks and many others.\n       2. The allegation that John Ashcroft's interview is somehow \n     disreputable. A simple listing of others who have been \n     interviewed in our ``Partisan Conversation'' section (which \n     is where Ashcroft appeared) should suffice to rebut this \n     silly charge. Other Interviewees include NBC weatherman \n     Willard Scott, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, civil \n     rights activist James Meredith, poet laureate James Dickey \n     and political leaders like Senators Trent Lott, Phil Gramm, \n     Jesse Helms and Thad Cochran as well as Ashcroft (a list of \n     other interviewees is attached).\n       3. The allegation that our magazine ``praises'' David Duke. \n     Absolutely not true. Twelve years ago, when Duke was running \n     for office in Louisiana, he claimed he had converted to \n     Christianity, renounced his past Klan involvement and \n     campaigned on a mainstream conservative platform. At that \n     time, we published a column defending the people of Louisiana \n     for taking Duke at his word. As it turned out, Mr. Duke was \n     deceiving everyone. In subsequent years he was rejected by he \n     voters of Louisiana, which was a happy ending. (I have \n     attached the full column in question, which is now 12 years \n     old, to show just how the meaning was twisted by the out-of-\n     context quote. Item #1 shows he quote extracted by \n     ``researchers'' seeking to damage the magazine. Item #2 makes \n     the true meaning clear).\n       4. The allegation that our magazine defends slavery. Again, \n     that outrageous idea got started by the New Republic. The \n     quote offered to ``prove'' we defend slavery was taken from a \n     book review of a scholarly work on slavery called Time on the \n     Cross. (Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman) One of the \n     findings of that book (based on plantation economic records) \n     was that slave families were not frequently broken up, \n     contrary to what was then a general view. Breaking up slave \n     families was bad for morale and therefore bad for business. \n     In preparing this memo, I consulted Dr. Walter Edgar's recent \n     book on the history of South Carolina, which has been widely \n     praised. Dr. Edgar is not a Republican or a conservative. The \n     1998 edition of his book has this to say on page 317: \n     ``Owners realized that it was to their advantage to encourage \n     stable slave family life . . . Slaves who had families were \n     less likely to run away. . .'' Obviously, in no way is such a \n     point intended to justify or defend slavery, which was a \n     terrible national tragedy. The point the reviewer hoped to \n     make was that slavery was bad enough without being \n     exaggerated.\n       5. The allegation that our magazine engages in ethnic \n     slurs. The quote most often offered to prove this allegation \n     was taken from a column Reid Buckley, William F.'s brother, \n     wrote for us 17 years ago. Here is what the New Republic \n     reported that Mr. Buckley had written:\n       ``In 1987 the magazine offered a vision of South African \n     history straight from the apartheid-era textbooks: `God led \n     [Afrikaners] into the Transvaal, it was with God that they \n     made their prayerful covenant when they were besieged by \n     bloodthirsty savages on all sides.' ''\n       Here is the actual text from which the quote was \n     dishonestly extracted:\n       ``Then what demon has provoked their hateful policies? \n     Well, not demon, it transpires upon reading a little South \n     African history. God Almighty. In their view. [Emphasis in \n     the original] God led them into the Transvaal, it was with \n     God that they made their prayerful covenant when they were \n     besieged by bloodthirsty savages on all side.''\n       It is obvious to even the most casual reader that Mr. \n     Buckley is actually criticizing the ``hateful policies'' of \n     apartheid, not defending them. The New Republic article \n     extracted a partial quote that completely reversed the \n     author's meaning. We can only assume that the distortion is \n     deliberate. Why else would the New Republic writer have \n     lifted only a portion of the passage?\n       6. The allegation that our magazine sells hateful t-shirts \n     and bumper strips, including a shirt with Lincoln's image and \n     the legend ``sic semper tyrannis'' which are the words Booth \n     uttered before he shot Lincoln.\n       There is a web site called pointsouth.com that apparently \n     sells a variety of Southern novelty items including bumper \n     strips. We have no ties whatsoever with that web site. For a \n     time, pointsouth.com carried a link to our web site. When we \n     discovered that they were selling bumper strips with messages \n     we found to be tasteless, we asked that the link be deleted. \n     It was.\n       As to the Lincoln ``Sic semper tyrannis'' t-shirt: that \n     tasteless item has never been advertised or sold on the pages \n     of our magazine. Seven years ago, a part-time staff member of \n     our magazine offered to compile a catalog of Southern items \n     available--from various vendors--such as art prints, books, \n     ties, grits, t-shirts, etc., to raise money to help defray \n     the cost of the magazine. The catalog was compiled and mailed \n     to our readers as a separate brochure, without careful review \n     by our editors. The catalog included a ``tree of liberty'' t-\n     shirt with the image of an oak tree and a quote from Thomas \n     Jefferson. Apparently the Lincoln image with the sic semper \n     tyrannis logo appeared on the reverse side of the t-shirt. \n     While the slogan was noted in the fine print, that face \n     escaped our attention. Nevertheless, it was advertised in the \n     catalog one time seven years ago. The catalog was cancelled \n     soon thereafter. Yes, the Lincoln message was in poor taste. \n     It was a mistake. We regret that it was sold through a \n     catalog our name was briefly associated with. But any effort \n     to hold Senator Ashcroft accountable for that is absurd.\n       7. The allegation that our magazine is anti-Semitic.\n       Of all the charges made, this is the single most baseless. \n     I do not believe Southern Partisan has ever published a \n     single negative comment about Jews. On the contrary, we have \n     published numerous very favorable articles on Jewish \n     Confederates and Judah P. Benjamin, pointing out that the \n     Confederate government had a Jewish member of its cabinet 50 \n     years before the federal government. The charge of anti-\n     Semitism against the magazine is completely unfounded.\n       8. The allegation that we are hostile to Martin Luther King \n     Day.\n       Two decades ago, there was widespread opposition to MLK Day \n     among conservatives all over the country. Around that time \n     (18 years ago in fact) we published a column suggesting that \n     other African-Americans in history might be more worthy of \n     elevation to holiday status. Examples of George Washington \n     Carver, Booker T. Washington and General Chappie James were \n     given. Of course, the debate is long over. MLK Day is now \n     accepted as a part of the nation's life. Nothing negative has \n     been written on our pages about MLK Day for the past 18 \n     years. In fact, South Carolina, the State where we publish, \n     recently converted MLK Day from an optional to a free-\n     standing holiday. The son of the writer who wrote that column \n     18 years ago is a member of the S.C. State Legislature. He \n     voted for the holiday with his Dad's support.\n       9. The allegation that we are hostile to Nelson Mandela.\n       Again, the column cited to support that allegation was \n     written over a decade ago. At the time, the idea that Mandela \n     had engaged in violence before his arrest and refused to \n     renounce violence as a precondition to release from jail was \n     widely reported. The views on Mandela expressed a decade ago \n     were conventional for conservative writers from all regions \n     of the country. In subsequent years, Mandela (who is now a \n     respected elder statesman) has changed his mind about \n     violence in the manner of Sadat and Begin.\n       10. The allegation that our magazine called Lincoln ``a \n     consummate liar * * *''.\n       The quote was taken from a speech given by the late Murray \n     Rothbard, a respected Jewish intellectual. He was president \n     emeritus of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, speaking at a \n     seminar on the cost of war. The introductory phrase left out \n     of Dr. Rothbard's remarks (which completely alters the \n     meaning) was this: ``Of course, Abraham Lincoln was a \n     politician which means he was a consummate liar, manipulator \n     * * *'' etc. The quote was followed by laughter from those in \n     attendance. In other words, it was a generic insult against \n     politicians intended to be humorous.\n       The ten slanders listed above are the major ones we have \n     seen in the media for the past six months. There may be \n     others. If so, please let us know so we will have an \n     opportunity to defend ourselves. Our concern is not only with \n     the reputation of our magazine but also with all the people \n     who have written for us or been interviewed by us over the \n     years. They are innocent bystanders in this scorched earth \n     campaign to defeat Sen. Ashcroft. Their reputations are very \n     important to them and to their families.\n\n[[Page S907]]\n\n       To our dismay, these slanders have metastasized like an \n     aggressive cancer throughout the national news media. In \n     fact, months ago, we sent all of the above corrections to the \n     People for the American Way with a polite request that they \n     correct their web site. They never did. It truly is shocking \n     that there are groups so radically committed to their \n     political agenda that they are willing to destroy reputations \n     falsely in an effort to prevent the appointment to a person \n     they disagree with.\n       Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional \n     questions (803-254-3660).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise as a new Member of the Senate, \nhaving listened to the arguments back and forth for several weeks on \nthe matter of John Ashcroft's nomination as Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  As a new Member, some of the arguments made, various votes and so \nforth are of interest, and there is some hyperbole to it.\n  But let me tell you that coming out of the real world and going \nthrough a campaign and listening to people in Virginia and elsewhere, I \nthink if there is one message that the American people sent to our \ncountry's leaders last November, it was this:\n  The politics of personal destruction in our country must end. Sadly, \nthere are some leaders of organized interest groups who have already \nturned a deaf ear to that message, even as we in the Senate are working \nso hard to move America forward in a bi-partisan manner.\n  Of course, I understand that some of my colleagues may disagree with \nthe philosophy of our new President and his choice for Attorney \nGeneral. However, when the Chief Executive picks his management team, \nunless there is an extraordinary reason that would dictate otherwise, \nthis body should not stand in his way or obstruct. Political \nopportunism is not an appropriate rationale for withholding consent for \na nominee.\n  When I served as Governor of Virginia, I was fortunate to have a \ncapable cabinet who assisted me in managing the day-to-day operation of \nstate government and advancing the agenda I established. While both the \nHouse and Senate in Virginia are required to approve of the Governor's \nselections, they have always, without exception, afforded the Governor \nthe ability to name the qualified individuals he recruits to lead the \nteam. No matter how distasteful the views of the nominee might be to \nsome on the other side of the aisle, except for a very very few \nlegislators, Republicans and Democrats alike have continuously \nrespectfully rallied to put the best interests of Virginia ahead of \npolitical chicanery and that has effectively enabled Virginia's \nGovernors to do the job they were elected to do.\n  The federal government should be no different and John Ashcroft \ndeserves the support of the United States Senate for Attorney General. \nHe has proven himself a caring and capable leader during his many years \nof public service. Elected by the people of Missouri five times, his is \na long record of achievement for all of the people he has represented. \nIt is incumbent on all of us to examine the totality of his record and \nto not be drawn to a single contorted, concocted blemish on a sterling \n30-year record. As we proceed toward a vote on his nomination, we must \nunderstand what is in this man's heart, not what is displayed on the \ntelevision screen in a 15-second distorted charge from heavily funded \nspecial interests.\n  Mr. President, the people of the United States expect principled \ncivil, debate here and in elections. In numerous elections all across \nthe U.S. last year, voters rejected the politics of division. \nVirginians, like so many other Americans, want our country to heal \nitself and to move beyond scare tactics and personal destruction.\n  We, here in the United States Senate, have the unique ability to \nprove to Americans that this noble goal is achievable. Let's move \nforward! I respectfully urge my colleagues to join together to rise to \na higher plane and vote to confirm the honorable John Ashcroft as \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of our distinguished former colleague, John \nAshcroft, to serve as Attorney General.\n  The debate we have been engaged in is not about Senator Ashcroft's \nqualifications because they are not in question. He has a wealth of \nexperience and a record of exemplary public service that spans three \ndecades. Twenty years ago, I recommended him for Attorney General under \nPresident Reagan, and I would like to place that letter into the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks. The intervening time has only made it \nmore clear that he should serve in this position. Before I had the \npleasure of working with him in the Senate and on the Judiciary \nCommittee, he served two terms as Missouri's Attorney General and \nGovernor. Senator Ashcroft is one of the most qualified people \nnominated for this position in all my years of public service.\n  I recognize that some Senators disagree with some of the positions \nthat he has taken during his almost thirty years in public life. As I \nsaid during his confirmation hearing, I hope the question will not be \nwhether we agree with him on every issue. That is a standard he cannot \nmeet for all of us. The President is entitled to some deference from \nthe Senate in selecting those who will carry out the President's \nagenda.\n  In the Senate, what we can expect is that the Attorney General will \ndo his job and enforce all the laws, and Senator Ashcroft will. His \nrecord of enforcing laws that he did not support while serving as \nMissouri Attorney General should help prove it.\n  We should keep in mind that all Attorneys General are called upon to \nenforce laws they do not support. The last Attorney General, Janet \nReno, opposed the death penalty. I was one of many senators who \nstrongly disagreed with her on this point, but we still supported her \nquick confirmation.\n  During the extensive committee hearings recently, Senator Ashcroft \ndid not have much time to talk about issues which will occupy most of \nhis time as Attorney General, such as crime and drugs. In the Senate, \nhe was a leader in fighting crime and helping keep drugs out of the \nhands of children. He also stood up for victim's rights. It should come \nas no surprise that the law enforcement community strongly supports \nhim.\n  Some of the toughest criticism of Senator Ashcroft's record is simply \nnot warranted. For example, it was proper for him to oppose a judge-\nimposed school desegregation plan in Kansas City called Missouri v. \nJenkins. In that case, the judge ordered a massive tax increase to pay \nfor his almost unlimited school improvements, which included a 2,000 \nsquare-foot planetarium, a 25-acre farm, a model United Nations, an art \ngallery, movie editing rooms, and swimming pools. The plan was an \nelaborate social experiment in the name of education, and it utterly \nfailed. Moreover, it established terrible legal precedent regarding the \npower of federal judges. I have introduced legislation in every \nCongress since to prohibit judges from being able to impose a tax \nincrease. Elected state officials should represent their constituents \nand oppose activist federal judges like this, as long as they comply \nwith the court after the case ends, as John Ashcroft did.\n  On another matter, I believe it is highly unfortunate that some \noutside special interests have gone beyond specific issues in their \nattacks and have criticized ``Senator Ashcroft's identification with . \n. . religious, right-wing extremism.'' This Senate should not tolerate \nany effort to make a person's religious beliefs an issue in whether \nthey should serve in a high government position. As the Union of \nOrthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote to the Senate, ``this \nview has been the subtext for some of the criticism of Mr. Ashcroft. We \nare confident that you will reject it, as you would any other form of \nprejudice.''\n\n  Senator Ashcroft has not only received strong support from well-known \nChristian organizations, such as the Christian Coalition, he has been \nendorsed by organizations of various religious faiths, such as the \nmajor Orthodox Jewish Organization, Agudath Israel of America. This is \na testament to what kind of person John Ashcroft is.\n  In fact, he should be praised for his deep religious convictions. It \nhelps explain many of his fine traits. He is a man of honesty and \nintegrity, and a person of strong moral character.\n  I am confident that he will serve with dedication and distinction as \nthe\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\nNation's top law enforcement officer. America needs a man like Senator \nAshcroft to lead the Justice Department. I urge all of my colleagues to \nlook beyond partisan politics and support this exceptional candidate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referenced earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1980.\n     Mr. Edwin Meese III,\n     Office of the President-Elect,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ed: Among the more important appointments that \n     President-Elect Reagan soon will make is that of Attorney \n     General of the United States. In this regard, I want to bring \n     to your attention The Honorable John Ashcroft, presently \n     Attorney General of the State of Missouri.\n       John Ashcroft was elected the 38th Attorney General of \n     Missouri in 1976. He was just reelected to another term in \n     that office, demonstrating the trust that the people of \n     Missouri have in this very bright, very dedicated young man.\n       I first met John Ashcroft in 1976. At that time, I was \n     immediately impressed with him. More recently, as I traveled \n     around the country speaking on behalf of Governor Reagan, I \n     had the pleasure of seeing John again. In fact, he introduced \n     me on one such visit to Missouri to attend a Reagan-Bush \n     rally.\n       I consider John Ashcroft to be one of our more promising \n     young Republican leaders and believe that he represents the \n     kind of young but experienced talent that could be used well \n     in the Reagan Administration in the post of Attorney General.\n       I am submitting a packet of informational materials on \n     John. I hope that you will review them carefully and that you \n     will conclude, as I have, that John deserves to be at the top \n     of your list of nominees for the post of Attorney General.\n       If I can provide other, additional materials of assistance \n     to you in this regard, please let me know.\n       With kindest personal regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator John Ashcroft \nfor Attorney General, and will outline some sound business reasons for \nthis position.\n  Senator Ashcroft has proven himself the friend of American consumers, \ninvestors, and businesses, especially in the high technology sector \nwhich has driven much of the prosperity of the last long economic \nexpansion.\n  His potential leadership in the Department of Justice has been hailed \nas especially good news by high tech businesses and investors, whose \nretirement and pensions rely on the health of the technology stocks \nthat have recently taken a beating.\n  Indeed, James Lucier of Prudential Securities recently wrote to \ninvestors,\n\n       Technology investors got their Christmas present three days \n     early on December 22 when President-elect George W. Bush \n     named . . . John Ashcroft as his choice to serve as Attorney \n     General . . . [W]e find it hard to imagine Bush choosing a \n     potential attorney general with better qualifications than \n     Ashcroft to restore investor confidence and dispel the more \n     extreme, valuation-depressing fears of political risk at a \n     time when Congress is set to take up a slate of complex \n     issues with ample potential to raise blood pressures among \n     the investor class.--Prudential Securities, ``Washington \n     Research, Washington World,'' January 3, 2001, p. 1.\n\n  In other words, according to some analysts, tech-sector investors who \nhave been worried about their wealth or retirement security because of \nrecent tech-stock losses can breath a little easier if John Ashcroft is \nconfirmed as Attorney General. With so many Americans now relying on \nthose investments, I think they need to understand that the partisan \nextremists fighting Senator Ashcroft could be putting at risk many \nAmericans' economic and retirement security to satisfy their own \npolitical interests.\n  His general approach of avoiding unnecessary regulation of and \nlitigation against business will help foster a positive economic \nenvironment that is so important to all Americans.\n  Senator Ashcroft has also played a role in helping consumers enjoy \nthe benefits of technology. The same newsletter points out Ashcroft's \nrole as Attorney General in Missouri authoring and filing an amicus \nbrief joined by other state attorneys general supporting Sony \nCorporation's contention that consumers had the right to ``time-shift'' \ntelevision broadcasts by taping on their VCRs in the famous Betamax \nSupreme Court case.\n  He has worked to support the development of the Internet, to avoid \ntaxes that would slow the growth of e-commerce; he has pushed to allow \nconsumers and Internet users to use strong encryption to protect their \nprivacy online, and to keep American companies at the forefront of \nencryption and software development.\n  All in all, Senator Ashcroft's nomination and confirmation should be \na boon to our economy, to investors, our businesses, and consumers. I \nwould hope that consumers, investors, and all those who rely on a \nstrong economy will make their support of Senator Ashcroft known to \ntheir Senators.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my voice to those \nof my colleagues in support of the nomination of Senator John Ashcroft \nfor the position of Attorney General.\n  I have known John Ashcroft for more than a decade. I first met him \nwhen I was mayor of Cleveland and he was Governor of Missouri, but I \nreally got to know him through our service together in the National \nGovernors' Association.\n  John was the chairman of the National Governors' Association, and I \nhad just joined the organization after being elected governor. My wife, \nJanet, and I were able to get to know John and his wife Janet on a \npersonal basis.\n  I could see almost immediately that John was a man who was dedicated \nto making a difference, and he wanted me to help in setting the NGA's \neducation agenda.\n  John appointed me to chair the NGA Bipartisan Taskforce on School \nReadiness. I will always be grateful for that appointment, because I \nquickly realized that the task force could serve as a forum in which to \n``air out'' new ideas on how best to help our kids learn. From that \ntask force, we were able to develop a Whole School Initiative.\n  I admired the leadership role John took at NGA, and our work together \nhelped me to get to know John Ashcroft.\n  Of course, nothing will help you get to know someone better than \ngoing fishing with them, and John and I have spent hours together \nfishing. I have spent enough time with him to get to know what is in \nhis heart, and I can honestly say that he is one of the most honorable \nmen I have ever met. He is, in every sense of the word, a gentleman.\n  We in the Senate have been given a remarkable obligation by our \nFounding Fathers to provide the President of the United States our \n``advice and consent'' on certain Presidential nominees for Cabinet \noffices and other positions of governmental importance.\n  It is a duty that all of us in this Chamber take seriously.\n  Historically, members of the United States Senate have given the \nPresident--Republican or Democrat--the benefit of the doubt when it \ncomes to the confirmation of a Cabinet official.\n  On the rare occasion when a nominee fails, it is because the \nnominee's qualifications are lacking, or because a flaw in his or her \ncharacter exempts them from successfully carrying out the duties of the \noffice in which they would serve.\n  However, in the case of President Bush's Attorney General nominee, \nJohn Ashcroft, there has been a steady stream of detractors who are \ntrying to cast doubt on the character of John Ashcroft or misconstrue \nhis record of accomplishments. I would like to say that those of us in \nthis body who have worked with John Ashcroft, know the type of man he \ntruly is.\n  In my personal relationship with John, and in my evaluation of his \nability to serve as Attorney General, I have seen only an individual \nwith impeccable qualifications and unquestionable character.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that John Ashcroft possesses the \nintegrity and the experience necessary to carry out the duties of \nAttorney General. We all know his biography by now--elected for two \nterms to serve as the Attorney General for the state of Missouri and \nelected for two terms to serve as Governor of Missouri, and then \nelected to serve as United States Senator from Missouri.\n  It is this record of public service that has made John Ashcroft the \nmost qualified individual ever to be nominated to be Attorney General. \nJust look at some of our recent Attorneys General--Janet Reno, a \nprosecutor;\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\nDick Thornburgh, a governor; Ed Meese, a district attorney.\n  Of the 67 persons who have served in the office of Attorney General \nin the history of our nation, only one--John Ashcroft--has served as \nstate attorney general of his state, and U.S. Senator--and only a \nhandful have held two of these three offices.\n  I might add that in each of the responsible positions he has held, he \nhas served the people of Missouri with distinction.\n  What is interesting, though, is how the special interest groups have \n``taken the gloves off'' in their opposition to John. They are working \novertime to demonize Senator Ashcroft, trying to paint him as unfit to \nhold public office.\n  But, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that the citizens of \nMissouri elected John Ashcroft 5 times to statewide office.\n  The John Ashcroft that the interest groups are characterizing is not \nthe John Ashcroft we all know, and in my view, he has been the victim \nof a vicious character assassination, the likes of which I have not \nseen in years.\n  This is just wrong.\n  This visceral opposition is being orchestrated by groups that I have \nto believe are making tons of money in their fundraising efforts by \nusing John Ashcroft as a lighting rod.\n  For example, some have raised the accusation that he is a racist \nbecause of his opposition to Ronnie White's nomination.\n  John Ashcroft did speak against Ronnie White in a convincing way. \nJohn did have some influence over my decision to vote against Ronnie \nWhite, but I had no idea he was an African American. That was never \neven an issue in our discussions over the nomination of Ronnie White, \nand I want everyone to understand that.\n  Anyone who knows my record knows that I do not tolerate racism or \ninsensitivity to others, and I have no patience for individuals who \nespouse such views.\n  In fact, in the more than ten years I have known John Ashcroft, I \nhave never heard a word uttered from him that indicated any \ninsensitivity to any minority groups. To the contrary, his \naccomplishments reflect a real level of support for the African \nAmerican community.\n  John Ashcroft signed Missouri's first hate crimes statute into law. \nHe signed into law the bill establishing a Martin Luther King, Jr., \nholiday in Missouri. He appointed the first African-American woman to \nthe Missouri Court of Appeals.\n  He led the fight to save Lincoln University, founded by African-\nAmerican Civil War veterans--something that he and I have in common, \ngiven my work to save Central State University, a historically black \nuniversity in Ohio. John also established an award in the name of \nrenowned scientist, George Washington Carver.\n  He also has been a leader in the opposition to racial profiling, \nconvening the only Senate hearing on the subject to date. He voted to \nconfirm 26 of 27 African American judicial appointees nominated by \nPresident Clinton that came to the Senate floor.\n  John Ashcroft has worked with African Americans. He has appointed \nAfrican Americans when he was Governor. He has worked on issues of \nimportance to African Americans. That's why I cannot understand all \nthis talk that John Ashcroft is somehow a racist.\n  Does the Senate honestly think that the good people of Missouri would \nelect a racist? Do we honestly think John Ashcroft could have possibly \nfooled the people of the ``Show-Me State'' 5 separate times?\n  John Ashcroft looks at his fellow human beings as in the image and \nlikeness of God. Yes, he is a Christian, and he believes in the Two \nGreat Commandments--love of God, and love of fellow man--and he follows \nthe Golden Rule, but those traits are not--and should never be--\ndisqualifying traits.\n  I have no question about what is in this man's heart, and I know that \nhe will be impeccably impartial in carrying out his responsibilities. \nIn fact, John Ashcroft will be scrupulous in carrying out the \nresponsibilities of his office.\n  Even with John's integrity, character and good sense, probably the \nloudest complaints about him seem to be from those individuals who \nbelieve that John will ignore or even seek to overturn laws he \npersonally does not like. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Throughout his many years of public service, John Ashcroft has been a \nsworn defender of the laws of the people--all of the people--and his \nrecord shows that he has not allowed his personal views to interfere in \nthe pursuit of his duties.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft strictly enforced laws \nthat differed from his own views, including such items as: firearms--he \ndetermined, under Missouri law, that prosecuting attorneys could not \ncarry concealed weapons; abortion--he determined, under the law, that \nhospital records on the number of abortions performed must remain \nconfidential, and, he determined, under the law, that a death \ncertificate was not legally required for fetuses under 20 weeks; and \nchurch and state--he determined, under Missouri law, that public funds \nwere not available for private and religious schools even though \nfederal grants permitted it, and he determined, under the law, that \nreligious materials could not be distributed in public schools.\n  I believe we all have faced laws or responsibilities that we must \ncarry out that we may not necessarily agree with. I did so when I was \nGovernor because I took an oath to uphold the law. So did John \nAshcroft.\n  For those who are not inclined to support the nomination of John \nAshcroft, I need only refer to his testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Senator Ashcroft gave his assurance--his word--\nthat as Attorney General he will uphold the law, including laws he may \npersonally disagree with.\n  The fact that he has his faith is one of the reasons why John \nAshcroft has upheld the law and why he will uphold the law--because he \nhas character, because he has principles, because he has a foundation, \nbecause he has roots and because he has grounding.\n  I think in our assessment of John, all we need to do is look at our \ncolleague, Senator Joseph Lieberman. Part of the reason why Senator \nLieberman is where he is in life is due to his profound faith. He \nabides by his faith and it impacts on decisions he makes in the Senate \nand in his life.\n  There are many other members of this chamber who I believe are \nexactly the same; with their faith at the base of who they are, whether \nthey are Jewish, Protestant, Catholic or whatever their religion.\n  It is that faith that builds the character and builds the individual. \nIt is what has made John Ashcroft.\n  And I urge all of my colleagues to read an article written by one of \nSenator Ashcroft's former staff members, Tevi Troy, for the New \nRepublic online. Mr. Troy, who is an Orthodox Jew, explains how faith \nhas influenced John Ashcroft's deep respect for other religions, and \nhow faith has shaped John Ashcroft to be the man he is today.\n  In my family--and I would imagine in most families as well--when \nwe're getting to know someone, we subconsciously subject them to what I \ncall the ``kitchen test.'' Basically, the kitchen test is: is this \nperson someone I would feel comfortable enough to bring to my home, to \nsit at my dinner table, with my family?\n  John Ashcroft is someone I would be honored to have in my home, at my \ndinner table, with my family. He is a good solid man.\n  Based on his record, John Ashcroft is fit in every way to be the \nAttorney General. He is a man of integrity, and I am completely \nconfident that not only will he be fair and impartial in the \nadministration of justice, but that he will insist that every employee \nat the Department of Justice do the same. He sets high standards for \npeople.\n  John Ashcroft's experience is more than enough to qualify him for the \nrole as the nation's ``top cop,'' but the added bonus to his \nachievements is the fact that he is a man of character, and a man who \nbelieves that the law is the law, and not something with which to \nmanipulate policy.\n  Though some of my colleagues may not agree with his personal views, I \nurge them to look beyond their personal prejudices and look at John's \nrecord, his character, his integrity and his experience and give \nPresident Bush the man he wants to serve as Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  I will vote in favor of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be United \nStates\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\nAttorney General, and I sincerely urge my colleagues to give him their \nfull support as well.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on \nthe nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be the United States \nAttorney General.\n  One of the first issues I faced as a new Senator in 1989 was the \ncontroversial nomination of former Senator John Tower to be Secretary \nof Defense. As this was the first time I was faced with the Senate's \nconstitutional ``advise and consent'' role, it was incumbent upon me to \nlearn more about this important role through study and through \nconversations with my fellow Senators. It was also important to devise \na standard to evaluate Presidential nominations so as to treat nominees \nof both Republican and Democratic Presidents with consistency and \nfairness.\n  I came to the conclusion that my general policy should be to support \nnominations made by a President, provided that the individual is \nappropriately qualified and capable of performing the duties of the \nposition. A President is entitled to a Cabinet of his or her own \nchoosing unless a nominee is proven unethical or unqualified. I would \nnot oppose a nominee just because I disagree with them on a policy \nmatter.\n  For judicial branch nominations, however, I apply a different \nstandard. I have made this distinction between executive and judicial \nnominees throughout my Senate career. For example, during the \nconsideration of Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court in \n1991, I argued that:\n\n       By no means does a president, even one of my own party, \n     have the right to pick virtually anyone he wants who meets \n     minimal qualifications with respect to character, legal \n     ability and judicial temperament. This is not a pass-fail \n     test. In my mind, such a process is entirely proper for \n     appointees to the executive branch of government. The \n     president should be given wide latitude in selecting his \n     Cabinet secretaries and key agency personnel. But under the \n     Constitution, such deference is inappropriate in the \n     confirmation of Supreme Court justices.\n\n  I used this policy in evaluating Presidential nominations throughout \nthe Bush Presidency and the subsequent Clinton Presidency, and will \ncontinue to use this standard to evaluate the nominations put forth by \nour current President. In order to determine a nominee's qualifications \nand capabilities, I review the statements of nominees, follow the \nhearings conducted on a nominee, and listen to the opinions expressed \nby my colleagues. I have done all of these in the case of this \nnomination and I am here today to express my support for the \nconfirmation of John Ashcroft to be the next United States Attorney \nGeneral.\n  A review of Senator Ashcroft's record shows that he is qualified to \nserve in the position of United States Attorney General. He has a long \nand distinguished tenure in public service, serving as Missouri's \nAttorney General, Governor and Senator. During his terms as Governor, \nJohn Ashcroft served as Chairman of the Republican Governors' \nAssociation and as Chairman of the National Governors' Association. In \naddition, during his tenure in the Senate he served on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and chaired the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution.\n  Senator Ashcroft is also capable of performing the duties of United \nStates Attorney General as he is a fair and judicious individual. Some \nhave raised questions concerning his ability to enforce laws he has \nopposed in the past, but during a meeting I had with him he assured me \nthat as Attorney General he would work to uphold the laws of this \nnation, including those with which he disagrees. I believe that these \nqualities prove Senator Ashcroft to be capable of performing the duties \nof Attorney General and will serve him well in this role.\n  As anyone can tell from our records, Senator Ashcroft and I have very \ndifferent opinions on many important issues, including abortion, civil \nand gay rights, and environmental protection. I will continue in my \nrole as a Senator from Vermont to support legislation upholding the Roe \nv. Wade decision legalizing abortion, protecting access to clinics that \nperform abortion services, combating employment discrimination and hate \ncrimes based on sexual orientation, and protecting our environment. I \nwill also closely follow the decisions Senator Ashcroft makes as \nAttorney General and speak out when I feel those decisions are wrong. \nHowever, while we may have different opinions on many issues, in my \nmind that alone is not enough to disqualify a nominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S910-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE LOCKERBIE VERDICT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today's unanimous verdict by a Scottish \ncourt convicting a Libyan intelligence agent of murder in the 1988 \nbombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie concludes an exhaustive \nterrorism trial that clearly exposed Libyan state sponsorship of the \nmass murder of 270 individuals, including 189 Americans. A second \nLibyan charged with the same offense was acquitted. Although no verdict \ncan compensate the victims' loved ones for their loss, the life \nsentence handed down to Libyan intelligence agent Abdel Basset Ali al-\nMegrahi represents a first step for the families, the prosecution, and \nthe Western nations that supported bringing the Libyans to justice.\n  Nonetheless, the trial's conclusion must not obscure the task ahead: \nholding Libya accountable for full compliance with the U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions governing the sanctions regime against that \ncountry. These resolutions mandate that, before sanctions can be \nlifted, Libya must (1) Cease all forms of terrorism; (2) Disclose all \ninformation about the Lockerbie bombing; (3) Accept responsibility for \nthe actions of Libyan officials; (4) Pay appropriate compensation to \nthe victims' families; and (5) Cooperate with the French investigation \ninto the 1989 bombing of UTA Flight 772 over Niger.\n  Full Libyan compliance with the U.N. resolutions must be the standard \nfor terminating the sanctions, which are believed by many experts to be \nresponsible for the significant decline in Libya's sponsorship of \nterrorism overseas.\n  Of perhaps more immediate importance to the United States is the \nquestion of the separate U.S. sanctions currently in place against \nLibya, primarily as a consequence of its sponsorship of state \nterrorism. True, Libya did hand over the Lockerbie defendants in 1999 \nand expel the Abu Nidal terrorist organization from its territory in \n1998. The Libyan government has also seemingly reduced its contacts \nwith radical Palestinian organizations espousing violence against \nIsrael. In 1999, after the conviction in absentia of six Libyans by a \nFrench court for the UTA 772 bombing, Libya compensated the families of \nthe 171 victims. However, it has not turned over the convicted \nindividuals for trial or acknowledged responsibility.\n  In addition to the issue of terrorism, the United States must \nconsider Libya's covert and sometimes armed intervention in the affairs \nof other African nations, including Chad, Sudan, and Sierra Leone, as \nwell as Libya's continuing development of weapons of mass destruction. \nLibya used chemical weapons acquired from Iran against Chad in 1986 and \nhas constructed chemical weapons facilities at Rabta and Tarhunah. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, Libya tried to buy \nnuclear weapons or components from China in 1975, India in 1978, \nPakistan in 1980, the Soviet Union in 1981, Argentina in 1983, Brazil \nin 1984, and Belgium in 1985. The United Kingdom accused Libya of \nsmuggling Chinese Scud missiles through Gatwick Airport in 2000. The \nPentagon believes China has provided missile technology training to \nLibyan workers.\n  While I applaud the Lockerbie verdict, I believe any consequent \nAmerican policy changes toward Libya must take into account its \npossession of chemical and potentially nuclear weapons, its compliance \nwith existing U.N Security Council mandates on the Lockerbie and UTA \nbombings, and any residual support for state terrorism. If Libya truly \nwishes to enter the ranks of law-abiding nations, with the economic and \ndiplomatic benefits such status affords, it must satisfy the \ninternational community's concerns on these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S910-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S910-S911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WARREN RUDMAN\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

The \nmedal recognizes Senator Rudman for co- authoring the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings deficit reduction law that requires automatic spending cuts if \nannual deficit targets are missed.\n  Senator Rudman served in the United States Army as a combat platoon \nleader and company commander during the Korean conflict. After \ngraduating from Boston College Law school, he returned to New Hampshire \nto practice law and was later appointed Attorney General of the State.\n  Senator Rudman serves as Chairman of the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board and was also appointed to serve as Vice \nChairman of the Commission on Roles and Capabilities of the United \nStates Intelligence Community.\n  During his distinguished twelve years in the Senate, Senator Rudman \nestablished a record of independence.

Mr. President, on New Year's Day, the Governor of Michigan \nsigned into law a bill to take discretion away from local gun boards in \nissuing concealed gun licenses. The new law, scheduled to take effect \non July 1st of this year, would increase the number of concealed \nhandgun licenses in our state by 200,000 to 300,000--a ten-fold \nincrease.\n  The concealed weapons law is being challenged by a coalition of law \nenforcement and community groups across our state called the People Who \nCare About Kids. This coalition is working to obtain 151,000 signatures \nneeded to suspend the implementation of the law and put the issue \nbefore voters in 2002.\n  Other groups in our state are also working along side the coalition \nto keep our streets and our communities safe. One such group is the \nDetroit-based Save Our Sons And Daughters, SOSAD. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print an article in the Record from the Detroit News about \nSOSAD to show what they are doing to fight the concealed weapons bill \nand to keep our children safe from gun violence.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Detroit News, Jan. 30, 2001]\n\n  New State Gun Law Alarms SOSAD Group Redoubles Efforts to Safeguard \n                                Children\n\n                         (By Rhonda Bates-Rudd)\n\n       Detroit--After 14 years of helping hundreds of grieving \n     families, who've lost a loved one as a result of homicide, \n     suicide, disease and natural death, Clementine Barfield, \n     founder and president of the nonprofit, Detroit-based Save \n     Our Sons and Daughters, says the organization is facing a new \n     challenge.\n       Michigan's latest concealed gun legislation, which limits \n     the power of county gun boards to deny gun permits, has moved \n     the group to turn up the heat in their efforts to promote \n     peace.\n       Homicide is among the leading causes of death for African-\n     American youths, recent data compiled by the Michigan \n     Department of Community Health said.\n       ``Homicide is real and the effects on children in our \n     community is immeasurable,'' Barfield said. ``People should \n     not believe that they are immune to this type of tragedy. \n     Many children already have a false confidence in weapons, as \n     evidenced by reports of their use of guns and violence in the \n     news. If ever there was a right time to promote peace in our \n     community, the time is now.''\n       In March, the group's mothers will reveal their new image, \n     a white kerchief and arm band, which is both a symbol of \n     their grief and desire for peace.\n       The nonprofit group, which also honors other groups that \n     help the grieving after deadly tragedies, is seeking \n     corporate and community sponsorship to develop programs and \n     activities for youth that will promote nonviolence. The \n     organization also is in need of volunteers willing to make a \n     long-term service commitment to perform an array of \n     administrative tasks, as well as spread the message of peace \n     to youth who, often, enlist the use of violence and handguns \n     to settle disputes.\n\n\n                          Usher in more death\n\n       Save Our Sons and Daughters member Cheryl Ross, her husband \n     and their four children moved to the suburbs after her son, \n     DeWunn Carter, 23, was shot to death in 1977 at a Coney \n     Island Restaurant on Chicago near Evergreen, just a few steps \n     from the front door of their former home.\n       ``I believe this new law will make it easier for more \n     people to get their hands on guns and keep them concealed, \n     which will make it easier for more youth to get their hands \n     on weapons,'' Ross said. ``I think this new law is just a \n     platform to usher in more death.''\n       Ross, who lives in Redford Township, has a better look than \n     most at the toll homicide takes. She is a SOSAD liaison \n     assigned to the Detroit Police Department Homicide Unit, \n     along with Linda Barfield and Vera Rucker.\n       Working in the homicide division, contacting victim's \n     families and helping them has been therapeutic, Ross said.\n       Liaisons almost daily receive a list of homicides they use \n     to create a file that includes basic information about the \n     family, such as phone number, address and the number of \n     family members. Serving as go-betweens, they contact the \n     families and offer the group's counseling and support group \n     services. They also provide families with information about \n     the case and how the process works.\n       ``If they are grieving and just need someone to talk to, we \n     are here for that, too, because as many of the SOSAD staffers \n     are mothers who've lost children, we understand what they are \n     going through,'' Ross said.\n       Victim liaison Rucker, who has been with SOSAD since its \n     inception, said ``No one can understand what you're going \n     through--the grief, anger, anguish and frustration--unless \n     they've lost a child to homicide.''\n       Her daughter, Melody ``Poochie'' Rucker, 14, was shot and \n     killed on Detroit's west side by random gunfire at a back-to-\n     school party for Benedictine High School students in 1986.\n       Police Inspector William Rice, commanding officer for the \n     Detroit police homicide unit, has been a law enforcer for 31 \n     years. He said, without a doubt, the group's 3-year-old \n     victim liaison office at the First precinct has been a new \n     tool to help in the aftermath of homicide.\n       ``After a homicide, the family is usually confronted by a \n     lot of social and economic issues, such as how and why the \n     crime was committed, and then they almost immediately have to \n     deal with funeral planning and burial expenses,'' Rice said. \n     ``SOSAD members avail themselves to assist families with \n     whatever it is they need.''\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\n       ``The volunteers can bring the compassion element that \n     police officers cannot offer because their (the police) job \n     is to solve the crime by asking a lot of questions that may \n     make family members uncomfortable and, many times, the clues \n     to solving a crime may lead us back to the family,'' Rice \n     said.\n       Barfield, a former City of Detroit accounting department \n     employee, said she was always troubled by reports of the \n     growing number of Detroit youth who were shot and, often, \n     fatally wounded by handguns.\n       The 1986 death of her son, Derick, 16, and that of many \n     other Detroit youth moved Barfield to create the organization \n     which has been featured in newspapers and magazines across \n     the country, including Essence, Ebony and People magazines.\n\n\n                            hundreds helped\n\n       In the last 14 years, the group has helped hundreds of \n     families through the grieving process with counseling and \n     support groups that meet weekly.\n       There also is a 24-hour crisis hotline in which volunteers \n     provide immediate response to families in need.\n       Since 1988, the group has held an annual public memorial \n     service that is open to anyone wanting to light a candle in \n     memory of someone killed. This year's service will be held \n     from 4-6 p.m. March 17 at the Cobo Center.\n       The group also hosts an annual appreciation breakfast, \n     usually during National Crime Victim Rights week, the last \n     week in April, to give accolades and the Angel of Mercy Award \n     to emergency room medical staff, homicide investigators, \n     funeral directors and morgue personnel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S912-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF GALE NORTON\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nGale Norton as this country's next Interior Secretary.\n  While I have some disagreements with some of Ms. Norton's positions, \nI believe that she represented herself well in the nomination hearings \nthat we held in the Energy Committee.\n  I indicated during those hearings that if I felt she were another \nJames Watt I could never vote for her ``in a million years.'' I say \nthat because, two decades ago, James Watt came to town as a newly \nappointed Interior Secretary and very quickly began to take both \npositions and actions that were, in my opinion, destructive to the \ninterests that I value with respect to the stewardship of public lands \nin our country. Because Gale Norton was a protege of James Watt, and \nbecause she has spoken and written extensively on a range of issues, we \nquestioned her very closely during her confirmation hearing on a wide \nrange of important issues that will confront the new Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  Her responses to some tough inquiries during the hearings \ndemonstrated to me that she is qualified to be Interior Secretary and \nthat the views she holds, while in some cases controversial, are well \nwithin the norm of the political discussions we're having in Washington \nabout a wide range of these issues.\n  I want Gale Norton to do an excellent job as Interior Secretary and \npledge my cooperation to help make that happen. At the same time, I \nwant her to know that those of us on the Energy Committee take very \nseriously the representations she made during the confirmation hearings \non a wide range of matters. She will find those of us on the Committee \nwho have now voted for her confirmation to be helpful in her job of \nmeeting the stewardship responsibilities of the Secretary of the \nInterior. But she should understand that she will find us to be severe \ncritics if the representations she made to us during the Committee \nhearings turn out to be not in keeping with the way she conducts \nherself as Interior Secretary.\n  I will be particularly interested in working with Ms. Norton on \nseveral issues important to North Dakota and the Nation. For example, I \nwill work to ensure that Ms. Norton provides protection for our \nNational Parks, public lands and environmentally-sensitive areas.\n  Native Americans are particularly important to me. During the \nhearing, Ms. Norton said she respects tribal sovereignty. She should \nadopt a cooperative approach to include the relevant tribal \nstakeholders in policy and regulatory decision making. She also \ncommitted to work with us to make progress in meeting the critical \nfunding needs for tribal schools and colleges.\n  I will count on Ms. Norton to adopt a sound scientific basis for her \npolicy decisions on actions pertaining to endangered species, the \nglobal climate, energy issues and more.\n  Again, I wish her well and pledge my cooperation as she begins her \nduties following her confirmation today. She clearly has the skill and \ncapability to do well as Interior Secretary if she pursues a balanced \nset of policies that conform to the positions she took when she \nappeared before our Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S912-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TERRY BRAGG\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a brave and \nhard-working Ohioan by the name of Terry Bragg. Terry has been a life-\nlong resident of McConnelsville, where he has spent the last 39 years \nas a member of the Malta-McConnelsville Fire Department. During nearly \n40 years of tireless dedication to his community, Terry has served as a \nfirefighter, Assistant Fire Chief, and for the last 32 years, as the \ndepartment's Fire Chief.\n  I recognize Terry today for his commitment to protecting his \ncommunity from devastating fires. People like Terry Bragg, who risk \ntheir lives daily on our behalf, command great respect and deserve our \ndeep and sincere thanks.\n  I cannot overstate just how important Terry's job of fire fighting \nand prevention education is to our families and communities. Overall, \nfire is responsible for killing more Americans than all natural \ndisasters combined. Every 18 seconds, a fire department responds to a \nfire somewhere in the United States. In 1998, there were 4,035 civilian \nfire deaths--that's one death every 130 minutes. And sadly, many of \nthose who die each year in fires are children.\n  To help support Terry and every firefighter in Ohio and across \nAmerica as they work to protect our families and children, I sponsored \nthe Firefighter Investment Act, which provides a vital federal \ninvestment to the courageous men and women who make up our local fire \ndepartments. I am please do report that we successfully included my \nbill as a provision in the recently-passed Fiscal Year 2001 Department \nof Defense Appropriations bill. The funding that will be made available \nas a result will help local fire departments and firefighters, just \nlike Terry Bragg and the Malta-McConnelsville Fire Department, to \ncontinue carrying out their life-saving missions.\n  Over the years, Terry Bragg has received many, many awards and \nspecial recognitions. He has received three medals for bravery, and in \n1997, the Ohio Department of the Veterans of Foreign Wars named him \n``Ohio Firefighter of the Year.'' He received the Bob and Delores Hope \n``Good Samaritan Award,'' the ``M Firefighter of the Year Award,'' \nand the Ohio Masonic Grand Master's ``Community Service Award.''\n  Not only is Terry a dedicated Fire Chief, he is a strong community \nleader; volunteer; businessman; and loving husband, father, and \ngrandfather. Indeed, Terry Bragg is a role model for whom we all can be \nproud.\n  I thank him for his past, present, and future service to his \ncommunity, to Ohio, and to our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S912-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S912-S913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTRIBUTE TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITIES INVOLVED IN THE \n                    APPREHENSION OF THE TEXAS SEVEN\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes \nto recognize the efforts of everyone involved in the capture of the \nTexas fugitives that ended one of the largest manhunts this national \nhas ever seen. As you know, the last two of the seven Texas inmates \nthat escaped from a maximum security prison in Kenedy, Texas on \nDecember 13th surrendered on January 24th in Colorado Springs, \nColorado. This can be attributed to the exemplary work done by the \nlocal and federal law enforcement agencies involved as well as the \ncommunities of Woodland Park and Colorado Springs. This was a \ncooperative effort that saw the pooling of all the resources available \nand resulted in a peaceful conclusion.\n  There cannot be enough said about the work that was done by the law \nenforcement agencies involved. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, The \nColorado Springs office of the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms, the U.S. \nMarshals\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\noffice, the Texas authorities, the Teller County Sheriffs office, the \nEl Paso County Sheriffs office, the Colorado Springs Police Department, \nthe Woodland Park Police Department and the Colorado State Patrol did a \ntremendous job of working together to apprehend the seven fugitives.\n  The effort and support of the residents of Woodland Park and Colorado \nSprings can't be overlooked. We need to commend people like Wade Holder \nand Eric Singer. Mr. Holder resides in Woodland Park and is the owner \nof the RV park where the fugitives were hiding out. He called in a tip \nto the local authorities after seeing pictures of the fugitives on the \nAmerica's Most Wanted Web Site. KKTV's Colorado Springs news anchor \nEric Singer helped negotiators by conducting a telephone interview with \nthe last two fugitives in order to assure a peaceful surrender. These \nare just a couple of examples of how the two communities contributed to \nthe successful manhunt.\n  In all of this we should not forget that two law enforcement agents \nlost their lives in this investigation. Irving, Texas Officer Aubrey \nHawkins and Colorado State Trooper Jason Manspeaker both died in the \nline of duty. Officer Hawkins was brutally shot 11 times and killed by \none of the fugitives while responding to a robbery of a sporting goods \nstore in Irving Texas on December 24th. Colorado State Trooper Jason \nManspeaker was killed when he crashed his Jeep Cherokee Squad car into \na heavy equipment trailer on U.S. Highway 6 in Colorado. The crash \noccurred while chasing a vehicle suspected of harboring the last two \nfugitives on January 23rd. Both Officer Hawkins and State Trooper \nManspeaker paid the ultimate price for our freedom. My wife Joan and I \noffer all our compassion, our sympathy and our prayers to the families \nof both victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S913-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LORETTA SYMMS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nexpress my regret that Loretta Symms will soon retire as Deputy \nSergeant at Arms. I would also like to congratulate her on a long and \ndistinguished career.\n  During her 22 years of service on Capitol Hill, Loretta gained the \nrespect of Senators and Congressman from both sides of the aisle. Her \ncreativity and dedication to improving the inner-workings of the Senate \nhave made her an invaluable asset to the institution and she will be \ndearly missed by all.\n  Loretta started her career on Capitol Hill in 1978 working for then-\nCongressman Steve Symms as executive assistant and office manager. In \n1981, after Congressman Symms was elected to the Senate, Loretta became \nhis executive secretary and office manager. In 1987, Senator Dole \nappointed Loretta as the Republican representative to the Sergeant at \nArms.\n  As Director of the Capitol Facilities Department, she reinvented the \nFacilities Department providing career ladders, formal position \ndescriptions, instituted reading programs, basic computer classes for \nemployees, and training programs. Working closely with the Secretary of \nthe Senate's office, Loretta has been actively involved in the \noversight and management of the Senate Page Program. For example, \nLoretta participated in the renovation and opening of Webster Hall, the \nSenate Page dormitory, and the Senate Page School.\n  During her tenure as Deputy Sergeant at Arms, Loretta worked closely \nwith the Assistant Secretary of the Senate to create the Joint Office \nof Education and Training which provides a wide variety of professional \nseminars and training for the staff of Senate Offices and Committees. \nAs every Senator can attest, this office has become an invaluable \nresource. In 1996, Senator Lott named Loretta Deputy Sergeant at Arms, \nthe post in which she still serves. As Deputy, Loretta has managed the \nday to day operations of more than 770 employees.\n  Loretta is married to former Senator Steve Symms. They have 7 \nchildren and 10 grandchildren. Her retirement will allow her to fulfill \nher dreams of traveling and spending more time with her grandchildren. \nLoretta's impact on the institution of the Senate is greatly \nappreciated and will be remembered for a long time to come. But most \nimpatiently to this Senator is the many acts of kindness in the most \nprofessional manner that Loretta was extended to me. For her many acts \nI will always be grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S913-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BEN AUGELLO\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, when I first came back to \nWashington, DC as a Senator-elect in December of 1996 for freshman \norientation, one of the first people I met was a young lady who I was \ntold I had to get to know if I was to be able to successfully get \naround the august halls of the Senate. She was then the Director of the \nCongressional Special Services Office that provided assistance to \nCapitol visitors and staff with disabilities. What I did not know at \nthe time, but soon learned, was that she had been working for years to \nhelp move both Houses of Congress toward compliance with the landmark \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. What I also didn't know at first, but \nlearned almost immediately was that this young lady, Deborah Kerrigan \nJans--known to all as Debbie--once worked for that great Senator Hubert \nHumphrey and that in addition to Minnesota ties she shared with Senator \nHumphrey a great fondness for the spoken word! In spite of that, or \nperhaps because of it, I soon found that Debbie had made herself \nindispensable to the conduct of my activities as a United States \nSenator and I quickly signed her on to my staff to coordinate my \nscheduling and advance work in the Senate. Part of her role was \ndescribed very well in an August 1999 article in Esquire magazine:\n\n       He (Cleland) has one staffer, Deborah Jans, who advances \n     his schedule to make sure he can get there. She is a dervish, \n     racing in and out of men's rooms to make sure the doors on \n     the stalls open out and not in, looking everywhere for ramps \n     and elevators, measuring doorways for the chair. . . . So she \n     goes, and she measures, and she checks--a whirlwind advancing \n     a kind of rolling thunder.\n\n  Today, Debbie is retiring after 25 years of service to the Senate and \nto Congress. Prior to her excellent work for me, Debbie served as \nDirector of the Congressional Special Services Office, Manager of the \nSenate Special Services Office, and Tour Guide with the U.S. Capitol \nGuide Service. These positions allowed her to share her love of the \nCapitol with visitors, providing a political, historical and \narchitectural orientation to our magnificent institution. As I \npreviously mentioned, in the latter part of this service, her role was \nextended to providing support and services to Capitol visitors and \nstaff with disabilities. The innovative programs that she managed \nincluded special tours for individuals with disabilities, sign language \ninterpreting, wheelchair loans, development of Braille materials, as \nwell as classes and seminars for Congressional staff on disability \nissues.\n  Debbie and her husband Ron, who is a wonderful fellow himself and has \nhad the opportunity to develop tremendous listening skills during his \nyears with\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\nDebbie, are preparing to return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes. \nWashington's loss is Minnesota's gain. We shall miss Debbie here on \nCapitol Hill. The place will never be the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S914-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nthe provisions of 22 U.S.C. 1928a, the Speaker appoints the following \nMembers of the House of Representatives to the United States Group of \nthe North Atlantic Assembly: Mr. Bereuter, Mr. Regula, Mrs. Roukema, \nMr. Hefley, Mr. Gillmor, Mr. Goss, Mr. Ehlers, and Mr. McInnis.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 93.

A bill to provide tax incentives for the construction of \nseagoing cruise ships in United States shipyards, and to facilitate the \ndevelopment of a United States-flag, United States-built cruise \nindustry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation designed to \npromote growth in the domestic cruise ship industry and at the same \ntime enable U.S. shipyards to compete for cruise ship orders. The \nlegislation would provide tax incentives for U.S. cruise ship \nconstruction and operation.\n  Current law prohibits non-U.S. vessels from carrying passengers \nbetween U.S. ports. As such, today's domestic cruise market is very \nlimited. The cruise industry consists predominantly of foreign vessels \nwhich must sail to and from foreign ports. The vast majority of cruise \npassengers are Americans, but most of the revenues now go to foreign \ndestinations. That is because the high cost of building and operating \nU.S.-flag cruise ships and competition from modern, foreign-flag cruise \nships have deterred growth in the domestic cruise ship trade.\n  By some estimates, a single port call by a cruise vessel generates \nbetween $300,000 and $500,000 in economic benefits. This is a very \nlucrative market, and I would like to see U.S. companies and American \nworkers benefit from this untapped potential. However, domestic ship \nbuilders and cruise operations face a very difficult, up-hill battle \nagainst unfair competition from foreign cruise lines and foreign \nshipyards. Foreign cruise lines, for example, pay no corporate income \ntax. Nor are they held to the same demanding ship construction and \noperating standards imposed on U.S.-flag vessel operators. Foreign \ncruise lines are also free from the need to comply with many U.S. labor \nand environmental protection laws, and U.S. health, safety, and \nsanitation laws do not apply to the foreign ships.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to level the \nplaying field between the U.S. cruise industry and the international \ncruise industry. For example, it provides that a shipyard will pay \ntaxes on the construction or overhaul of a cruise ship of 20,000 gross \ntons or greater only after the delivery of the ship.\n  Under my bill, a U.S. company operating a cruise ship of 20,000 grt \nand greater may depreciate that vessel over a five-year period rather \nthan the current 10-year depreciation period. The bill would also \nrepeal the $2,500 business tax deduction limit for a convention on a \ncruise ship to provide a tax deduction limit equal to that provided to \nconventions held at shore-side hotels. The measure would authorize a 20 \npercent tax credit for fuel operating costs associated with \nenvironmentally clean gas turbine engines manufactured in the U.S., and \nalso allows use of investment of Capital Construction Funds to include \nnot only the non-contiguous trades, but also the domestic point-to-\npoint trades and ``cruises to nowhere''.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe that this legislation would help \njumpstart the domestic cruise trade, benefit U.S. workers and \ncompanies, and promote economic growth in our ports. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to join me in a strong show of support for this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 223. A bill to terminate the effectiveness of certain drinking \nwater regulations; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, ``Just as houses are made of stones, so \nis science made of facts; but a pile of stones is not a house and a \ncollection of facts is not necessarily science.''\n  For the past 8 years I have questioned numerous collections of facts \nput out by the Environmental Protection Agency in the name of science \nand I have found sound science has been left out of the regulation \nequation too often. A prime example is the new arsenic standards in \ndrinking water proposed last week. This new standard dramatically \nreduces the arsenic level allowable in drinking water from 50 parts per \nbillion (ppb) to 10 ppb, a reduction of 80 percent.\n  I believe it is essential to protect and ensure the safety of our \nnation's water supply and to uphold the principles and goals set forth \nin the Safe Drinking Water Act, but these standards were not based on \nsound science and there is no proof that they will increase health \nbenefits. They were put into effect because it was the politically \nexpedient thing to do.\n  That is why at this time I am introducing this bill which would \nterminate the effectiveness of these new drinking water standards.\n  The amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act required the standards \nfor arsenic in drinking water be changed by January 1st of this year. \nBecause the proposed rule was issued late, I cosponsored an amendment \nto the VA HUD appropriations bill giving EPA a 6-month extension. This \namendment was later signed into law, but was ignored by the agency.\n  There was much controversy and debate surrounding the appropriate \nlevel for the new standard. The EPA's Science Advisory Board expressed \nunanimous support for reducing the current standard, but varied \nconsiderably on the appropriate level. Both the EPA and the National \nAcademy of Sciences National Research Council acknowledged more health \nstudies were needed to evaluate what potential health benefits, if any, \nwould likely result from this lower standard.\n  Arsenic is naturally occurring in my home state. In fact, New Mexico \nhas some of the highest levels of arsenic in the nation, yet has a \nlower than average incidence of the diseases associated with arsenic. I \nhave not seen any reasonable data in support of increased health \nbenefits from these lower standards. I have only seen a collection of \nfacts from studies conducted outside of the United States.\n  Under these new standards states such as New Mexico, are going to be \nrequired to revise water treatment facilities at a significant cost to \nthe general public. Such costs should not be incurred unless sufficient \nscientific information exists in support of the new standard.\n  The New Mexico Environment Department estimates this new standard \nwill affect approximately 25 percent of New Mexico's water systems, \nwith the price for compliance between $400,000,000 and $500,000,000 in \ninitial\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\ncapital expenditures. Annual operating costs will easily fall anywhere \nbetween $16,000,000 and $21,000,000. Additionally, large water system \nusers will see an average water bill increase between $38 and $42 and \nsmall system users will see an average water bill increase of $91. The \ncost of complying with this new standard could well put small rural \nsystems out of business, which is the exact opposite of what we should \nbe trying to accomplish--providing a safe and reliable supply of \ndrinking water to rural America.\n  Again, I believe that science is made of facts and I don't believe we \nhave enough facts here to determine if there will be increased health \nbenefits from the change in these standards. I see unintended \nconsequences resulting from well intentioned motives. We should study \nthis issue here in the United States and then take our best data and \nformulate standards that are scientifically sound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS.\n\n       On and after the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (1) the amendments to parts 9, 141, and 142 of title 40, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, made by the final rule \n     promulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency entitled ``Arsenic and Clarifications to \n     Compliance and New Source Contaminants Monitoring'' (66 Fed. \n     Reg. 6976 (January 22, 2001)) are void; and\n       (2) those parts shall be in effect as if those amendments \n     had not been made.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 224. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to set \naside up to $2 per person from park entrance fees or assess up to $2 \nper person visiting the Grand Canyon or other national parks to secure \nbonds for capital improvements to those parks, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am renewing my efforts to provide \ninnovative solutions to address urgently needed repairs and \nenhancements at our nation's parks. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday is identical to the bill I sponsored in prior congresses, which \nreceived substantial support from many of the organizations supporting \nthe National Parks system. I thank my colleague, Representative Kolbe, \nfor introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 2001 would help secure \ntaxable revenue bonding authority for National Parks. This legislation \nwould allow private fundraising organizations to enter into agreements \nwith the Secretary of Interior to issue taxable capital development \nbonds. Bond revenues would then be used to finance park improvement \nprojects. The bonds would be secured by an entrance fee surcharge of up \nto $2 per visitor at participating parks, or a set-aside of up to $2 \nper visitor from current entrance fees.\n  Our national park system has enormous capital needs--which by last \nestimate ranges from $3 to 5 billion--for high-priority projects such \nas improved transportation systems, trail repairs, visitor facilities, \nhistoric preservation, and the list goes on and on. The unfortunate \nreality is that even under the rosiest budget scenarios, our growing \npark needs far outstrip the resources currently available. Parks are \nstill struggling to address enormous resource and infrastructure needs \nwhile seeking to improve the park experience to accommodate the \nincreasing numbers of visitors to recreation sites.\n  Revenue bonding would take us a long way toward meeting our needs \nwithin the national park system. For example, based on current \nvisitation rates at the Grand Canyon, a $2 surcharge would enable us to \nraise $100 million from a bond issue amortized over 20 years. That is a \nsignificant amount of money which we could use to accomplish many \ncritical park projects.\n  Let me emphasize, however, the Grand Canyon National Park would not \nbe the only park eligible to benefit from this legislation. Any park \nunit with capital needs in excess of $5 million is eligible to \nparticipate. Among eligible parks, the Secretary of Interior will \ndetermine which may take part in the program. I also want to stress \nthat only projects approved as part of a park's general management plan \ncan be funded through bond revenue. This proviso eliminates any concern \nthat the revenue could be used for projects of questionable value to \nthe park.\n  In addition, only organizations under agreement with the Secretary of \nInterior will be authorized to administer the bonding, so the Secretary \ncan establish any rules or policies determined necessary and \nappropriate.\n  Under no circumstances, however, would investors be able to attach \nliens against Federal property in the very unlikely event of default. \nThe bonds will be secured only by the surcharge revenues.\n  Finally, the bill specifies that all professional standards apply and \nthat the issues are subject to the same laws, rules, and regulatory \nenforcement procedures as any other bond issue.\n  The most obvious question raised by this legislation is: Will the \nbond markets support park improvement issues, guaranteed by an entrance \nsurcharge? The answer is an emphatic yes. Bonding is a well-tested tool \nfor the private sector. Additionally, Americans are eager to invest in \nour Nation's natural heritage, and with park visitation growing \nstronger, the risks appear minimal.\n  Are park visitors willing to pay a little more at the entrance gate \nif the money is used for park improvements? Again, I believe the answer \nis yes. Time and time again, visitors have expressed their support for \nincreased fees provided that the revenue is used where collected and \nnot diverted for some other purpose devised by Congress. In recent \nsurveys by the National Park Service, nearly 83 percent of \nparticipating respondents were comfortable in paying such fees for park \npurposes and other respondents thought the fees too low.\n  With the recreational fee program currently being implemented at \nparks around the Nation, an additional $2 surcharge may not be \nnecessary or appropriate at certain parks. Under the bill, those parks \ncould choose to dedicate $2 per park visitor from current entrance fees \ntoward a bond issue. This legislation can easily compliment the \nrecreational fee program to increase benefits to support our parks and \nincrease the quality of America's park experience well into the future.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and National Parks \nsupporters to ensure passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to public elementary and secondary school teachers by \nproviding a tax credit for teaching expenses, professional development \nexpenses, and student education loans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, ``The Teacher \nTax Credit Act.''\n  All of us know that individuals do not pursue a career in the \nteaching profession for the money. People go into the teaching \nprofession for grander reasons--to educate our youth, to make a lasting \ninfluence.\n  Simply put, to teach is to touch a life forever.\n  How true that is. I venture to say that every one of us can remember \nat least one teacher and the special influence he or she had on our \nlives.\n  Despite the fact that teachers play such an important role, \nelementary and secondary education teachers are underpaid, overworked, \nand, unfortunately, all too often, under-appreciated.\n  I was astounded to learn that teachers expend significant money out \nof their own pocket to better the education of our children. Most \ntypically, our teachers are spending money out of their own pocket on \nthree types of expenses:\n\n       (1) education expenses brought into the classroom--such as \n     books, supplies, pens, paper, and computer equipment;\n       (2) professional development expenses--such as tuition, \n     fees, books, and supplies associated with courses that help \n     our teachers become even better instructors; and\n       (3) interest paid by the teacher for previously incurred \n     higher education loans.\n\n  This is the essence of volunteerism in the United States--teachers \nspending their own money to better our childrens' education. Why do \nthey do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate to meet \nthe costs of education.\n  These out-of-pocket costs placed on the backs of our teachers are but \none reason our teachers are leaving the profession.\n  Numerous reports exist detailing the teacher shortage. According to \nthe National Education Association, ``America will need two million new \nteachers in the next decade, and experts predict that half the teachers \nwho will be in the public school classrooms 10 years from now have not \nyet been hired.''\n  In addition, it is estimated that twenty percent of all new hires \nleave the teaching profession within three years.\n  Certainly, a pay raise for teachers is needed and would be a strong \nshowing of recognition and appreciation towards the profession. \nHowever, whether or not to provide teachers a pay raise is a local \nissue and not one that the federal government ought to be involved in.\n  Nevertheless, there is something we can do. On a federal level, we \ncan encourage individuals to enter the teaching profession and remain \nin the teaching profession by reimbursing them for the costs that \nteachers voluntarily incur as part of the profession. Second, we can \nhelp our local school districts with the costs associated with \neducation. And, finally, third, we can specifically help financially \nstrapped urban and rural school systems recruit new teachers and keep \nthose teachers that are currently in the system.\n  With these premises in mind, I introduce, ``The Teacher Tax Credit.'' \nThis legislation creates a $1,000 tax credit for eligible teachers for \nqualified education expenses, qualified professional development \nexpenses and interest paid by the teacher during the taxable year on \nany qualified education loan.\n  Every one of these expenses benefit the student in the classroom \neither through better classroom materials or through increased \nknowledge on the part of the teacher. Even so, the current tax code \nprovides little, if any, recognition of the importance of these \nexpenses.\n  Under the current tax structure, each of these expenses are \ndeductible. However, in order to deduct these classroom expenses under \nthe current tax code, our teachers must meet 4 requirements:\n\n       (1) Teachers must itemize their deductions to receive any \n     tax benefit for the unreimbursed money they spend on \n     education expenses or professional development expenses. Most \n     taxpayers in this country do not itemize;\n       (2) In the event teachers do itemize, in order to receive a \n     deduction under the current tax code for education expenses \n     or professional development costs, teachers' deductions would \n     have to exceed two percent of their adjusted gross income;\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\n       (3) With respect to qualified education loans, under the \n     current tax law, the interest on these loans is deductible, \n     but that deduction is limited to the first sixty months after \n     graduation. A teacher with the standard ten year repayment \n     loans who has been teaching for more than five years receives \n     no benefit; and\n       (4) Under the current tax code, the student loan interest \n     deduction is phased out based on income level. Thus, some \n     teachers, although not rich by any means, could be phased out \n     of the deduction.\n\n  As a result of these four prerequisites, most teachers today receive \nlittle, if any, tax benefit for their out of pocket expenses to improve \nour childrens' education.\n  Our teachers deserve better.\n  When our teachers spend their own money on education expenses that go \ninto the classroom to help students learn, they ought to receive a real \ntax benefit.\n  When our teachers spend their own money on professional development \ncourses to enhance their knowledge in a subject in which they are \ninstructing, our teachers deserve a real tax benefit.\n  When our recent college graduates make the honorable and tough choice \nof training today's youth and tomorrow's leaders, with little \nexpectation of financial riches, such a choice should be encouraged and \nour teachers' choices should be recognized.\n  In my view, the most important factor in ensuring a quality education \nis having a quality teacher in the classroom.\n  The $1,000 Teacher Tax Credit recognizes the hard work our teachers \nhave committed themselves to and helps improve education.\n  Under my legislation, teachers could receive up to a $1,000 tax \ncredit for qualified education expenses, qualified professional \ndevelopment courses, and interest on student loans. Qualifying teachers \nwould not have to itemize their deductions to receive the credit, and \nthey would not have to exceed the two percent floor. Teachers would not \nbe phased out of the student loan interest benefit based on income \nlevel, and there would be no 60 month limitation.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that our education system must ensure \nthat no child is left behind. As we move towards education reforms to \nachieve this goal, we must keep in mind the other component in our \neducation system--the teachers.\n  We must ensure that qualified teachers are not forgotten.\n  Quality, caring teachers, along with quality caring parents, play the \npredominant roles in ensuring that no child is left behind. Passage of \nThe Teacher Tax Credit will help our school systems retain the good \nteachers they now have and recruit the good teachers they need for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues in the Senate have recognized \nthat we can and must do more for our teachers in this country. Senators \nCollins and Kyl have worked on similar legislation, and I commend them \nfor their efforts. I look forward working with them and my other \ncolleagues on this important matter. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Education \nAssociation and the Virginia Education Association indicating their \nsupport for this legislation and the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ongoing \n     professional development is essential to ensure that teachers \n     stay up-to-date on the skills and knowledge necessary to \n     prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. The \n     TEACHER\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\n     Act tax credit for professional development expenses will \n     make a critical difference in helping teachers access quality \n     training.\n       In addition, the TEACHER Act will help encourage talented \n     students to pursue a career in teaching by providing a tax \n     credit for interest paid on higher education loans. Such a \n     tax credit is particularly critical given the projected need \n     to recruit two million qualified teachers nationwide over the \n     next decade.\n       Finally, we are pleased that your legislation would provide \n     a tax credit for teachers who reach into their own pockets to \n     pay for necessary classroom materials, including books, \n     pencils, paper, and art supplies. A 1996 NEA study found that \n     the average K-12 teacher spent over $400 a year out of \n     personal funds for classroom supplies. For teachers earning \n     modest salaries, the purchase of classroom supplies \n     represents a considerable expense for which they often must \n     sacrifice other personal needs.\n       We than you for your leadership in introducing this \n     important legislation and look forward to working with you to \n     support our nation's teachers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Virginia Education Association,\n\n                                   Richmond, VA, January 24, 2001.\n     Hon.

A bill to establish a Northern Border States-Canada Trade \nCouncil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that \nwould establish a Northern Border States Council on United States-\nCanada trade.\n  The purpose of this Council is to oversee cross-border trade with our \nNation's largest trading partner--an action that I believe is long \noverdue and should be considered. The Council will serve as an early \nwarning system to alert State and Federal trade officials to problems \nin cross-border traffic and trade from the very people who are dealing \nwith trade problems. The Council will enable the United States to more \neffectively administer the trade policy with Canada by applying the \nwealth of insight, knowledge and expertise of people who reside not \nonly in my State of Maine, but also in the other northern border \nStates, on this critical policy issue.\n  Within the U.S. Government we already have the Department of Commerce \nand a U.S. Trade Representative, both Federal entities, responsible for \nour larger, national U.S. trade interests. But the fact is that too \noften such entities fail to give full consideration to the interests of \nthe northern States that share a border with Canada, the longest \ndemilitarized border between two nations anywhere in the world. The \nNorthern Border States Council will provide State trade officials with \na mechanism to share information about cross-border traffic and trade. \nThe Council will also advise the Congress, the President, the U.S. \nTrade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal and \nState trade officials on United States-Canada trade policies, \npractices, and problems.\n  Canada is our largest and most important trading partner. It is by \nfar the top purchaser of U.S. export goods and services, as it is the \nlargest source of U.S. imports. In 1999, total two-way merchandise \ncommerce was $365 billion--that's $1 billion a day. With an economy \none-tenth the size of our own, Canada's economic health depends on \nmaintaining close trade ties with the United States. While Canada \naccounts for about one-fifth of U.S. exports and imports, the United \nStates is the source of two-thirds of Canada's imports and provides the \nmarket with fully three-quarters of all of Canada's exports.\n  The United States and Canada have the largest bilateral trade \nrelationship in the world, a relationship that is remarkable not only \nfor its strength and general health, but also for the intensity of the \ntrade and border problems that do frequently develop--as we have seen \nin recent years with actual farmer border blockades in some border \nstates because of the unfairness of agricultural trade policies.\n  Over the last decade, Canada and the United States have signed two \nmajor trade agreements--the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement \nin 1989, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in \n1993. They also negotiated the 1996 US-Canada Softwood Lumber \nAgreement, which will expire two months from now, on March 31. Even \nthough some of us in Congress urged the last Administration on more \nthan one occasion to negotiate a process with Canadian officials to \nwork for a fairer alternative, nothing was attempted on a government to \ngovernment basis.\n  Notwithstanding these trade accords, numerous disagreements have \ncaused trade negotiators to shuttle back and forth between Washington \nand Ottawa for solutions to problems for grain trade, wheat imports, \nanimal trade, and joint cooperation on Biotechnology.\n  Most of the more well-known trade disputes with Canada have involved \nagricultural commodities such as durum wheat, peanut butter, dairy \nproducts, and poultry products, and these disputes, of course, have \nimpacted more than just the northern border States. Each and every day, \nan enormous quantity of trade and traffic crosses the United States-\nCanada border. There are literally thousands of businesses, large and \nsmall, that rely on this cross-border traffic and trade for their \nlivelihood.\n  My own State of Maine has had a long-running dispute with Canada over \nthat nation's unfair policies in support of its potato industry. \nSpecifically, Canada protects its domestic potato growers from United \nStates competition through a system of nontariff trade barriers, such \nas setting container size limitations and a prohibition on bulk \nshipments from the United States. I might add that there has still not \nbeen any movement towards solutions for these problems, even though I \nhave been given promises every year that trade problems with Canada \nwould be a top priority for discussion.\n\n  This bulk import prohibition effectively blocks United States potato \nimports into Canada and was one topic of discussion during a 1997 \nInternational Trade Commission investigations hearing, where I \ntestified on behalf of the Maine potato growers. The ITC followed up \nwith a report stating that Canadian regulations do restrict imports of \nbulk shipments of fresh potatoes for processing or repacking, and that \nthe U.S. maintains no such restrictions. These bulk shipment \nrestrictions continue, and, at the same time, Canada also artificially \nenhances the competitiveness of its product through domestic subsidies \nfor its potato growers.\n  Another trade dispute with Canada, specifically with the province of \nNew Brunswick, originally served as the inspiration for this \nlegislation. In July 1993, Canadian federal customs officials began \nstopping Canadians returning from Maine and collecting from them the \n11-percent New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax, [PST] on goods purchased \nin Maine. Canadian Customs Officers had already been collecting the \nCanadian federal sales tax all across the United States-Canada border. \nThe collection of the New Brunswick PST was specifically targeted \nagainst goods purchased in Maine--not on goods purchased in any of the \nother provinces bordering New Brunswick.\n  After months of imploring the U.S. Trade Representative to do \nsomething about the imposition of the unfairly administered tax, then \nAmbassador Kantor agreed that the New Brunswick PST was a violation of \nNAFTA, and that the United States would include the PST issue in the \nNAFTA dispute settlement process. But despite this explicit assurance, \nthe issue was not, in fact, brought before NAFTA's dispute settlement \nprocess, prompting Congress in 1996, to include an amendment\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nI offered to immigration reform legislation calling for the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to take this action without further delay. But, it took \nthree years for a resolution, and even then, the resolution was not \ncrafted by the USTR.\n  Throughout the early months of the PST dispute, we in the state of \nMaine had enormous difficulty convincing our Federal trade officials \nthat the PST was in fact an international trade dispute that warranted \ntheir attention and action. We had no way of knowing whether problems \nsimilar to the PST dispute existed elsewhere along the United States-\nCanada border, or whether it was a more localized problem. If a body \nlike the Northern Border States Council had existed when the collection \nof the PST began, it could have immediately started investigating the \nissue to determine its impact and would have made recommendations as to \nhow to deal with it.\n  The long-standing pattern of unsuccessful negotiations is alarming. \nIn short, the Northern Border States Council will serve as the eyes and \nears of our States that share a border with Canada, and who are most \nvulnerable to fluctuations in cross-border trade and traffic. The \nCouncil will be a tool for Federal and State trade officials to use in \nmonitoring cross-border trade. It will help ensure that national trade \npolicy regarding America's largest trading partner will be developed \nand implemented with an eye towards the unique opportunities and \nburdens present to the northern border states.\n  The Northern Border States Council will be an advisory body, not a \nregulatory one. Its fundamental purpose will be to determine the nature \nand cause of cross-border trade issues or disputes, and to recommend \nhow to resolve them.\n  The duties and responsibilities of the Council will include, but not \nbe limited to, providing advice and policy recommendations on such \nmatters as taxation and the regulation of cross-border wholesale and \nretail trade in goods and services; taxation, regulation and \nsubsidization of food, agricultural, energy, and forest-products \ncommodities; and the potential for Federal and State/provincial laws \nand regulations, including customs and immigration regulations, to act \nas nontariff barriers to trade.\n  As an advisory body, the Council will review and comment on all \nFederal and/or State reports, studies, and practices concerning United \nStates-Canada trade, with particular emphasis on all reports from the \ndispute settlement panels established under NAFTA. These Council \nreviews will be conducted upon the request of the United States Trade \nRepresentative, the Secretary of Commerce, a Member of Congress from \nany Council State, or the Governor of a Council State.\n  If the Council determines that the origin of a cross-border trade \ndispute resides with Canada, the Council would determine, to the best \nof its ability, if the source of the dispute is the Canadian Federal \nGovernment or a Canadian Provincial government.\n  The goal of this legislation is not to create another Federal trade \nbureaucracy. The Council will be made up of individuals nominated by \nthe Governors and approved by the Secretary of Commerce. Each northern \nborder State will have two members on the Council. The Council members \nwill be unpaid, and serve a 2-year term.\n  The Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada Trade will \nnot solve all of our trade problems with Canada. But it will ensure \nthat the voices and views of our northern border States are heard in \nWashington by our Federal trade officials. For too long their voices \nhave been ignored, and the northern border States have had to suffer \nsevere economic consequences at various times because of it. This \nlegislation will bring our States into their rightful position as full \npartners for issues that affect cross-border trade and traffic with our \ncountry's largest trading partner.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to make \npermanent the Native American veterans housing loan program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which \npermanently authorizes the Native American Veteran Housing Loan \nProgram.\n  In 1992, I authored a bill that established a pilot program to assist \nNative American veterans who reside on trust lands. This pilot program, \nadministered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, provides direct \nloans to Native American veterans to build or purchase homes on trust \nlands. Previously, Native American veterans who resided on trust lands \nwere unable to qualify for VA home loan benefits. This disgraceful \ntreatment of Native American veterans was finally corrected when \nCongress established the Native American Direct Home Loan Program.\n  Despite the challenges of creating a program that addresses the needs \nof hundreds of different tribal entities, VA has successfully entered \ninto agreements to provide direct VA loans to members of 59 tribes and \nPacific Island groups, and negotiations continue with other tribes. \nSince the program's inception, 233 Native American veterans have been \nable to achieve home ownership, and none of the loans approved by the \nVA have been foreclosed.\n  Unfortunately, the authority to issue new loans under this successful \nprogram will end on December 31, 2001. This would be devastating to a \nnumber of Native American veterans who would like to participate in \nthis program. Native American veterans who reside on trust lands should \nbe afforded the same benefits available to other veterans. Without this \nprogram, it would be incredibly difficult for Native Americans living \non trust lands to obtain home loan financing.\n  Permanent authorization of this program will ensure that Native \nAmerican veterans are provided equal access to services and benefits \navailable to other veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT AUTHORITY FOR NATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS \n                   HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Permanent Authority.--Section 3761 of title 38, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking subsection (c).\n       (b) Reporting Requirements.--Subsection (j) of section 3762 \n     of that title is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking \n     ``through 2002''; and\n       (2) by striking ``pilot'' each place it appears.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--(1) Section 3761 of that title \n     is further amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) in the first sentence, by striking ``establish and \n     implement a pilot program'' and inserting ``carry out a \n     program''; and\n       (ii) in the second sentence, by striking ``establish and \n     implement the pilot program'' and inserting ``carry out the \n     program''; and\n       (B) in subsection (b), by striking ``pilot''.\n       (2) Section 3762 of that title is further amended--\n       (A) in subsection (b)(1)(E), by striking ``pilot program \n     established under this subchapter is implemented'' and \n     inserting ``program under this subchapter is carried out'';\n       (B) in the second sentence of subsection (c)(1)(B), by \n     striking ``in order to carry out'' and all that follows \n     through ``direct housing loans'' and inserting ``to make \n     direct housing loans under the program under this \n     subchapter''; and\n       (C) in subsection (i)--\n       (i) in paragraph (1), by striking ``pilot'';\n       (ii) in paragraph (2)(A)--\n       (I) by striking ``pilot program'' the first place it \n     appears and inserting ``program provided for under this \n     subchapter''; and\n       (II) by striking ``pilot program'' the second place it \n     appears and inserting ``that program''; and\n       (iii) in paragraph (2)(E), by striking ``pilot program'' \n     and inserting ``program provided for under this subchapter''.\n       (d) Clerical Amendments.--(1) The section heading of \n     section 3761 of that title is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 3761. Housing loan program''.\n\n       (2) The subchapter heading of subchapter V of chapter 37 of \n     that title is amended to read as follows:\n\n    ``SUBCHAPTER V--NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM''.\n\n       (3) The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 37 of \n     that title is amended by striking the item relating to \n     subchapter V and the item relating to section 3761 and \n     inserting the following new items:\n\n      ``SUBCHAPTER V--NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM\n\n``3761. Housing loan program.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n\n  S. 231. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to ensure that seniors are given an opportunity to serve as \nmentors, tutors, and volunteers for certain programs; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the future of our nation rests on the \nsmall shoulders of America's school children. To help them face that \nchallenge, we must call on all of our resources and find new and \ninnovative ways to support our schools, right now.\n  That is why today, I am introducing the ``Seniors As Volunteers in \nOur Schools Act,'' a bill that will be an important step in ensuring \nthat our\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nschools provide a safe and caring place for our children to learn and \ngrow. This bill is based on legislation which I introduced in the 106th \nCongress, S. 1851. I am pleased to have my colleagues Senators \nGrassley, Akaka and Inouye as original co-sponsors.\n  Over the past week, under the leadership of President Bush, our \nnation and this body have committed to improving the nature of our \nschools. This bill presents one common-sense approach to enhancing the \nsafety in our schools by utilizing one of our greatest resources--our \nsenior citizens.\n  The bill I introduce today would encourage school administrators and \nteachers to use qualified seniors as volunteers in federally funded \nprograms and activities authorized by the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA. The legislation specifically would encourage the \nuse of seniors as volunteers in the safe and drug free schools \nprograms, Indian education programs, the 21st Century Community before- \nand after-school programs and gifted and talented programs.\n  The Seniors as Volunteers in Our Schools Act creates no new programs; \nrather it suggests another allowable use of funds already allocated. \nThe discretion whether to take advantage of this new resource continues \nto remain solely with the school systems.\n  In my home state of Colorado, a School Safety Summit recommended \nconnecting each child to a caring adult as a way to reduce youth \nviolence. Studies show that consistent guidance by a mentor or caring \nadult can help reduce teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and youth \nviolence. Evidence also shows that the presence of adults on \nplaygrounds, and in hallways and study halls, stabilizes the learning \nenvironment.\n  I know firsthand the importance of mentoring based on my own \nexperiences as a teacher. A mentor can have a profound and positive \nimpact on a child's life. What better way to make our schools safer for \nour children than to have more caring adults visibly involved?\n  I am pleased to note that the Colorado Association of School Boards \nsupports the goal of this legislation. Jane Urschel, the Association's \nAssociate Executive Director states, ``As many Colorado school \ndistricts have already discovered, having senior citizens in our \nclassrooms helps to build inter-generational relationships and trust. \nIt leads to a richer life for all.''\n  I am pleased that a number of seniors in Colorado already are helping \nin schools throughout my state. Many of my former and current staffers \nand their relatives care deeply about this issue and are very involved \nin volunteer and mentoring activities.\n  I do not expect this legislation to solve all the problems \nconfronting our schools today. But, I see it as a practical way to help \nmake our schools safer, more caring places for our children.\n  Mr. President, the Seniors as Volunteers in Our Schools Act of 2001 \nis one simple way to address the school safety issue in Colorado and \nnationwide. I believe that as we work to find the resources our schools \nrequire we must not overlook one of the more plentiful and accessible \nresources at our disposal--willing and capable adult role models. This \nbill provides an opportunity to immediately improve the lives of \nyounger and older Americans alike by bringing them together in our \nschools. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code for 1986 to exclude\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\nUnited States savings bond income from gross income if it is used to \npay long-term care expenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to begin this session \nwith re-introduction of a measure to help Americans to better afford \nhealth care. Last Congress, I introduced S. 2066, which would have \ncreated a Savings Bond Income Tax-exemption for long-term care \nservices. On July 17, 2000, this measure was adopted by the Senate as \nan amendment to S. 2839, the Marriage Penalty Reconciliation bill, but \nunfortunately was not retained in the final version of the legislation. \nAs we all know, Congress did not pass any significant tax relief for \nhealth care coverage last year. Today, I am joined by Senators Durbin, \nHagel, Corzine and Landrieu in re-submitting this legislation.\n  Many have expressed their continuing interest in enacting our \nproposal which would result in a revenue loss of less than $22 million \nover ten years as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation while \noffering significant help in the financing of long-term health care \nneeds. It is currently forecasted that in the next 30 years, half of \nall women and a third of all men in the United States will spend a \nportion of their life in a nursing home at a cost of $40,000 to $90,000 \nper year per person. I believe the proposed legislation would provide \nan excellent opportunity to assist millions of Americans facing the \nfinancial burdens of long-term care.\n  The bill we are re-introducing today would exclude United States \nsavings bond income from being taxed if used to pay for long-term \nhealth care expenses. It will assist individuals struggling to \naccommodate costs associated with many chronic medical conditions and \nthe aging process. Families that claim parents or parents-in-law as \ndependents on their tax returns would qualify for this tax credit if \nsavings bond income is used to pay for long-term care services. \n``Sandwich generation\" families paying for both college education for \ntheir children and long-term care services for their parents could use \nthe tax credit for either program or a combined credit up to the \nallowable amount.\n  The last Congress took an important step in addressing our growing \nlong-term care needs by enacting H.R. 4040, the Long-Term Care Security \nAct. H.R. 4040, which was signed into law on September 19, 2000, \ncreated the largest employer-based long-term care insurance program in \nAmerican history. Additional steps are needed and our proposal will \nmake long-term care more obtainable by more Americans. I urge you to \nsupport this needed tax relief for Americans struggling with the high \ncost of assistive and nursing home care.\n  I ask that this proposal to provide tax relief for long-term care \nservices be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to place a moratorium on executions by the Federal \nGovernment and urge the States to do the same, while a National \nCommission on the Death Penalty reviews the fairness of the imposition \nof the death penalty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one year ago today, Governor George Ryan \ntook the bold step of placing a moratorium on executions in Illinois. \nHe refused to sign off on a single execution in Illinois. Why? Because \nhe saw that the system by which people were sentenced to death in \nIllinois was terribly flawed. In fact, by the time Governor Ryan made \nhis decision, Illinois had seen more exonerations of innocent people \nthan executions. There had been 13 exonerations and 12 executions. Of \nthe 13 people found innocent, some were wrongfully convicted based on \npolice or prosecutorial misconduct. Modern DNA testing played a role in \nyet another 5 exonerations. And in some cases, it was students from \nNorthwestern University--people very much outside the criminal justice \nsystem--who played a key role in finding and presenting the evidence to \nsecure the release of wrongfully condemned men.\n  What did Governor Ryan do in the face of this risk of executing \ninnocent people? Governor Ryan recognized the moral stakes that faced \nhim and took the courageous step of suspending executions. He said, \n``until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or \nwoman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate.'' Is \nthat too much to ask--that innocent men and women not be put to death? \nI believe the vast majority of Americans would say it is not too much \nto ask. Governor Ryan has been an ardent death penalty supporter, \nhaving argued vehemently for its use while a member of the Illinois \nlegislature. But now, as Governor, he was faced with the awesome \nresponsibility of carrying out the final stage of this punishment. \nFollowing his decision to place a moratorium on executions, he promptly \nappointed a panel of distinguished prosecutors and defense lawyers, as \nwell as\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\ncivic and political leaders. That panel is charged with thoroughly \nreviewing the flaws in the administration of the death penalty in \nIllinois.\n  But these problems--and particularly the risk of executing an \ninnocent person--are not unique to Illinois. They exist throughout our \nNation. That is why today I rise to re-introduce the National Death \nPenalty Moratorium Act. This bill seeks to apply the wisdom of Governor \nRyan and the people of Illinois to the federal government and all \nstates that authorize the use of capital punishment. I am pleased that \nmy distinguished colleagues, Senators Levin, Wellstone and Corzine, \nhave joined me in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Governor Ryan's decision was a watershed event. During the last year, \nhis action was a significant factor in unleashing a renewed, national \ndebate on the death penalty. For the first time in many years, people \nare beginning to understand that our system is fallible. Mistakes can \nbe made. Mistakes have been made. But mistakes should not be made, \nparticularly when mistakes can mean the difference between life and \ndeath. In fact, overall support for the death penalty has dropped to an \nalmost 20-year low. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, \n63 percent of Americans support a suspension of executions while \nquestions of fairness are addressed.\n  The time to prevent the execution of the innocent is now. The time to \nrestore fairness and justice is now. The time to act is now. The time \nfor a moratorium is now.\n  Governor Ryan was greatly troubled by the number of innocent people \nsent to death row in Illinois--13 people, and still counting. Since the \n1970s, 93 people have been exonerated nationwide. At the same time, we \nhave executed close to 700 people. That means for every seven people \nwho have been executed, we have found one person sitting on death row \nwho should not have been there. And it's not just Illinois that has \nsent innocent people to death row. Twenty-two of the 38 states that \nauthorize capital punishment have had exonerations. In fact, Florida \nactually exceeds Illinois in total number of people exonerated: Florida \nhas had 20. Oklahoma has exonerated 7, Texas has exonerated 7 people, \nGeorgia has exonerated 6 people, and on and on. Mr. President, while we \nexplore ways to reduce and eliminate the risk of executing the \ninnocent, not a single person should be executed. The time to act is \nnow. The time for a moratorium is now.\n  My distinguished colleague from Vermont, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has championed the need for access \nto modern DNA testing and certain minimum standards of competency for \ndefense counsel in capital cases. I have joined him and many of our \ndistinguished colleagues, including Senators Gordon Smith, Collins, \nJeffords, and Levin, to support the Innocence Protection Act. This bill \nwould bring greater fairness to the administration of the death \npenalty. I commend Senator Leahy for his leadership on this bill, \nparticularly for highlighting the need for access to modern DNA \ntesting. During the last year, as a result of his leadership, the \nAmerican people are beginning to understand the value and necessity of \nmodern DNA testing in our criminal justice system. But while we work to \npass these needed reforms, a time-out is needed to ensure the integrity \nand fairness of our criminal justice system. The time for a moratorium \nis now.\n  According to a study led by Columbia University Law Professor Jim \nLiebman and released last June, the overall rate of error in America's \ndeath penalty system is 68 percent. Reviewing over 4,500 appeals \nbetween 1973 and 1995, the report found that courts detected serious, \nreversible error in nearly 7 of every 10 of the capital sentences that \nwere fully reviewed. It is appalling that the system is producing so \nmany mistakes. And, of course, the question remains: Are we in fact \ncatching all the mistakes?\n  The Columbia study is further evidence that Illinois' problems are \nnot unique. The overall error rate in Illinois was 66 percent, just \nbelow the national average, which means that some states are well above \nIllinois. I can't underscore this enough. The serious, prejudicial \nerror that results in reversals is a phenomenon nationally, not just in \nIllinois.\n  In the words of the study's authors, our system is ``collapsing under \nthe weight of its own mistakes.'' Mr. President, if our death penalty \nsystem was a business enterprise that had an error rate in producing \nwidgets of 68 percent, that business would undertake a thorough, top to \nbottom review. Let's conduct a thorough, top to bottom review of our \nnation's death penalty system.\n  The Columbia study found that the most common errors are (1) \negregiously incompetent defense counsel who failed to look for \nimportant evidence that the defendant was innocent or did not deserve \nto die; and (2) police or prosecutors who discovered that kind of \nevidence but suppressed it, again keeping it from the jury. On retrial \nwhere results are known, 82 percent of the reversals resulted in \nsentences less than death, while another 7 percent were found to be \ninnocent of the crime that sent them to death row. When the system \nsends an innocent person to death row, there is a double loss: the \ninnocent person is robbed of freedom and the real killer is still free, \nfree to potentially do more harm.\n  Senator Leahy's Innocence Protection Act is a first step in the fight \nto ensure that defendants facing capital charges receive competent \nlegal representation. We have heard stories of sleeping lawyers, drunk \nlawyers, lawyers who are paid less than a living wage, all of whom are \nlawyers who have represented people subsequently convicted and \nsentenced to death. But, as the Columbia study shows, access to modern \nDNA testing and efforts to ensure competent counsel in capital cases \nare only two of the many menacing problems plaguing the administration \nof the death penalty.\n  The second common error, according to the Columbia study, is the role \nof police or prosecutorial misconduct in suppressing evidence that \ncould mean the difference between guilt and innocence, or life and \ndeath. The risk of police or prosecutorial misconduct is increased in \ncapital cases. Why? Because capital cases are usually high profile, \nhigh stakes cases, particularly for the police or prosecutor's \npersonal, professional advancement. One problem involves the use of \njailhouse informant testimony. Police or prosecutors use jailhouse \ninformants who claim to have heard the defendant confess to a crime. \nThese informants' testimony, however, is inherently unreliable because \nthey have a strong incentive to lie: their testimony to convict another \nperson can mean reduced charges or a lighter sentence in their own \ncase.\n  Similarly, prosecutors may rely on the testimony of co-defendants who \nalso may have strong incentives to lie to avoid tougher charges or \nharsher sentences. Yet another area of police misconduct involves false \nconfessions. Take the case of Gary Gauger. Gauger was wrongfully \nconvicted of murdering his parents on the basis of a false confession \nobtained by police. In 1993, he was convicted and sent to Illinois' \ndeath row. The main piece of evidence against him was a so-called \n``confession'' that the police claimed they obtained after holding \nGauger for 21 hours without food or access to an attorney. The police \nwrote out a version of the murder and tried to convince Gauger that he \nhad killed his parents while in a blackout state. He refused to sign \nthe ``confession.'' But the prosecution introduced the unsigned \nconfession against him at trial. His defense attorney did virtually no \nwork preparing for trial, telling Gauger's sister that ``death penalty \ncases are won on appeal.'' Fortunately for Gauger, Northwestern \nUniversity Law Professor Larry Marshall took over his case and Gauger's \nconviction was reversed. In the meantime, the real killers were \ndiscovered when FBI agents, listening to wiretapped conversations \nduring an FBI investigation of a motorcycle gang, heard the killers \ndescribe murdering Gauger's parents.\n  Gauger finally got his freedom, but only after being unfairly and \nunjustly dragged through our criminal justice system. Our law \nenforcement officers do a great job, but we must act to understand the \nrole of misconduct by police and prosecutors and its contribution to \ncreating a high rate of error in capital cases. The time to act is now. \nThe time for a moratorium is now.\n  Another problem with our nation's administration of the death penalty \nis\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\nthe glaring racial disparity in decisions about who shall be executed. \nOne of the most disturbing statistics suggests that white victims are \nvalued more highly by the system than non-whites. Since reinstatement \nof the modern death penalty, 83 percent of capital cases involve white \nvictims, even though murder victims are African American or white in \nroughly equal numbers. Nationwide, more than half the death row inmates \nare African Americans or Hispanic Americans.\n  Racial disparities are particularly pronounced at the federal level. \nAccording to a report released by the Justice Department in September \n2000, whether a defendant lives or dies in the federal system appears \nto relate to the color of the defendant's skin or the federal district \nin which the prosecution takes place. The report also found that 80 \npercent of the cases submitted for death penalty prosecution \nauthorization involved minority defendants. Furthermore, according to \nthe Department of Justice, white defendants are more likely than black \ndefendants to negotiate plea bargains saving them from the death \npenalty in Federal cases. In fact, currently, 16 of the 20, or 80 \npercent, of federal death row inmates are racial or ethnic minorities.\n  The federal death penalty system also shows a troubling geographic \ndisparity. The Department of Justice report shows that United States \nAttorneys in only 5 of 94 Federal districts--1 each in Virginia, \nMaryland, Puerto Rico, and 2 in New York--submit 40 percent of all \ncases in which the death penalty is considered. In fact, U.S. attorneys \nwho have frequently recommended seeking the death penalty are often \nfrom States with a high number of executions under State law, including \nTexas, Virginia, and Missouri.\n  The National Institute of Justice is already setting into motion a \ncomprehensive study of these racial and geographic disparities. Federal \nexecutions should not proceed until these disparities are fully studied \nand discussed, and until the federal death penalty process is subjected \nto necessary remedial action.\n  In addition to racial and geographic disparities in the \nadministration of the federal death penalty, other serious questions \nexist about the fairness and reliability of federal death penalty \nprosecutions. Federal prosecutors rely heavily on bargained-for \ntestimony from accomplices of the capital defendant, which is often \nobtained in exchange for not seeking the death penalty against the \naccomplices. This practice creates a serious risk of false testimony.\n  Federal prosecutors are not required to provide discovery \nsufficiently ahead of trial to permit the defense to be prepared to use \nthis information effectively in defending their clients. The FBI, in \nincreasing isolation from the rest of the nation's law enforcement \nagencies, refuses to make electronic recordings of interrogations that \nproduce confessions, thus making subsequent scrutiny of the legality \nand reliability of such interrogations more difficult. Federal \nprosecutors rely heavily on predictions of ``future dangerousness''--\npredictions deemed unreliable and misleading by the American \nPsychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association--to \nsecure death sentences.\n  I was pleased when, in December 2000, President Clinton stayed Juan \nRaul Garza's execution and ordered the Justice Department to conduct \nfurther reviews of the racial and regional disparities in the federal \ndeath penalty system. Before the federal government takes this step, \nresuming executions for the first time in almost 40 years, we should be \nsure that our system of administering the ultimate punishment is fair \nand just.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the National Death \nPenalty Moratorium Act. This bill would place a moratorium on federal \nexecutions and urge the States to do the same. The bill would also \ncreate a National Commission on the Death Penalty to review the \nfairness of the administration of the death penalty at the state and \nfederal levels. This Commission would be an independent, blue ribbon \npanel of distinguished prosecutors, defense attorneys, jurists and \nothers.\n  The need for a moratorium could not be more critical than it is \ntoday. The time to act is now. The time for a moratorium is now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Death Penalty \n     Moratorium Act of 2001''.\n\n                TITLE I--MORATORIUM ON THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) General findings.--\n       (A) The administration of the death penalty by the Federal \n     government and the States should be consistent with our \n     Nation's fundamental principles of fairness, justice, \n     equality, and due process.\n       (B) At a time when Federal executions are scheduled to \n     recommence, Congress should consider that more than ever \n     Americans are questioning the use of the death penalty and \n     calling for assurances that it be fairly applied. Support for \n     the death penalty has dropped to the lowest level in 19 \n     years. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll revealed that 63 \n     percent of Americans support a suspension of executions until \n     questions of fairness can be addressed.\n       (C) Documented unfairness in the Federal system requires \n     Congress to act and suspend Federal executions. Additionally, \n     substantial evidence of unfairness throughout death penalty \n     States justifies further investigation by Congress.\n       (2) Administration of the death penalty by the federal \n     government.--\n       (A) The fairness of the administration of the Federal death \n     penalty has recently come under serious scrutiny, \n     specifically raising questions of racial and geographic \n     disparities:\n       (i) Eighty percent of Federal death row inmates are members \n     of minority groups.\n       (ii) A report released by the Department of Justice on \n     September 12, 2000, found that 80 percent of defendants who \n     were charged with death-eligible offenses under Federal law \n     and whose cases were submitted by the United States attorneys \n     under the Department's death penalty decision-making \n     procedures were African American, Hispanic American, or \n     members of other minority groups.\n       (iii) The Department of Justice report shows that United \n     States attorneys in only 5 of 94 Federal districts--1 each in \n     Virginia, Maryland, Puerto Rico, and 2 in New York--submit 40 \n     percent of all cases in which the death penalty is \n     considered.\n       (iv) The Department of Justice report shows that United \n     States attorneys who have frequently recommended seeking the \n     death penalty are often from States with a high number of \n     executions under State law, including Texas, Virginia, and \n     Missouri.\n       (v) The Department of Justice report shows that white \n     defendants are more likely than black defendants to negotiate \n     plea bargains saving them from the death penalty in Federal \n     cases.\n       (vi) A study conducted by the House Judiciary Subcommittee \n     on Civil and Constitutional Rights in 1994 concluded that 89 \n     percent of defendants selected for capital prosecution under \n     the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were either African American \n     or Hispanic American.\n       (vii) The National Institute of Justice has already set \n     into motion a comprehensive study of these racial and \n     geographic disparities.\n       (viii) Federal executions should not proceed until these \n     disparities are fully studied, discussed, and the federal \n     death penalty process is subjected to necessary remedial \n     action.\n       (B) In addition to racial and geographic disparities in the \n     administration of the federal death penalty, other serious \n     questions exist about the fairness and reliability of federal \n     death penalty prosecutions:\n       (i) Federal prosecutors rely heavily on bargained-for \n     testimony from accomplices of the capital defendant, which is \n     often obtained in exchange for not seeking the death penalty \n     against the accomplices. This practice creates a serious risk \n     of false testimony.\n       (ii) Federal prosecutors are not required to provide \n     discovery sufficiently ahead of trial to permit the defense \n     to be prepared to use this information effectively in \n     defending their clients.\n       (iii) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in \n     increasing isolation from the rest of the nation's law \n     enforcement agencies, refuses to make electronic recordings \n     of interrogations that produce confessions, thus making \n     subsequent scrutiny of the legality and reliability of such \n     interrogations more difficult.\n       (iv) Federal prosecutors rely heavily on predictions of \n     ``future dangerousness''--predictions deemed unreliable and \n     misleading by the American Psychiatric Association and the \n     American Psychological Association--to secure death \n     sentences.\n       (3) Administration of the death penalty by the states.--\n       (A) The punishment of death carries an especially heavy \n     burden to be free from arbitrariness and discrimination. The \n     Supreme Court has held that ``super due process'', a higher \n     standard than that applied in regular\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\n     criminal trials, is necessary to meet constitutional \n     requirements. There is significant evidence that States are \n     not providing this heightened level of due process. For \n     example:\n       (i) In the most comprehensive review of modern death \n     sentencing, Professor James Liebman and researchers at \n     Columbia University found that, during the period 1973 to \n     1995, 68 percent of all death penalty cases reviewed were \n     overturned due to serious constitutional errors. In the wake \n     of the Liebman study, 6 States (Arizona, Maryland, North \n     Carolina, Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska), as well as the \n     Chicago Tribune and the Texas Defender Service are conducting \n     additional studies. These studies may expose additional \n     problems. With few exceptions, the rate of error was \n     consistent across all death penalty States.\n       (ii) Forty percent of the cases overturned were reversed in \n     Federal court after having been upheld by the States.\n       (B) The high rate of error throughout all death penalty \n     jurisdictions suggests that there is a grave risk that \n     innocent persons may have been, or will likely be, wrongfully \n     executed. Although the Supreme Court has never conclusively \n     addressed the issue of whether executing an innocent person \n     would in and of itself violate the Constitution, in Herrara \n     v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), a majority of the court \n     expressed the view that a persuasive demonstration of actual \n     innocence would violate substantive due process rendering \n     imposition of a death sentence unconstitutional. In any \n     event, the wrongful conviction and sentencing of a person to \n     death is a serious concern for many Americans. For example:\n       (i) After 13 innocent people were released from Illinois \n     death row in the same period that the State had executed 12 \n     people, on January 31, 2000, Governor George Ryan of Illinois \n     imposed a moratorium on executions until he could be ``sure \n     with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing \n     a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate''.\n       (ii) Since 1973, 93 persons have been freed and exonerated \n     from death rows across the country, most after serving \n     lengthy sentences.\n       (C) Wrongful convictions create a serious public safety \n     problem because the true killer is still at large, while the \n     innocent person languishes in prison.\n       (D) There are many systemic problems that result in \n     innocent people being convicted such as mistaken \n     identification, reliance on jailhouse informants, reliance on \n     faulty forensic testing and no access to reliable DNA \n     testing. For example:\n       (i) A study of cases of innocent people who were later \n     exonerated, conducted by attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter \n     Neufeld with ``The Innocence Project'' at Cardozo Law School, \n     showed that mistaken identifications of eyewitnesses or \n     victims contributed to 84 percent of the wrongful \n     convictions.\n       (ii) Many persons on death row were convicted prior to 1994 \n     and did not receive the benefit of modern DNA testing. At \n     least 10 individuals sentenced to death have been exonerated \n     through post-conviction DNA testing, some within days of \n     execution. Yet in spite of the current widespread prevalence \n     and availability of DNA testing, many States have procedural \n     barriers blocking introduction of post-conviction DNA \n     testing. More than 30 States have laws that require a motion \n     for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence to be \n     filed within 6 months or less.\n       (iii) The widespread use of jailhouse snitches who earn \n     reduced charges or sentences by fabricating ``admissions'' by \n     fellow inmates to unsolved crimes can lead to wrongful \n     convictions.\n       (iv) The misuse of forensic evidence can lead to wrongful \n     convictions. A recently released report from the Texas \n     Defender Service entitled ``A State of Denial: Texas and the \n     Death Penalty'' found 160 cases of official forensic \n     misconduct including 121 cases where expert psychiatrists \n     testified ``with absolute certainty that the defendant would \n     be a danger in the future'', often without even interviewing \n     the defendant.\n       (E) The sixth amendment to the Constitution guarantees all \n     accused persons access to competent counsel. The Supreme \n     Court set out standards for determining competency in the \n     case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). \n     Unfortunately, there is unequal access to competent counsel \n     throughout death penalty States. For example:\n       (i) Ninety percent of capital defendants cannot afford to \n     hire their own attorney.\n       (ii) Fewer than one-quarter of the 38 death penalty States \n     have set any standards for competency of counsel and in those \n     few States, these standards were set only recently. In most \n     States, any person who passes a bar examination, even if that \n     attorney has never represented a client in any type of case, \n     may represent a client in a death penalty case.\n       (iii) Thirty-seven percent of capital cases were reversed \n     because of ineffective assistance of counsel, according to \n     the Columbia study.\n       (iv) The recent Texas report noted problems with Texas \n     defense attorneys who slept through capital trials, ignored \n     obvious exculpatory evidence, suffered discipline for ethical \n     lapses or for being under the influence of drugs or alcohol \n     while representing an indigent capital defendant at trial.\n       (v) Poor lawyering was also cited by Governor Ryan in \n     Illinois as a basis for a moratorium. More than half of all \n     capital defendants there were represented by lawyers who were \n     later disciplined or disbarred for unethical conduct.\n       (F) The Supreme Court has held that it is a violation of \n     the eighth amendment to impose the death penalty in a manner \n     that is arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. McKlesky v. \n     Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987). Studies consistently indicate \n     racial disparity in the application of the death penalty both \n     for the defendants and the victims. The death penalty is \n     disparately applied in various regions throughout the \n     country, suggesting arbitrary administration of the death \n     penalty based on where the prosecution takes place. For \n     example:\n       (i) Of the 85 executions in the year 2000, 51 percent of \n     the defendants were white, 40 percent were black, 7 percent \n     were Latino and 2 percent Native American. Of the victims in \n     the underlying murder, 76 percent were white, 18 percent were \n     black, 2 percent were Latino, and 3 percent were ``other''. \n     These figures show a continuing trend since reinstatement of \n     the modern death penalty of a predominance of white victims' \n     cases. Despite the fact that nationally whites and blacks are \n     victims of murder in approximately equal numbers, 83 percent \n     of the victims involved in capital cases overall since \n     reinstatement, and 76 percent of the victims in 2000, have \n     been white. Since this disparity is confirmed in studies that \n     control for similar crimes by defendants with similar \n     backgrounds, it implies that white victims are considered \n     more valuable in the criminal justice system.\n       (ii) Executions are conducted predominately in southern \n     States. Ninety percent of all executions in 2000 were \n     conducted in the south. Only 3 States outside the south, \n     Arizona, California, and Missouri, conducted an execution in \n     2000. Texas accounted for almost as many executions as all \n     the remaining States combined.\n\n     SEC. 102. FEDERAL AND STATE DEATH PENALTY MORATORIUM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Government shall not carry out \n     any sentence of death imposed under Federal law until the \n     Congress considers the final findings and recommendations of \n     the National Commission on the Death Penalty in the report \n     submitted under section 202(c)(2) and the Congress enacts \n     legislation repealing this section and implements or rejects \n     the guidelines and procedures recommended by the Commission.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     each State that authorizes the use of the death penalty \n     should enact a moratorium on executions to allow time to \n     review whether the administration of the death penalty by \n     that State is consistent with constitutional requirements of \n     fairness, justice, equality, and due process.\n\n           TITLE II--NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n     SEC. 201.

A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States which requires (except during time of \nwar and subject to suspension by the Congress) that the total amount of \nmoney expended by the United States during any fiscal year not exceed \nthe amount of certain revenue received by the United States during such \nfiscal year and not exceed 20 per centum of the gross national product \nof the United States during the previous calender year; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                            budget amendment\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a balanced \nbudget\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\namendment to the Constitution. This is the same amendment which I have \nintroduced in every Congress since the 97th Congress. Throughout my \nentire tenure in Congress, during the good economic times and the bad, \nI have devoted much time and attention to this idea because I believe \nthat the most significant thing that the Federal Government can do to \nenhance the lives of all Americans and future generation is to ensure \nthat we have a balanced Federal budget.\n  Our Founding Fathers, wise men indeed, had great concerns regarding \nthe capability of those in government to operate within budgetary \nconstraints. Alexander Hamilton once wrote that ``* * * there is a \ngeneral propensity in those who govern, founded in the constitution of \nman, to shift the burden from the present to a future day.'' Thomas \nJefferson commented on the moral significance of this ``shifting of the \nburden from the present to the future.'' He said: ``the question \nwhether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it \nimposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the \nfundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves \nunauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to \npay them ourselves.''\n  I completely agree with these sentiments. History has shown that \nHamilton was correct. Those who govern have in fact saddled future \ngenerations with the responsibility of paying for their debts. For a \nlarge part of the past 30 years, annual deficits became routine and the \nfederal government built up massive debt. Furthermore, I believe that \nJefferson's assessment of the significance of this is also correct: \nintergenerational debt shifting is morally wrong.\n  Some may find it strange that I am talking about the problems of \nbudget deficits and the need for a balanced budget amendment at a time \nwhen the budget is actually in balance. However, I raise this issue \nnow, as I have time and time again in the past, because of the seminal \nimportance involved in establishing a permanent mechanism to ensure \nthat our annual federal budget is always balanced. Without such an \namendment there is a no guarantee that the budget will remain balanced.\n  A permanently balanced budget would have a considerable impact in the \neveryday lives of the American people. A balanced budget would \ndramatically lower interest rates thereby saving money for anyone with \na home mortgage, a student loan, a car loan, credit card debt, or any \nother interest rate sensitive payment responsibility. Simply by \nbalancing its books, the Federal Government would put real money into \nthe hands of hard working people. In all practical sense, the effect of \nsuch fiscal responsibility on the part of the government would be the \nsame as a significant tax cut for the American people. Moreover, if the \ngovernment demand for capital is reduced, more money would be available \nfor private sector use, which in turn, would generate substantial \neconomic growth and create thousands of new jobs. More money in the \npockets of Americans, more job creation by the economy, a simple step \ncould make this reality-a balanced budget amendment. Furthermore, a \nbalanced budget amendment would also provide the discipline to keep us \non the course towards reducing our massive national debt.\n  Currently, the Federal Government pays hundreds of billions of \ndollars in interest payments on the debt each year. This means we spend \nbillions of dollars each year on exactly, nothing. At the end of the \nyear we have nothing of substance to show for these expenditures. These \nexpenditures do not provide better educations for our children, they do \nnot make our Nation safer, they do not further important medical \nresearch, they do not build new roads. They do nothing but pay the \nobligations created by the fiscal irresponsibility of those who came \nearlier. In the end, we need to ensure that we continue on the road to \na balanced budget so that we can end the wasteful practice of making \ninterest payments on the deficit.\n  However, opponents of a balanced budget amendment act like it is \nsomething extraordinary. In reality, a balanced budget amendment will \nonly require the government to do what every American already has to \ndo: balance their checkbook. It is simply a promise to the American \npeople, and more importantly, to future generations of Americans, that \nthe government will act responsibility.\n  Thankfully the budget is currently balanced. However, there are no \nguarantees that it will stay as such. We could see dramatic changes in \neconomic conditions. The drain on the government caused by the \nretirement of the Baby Boomers may exceed expectations. Future leaders \nmay fall pray to the ``general propensity * * * to shift the burden'' \nthat Alexander Hamilton wrote about so long ago. We need to establish \nguarantees for future generations. The balanced budget amendment is the \nbest such mechanism available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \na Senate resolution which designates August 16, 2001 as ``National \nAirborne Day.''\n  On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test \nPlatoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The \nParachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed \nthe first official army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success \nof the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne \ncontingent that has served from World War Two until the present.\n  I was privileged to serve with the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the \nfirst airborne divisions to be organized. In a two-year period during \nWorld War Two, the regiments of the 82nd served in Italy at Anzio, in \nFrance at Normandy (where I landed with them), and at the Battle of the \nBulge.\n  The 11th, 13th, 17th, and 101st Airborne Divisions and numerous other \nregimental and battalion size airborne units were also organized \nfollowing the success of the Parachute Test Platoon. In the last sixty \nyears, these airborne forces have performed in important military and \npeace-keeping operations all over the world, and it is only fitting \nthat we honor them.\n  Through passage of ``National Airborne Day'', the Senate will \nreaffirm our support for the members of the airborne community and also \nshow our gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's \ndefense and ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S929-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, the position of United States Attorney \nGeneral is the most sensitive in the executive branch.\n  I have made a practice of setting a different standard for approval \nof persons nominated to serve in the president's cabinet and those the \npresident has chosen for federal judgeships.\n  In the former instance, there is a very strong presumption that the \npresident should have the right to choose whomever he feels would \neffectively carry out his administration's policies.\n  With a federal judge nominee, that presumption is lessened. Federal \njudges serve not at the pleasure of the president, but rather for a \nlifetime and represent the third, equal branch of government.\n  I place the appointment of an attorney general in between these two \nstandards because of the office's unique role.\n  The attorney general has far more autonomy than does any other \ncabinet head. The attorney general decides when and how to take legal \naction and use government resources supplied by taxpayer dollars.\n  Attorneys general do not just enforce the law. They have broad \ndiscretion to interpret the law, then enforce it based on that \ninterpretation. Traditionally, the attorney general does not attend \npolitical functions or otherwise engage in partisan politics to \npreserve the appearance of neutrality.\n  Rarely does the president interfere in the realm of the attorney \ngeneral--a notable exception being when Attorney General Elliot \nRichardson resigned to avoid complying with President Nixon's order to \nfire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate burglary. More \noften, the president consults the attorney general for legal counsel \nand follows that advice. The attorney general's interpretations then \nbecome government policy.\n\n  Interpretation of a law by a United States attorney general has been \nresponsible for some of this country's proudest moments, and some of \nits most shameful. It was a United States attorney general, in the \ncabinet of President Martin Van Buren, who argued that the men and \nwomen who had rebelled against their slave masters on the Spanish ship \nAmistad, were property and should be returned to captivity.\n  It was also the interpretation of civil rights statutes that led \nAttorney General Robert Kennedy to use federal troops to desegregate \nschools. Kennedy also chose to use the government's resources to ensure \nthe right of African-Americans to vote--filing more than 50 law suits \nin four states that were resisting change.\n  In large part because of this legacy, the attorney general has come \nto be seen as the primary defender of individuals' basic civil rights.\n  Because of this protective role, and because of the discretionary \nnature of the job, the attorney general must be a person who commands \nthe respect of all people in the country. That doesn't mean that \neveryone has to agree with everything the attorney general has done in \nthe past.\n  But the attorney general must be able to carry out the covenant with \nAmerica that comes with the job--the agreement to look at the law with \nan unbiased eye and enforce it without personal or political prejudice.\n  I submitted questions to Senator Ashcroft to help me ascertain his \nlevel of commitment to that covenant. Specifically, I am concerned \nabout the investigation by the Department of Justice Civil Rights \nDivision into allegations of discrimination in the November 7, 2000 \nelection in Florida. These are serious allegations. These are not about \nchads, or butterflies or any of the other arcane voting terms that have \nmade their way into the wider American lexicon. These are about \nAmericans and their fundamental rights. These must be investigated by \nsomeone who has the trust and confidence of the public.\n\n  Investigations are now being conducted by the Department of Justice's \nCivil Rights division and the United States Commission on Civil Rights.\n  The focus of these investigations is to determine whether these \nindividual acts, which denied citizens the right to vote, were just \nthat--individual acts of incompetence and inefficiency--or whether they \nrepresented a conscious pattern intended to deny thousands of \nFloridians the right to vote.\n  Allow me to share a few of the allegations. Donnise DeSouza, a Miami \nattorney, wanted to teach her 5-year-old son about democracy by letting \nhim punch her ballot. Instead she was told her name was not on the \nproper list, and was sent home without having cast a vote.\n  Ernest Duval is a Haitian American who lives in Palm Beach County. \nHe, like many others, found the ballot layout confusing. He punched the \nwrong hole, recognized his mistake, and asked for a new ballot. His \nrequest was denied. He was left with no choice but to repunch the \noriginal. His ballot became an official ``overvote'' and was discarded. \nHe told the NAACP ``I left Haiti for the freedom to live in a free \nland. We have the right to choose the right person.''\n  Radio host Stacey Powers visited polling sites to encourage African-\nAmerican voters and saw police officers harassing an elderly African-\nAmerican man for doing nothing more than being in the neighborhood. \nAfter she reported it on the air, a police car followed her for five \nand a half miles.\n  These were not just the complaints of a few disenfranchised or \nintimidated voters. In an operation of this scale, reasonable people \nrecognize that unfortunate mistakes will happen. But on Election Day, \ncomplaints came from every corner of the state.\n  Voters in the City of Plantation were never notified that their \npolling place, Plantation Elementary School, had been demolished two \nweeks before Election Day. Reports were made of police officers' \nblocking roads in close proximity to polling places and of minority \nvoters being forced to show identification that white voters didn't \nneed to have. Phones in a number of minority precincts were not \nworking, leaving precinct workers unable to call central election \noffices for help with broken machines and other problems.\n  Just as troubling was the information that came out after the \nelection. Statistical analyses by civil rights groups and news \norganizations suggest that outdated or dilapidated voting equipment was \nmost likely to be found in areas with a high concentration of minority \nvoters. And so it followed that minorities were far more likely to have \ntheir votes thrown out than were white Florida voters.\n  The question that remains is whether these were isolated, though \nwidespread\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nincidences, or if there is a broad, systematic pattern of discouraging \nor preventing minority votes.\n  If these allegations are swept under the rug, if they go without a \nthorough review--and prosecutions if necessary--there will be a \npermanent scar on the face of our democracy. These allegations are \ngermane to these proceedings because the attorney general, by \ncongressional statute, has almost total discretion to enforce federal \nvoting rights laws.\n\n  The attorney general will decide how the investigation into these \nallegations proceeds--if it does at all--and what will come of the \nfindings.\n  I asked Senator Ashcroft several questions to further understand his \ncommitment to this investigation: Whether he could assure us that such \nan investigation could be completed in a timely matter. What was his \nplan of action for remedies if violations of the Voting Rights Act are \nidentified? Would he consider appropriate decertification of all punch-\ncard voting methods and other unreliable methods, or discontinue purges \nof the voter registration rolls until procedures are put in place to \nensure that such purges are done in a uniform and non-discriminatory \nfashion? If the United States Commission on Civil Rights does discover \ninstances of voter disenfranchisement, will the Department of Justice \nexpand its investigation and aggressively prosecute violations of the \nVoting Rights Act? How will the Department of Justice use information \nfrom this election to make sure discrimination is not given free reign \nin the future?\n  In answering my questions, Senator Ashcroft said the right thing, but \ndid so in a perfunctory manner. The answers were long on platitudes, \nshort on specificity. He did not present a course of action in pursuit \nof the truth, nor offer potential solutions.\n  Had these answers been the only information available about Senator \nAshcroft's commitment to civil rights, I may have accepted them on \ntheir face and approved this nomination.\n  But Senator Ashcroft has a long record of public service that \nsuggests enforcement of civil rights is not his highest priority. My \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee raised questions about several of \nthese incidents. I share their concern. I also believe, as his \nsupporters have said, that Senator Ashcroft has a good heart and that \nhe is a man of integrity.\n\n  I hope that my apprehensions about Senator Ashcroft turn out to have \nbeen unwarranted and that if confirmed, as I assume he will be, he will \nprove me wrong by carrying on a full, fair hearing of the allegations \nraised by thousands of Floridians.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to acknowledge my mistake. But I am \nnot prepared to take the risk that Senator Ashcroft's longstanding \npractice of not defending the civil rights of minorities will be \nprologue to his policies as attorney general.\n  Since the birth of this country people have died fighting for the \nright to vote. Our own American Revolution was about lack of \nrepresentation, lack of voice and choice in governance. Nearly two \ncenturies later Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney, \nwere brutally murdered for trying to register African-Americans to \nvote.\n  More recently, Americans have been lulled into complacency about \nvoting rights. We seem to believe that if there are no obvious \ndeterrents to voting, like poll taxes, then there are no voting-rights \nviolations.\n  The events of the past election should wake us up. The right to vote \ncan be violated by armed men lurking menacingly at the door of the \npolling place.\n  The right to vote can also be stolen by antiquated voting equipment \nand careless or discriminatory purging of the voter rolls. Coupled with \nhis record, Senator Ashcroft's answers to my inquiries do not convince \nme of a genuine commitment to a forceful investigation and follow-up \naction of voting-rights violations in Florida.\n  I am not confident that action will follow words. Therefore, I will \nvote ``no'' on the confirmation of John Ashcroft for United States \nAttorney General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/31/senate-section/article/S931-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
