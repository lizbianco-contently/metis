Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider the nominations of \nDonald H. Rumsfeld to be Secretary of Defense, Colin L. Powell to be \nSecretary of State, Paul H. O'Neill to be Secretary of the Treasury, \nAnn Veneman to be Secretary of Agriculture, Donald L. Evans to be \nSecretary of Commerce, Rod Paige to be Secretary of Education, and \nSpencer Abraham to be Secretary of Energy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I further ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the \nnominations be considered en bloc and disposed of en bloc, that each \nnomination be considered separately in the Record, and following the \nconfirmations the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that the \nPresident be immediately notified that the Senate has given its consent \nto these nominations, and the Senate then return to legislative \nsession.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President,\n  I wish the Record to reflect that with regard to the nomination of \nSpencer Abraham to be Secretary of Energy, I am voting in the negative. \nI appreciate the fact that we need a Secretary of Energy immediately \nbecause of the dire energy crisis in the State of California. My \nobjection to Secretary designee Abraham's nomination is based on the \ntroubling record Mr. Abraham has established on nuclear waste. This \nobjection is based on a difference of opinion over this matter. Indeed, \nI had the honor of serving in this body with Spencer Abraham in his \ncapacity as a Senator from Michigan. I know him to be a decent and \nhonorable man who served with distinction.\n  As a Senator from Michigan, however, he voted repeatedly to ship \nnuclear waste to the State of Nevada despite the overwhelming evidence \nthat such a move was being made without regard for sound science and \npublic health and safety. He voted to ship nuclear waste to Nevada \nnotwithstanding the fact that there is no safe route for the \ntransportation of high level nuclear waste through the states and \ncities and towns of America. He supported an industry backed bill that \nwould have expedited delivery of nuclear waste to Nevada on an \n``interim'' basis. He even supported overriding President Clinton's \nveto of a bill which would have greatly weakened the EPA's role in \nestablishing the appropriate radiation standards at Yucca Mountain.\n  The decision on the designation of a permanent nuclear waste \nrepository rests with the Secretary of Energy. This decision, and \nothers relating to Yucca Mountain, must be made absent bias. \nRegrettably, Secretary designee Abraham's record as a Senator and his \ntestimony before the Energy Committee as a nominee lead me to believe \nthat he may not be capable of such impartiality on this very important \nissue.\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to give my strongest \nrecommendation for the confirmation of the nomination of Donald H. \nRumsfeld to be Secretary of Defense.\n  On December 28, 2000, then President-elect Bush announced his \nintention to nominate former-Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, a man I \nhave known for more than 20 years, to be his Secretary of Defense. I \nsupport this nomination, and I am pleased that the President decided to \nrecommend him for this important position.\n  Don Rumsfeld served as Secretary of Defense for President Ford from \n1975 to 1977. I am confident that he will, once again, be a competent, \ntrustworthy, effective Secretary of Defense. He has the experience, \nknowledge, skill and ability to oversee the best--the largest--military \nforce in the world. His challenge will be to prepare that force for \nmissions in the ever-growing, increasingly complex threat environment \nof the 21st century. He must ``jump start'' the pace of transition from \ncold war thinking to new thinking.\n  Don Rumsfeld has been extremely successful in the business world in \nthe years since he last served as Secretary of Defense. He has served \nas the chief executive officer of G.D. Searle and Company, a worldwide \npharmaceutical company, and as chairman and chief executive officer of \nGeneral Instrument Corporation, a leader in broadband and digital, \nhigh-definition television technology. While leading these major \nprivate-sector businesses, he continued his public service by serving \nin a variety of Federal posts and as a member of several commissions.\n  Many Senators are familiar with the excellent work Secretary Rumsfeld \nhas done on both the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat \nto the United States, which issued its report in 1998, and the \nCommission to Assess United States National Security Space Management \nand Organization, which issued its report on January 11, 2001.\n  President Bush has articulated a vision for the U.S. military and has \nset three broad goals for national defense: first, to renew the bond of \ntrust between the President and the military; second, to defend the \nAmerican people against missiles and terror; and third, to begin \ncreating the military of the next century. I know that Don Rumsfeld is \ncommitted to these goals as well.\n  In a speech at the Citadel in September 1999, then-Governor Bush \nsaid, ``Those who want to lead America accept two obligations. One is \nto use our military power wisely, remembering the costs of war. The \nother is to honor our commitments to veterans who have paid those \ncosts.'' I doubt that any Member of the Senate would take exception \nwith those obligations. Don Rumsfeld will certainly accept these \nobligations with enthusiasm.\n  Public service is a demanding vocation for the family as well as the \nnominee. I want to express my personal appreciation to Mrs. Joyce \nRumsfeld for rededicating herself to public service as well. The Nation \nwill never fully appreciate the sacrifices spouses, such as Joyce \nRumsfeld, make supporting those who serve our country.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend my friend and colleague, Senator \nLevin, for the manner in which, as the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, he dealt with this nomination. Chairman Levin and I worked \ntogether very closely as the committee considered the nomination in a \ndeliberate and timely manner.\n  I support this nomination. I urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination as well. Secretary Rumsfeld will be a crucial part of the \ngreat national security team that President Bush has assembled.\n  The nominations were considered and confirmed, as follows:\n\n                       Department of Agriculture\n\n       Ann Margaret Veneman, of California, to be Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n\n                         Department of Defense\n\n       Donald Henry Rumsfeld, of Illinois, to be Secretary of \n     Defense.\n\n                         Department of Commerce\n\n       Donald Louis Evans, of Texas, to be Secretary of Commerce.\n\n                          Department of Energy\n\n       Spencer Abraham, of Michigan, to be Secretary of Energy.\n\n                       Department of the Treasury\n\n       Paul Henry O'Neill, of Pennsylvania, to be Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n\n                          Department of State\n\n       Colin Luther Powell, of Virginia, to be Secretary of State.\n\n                        Department of Education\n\n       Roderick R. Paige, of Texas, to be Secretary of Education.\n\n\n                              nominations\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I said on January 3 that I intended to \nsavor every one of the next 17 days. And I am pleased to tell you, I \ndid.\n  In fact, I called my office this morning just to hear the \nreceptionist say--one last time--``Majority Leader's Office.'' I did it \nagain this morning.\n  It was an honor to serve as majority leader of this Senate--even if \nonly for 17 days.\n  In the spirit of bipartisanship, I want to say to my friend, Senator \nLott that if he every needs to take a day off--for any reason--I'll be \nhappy to fill in for him.\n  I also want to thank my fellow Democratic Senators--particularly our \ncommittee chairs.\n  It's been a while since a Democratic Senator had banged a chairman's \ngavel around here.\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n  But you never would have known it to see them in action.\n  One measure of their dedication is the fact that we are here today to \nconfirm the first seven of President Bush's Cabinet nominees.\n  Every other Cabinet nominee has gotten, or is getting, a fair \nhearing.\n  Something else happened during these last 17 days: We reached a \nhistoric agreement to share responsibility in America's first-ever 50/\n50 Senate.\n  I want to thank Senator Lott again, and commend him for having the \nfaith and the courage to do the right and fair thing.\n  Today, I hand the title of Majority Leader back to him.\n  And that's just fine.\n  As Thomas Jefferson said: ``I like the dream of the future better \nthan the history of the past.''\n  Today, as President Bush begins his Presidency, we wish him well. We \nwant to work with him to make a better future--for all Americans.\n  To the cynics who say that's not possible, let me point out seven \nreasons for hope: Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul O'Neill, Don \nEvans, Spence Abraham, Ann Veneman, and Rod Paige.\n  I'd like to say a few words about each of these extraordinary men and \nwomen.\n\nColin Powell:\n  I told Colin Powell earlier this week that he has lots of admirers on \nboth sides of the aisle here, and I consider myself one of the biggest. \nAmerica is fortunate to have him as our ambassador to the world.\n  General Powell has spent his entire adult life serving this nation. \nHe started in the Army as a second lieutenant in June 1958 and spent \nthe next 35 years as a professional soldier. He eventually rose to \nbecome Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--the highest military \nassignment at the Pentagon--and National Security Adviser to President \nReagan. He received many awards, including: the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal with 3 oak leaf clusters, the Army Distinguished Service \nMedal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the \nLegion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Soldier's Medal, the Bronze \nStar, and the Purple Heart.\n  In 1993, General Powell retired from the Army and found a new way to \nserve his country: as chairman of America's Promise--The Alliance for \nYouth.\n  The world has changed dramatically since Colin Powell first put on an \nArmy uniform. I was reminded of that again a few days ago when I read a \nnewspaper article about police officer in Sioux Falls by the name of \nGreg Schmit. Officer Schmit and 10 other police officers throughout \nAmerica recently returned from Russia.\n  They went to Russia as part of a State Department program to train \nRussian police in Western policing methods. They didn't go out of some \nmisguided idealism. They went because it is in America's national \nsecurity interest to help foster the rule of law and a professional \npolice force in Russia.\n\n  I mention this because I believe there are parallels between what \nOfficer Schmit and his colleagues did, and what Secretary Powell can, \nand must, do as Secretary of State.\n  The threats to world peace are different today than when Colin Powell \nfirst joined the Army--but they are no less dangerous.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has turned what used \nto be regional conflicts into potential global catastrophes.\n  New technologies and more open societies have enabled drug \ntraffickers and other criminals to expand their activities--threatening \nAmerican citizens and democratic advances worldwide.\n  Abandoning our responsibilities as a world leader will not protect us \nfrom the threats in today's world. But it would deprive us of the \nbenefits.\n  We must not fall for the false security of isolationism.\n  We must remain engaged in the world.\n  Protecting America's interests and promoting the causes of peace and \ndemocracy throughout the world will require a team effort.\n  I can think of no one better-suited to head that team than Colin \nPowell.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld:\n  Joining Secretary Powell on that team is an outstanding leader who \nhas also had a long and distinguished career inside and outside of \ngovernment: Donald Rumsfeld.\n  As Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld will lead 1.5 million active \nduty personnel, nearly 1 million reserve personnel and more than \n800,000 full-time civilian employees. And he will encounter new and \nunconventional threats that defy conventional solutions.\n  Clearly, these are daunting challenges. But Don Rumsfeld is well-\nqualified to meet them.\n  A graduate of Princeton University, he served three years as a U.S. \nNavy aviator before being elected in 1962--at the age of 30--to the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  In 1969, he resigned from Congress to work for President Nixon, and \nstayed to work for President Ford.\n  In 1975 he was confirmed by the Senate to serve as our 13th and \nyoungest Secretary of Defense.\n  Two years later, he began a 20-year career in the private sector. But \nhe continued to answer the call of public duty, serving as President \nReagan's Special Envoy for the Middle East and chairman of the \nCommission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States.\n  I look forward to working with both Secretary Powell and Secretary \nRumsfeld.\n  There are five areas in particular where I hope we can build \nbipartisan support:\n  First: In recent years, the U.S. has worked with NATO to end ethnic \ncleansing in the former Yugoslavia and restore stability to \nsoutheastern Europe. In East Asia, we worked with our Korean and \nJapanese allies to diminish North Korea's nuclear threat and come \nwithin striking distance of an agreement to halt that country's missile \nprogram. We must not threaten these and other critical alliances by \nrushing to disengage from successful efforts in the Balkans and \nelsewhere.\n  Second: We must also avoid threatening our friends--and our enemies--\nunnecessarily by rushing too quickly to deploy a national missile \ndefense. President Bush has said he is committed to deploying such a \nsystem, and Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld also have expressed support \nfor it.\n  Let me be clear: Democrats also support ballistic missile defense \nsystem--as long as it meets four essential criteria. It must be \naffordable and effective, it must meet the threat, and it must not \ndamage relations with our allies. In short, it must make us more \nsecure, not less.\n  Third: We want to work with Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld, and with \nPresident Bush, to build bipartisan support for the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  I will not dwell here on the lengths to which CTBT opponents went in \nthe last Congress to tilt the playing field--both procedurally and \nsubstantively. Suffice it to say that this important treaty did not get \nthe fair and full hearing it should have, and the Senate failed to \nratify it.\n  General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, said recently: ``(t)he advantages of the Test Ban Treaty \noutweigh any disadvantages, and thus . . . ratification would increase \nnational security.'' I hope the Bush administration will pay close \nattention.\n  Fourth: We must maintain our support for efforts to control the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction, such as the Cooperative Threat \nReduction program--better known as ``the Nunn-Lugar program.'' This \nprogram enables us to work with Russia to reduce its nuclear arsenal. \nIt has led to the destruction of thousands of Russian nuclear weapons \nand weapons platforms. It has also resulted in tighter security at \nRussian nuclear weapons development and production facilities.\n\n  It is hard to imagine a better investment in our national security. \nWe must maintain it.\n  Fifth: Our diplomatic corps will always be our first line of defense. \nWe must make sure it has the resources it needs to do its job well.\n  At the same time, we must make it clear to our friends and our \nenemies alike that, if America's values and interests are threatened, \nand if diplomacy fails, we will use force.\n  We must maintain America's role as a global leader.\n\nPaul O'Neill:\n  To do that, we must maintain our fiscal discipline.\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\n  Paul O'Neill, our next Secretary of the Treasury, understands that.\n  Like Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld, he comes to his post with a \nlong and impressive record of achievement in both the private and \npublic sectors.\n  He has been a tremendously successful CEO of a major American \ncorporation, Alcoa, which operates worldwide and has thrived in the \nglobal economy under his leadership.\n  He has earned the respect of Wall Street--and Alcoa employees.\n  George Becker is president of the Steelworkers Union. Listen to what \nhe had to say about Paul O'Neill--quote: ``Most of our relationships \nwith employers are confrontational by nature. but we found that Paul \nhad very keen interest on the side of working people.''\n  His predecessors in the current Administration--Lloyd Bentsen, Bob \nRubin, and Larry Summers--played critical roles in restoring the fiscal \nstrength of the United States and in responding to financial crises \naround the globe. As a result--in significant measure--of their insight \nand actions, the new Treasury Secretary will inherit a remarkably \nstrong fiscal situation.\n  In his new office, I hope Secretary O'Neill will remember how hobbled \nour economy was a decade ago, and how hard Americans worked to put our \neconomy back on sound financial footing. I also hope he will look to \nthe future.\n  In less than a decade, the first Baby Boomers will retire. We want to \nwork with Secretary O'Neill, President Bush, and our Republican \ncolleagues to prepare for the Baby Boomers' retirement now, while we \nstill have the time, so we can avoid a crisis down the road.\n  We can afford to cut taxes. We can afford to provide to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare. But we must not go too far. We \ncannot afford to return to fiscal irresponsibility and weakness. \nThere's a better way. Together, we can find it.\n\nDon Evans:\n  Maintaining fiscal discipline is the key to keeping our economy \nstrong.\n  We must also continue to help American businesses and entrepreneurs \ngrow and create new jobs, and continue to seek out new markets for \nAmerican good and services--at home and abroad.\n  That will be the job of President Bush's new Commerce Secretary. And \nhe is well-prepared to take it on.\n  Mr. Evans understands that we live in a global economy, and that \nerecting trade barriers between countries is the wrong approach.\n  As someone from a rural state, I particularly appreciate his \ncommitment to promote access to the newest technologies in rural \nAmerica.\n  We are ready to work with Secretary Evans on all of these priorities.\n  We also want to work with him to keep politics out of the census, so \nthat we can get an accurate count of America's population.\n\nSpencer Abraham:\n  These last couple of weeks have provided dramatic reminders of how \nessential affordable, reliable energy supplies are to our nation.\n\n  In California, rolling energy blackouts have forced temporary \nshutdowns of Silicon Valley computer giants, and turned off traffic \nlights at the height of rush-hour.\n  In South Dakota and many other states, soaring oil and natural gas \nprices are making it harder for families to heat their homes, and \neating into business profits.\n  As Secretary of Energy, Spence Abraham is the person to whom America \nwill look for solutions to our nation's pressing energy needs.\n  He is also the person most responsible for ensuring the safety and \nsecurity of our nation's nuclear stockpile, storing and cleaning up \nnuclear waste, and overseeing critical research at our national energy \nlabs.\n  I am confident that Secretary Abraham is ready for these difficult \ntasks.\n  He showed during his six years in the Senate that he is willing to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion. I look forward to continuing to work with \nhim in his new capacity.\n  I am especially interested in working with him to promote the use of \nrenewable energy sources such as wind and ethanol, and providing \nincentives for improved energy efficiency.\n  By using our resources wisely, we can reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and ensure the stability of our economy.\n\nAnn Veneman:\n  The Department of Agriculture is charge with the oversight of a wide \nrange of policy areas--from commodity programs and trade to food \nsafety, from natural resources and forestry management to nutrition \nprograms.\n  I am confident that Ann Veneman has the breadth of experience and \nknowledge to ensure Americans are very well served in all of these \nareas.\n  Ms. Veneman has a long history of public service.\n  In 1991, Agriculture Secretary Madigan tapped her to be Deputy \nSecretary at USDA. She was the first women ever to be appointed to that \nposition. But what people know her for was her significant \ncontributions to the GATT Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture, \nfrom which we continue to benefit.\n  In 1995, Governor Wilson appointed her to be Secretary of Agriculture \nin California.\n  She was the first woman to serve as Agriculture Secretary in \nCalifornia. While there, she pursued a strong and varied agenda that \nincluded opening new markets for trade and making significant \nimprovements in California's food safety system.\n  With this nomination, Ms. Veneman will be the first woman United \nStates Secretary of Agriculture. She brings considerable strengths to \nthis post, and we are confident that we will take major strides in farm \npolicy with her at the helm.\n\nRoderick Paige:\n  Finally, I want to commend President Bus for choosing Dr. Roderick \nPaige as his Secretary of Education. As superintendent of the Houston \nIndependent School District and before that, as a member of Houston's \nschool board, Dr. Paige has shown that he believes every child deserves \nan opportunity to attend a good public school.\n  During his nearly seven years as superintendent, Houston saw \nsignificant gains in the numbers of 10th graders passing Texas' basic \nskills test--especially among minority students.\n  Dr. Paige understands from personal experience the many challenges \nfacing America's public schools, the men and women who work in them, \nand the children who depend on them.\n  He has earned the support and admiration of a wide variety of \neducation professionals. He has earned this nomination. I look forward \nto working closely with him to help President Bush fulfill his pledge \nto leave no child behind.\n  Again, I commend President Bush for sending us seven such strong \nnominees. I urge my colleagues to support all of them. And I look \nforward to working with each of them to make that dream of a better \nfuture, that Thomas Jefferson wrote about, a reality.\n\n\n                       nomination of colin powell\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President I rise today to offer my unequivocal \nsupport for the nomination of General Colin Powell as our Secretary of \nState. Colin Powell's experience as a soldier, a public servant, and a \ncivilian leader will serve him well in overcoming the challenges ahead.\n  Americans should know that we could not ask for any person with \nbetter preparation, more knowledge, or greater skills to take the helm \nof U.S. foreign policy and its diplomatic corps at this time in our \nhistory.\n  As a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Powell \nfully understands the role of the military in the implementation of \nforeign policy. He also understands that a powerful military can be \neroded through misuse. The use of force should be the last resort, not \nthe first best solution to failed diplomacy.\n  As General Powell stated in his testimony before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the United States' challenge is one of leadership. \nU.S. power--military, economic, and diplomatic--is unparalleled. We \nmust use such power judiciously. And we must apply the appropriate type \nof power in the right situations to shape a more peaceful and \nprosperous world.\n  But first we must know and clearly define our objectives.\n  President Bush stated that U.S. foreign policy was ``like a cork in a \ncurrent being swept from crisis to crisis. I believe this image \naccurately depicts the struggle over the last several years with the \nlack of a clearly formulated and executed foreign policy.\n  Many recognize, and General Powell addressed this also in his \ntestimony,\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\nthat the world we live in has radically changed in the last decade. We \nno longer face an ideological foe. We no longer live with the threat of \nannihilation from Soviet nuclear forces.\n  But the world today is not peaceful. The end of the Cold War \nstalemate unleashed forces of change. These forces of change couple \nwith unprecedented technological advances have fundamentally altered \nthe global landscape. The threats we face are diffuse, and many tools \nof the Cold War era prove insufficient in countering these new threats.\n  These new challenges--from cyber-terrorism to AIDS in Africa to \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction--will require new \napproaches and better coordination between our federal agencies. The \nBush Administration is bringing together the most talented and \nexperienced Cabinet in recent years to tackle these problems.\n  Colin Powell brings the leadership skills and commands the respect \nnecessary to initiate needed changes, renew our diplomatic corps, \nclearly define our national interests and implement policies to achieve \nU.S. objectives. I look forward to working with Secretary Powell in my \nrole as Chairman of the Budget Committee to give him the means \nnecessary to address the State Department's needs.\n  Mr. President, in closing I would like to thank General Powell for \nhis willingness to, once again, serve the American people.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my enthusiastic support \nfor the nomination of Colin L. Powell to be the next United States \nSecretary of State--a view that I believe is unanimous in this body. \nThe reasons are obvious. General Powell is a distinguished American who \nwill bring credit to the Bush administration and our country over the \nnext four years. He is without doubt extremely well qualified by \nexperience and temperament to represent our nation as its chief \ndiplomat and foreign policy spokesman.\n  I know a number of my colleagues have already gone on at length about \nthe distinguished record of public service that General Powell has \nperformed during his thirty-five years of military service before \nretiring, in 1993, from his post as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. In the interest of time, I will simply associate myself with \ntheir remarks in noting that General Powell's record of public service \nis truly impressive. I would point out, however that the various \npositions he has held over the years have prepared him well to assume \nhis new responsibilities as Secretary of State.\n  And, as if his years of public service were not enough, General \nPowell continued to serve his country and community in ``retirement.'' \nHe agreed to chair President Clinton's Summit for America's Future in \n1997 and founded and chaired America's Promise--The Alliance for Youth, \na non-profit organization dedicated to strengthening the character and \ncompetence of America's young people. General Powell's efforts to raise \nthe profile of such an important issue, one that goes to the very \nfabric of our society, have clearly begun to bear fruit. As a Senator \nwith a particular interest in the welfare of our children, I hope that \nAmerica's Promise will continue its important work now that General \nPowell has a new ``day job.''\n  General Powell has now agreed to take on yet another assignment for \nthe American people, this time as our country's chief diplomat and \ninternational spokesman. There is no doubt in my mind that he will do a \nsuperb job as Secretary of State. While some of President Bush's recent \nappointments have provoked controversy, the Rumsfeld/Powell--Defense/\nForeign Policy team has strong bipartisan support in Congress and has \nbeen welcomed by the American people. I want to commend President Bush \nfor his wise choice in asking General Powell to join his \nadministration, and I want to personally thank General Powell for his \nwillingness to once again answer the call of public service to his \ncountry. No one would have begrudged him had he said, ``thanks but no \nthanks.'' His commitment and service to our country is truly \nextraordinary.\n  Let me also say for the record that General Powell's recent \npredecessors, Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher have also \ndistinguished themselves during their tenures and have left the world a \nbetter place for their efforts. I want to thank them for their service \nto our country and wish them well in their future endeavors.\n  On Thursday, I had the privilege of questioning General Powell at his \nnomination hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee. While we did \nnot agree on every topic discussed, it was clear to me that General \nPowell has taken his nomination seriously and has educated himself on \nall aspects of foreign policy. He listened to every question \nattentively and answered every query thoughtfully. I was heartened in \nparticular by the high priority he has placed on ensuring that adequate \nresources are made available to the State Department to make it \npossible for our diplomatic responsibilities to be effectively \ndischarged around the world. In his prepared statement. General Powell \nalso outlined his view of the world and emphasized that the United \nStates cannot suddenly isolate itself from the global community. \nMoreover, he reiterated the necessity of the United States remaining \nengaged internationally in order to build upon the successes of \nprevious administrations.\n  I took the opportunity to question General Powell at length on issues \nof special concern to me. He pledged to continue to monitor the Irish \nand Middle East peace processes, and while I know we have a difference \nof opinion on this issue, he did not reject outright the idea of an \nInternational Criminal Court, although he made clear his concerns with \nthe treaty as currently drafted. Furthermore, I was extremely pleased \nto hear that President Bush has pledged to take a more active role in \nforeign policy with respect to strengthening our relations with \ncountries in our own hemisphere. Many of my colleagues know of my \ninterest in this region. I had numerous questions for General Powell on \na wide range of topics of interest in Latin America--Mexico, Plan \nColombia, our complex relationship with Cuba, the political chaos in \nPeru, and how best to spur democratization in Haiti. While we did not \ndiscuss any of these topics in great depth, it was clear to me that \nGeneral Powell has a clear grasp of the problems extant in this region \nof the world, and I look forward to working with him over the next four \nyears on issues of mutual concern.\n  General Powell demonstrated a willingness to listen to Senators \nthoughts and concerns over the six hours that his hearing lasted. Such \nan attitude can only serve to forge a strong and productive \nrelationship between the State Department and the Senate. At the end of \nthe day, dialogue between the Secretary and the Congress will ensure \nthat the United States foreign policy agenda has strong bipartisan \nsupport here at home. U.S. foreign policy and national security \ninterests will be best served if this proves to be so. If anyone can \nfoster a spirit of bipartisanship in foreign policy, I believe that \nGeneral Powell can. I look forward to working with him on issues of \nmutual interest and concern, and urge my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n\n\n                    nomination of donald h. rumsfeld\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Donald Rumsfeld \nto be Secretary of Defense, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination. It is important for the Senate confirm Mr. Rumsfeld today, \nthe first day of the new administration, so that the new Secretary of \nDefense can assume his position in the chain of command of our armed \nforces.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld is well qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense. He \nhas a distinguished record of public service, and in fact served as \nSecretary of Defense in the last 14 months of President Ford's \nadministration. Since then, he has led several large private sector \ncompanies, while still remaining active in national security policy \nissues. Most recently, he served as Chairman of the U.S. Ballistic \nMissile Threat Commission and the Commission to Assess the United \nStates National Security Space Management and Organization.\n  President Bush announced his intent to nominate Mr. Rumsfeld to be \nSecretary of Defense on December 28. Since then, the Armed Services \nCommittee has conducted the same thorough review of this nomination \nthat we apply to every nomination that comes before the committee. The \nnominee has submitted the required paperwork to the committee, met \napplicable financial disclosure requirements, and pledged to comply \nwith the conflict of\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\ninterest standards of the executive branch and the committee.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld has completed the detailed Armed Services Committee \nquestionnaire that we require of all nominees. He has also responded in \nwriting to an extensive series of policy questions which were \ncirculated to all members of the committee and released to the public.\n  On February 11, the committee conducted a lengthy hearing with the \nnominee. A number of members of the committee submitted additional \nquestions in writing to the nominee at the end of the confirmation \nhearing, and Mr. Rumsfeld has responded to all of those questions.\n  Finally, Senator Warner and I have reviewed the summary of the FBI \nbackground investigation of Mr. Rumsfeld.\n  Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee met and voted unanimously to \nrecommend that the full Senate give its advice and consent to this \nnomination. I ask unanimous consent that a memo that Senator Warner and \nI sent to Senator Daschle and Senator Lott informing them of the \ncommittee's action be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. As Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld will inherit the \nmost dominant military force in the history of the world. Over the last \ntwo decades, our military has incorporated a series of technological \nimprovements that have revolutionized their military capability--from \nprecision-guided munitions and stealth technology to satellite \nreconnaissance and electronic warfare capabilities. Today, each of our \nmilitary services is more lethal, more maneuverable, more versatile and \nhas greater situational awareness on the battlefield than at any time \nin our history.\n  But this is not a time for us to rest on our past accomplishments. \nThe next administration and the Congress must work together to make \nsure our military is prepared to deal with the new threats to our \nsecurity--particularly the terrorist threat--with new technologies, \nmore mobile forces and improved intelligence capabilities. It is also \nessential that we devote a great deal of energy to combating what I \nbelieve is the greatest single threat to our security in the future--\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, Donald Rumsfeld has a strong commitment to the \nnational security of our country and to the well-being of the men and \nwomen of our armed forces and their families. He is well-qualified to \nlead the Department of Defense. I look forward to working with him in \nhis new position, and I urge the Senate to confirm his nomination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2001.\n     Memorandum to: Senator Daschle and Senator Lott.\n     From: Senator Levin and Senator Warner.\n     Subject: Nomination of Donald H. Rumsfeld to be Secretary of \n       Defense.\n       On December 28, 2000, President-elect Bush announced his \n     intention to nominate Donald H. Rumsfeld to be Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       On January 3, 2001, the Committee on Armed Services \n     forwarded the Committee's nomination questionnaire to \n     Secretary-designate Rumsfeld. The Committee requires each \n     nominee to complete a questionnaire relating to the nominee's \n     qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Mr. \n     Rumsfeld's responses to the questionnaire provided basic \n     biographical and financial information.\n       Pursuant to its normal practice, on January 3, 2001, the \n     Committee submitted a number of advance policy questions to \n     the nominee. Secretary-designate Rumsfeld provided his \n     responses to these questions on January 9, 2001. The \n     questions and Secretary-designate Rumsfeld's responses were \n     made a part of the record of the Committee's nomination \n     hearing.\n       In anticipation of the nomination, the Committee conducted \n     a hearing on January 11, 2001, in public session, to \n     carefully review the credentials of Secretary-designate \n     Rumsfeld. Secretary-designate Rumsfeld was the only witness \n     at this hearing.\n       As part of the confirmation process, the Committee received \n     the nominee's Public Financial Disclosure Report and appended \n     ethics agreement, as well as letters on conflict of interest \n     and related matters from the Director of the Office of \n     Government Ethics and the General Counsel of the Department \n     of Defense. Based on this information, the Committee \n     concludes that the nominee has agreed, upon appointment, to \n     initiate the necessary actions to comply with all applicable \n     laws and regulations regarding conflict of interest.\n       The Committee on Armed Services found Donald H. Rumsfeld to \n     be highly qualified for the position of Secretary of Defense. \n     In an Executive Session on January 19, 2001, the Committee \n     voted unanimously to recommend the Senate provide its advice \n     and consent to the nomination of Mr. Rumsfeld.\n     John Warner,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Carl Levin,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the \nnomination of Donald Rumsfeld as our Secretary of Defense. He will \nbring unparalleled experience, tremendous knowledge, and tactics of no \nfear to a daunting task.\n  Let me briefly describe his task: As Secretary of Defense, Donald \nRumsfeld will be charged with leading the world's most powerful \nmilitary. The U.S. military is the most technologically advanced and \nbest trained in the world. Today, no other nation would take us on \nhead-to-head.\n  But this is also a military machine that suffered years of neglect \nand misuse.\n  Donald Rumsfeld will take charge after the peace dividend has long \nexpired. The motto of doing ``more with less'' is no longer feasible. \nThe fabric of our military forces is stretched so thin as to begin \nunraveling.\n  While U.S. forces have continued to shrink in size, increased \ndeployments and the corresponding operational tempo has eaten away at \nmoral. Plummeting retention and recruitment appears to have been \narrested for the time being, but without acknowledging this situation \nand turning the tide, our military might will wither.\n  In 1975 Donald Rumsfeld had only 14 months to turn the tide before \nJimmy Carter took the election in 1976. In reviewing his achievements \nin that short period, I believe the next four years hold great promise.\n  I would also like to mention some of Donald Rumsfeld's most recent \ncontributions to important national security issues. The Rumsfeld \nCommission's report in the summer of 1999 underscored the heightened \nthreat and accelerated pace of missile programs in nations hostile to \nthe United States. Within a month of the Report's release, North Korea \nproved Rumsfeld right.\n  Donald Rumsfeld also headed the Commission to Assess United States \nNational Security Space Management and Organization. The unanimous \nreport of the Commission was released on January 11--just nine days \nago. The Commission's findings will help inform and guide our national \nspace policy in the coming years.\n  On a more parochial note, Donald Rumsfeld also has a working cattle \nranch in northern New Mexico. He and his wife, Joyce, spend many months \na year there. He is known and admired by many in the local community. \nKnowing the beauty of El Prado as I do, I must say that he is \nsacrificing a great deal to take this job. But knowing Donald Rumsfeld \nalso as I do, he's never shirked in performing his duty to this great \nnation.\n  Donald Rumsfeld brings the necessary experience, leadership ability, \nand esteem to initiate needed changes, reinvigorate our military \nforces, and prepare them for the 21st century. As chairman of the \nBudget Committee and a member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I look forward to working with Secretary Rumsfeld in \nmeeting these challenges.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity on this \nhistoric inauguration day to rise in strong support of the Honorable \nDonald Rumsfeld, President Bush's nominee for Secretary of Defense. In \nmy judgment, Secretary Rumsfeld is eminently qualified for the post, a \nposition he previously held some 25 years ago, and the decisive action \nI believe will be taken on the Senate floor today is a clear indication \nof the strong bipartisan support he has rightfully earned.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has long been a prominent and positive figure in \nAmerican public life. Most recently, he chaired the U.S. Ballistic \nMissile Threat Commission and served as a member of the U.S. Trade \nDeficit Review Commission, positions that both inform his understanding \nand expertise, and demonstrate his diverse\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nbroad-ranging talents. A former naval aviator, Mr. Rumsfeld ably \nrepresented the people of Illinois in the House of Representatives for \nfour terms before joining President Nixon's Cabinet in 1969. He \nfaithfully served this country in a number of capacities, including \nUnited States Ambassador to NATO, White House Chief of Staff and, as I \nnoted, the 13th Secretary of Defense under President Ford from 1975 \nthrough 1977.\n  The Pentagon Mr. Rumsfeld presided presided over in the 1970s was \nvery different from the one he will inherit today. Then, the world was \ndivided by cold war and our nation was divided by the Vietnam war. \nStung by the lessons of Vietnam, the efficacy of our military was in \nquestion. Today, the United States stands as the fortress of democracy \nand a compassionate champion of peace and freedom in an evolving global \nenvironment. Our military is the best equipped, the best trained and \nthe most capable fighting force in the world. The difference between \nthe two eras is profound, but let there be no question: this Secretary \nof Defense is the right person for today and the days to come.\n  We face the world with strength and confidence, ever mindful of the \nchallenges ahead. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the \nthreat of cyber-terrorism, the potential vulnerability of our space-\nbased assets, and the future of theater-wide and global missile defense \nare among our present and future challenges that will require \ninnovative solutions. The health and well-being of our troops and their \nfamilies, and our ability to train and retain the brightest and most \ntalented personnel are persistent concerns that deserve close \nattention. Our commitment to maintaining a technological advantage on \nthe battlefield and equipping our troops with the most advanced, \nreliable, and effective weaponry available must never waver. And we \nmust achieve these objectives while providing the Navy with the \nresources to carry out its expanding and accelerating mission, \ntransforming the Army into a more lethal and mobile force, building the \nAir Force's next generation air-superiority fighter and air-lift \ncapacity, and maintaining the budgetary responsibility that has yielded \nAmerica's strongest fiscal footing in a generation.\n  At this moment of transition, I would also like to commend the \noutgoing Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, on a job well done. He \nwas called ``the right person to secure the bipartisan support \nAmerica's armed forces must have and clearly deserve,'' by President \nClinton in 1997, and I believe his record of service confirms those \nremarks. Secretary Cohen focused on force modernization and troop \nreadiness, and he made improving conditions for the fighting men and \nwomen of this nation the touchstone of his tenure.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld will have a difficult act to follow. The \nchallenges ahead are many. The course laid out by President Bush is \nneither quickly achieved nor easily traversed, but it gives me \nconfidence to know that Donald Rumsfeld has answered the call to serve \nthis nation once more.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to his wife, Joyce, and \nthe Rumsfeld family for the countless sacrifices they will make in \ncourse of his term.\n  In Secretary Rumsfeld, we have found the right person for the job. I \nlook forward to working with him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I had the honor of introducing my \ndistinguished colleague from the Land of Lincoln, Donald Rumsfeld, to \nthe Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing just a little \nover a week ago.\n  I know that Presidents have often complained about the Senate \nconfirmation process. Herbert Hoover, upon the birth of his \ngranddaughter, said ``Thank God she doesn't have to be confirmed by the \nSenate.'' Donald Rumsfeld has so much experience, I am sure he will \nsecure even more votes for his confirmation today than President \nHoover's granddaughter would have if she had required the Senate's \nblessing.\n  Don Rumsfeld's resume is impressive: 4-term Congressman from \nIllinois, Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, US Ambassador \nto NATO, White House Chief of Staff, the youngest-ever Secretary of \nDefense, CEO of several major companies, and a Special Envoy for \nPresident Reagan.\n  We've heard a lot about bipartisanship lately. When Donald Rumsfeld \nrepresented Illinois in the House of Representatives, it was before \nSupreme Court cases that applied the one-person one-vote standard to \nthe drawing of congressional districts. His district was enormous; he \nrepresented 1.1 million people, whereas Sam Rayburn only represented \n89,000. In the Congress that followed his departure to serve in the \nNixon administration, his district was split into two, with one \ndistrict represented by a conservative Republican and one by a liberal \nDemocrat. His ability to serve such a diverse district speaks well of \nhis ability to bridge a Congress and a country almost equally divided.\n  While all Senators may not agree with Mr. Rumsfeld on every issue, he \nhas earned our respect. I may disagree with him on the deployment of a \nnational missile defense system, depending on the plan he supports. I \ncertainly disagree with him about the importance of continuing to \nadhere to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. I believe the treaty \nremains the cornerstone of strategic stability, where he dismisses it \nas ``ancient history.'' However, I am certain that he will conduct a \nthorough and fair review of these issues as Secretary of Defense. It is \nmy hope that we can keep the lines of communication open on these and \nother important defense issues as we address them in the Senate.\n  In fact, Senators may be reluctant to ``go to the mat'' with Mr. \nRumsfeld. Not only was he captain of Princeton University's wrestling \nteam and All Navy Wrestling Champion, he was also inducted into the \nNational Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum. He joins Speaker Hastert as \nanother famous wrestler who hails from Illinois. I, for one, plan to \nkeep in mind that wrestling depends on strategy and making the right \nmove at the right time as much as it does on strength and power.\n  Some of his critics have complained that Mr. Rumsfeld's experience \nwith defense issues is from the bygone cold war era. Those critics \nignore Mr. Rumsfeld's valuable contributions chairing several \ncommissions, including the Ballistic Missile Threat Commission, and \nunderestimate the value of his experience managing major corporations \nin this new economy. Mr. Rumsfeld has kept up and I would challenge his \ncritics to try to keep up with him.\n  In 1775, in our revolutionary era, Patrick Henry said: ``I have but \none lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of \nexperience. I know no way of judging of the future but by the past.''\n  It is only because the United States was so steadfast in fighting for \nfreedom and democracy that the world enjoys an unprecedented era of \nfreedom and prosperity today.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Rumsfeld carries the lamp of experience. I wish \nhim, for our country's sake, every success as he travels by its light. \nIt is with pride that I cast my vote to support the nomination of one \nof Illinois' favorite and most distinguished sons.\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF RODERICK PAIGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us are pleased that the nominee \nfor Secretary of Education, Dr. Roderick Paige, will be confirmed with \nunanimous bipartisan support. I'm optimistic that his bipartisan \nconfirmation will set a high standard for bipartisan cooperation on \neducation in the coming years.\n  The issue is of profound importance for the future of our country. \nEducation is a continuum that begins at birth and continues through \ncollege and in the larger working society. States and communities are \nmaking significant progress in improving their public schools, and that \nis evident in the city of Houston under the leadership of Dr. Paige. \nBut we know that more needs to be done. Public schools across the \nnation are facing ever greater challenges. This year, elementary and \nsecondary schools confront record enrollments of 53 million students, \nand by all estimates, the number of school-age children will continue \nto increase steadily over the next decade and beyond.\n  As schools and communities struggle to educate millions more \nchildren, they also face the difficult challenges of achieving higher \nstandards of learning, and dealing with other problems\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\nsuch as overcrowded classrooms, a shortage of qualified teachers, \nincreased safety concerns, and a lack of adequate after-school \nprograms. Schools cannot face these challenges alone. They need the \nhelp of their communities, their States, and the Federal Government to \nprovide the best possible opportunities for all children. We must \ninvest in critical national priorities and target funds to the neediest \nstudents. That means investing in better teachers, smaller classes, \nsafe and modern facilities, better after-school programs, and programs \nto help children obtain the literacy skills they need. And that \nliteracy training needs to begin in the very early years, long before a \nchild first walks through the schoolhouse door.\n  As we increase support for proven effective reform in each of these \nareas, we must also increase accountability. At the same time, we can't \nafford to undermine the Federal investment in education by adopting \nblock grants to States in ways that would undermine local control, \nreduce targeting to the neediest children, put too little emphasis on \nwhat works, or eliminate accountability for results. Above all, we must \nnot undermine public schools through private school vouchers. Block \ngrants and vouchers have not been proven effective. They are divisive \nissues that lead to needless partisan conflict.\n  Genuine reform of public schools requires bipartisan consensus on \ntargeted top priorities. At his confirmation hearing, Dr. Paige \ntestified that if a strategy had been proven effective in helping to \nimprove public schools and student achievement, he will consider it as \na potential Federal investment. I hope that all of us in Congress hold \nourselves to the same standard. We know what works to help children do \nwell in school. We need to do more to help schools implement these \nstrategies.\n  When President Bush submits the details of his education proposals, I \nam hopeful that we will find many areas of strong bipartisan agreement \non reforms such as increased accountability, better targeting of \nresources to the neediest students, placing a qualified teacher in \nevery classroom, improving children's reading skills, making each \nschool a safe learning environment for students and teachers, and \nensuring that all children with disabilities get a good education too. \nWe can also strengthen our commitment to make college affordable for \nevery qualified student in America. With over 15 million students \nenrolled in higher education today, we must continue to invest in \nstudent loans, and ensure that students continue to obtain the low cost \nloans they deserve.\n  But for the neediest students, loans are often not enough. The \nprospect of a mountain of debt is often impossibly intimidating. We \nneed to focus on grants as well as loans, so that we can open the doors \nof college to millions more students. In 1980, the proportion of grants \nto loans in Federal college aid was 60-40. But today, it is jut the \nreverse--40-60. Pell grants, supplemental educational opportunity \ngrants, and campus-based aid offer students and institutions the \nflexibility they need to help every student make college a reality. But \nby shortchanging these grants, we are shortchanging students--and \nshortchanging America too. I am hopeful that we will continue to \nsupport college opportunity programs in the Nation's public schools--to \nmake sure that all children can see college as a realistic possibility \nfor their own future. We need to give more students the tools and the \nwill to rise out of poverty, and to enter the workforce with the \nability that comes from a good education.\n  Dr. Paige has an impressive background to help the nation meet all \nthese challenges. He currently serves as superintendent of the Houston \nIndependent School District. He has often been credited for turning the \nHouston schools around and raising education standards in the city. He \nwas also dean of the College of Education at South Texas University, \nand he knows first-hand what it takes to bring qualified teachers into \nevery classroom. He comes from a family of educators who share a deep \ncommitment to helping all children do well. I look forward to working \nclosely with Dr. Paige and President Bush in the coming years to meet \nthese high priorities. I congratulate Dr. Paige on his nomination, and \nI urge the Senate to support his confirmation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise to support the nomination of Dr. \nRoderick Paige as Secretary of Education. Education is ``the hub of the \nwheel'' of our society, founded as it is on the principle of equal \nopportunity. If we succeed in making our education system as good as it \ncan be, there is no national priority that will not benefit. If we do \nnot succeed, we leave things to change. So, I believe that Secretary of \nEducation is one of the most, if not the most, important positions in \nthe President's cabinet. Dr. Paige will succeed Secretary Riley, a \nremarkable man who has done a remarkable job promoting and improving \neducation for eight years. I was happy to learn at Dr. Paige's hearing \nbefore the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee of his \nclose friendship with Secretary Riley, and also was happy, though not \nsurprised, to read in the Washington Post on January 19, that Secretary \nRiley welcomed President Bush's choice of Dr. Paige.\n  Dr. Paige comes to the Department of Education with outstanding \ncredentials. He has extensive experience in elementary, secondary, and \nhigher education. From 1994 until his selection as Secretary, Dr. Paige \nserved as Superintendent of the Houston Independent School District. \nPrior to that, he served as the Dean of the College of Education at \nTexas Southern University. In recognition of his work in Houston, Dr. \nPaige was the 2000 National Alliance of Black School Educators' \nnational Superintendent of the Year and is the Texas Association of \nSchool Administrators' nominee for 2001 National Superintendent of the \nYear. In 1999, he was one of the Council of Great City Schools' two \nOutstanding Urban Educators. To me, what is equally as heartening as \nall of Dr. Paige's experience and awards is his background. His father \nwas a principal, his mother was a teacher and librarian, and all three \nof his sisters are educators. I also come from a family of educators. \nThree of my aunts, my sister, and my brother have devoted decades of \ntheir lives to teaching.\n  As Dr. Paige said at his hearing, the virtues of faith and hard work, \nlove of country, and the importance of the American dream that his \nparents instilled in their five children gave him the confidence to \ngraduate from a segregated high school, to pursue higher education, and \nto serve his country in the Navy. When a person grows up in that kind \nof environment, I know that his commitment to education is heartfelt \nand deep. Finally, Dr. Paige's experience and commitment to education \nshowed in his statement and answers to questions at his hearing. I was \nimpressed by the breadth of his knowledge and his ability to respond on \nthe spot to such a wide range of questions on so many aspects of \neducation policy.\n  Of course, my great respect for Dr. Paige's integrity and dedication \ndoes not mean that I have no concerns about positions that he has taken \nduring his distinguished career. For example, Dr. Paige supported the \nuse of public funds to pay private school tuition in Huston and \nsupported that at his hearing, as well. There are approximately 53 \nmillion children in elementary and secondary schools in the United \nStates--approximately 48 million of those attend public schools. I \nthink that voucher programs, although Dr. Paige chose not to use that \nterm, divert much needed funds from our public schools. I also want to \nwork with Dr. Paige to ensure that Federal funds continue to benefit \nlow-income children. I don't question that most education decisions are \nand should be made at the State and local level, but excellence in \neducation also is a national priority and the Federal government has a \nrole to play. We provide only about seven percent of elementary and \nsecondary school funding, but we play a very significant role in \nensuring that groups that may have less of a voice in funding \ndecisions, such as underprivileged students and their families, receive \nthe resources they need, and I believe that we need to continue doing \nthat.\n  And I am concerned about President Bush's proposal to move Head Start \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of \nEducation and change the program's focus to reading. I'm not out to \ndefend\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\nanyone's bureaucratic turf. I'm interested in helping low-income \nchildren and their families, not from which building in Washington the \nprogram is administered. Since 1965, Head Start programs have provided \ncomprehensive early childhood development, educational, health, \nnutritional, social, and other services to more than 17 million low-\nincome pre-school children and their families. Dr. Edward Zigler, one \nof Head Start's founders, said in the December 23, 2000 New York Times \nthat the vast majority of three or four-year olds do not have the \ncognitive ability to ``attribute meaning to abstract symbols, like \nwritten words.'' He added that even the few three or four-year olds who \ndo have that ability are better off spending their time in the Head \nStart learning behaviors needed in school, like listening, taking \nturns, and getting along with other children.\n  Dr. Zigler said that what children need to be prepared to succeed in \nschool are good health, the early involvement of their parents, and \nrelief from the complications of poverty. That's exactly what Head \nStart provides. Of course, literacy is important, and Congress \nrecognized that when we reauthorized Head Start in 1998--which we did \nin a very bipartisan manner. No one questions the importance of \nteaching children to read, but it's not as simple as providing more \nreading classes. A child won't benefit from reading classes alone is \nshe hasn't eaten breakfast, or has an undiagnosed vision problem, or \nhasn't learned how to socialize with other children. Those kinds of \nbenefits, which Head Start provides, are not ``add-ons'' to preparing a \nchild to succeed in school, they are essential to it. As Dr. Zigler \nsaid, Head Start's job then, is to lay a foundation for literacy. So, I \nthink we need to be cautious about changing a program that does so much \ngood for so many children and families.\n  But, that said, I have every confidence in Dr. Paige's qualifications \nand commitment to America's children. President Bush has spoken often \nof the need for bipartisanship in Washington. I have worked with many \nof my Republican colleagues for many years on education policy; for \nexample, with Senator DeWine on the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, \nwith Senator Domenici on character education, with Senator Jeffords on \n21st Century Community Learning Centers, and with Senator Shelby on \ncommercialism in schools. I hope and expect that Dr. Paige and the \nSenate will be able to work together to build on the education \naccomplishments of the past 8 years, and to work toward the goal that \nwe all share--that our children receive the education they need and \ndeserve.\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF PAUL O'NEILL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the Senate's \nprocedure for consideration of the nomination of Paul O'Neill for \nSecretary of the Treasury. Under regular order, the nomination for \nSecretary of the Treasury, which is under the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee would be considered by the committee after \nreferral to the committee. The process usually involves a hearing and a \nvote on the nomination. In this case, a hearing in anticipation of the \nnomination was held. The nomination, however, was not fully considered \nby the committee. The committee agreed to be discharged only because of \nhighly unusual circumstance. The circumstances arise from the fact that \nall Senate committees, including the Finance Committee, are not yet \ncomposed and organized. Moreover, the Secretary of the Treasury is a \ncritical Cabinet position and expeditious consideration of the \nnomination is in the best interests of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the Finance Committee \nwill insist on its jurisdictional prerogatives. This nomination \npresents a highly unusual and compelling procedural exception.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to enthusiastically support \nthe nomination of Mr. Paul Henry O'Neill to be the 72d Secretary of the \nTreasury. Mr. O'Neill is no stranger to policymaking, having served a \nnumber of years at the Office of Management and Budget. He has \nimpressive credentials, both in and out of government, and an \nunchallenged reputation for hard work, straight talk and tough-\nmindedness. He is an extremely strong candidate and a very able \nindividual.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate will vote today to confirm his \nnomination. I believe it is important for our country to have a \nTreasury Secretary in place as the new administration takes over. The \nnext administration will inherit the strongest economy in a generation, \nand the Treasury Department will face extraordinary challenges in \nkeeping the economy going. Eight years ago, the nation's economic \ngrowth was low, interest rates and unemployment were high, and Federal \nbudget deficit and national debt was growing at an unfathomable rate.\n  Today, we have experienced the longest economic expansion in history, \nwith record low unemployment, low interest rates, higher family \nincomes, and record budget surpluses. Inflation is in check, and we are \nbeginning to pay down the national debt--something I know Mr. O'Neill \nhas advocated. Putting the nation's fiscal house in order didn't happen \novernight. Nor did it happen by chance--tough decisions were made and \ndifficult votes taken.\n  In light of this, I am concerned about how we handle the upcoming \ndebate about the budget and taxes. We should proceed carefully, and \nmake certain that our decisions do not put in jeopardy the \naccomplishments made over the past 8 years. In any event, with Mr. \nO'Neill, the President and the country have found the right person for \nthe job. Mr. O'Neill has my support, and he has my vote. I look forward \nto working with Secretary O'Neill, and the new administration, to \naddress the many challenges that lie ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the American economy has changed \ndramatically in the past decade. International economic policy now has \na direct effect on our domestic economy. The information age has \ntransformed America's economic future. Budget surpluses now suggest the \nvery real possibility of paying down the national debt. This new \neconomy requires a new kind of Treasury secretary. It requires someone \nwho is experienced and knowledgeable in both the domestic and the \ninternational marketplace. It requires someone who has demonstrated \nexemplary leadership in both government and private enterprise. \nExperience and leadership Paul O'Neill will bring these vital skills to \nthe Department of Treasury.\n  Paul O'Neill's outstanding career in both the public and private \nsectors has clearly demonstrated his ability to serve as our Nation's \nnext Treasury Secretary. In 1967, he stated as a policy analyst for the \nOffice of Management and Budget. However, his skill and intelligence \nwere quickly noted by OMB Director George Shultz, who promoted him to \nserve as Associate Director with responsibility for social programs. At \nOMB, Paul O'Neill gained a reputation for his sharp analysis and his \nkeen understanding of a wide variety of issues. In fact, he displayed \nsuch strong leadership and gained such respect from both parties that \nin 1976, President Jimmy Carter asked him to serve as his Deputy \nTreasury Secretary. However, Paul O'Neill decided to continue his \ncareer in the private sector. He went to work for the International \nPaper Company, a global paper corporation, of which he eventually \nbecame President. In 1987, he became the chairman and chief executive \nof the Alcoa Corporation, where he has worked since.\n  Paul O'Neill's service to Alcoa is a shining symbol of his \noutstanding abilities. His vision and hard work transformed the \ntroubled industrial company into a profitable international enterprise. \nAs chief executive, he embraced new technologies and gave Alcoa the \nability to prosper in the new economy, even as the national aluminum \nindustry was facing economic troubles. Most importantly, Paul O'Neill \ndemonstrated his leadership at Alcoa by garnering the respect and trust \nof his employees. In fact, the President of the Untied Steelworkers of \nAmerica praised his nomination and called him ``a man you can trust and \nbelieve.'' I am certain that his integrity and leadership will earn \nPaul O'Neill the trust of the American people and of the world's \neconomic leaders.\n  In recent years, Paul O'Neill dedicated his time to leading several \ncommissions on improving health care, education, and the local \ngovernment of his hometown, Pittsburgh. Our nation\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nwill be fortunate to have a Treasury Secretary with such board and \nvaried expertise, and these experiences will prove vital in leading a \nprogressively diverse economy. I believe that Paul O'Neill will be an \nexemplary Treasury Secretary. He has already spoken of his dedication \nto paying down our national debt, fundamentally reforming the tax code, \nand ensuring that America's industries can compete in the new global \neconomy. I am certain that his experience and leadership will be great \nassets in achieving these important goals.\n  Mr. President, it is my great honor to support Paul O'Neill to head \nthe Department of the Treasury.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few brief moments to \ncomment on the nomination of Paul O'Neill to be the Treasury Secretary \nof the United States. I first want to commend President Bush on \nchoosing such a highly qualified candidate to take over the many \nresponsibilities demanded of the United States Treasury Secretary. I \nfully support Mr. O'Neill's nomination, and I look forward to working \nwith him in the new administration.\n  Mr. O'Neill brings to the position of Treasury Secretary a broad \nrange of experience both in the public and private sector. He began his \ncareer as an engineer with Morrison-Knudsen, Inc. in Anchorage, Alaska \nand then went on to serve as Deputy Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget under the Ford administration. In 1977, Mr. \nO'Neill became the vice president of International Paper and in 1985 \nassumed the position of President. This path ultimately led him to \naluminum giant Alcoa where, as chairman, he has been credited with the \ncompany's revival in the face of the industry's struggles nationwide. \nBased on his past accomplishments, I believe Mr. O'Neill will bring \nvaluable insights to the critically important post to which he has been \nnominated.\n  I noted with interest Mr. O'Neill's comments during his confirmation \nhearing about the role tax cuts should play in our economy, namely, \nthat they are not the sole means by which to stimulate a slowing \neconomy. This is an important cautionary note that we all should heed \nas we move forward on the issue of tax cuts. While I support tax relief \nand reform, I also believe that our Nation's tax policy should be \nguided by three main principals. First, it should be fair. Those who \nneed tax relief the most should receive the most relief. Second, any \ntax reform must be consistent with our commitment to maintain a \nbalanced budget and reduce our national debt. In my opinion, this is \nthe best gift we can give to future generations of Americans. And \nfinally, we must leave room to meet our existing obligations, like \ndefense, education, law enforcement, Medicare, and Social Security, as \nwell as the new challenges that most certainly lie ahead.\n  The goal of this new Congress and administration must be to maintain \nand build upon the prosperity achieved over the past eight years. We \nnow have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. The national poverty \nrate is at its lowest mark in 20 years. The economy has created 22 \nmillion new jobs since 1993. We have moved from record deficits to \nrecord surpluses. And October 2000 marked this country's 115th \nconsecutive month of economic expansion--the longest period of economic \ngrowth in our nation's history. Our future policy decisions should \nreflect a commitment to foster this progress and growth in the coming \nyears.\n  And while Mr. O'Neill will be inheriting a strong economy, there \nstill remain a number of challenges that I believe will deserve special \nattention so as to keep our economy moving in a positive direction. One \nof the most critical tasks to be faced is the aging of America, and \nspecifically, the stability of Social Security. As new levels of demand \nare placed on Social Security, we must look to reasonable and balanced \nproposals that will ensure a financially secure foundation for current \nand future retirees.\n  We must also strive to maintain the United States position as a trade \nleader in an ever-increasing global marketplace. It is in our best \nlong-term economic interests to remain an active trading partner with \nour allies and to be open to the opportunities that exist in emerging \nmarkets. At the same time, we must remain aware of the needs and job \nsecurity of American workers and the goods they produce. Furthermore, \nemphasis should be placed on maintaining the competitiveness of our \nfinancial institutions.\n  And one of the biggest challenges will be how to expand our nation's \nprosperity to more Americans--Americans who have yet to reap the \nbenefits of our dynamic economy and who strive to achieve more \nfinancial security for themselves and their families.\n  In closing, I once again wish to express my support for Mr. O'Neill's \nnomination. He has presented himself as a fair and honest candidate who \nhas expressed a willingness to work with all Members of Congress on our \nnation's most important priorities. I remain hopeful that we will be \nable to do so, and urge my colleagues to support this nominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/20/senate-section/article/S66-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to say goodbye to those \nyoung men and women who served in the United States Senate as pages \nduring the fall of 2000. When they arrived in Washington in September, \nno one would have guessed that their term as a Senate page would be at \nsuch a historical time in the history of the United States. These \ndedicated young people were eyewitnesses to a presidential election \nwhich remained undecided for weeks after the votes were cast. In \naddition, they saw the Senate become an evenly divided body for the \nfirst time in decades.\n  As I have mentioned on numerous occasions when saluting the young \npeople who serve as Senate pages, the life of a page is quite \nchallenging. The school day begins at 6 a.m. After classes, the pages \nreport to work at the U.S. Senate. When the Senate convenes, the pages \nare at their post and ready for the day's activities. Pages are called \nupon to assist Senators and staff in the daily operations of the \nSenate. Their tasks include providing Senators with copies of the \nappropriate bills and resolutions under consideration. They may be \nasked to secure documents from a Senator's office and rush over to the \nSenate floor for that Senator's use in debate on an issue. During \nrollcall votes, pages are often asked to notify relevant staff of the \narrival of Senators to the floor.\n  Throughout the day, the page is called upon to perform any number of \nduties vital to the smooth operation of the Senate. They do so with a \nsmile. This group of young men and women have had an extraordinary \nopportunity to serve as a Senate page. They are among a very select \ngroup to do so, and they did a great job. It is my hope that their \nexperience here has served them well as they return home. Public \nservice is an admirable profession. These young people are our public \nservants and leaders of tomorrow. Perhaps in the not too distant \nfuture, some of these young pages will return to Washington to serve as \na Congressman or a Senator, or perhaps even as President of the United \nStates.\n  I know all of my colleagues join me in wishing the pages well and \ngood luck as they continue with their education, and I hope that they \nnow have a greater understanding of our Government and its importance \nto all the people of the United States. Mr. President, at this time, I \nask unanimous consent that the names of those young people who served \nas fall pages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Fall Pages\n\n\n                            Democratic Pages\n\n       Ashley Alvarado (Montana); Mathew Mandel (Wisconsin); Amber \n     Lopez (Vermont); Christina Kielsmeier (Minnesota); Kyle \n     Sapkiewiez (Michigan); Bram Geller (Massachusetts); Peter \n     Koziol (Illinois); Milena Caraballo (New Jersey); and Andrea \n     Halverson (South Dakota).\n\n\n                            Republican Pages\n\n       Sabrina Byrd (Arkansas); Kenneth Donahue (Vermont); Grant \n     Gibson (Idaho); Sam Gladney (Missouri); Frances Griffin \n     (Alabama); Travis Kavulla (Montana); Emily Nuse (Missouri); \n     Laila Ouhamou (Virginia); Amy Pennington (Washington); Mathew \n     Wigginton (Virginia); and Daniel Zoller (Indiana).\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/20/senate-section/article/S67-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S67]]\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees except \nfor those confirmed by unanimous consent.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/20/senate-section/article/S67-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUBMISSION OF CONCURRENT AND SENATE RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following concurrent resolutions and Senate resolutions were \nread, and referred (or acted upon), as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ROBERTS (for (Mr. Lott (for himself and Mr. \n             Daschle)):\n       S.
