Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about reports that I \nhave been hearing that indicate that perhaps the Senate may not even \nconsider a budget resolution this year. It is not clear whether we will \nor we won't, but in the discussions I have had with Senator Daschle, \nhis only response has been: Well, that decision has not been made yet.\n  I must say that is very troubling, and I hope the decision is not \nmade to just defer action completely on the budget resolution this \nyear.\n  If we don't have a budget resolution, I predict that it will lead to \nlegislative chaos for the remainder of the year. When you look at the \nbudget resolution, you see page after page of numbers. I realize it is \nnot very exciting, it is difficult to read, and the debate on the \nbudget resolution, while it is under expedited procedures, leads to \nhighly arcane descriptions of such things as reserve funds, \nreconciliation procedures, and references to points of order. But, \nclearly, it is a process that you can go through and you can usually do \nit in about a week. Yes, it leads to a number of votes, quite often \neven the very unattractive carousel-type procedure where you vote on \namendment after amendment.\n  I wish we could find a way to limit that. Maybe this is the year we \ncan come to some sort of agreement to not have 20 or 30 votes, one \nright after the other. It makes it very difficult to legislate properly \nand difficult for Senators to even understand the ramifications of \nthose votes. But that is the way it has been done.\n  I think that in spite of the messy procedure, it will determine \nwhether or not we are able to really govern this year. The budget \nresolution is not really about numbers in the final analysis; it is \nabout setting priorities and making choices. What will be the position \nof the Senate on spending for the year? What is the position of the \nSenate on tax policy? What is the position of the Senate in terms of \ndefense and improving education and health care? Everything sort of \ndepends on having this statement of policy in the budget resolution.\n  Now, in the years we have had the Budget Empowerment Act, since about \n1974, the Senate has never failed to act. Two or 3 years ago, we did \nhave a situation where the Senate passed a resolution, the House passed \na resolution, and we could not get a conference agreement. But the two \nbodies agreed on the numbers that would be followed by the \nAppropriations Committee and we went forward. I was not proud of that. \nI thought that was an abdication of our responsibility. At least we \nagreed on numbers and we went forward.\n  The idea we would not even make an effort this year sends a fairly \nbad signal. I realize there is a time problem here. We have about 5 \nweeks before the Memorial Day recess. We need to finish the energy \nbill, and we need to do trade promotion authority and bills associated \nwith that, at least indirectly, such as the Andean trade authority and \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. We still have to do supplemental \nappropriations. We need to do the Defense authorization bill and a \nbudget resolution, and we need to do all that before the Memorial Day \nrecess. The law requires that we do a budget resolution by April 15.\n  More years than not, we do not meet that deadline, but at least we go \nforward and have a budget resolution. If we do not do this by Memorial \nDay, then it will be very difficult for the Appropriations Committee to \nproceed. When we look at the fact we have June, July, and September \nbasically remaining in this legislative year, we will have to get going \nwith Defense--well, with all the appropriations bills. Hopefully, \nDefense appropriations will be first. We need to make sure we fund that \nprogram before anything else because our men and women are so dependent \non it.\n  I am very worried about what the situation will be if we do not have \na budget resolution. I have been looking at what it could lead to, and \nI have to say it is going to be a wild-west-type approach. If \nappropriations bills come up, there are no limits, no points of order \nto limit spending beyond what a subcommittee may have designated as its \nnumbers. The 60-vote point of order will not apply. The bills could \nvery well collapse of their own weight because there will be so many \nbrilliant ideas of how spending can be added.\n  If I were a subcommittee chairman, regardless of on which aisle I \nsat, that would be a very difficult situation to manage.\n  The argument might be: It will be hard; we will have to vote on all \nthose amendments. That is true, but we do it year after year.\n  The argument can be made: We are closely divided. Last year we got a \nbudget resolution, and we were divided 50-50. Here are the budget \nresolutions we passed over the past 6\\1/2\\ years, including last year \nwhen it was 50-50. By the way, when we got to a final vote, it was \npassed by a wide bipartisan vote. In fact, the Senate passed the budget \nresolution on April 6, before the April 15 date that is included in the \nbudget law, and it was by a bipartisan vote of 65 to 35. It can be \ndone, it should be done, and every year I served as majority leader, we \ngot it done. Here are the budget resolutions. The evidence is there.\n  I think perhaps what is going on here is just a desire to not have \nSenators cast these tough votes. That is an abdication of our \nresponsibility.\n  Perhaps the Senate majority leader and the budget chairmen have \nsomething different in mind. Maybe they are saying they prefer to just \noperate under last year's budget resolution. By choosing not to vote on \ntheir own, they are, in effect, choosing to continue under the budget \nresolution we passed last year. Obviously, that would create a number \nof problems.\n  I support the President's budget. The President came up with a good \nbudget. He does provide a significant increase in the priorities that \nneed to have increases. There is an increase for defense funding. We \nneed a supplemental for defense to pay for what we have already spent, \nand we need to make sure our military men and women have a decent \nquality of life, have the weapons they need to do the job, the most \nmodern technology possible, which has saved a lot of lives.\n  We need to move forward on national security. Of course, we realized \nlast year after September 11 that we were vulnerable and we needed to \ndo more with respect to homeland security. There are a lot of hearings \noccurring now in the Appropriations Committee and other committees of \njurisdiction about exactly where this additional spending in homeland \nsecurity should go. We know we need to do more for port security, \nairport security, first responders, law enforcement, firemen.\n  Clearly, we are going to have to add significant increases in funds \nfor homeland security. That has been acknowledged and called for on \nboth sides of the aisle. So national defense, homeland security, and \neconomic security are priorities.\n\n  We need to make sure we are doing the right thing with fiscal policy \nat the Federal Government level so that the economy will grow. We see \npositive signs, but it is not universal. It is uneven, and it varies \nfrom sector to sector, and there are even some regional differences.\n  This year maybe more than ever we need to have a budget resolution \nthat sets some priorities so that we can do what we need to do but not \nlose control of it when it gets to this Chamber.\n  Let me speak a minute about one of the specifics in the budget \nresolution that came out of the Senate Budget Committee. I commend \nSenator Conrad, the chairman of the committee. He could have just said \nit is not worth the effort, we are not even going to try to get it out \nof committee. He did make the effort, and they reported out a budget \nresolution. That signaled to me we were going to be ready to go to the \nfloor with the resolution that came out of the committee.\n  Now you see it, now you don't. I do not quite understand why that \nchange occurred, even after the Budget Committee stepped up, and while \nit did not pass on a bipartisan vote, it went through within 2 or 3 \ndays of consideration and is now ready for full Senate consideration.\n  My concern is specifically in the defense area. I am worried that the \nbudget that came out of the Budget Committee is soft on defense. While \nit fully funds the President's defense request for next year, it \nshortchanges the President's request by $225 billion over the next \nsucceeding 9 years. It is $225\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nbillion short. That means the troops will not get the supplies and \narmaments they need to prosecute the war on terrorism, and this, we all \nknow, is not a short-term issue; this is something that is going to \ntake months and years as we try to root out terrorism and make sure we \ncan be safe around the world at our embassies and at home.\n  It means that operations and maintenance will suffer. Pilots will not \nbe able to fly the missions they need for training, and upkeep on ships \nwill slow down. It means Secretary Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs will \nhave fewer resources in place to plan for the next step. It will mean \nwe will not have the resources to take action against Saddam Hussein \nand the ``axis of evil.''\n  The President has established our priorities, and national defense is \ntops. The President has called on us to act on the defense bill first.\n  Why in the world would this decision be made not to fully fund the \nwar? I think the response we are going to hear is: We do fully fund the \nPresident's request next year, but then we are going to create a \nreserve fund for defense spending for the future. Unfortunately, the \nreserve fund is nothing more than a gimmick.\n  If one looks elsewhere in the budget, specifically in the section \ntitled ``Functional Totals,'' one will see that the defense money in \nthe reserve fund is not there for defense. It would be used supposedly \nto reduce the debt. That certainly is a worthwhile objective, and we \nshould continue to try to find ways to live within a budget and reduce \nthe debt, as we had been doing for the previous 4 years.\n  We have to make some choices now. We should fund defense first, and \nwe should not set up a mechanism that would short the Defense \nDepartment by $225 billion.\n  Our world changed on September 11. We know national security and \nhomeland security is going to be important. We are going to have to act \non it. We have to be prepared to defend ourselves against attacks \ninternationally and at home. We have to provide support for our allies \nand friends, such as NATO and Israel. We must repel and deter and, in \nsome instances, take preemptive action to prevent attacks on American \ncitizens. No one in the Senate disagrees we are going to have to do \nmore in national security and it is going to take more than 1 year. \nThis is a long-term commitment.\n  I do want to particularly point out to my colleagues that there is a \nhuge problem in the budget resolution reported by the committee in the \ndefense area. We need to stand shoulder to shoulder with the President, \nand we have in the war on terrorism. We did it repeatedly and \ncourageously after the events of September 11. But slowly we have \nslipped back into our normal sniping.\n  We will always have legitimate debate. It is about democracy. That is \nthe great thing about America. We can disagree without undermining what \nneeds to be done for our country. When it comes to defense, we cannot \nshort-fund it, and we cannot allow it to slip off into partisan debate.\n  Here is what we need to do in the Senate, and we need to do it before \nthe Memorial Day recess: Pass a budget resolution. What other form of \ndiscipline can we possibly have? What more important indicator is there \nabout whether or not we are prepared to govern and make tough choices? \nPass a budget resolution, fully fund the President's budget request in \nboth the short and long term, add the $225 billion for defense back \ninto the budget resolution, and eliminate the reserve fund. Pass the \ndefense resolution first.\n  That, Mr. President, is how we stand shoulder to shoulder with the \nPresident in this war on terrorism.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2691-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the Senate is aware, we are facing a \nvacancy crisis in the Federal courts with over 11 of the Federal \njudgeships open.\n  This crisis is even worse at the appellate level where almost 19 \npercent of the appellate court judgeships are vacant. That means that \none out of every five seats is empty.\n  Nowhere is the problem felt more acutely than in my home circuit, the \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which consists of Michigan, Ohio, \nKentucky, and Tennessee. We have an astonishing 50-percent vacancy \nrate. Half of the seats of my home circuit are empty.\n  I would like to take a little time to discuss what that means to the \npeople who live in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee--the people \nwho make up the Sixth Circuit.\n  We have a chart of the Sixth Circuit--Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and \nTennessee. There are 16 total seats on the Sixth Circuit. There are \neight sitting judges representing, of course, a 50-percent vacancy. The \nPresident has sent up seven nominees for the eight vacancies. To date, \nthere have been no hearings on any of those nominees.\n  The practical effect of that is each judge is having to dispose of \nmany more cases. As the chart shows, according to the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts, the average number of cases that active-status \njudges on the Sixth Circuit are having to dispose of has increased by \n46 percent in the last 5 years.\n  As a result of this vacancy rate, the dispositions per active judge \nhave gone up 46 percent since 1996--a 46-percent increase--to 535 \nmatters per judge.\n  From just 1996 to 2001, the average number of cases each Sixth \nCircuit judge is deciding has increased by almost half--50 percent.\n  Let us take a look at this chart and the dramatic increase in \ndecision time.\n  Why this matters is that with Sixth Circuit judges having to dispose \nof many more cases, this results in a dramatic increase in the length \nof time for an appellate decision to be rendered. In fact, according to \nthe Administrative Office of the Courts, the Sixth Circuit is ranked \nnext to last among all Federal circuits in median time for disposition \nof an appeal.\n  The national average is 10.9 percent. In Sixth Circuit, it is 15.3 \npercent, which is 40 percent as a result of the eight vacancies that we \nhave.\n  It is not just the Sixth Circuit is next to last--someone has to be \nnext to last--but that the deviation from the national average is so \ngreat.\n  Specifically, as my third chart shows, in 1994, when there were no \nvacancies, the Sixth Circuit was about 1 month slower in processing \nappeals than the national average, about 10 percent slower.\n  By the time of the first vacancy in the following year, 1995, the \nSixth Circuit was a little over 2 months slower than the national \naverage, or about 17 percent slower than the national average.\n  But by last year when there were eight vacancies, the Sixth Circuit \nwas almost 4\\1/2\\ months slower than the national average, which \ntranslates into a full 40 percent below average.\n  There is no question that the significant number of vacancies has had \nan impact on litigants in the Sixth Circuit.\n  What that means is that in other circuits, if you file your appeal at \nthe beginning of the New Year, you get your decision by about \nHalloween. But in the Sixth Circuit, if you file your appeal at the \nsame time, you are forced to wait until Easter of the following year to \nget your case resolved.\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\n  These are alarming statistics. To put a human face on it, let me read \nsome comments from judges and practitioners.\n  Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery has said that numerous death \npenalty appeals before the Sixth Circuit are experiencing prolonged \ndelays. For example, the appeal of Michael Beuke has not been acted on \nin more than 2 years, and Clarence Carter has had a motion pending \nbefore the Sixth Circuit for 3 years.\n  These are death penalty appeals.\n  Federal district Judge Robert Holmes Bell described the Sixth Circuit \nas in a ``crisis'' because of the vacancies. He added, ``We're having \nto backfill with judges from other circuits who are basically \nsubstitutes. You don't get the same sense of purpose and continuity you \nget with full-fledged court of appeals judges.'' Even with \n``backfilling,'' the Sixth Circuit still takes more than 40 percent \nlonger than the national average to resolve cases.\n  Cincinnati Attorney Elizabeth McCord, as of the end of last year, had \nbeen waiting 15 months just to have oral argument scheduled for her \nclient's appeal in a job discrimination suit. In the interim, her \nclient died. According to the Cincinnati Post, delays like this have \nbecome ``commonplace'' because vacancies have left the court ``at half-\nstrength and have created a serious backlog of cases.''\n  Mary Jane Trapp, president of the Ohio Bar Association, said \n``Colleagues of mine who do a lot of Federal work are continuing to \ncomplain (about the delays). When you don't have judges appointed to \nhear cases, you really are back to the adage of `justice delayed is \njustice denied.' ''\n  The purpose of my discussion is not to point fingers or to lay blame. \nMy friend, the chairman--and he is my friend--knows how warmly I feel \nabout the way he handled the district court vacancies in my State. I \nhave repeatedly said how much I appreciate his actions in this regard, \nand I will continue to do so.\n  The point of my discussion is simply to underscore the problem facing \nmy constituents in Kentucky and the citizens in the other States in the \nSixth Circuit. I also feel compelled to discuss this problem because I \ndon't see any indication of progress.\n  The President has nominated outstanding individuals to fill seven of \nthe eight vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. And I am hopeful that he will \nsoon fill that last vacancy. Yet, unfortunately, no hearings have been \nscheduled--not a single one--for any of these seven nominees, even \nthough two of those nominees--Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook, both \nfrom Ohio--have been before the Senate for almost a full year, and have \nnot even had a hearing.\n  We are talking about a substantial amount of time:\n  John Rogers, from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, has been waiting for \n119 days.\n  Henry Saad, Susan Neilson, and David McKeage from Michigan have now \nbeen waiting 160 days.\n  Julia Gibbons from Tennessee has been waiting for 190 days. And both \nJeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook from Ohio have now been waiting 343 \ndays.\n\n  We are talking about well-qualified nominees. For example, Jeffrey \nSutton graduated first in his law school class, has served as solicitor \nfor the State of Ohio, and has argued over 20 cases before the U.S. and \nState Supreme Courts. Deborah Cook has been a well-respected justice on \nthe Ohio Supreme Court for 8 years.\n  But the nominee, obviously, I know best--in fact, the only one I \nreally know--is Professor John Rogers from my own State of Kentucky. He \nhas taught law for almost a quarter of a century at the University of \nKentucky College of Law. He has twice served in the Appellate Division \nof the Department of Justice, once as a visiting professor.\n  He has served his country as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army \nReserves. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford University \nduring his junior year. He graduated magna cum laude from the law \nschool at the University of Michigan, where he was elected to the Order \nof the Coif. He is clearly an outstanding selection by the President of \nthe United States.\n  The Sixth Circuit is in dire need of the services of the fine lawyers \nsuch as Professor Rogers whom President Bush has nominated. I hope the \nSenate can make some reasonable progress on accommodating the court's \nurgent needs because it is important to remember when you have a \ncircuit that is 50 percent vacant, this has a direct impact on \nlitigants. Justice is being delayed and, therefore, denied in the Sixth \nCircuit. That has a direct bearing on the people who live in Michigan, \nin Ohio, in Kentucky, and in Tennessee.\n  It is still not too late for us to address this problem. I hope we \nwill do it in the coming months because we genuinely have a crisis in \nthe courts, and, particularly, we have a crisis in the Sixth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2692-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2692-S2694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE REPORT OF THE ILLINOIS GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to talk about another \nsignificant milestone in our Nation's debate on the death penalty. Last \nweek, our Nation witnessed the 100th innocent person to be freed from \ndeath row in the modern death penalty era--that is, since the Supreme \nCourt found the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972. Number 100 is \nRay Krone. Krone spent 10 years in the Arizona prisons for a murder he \ndid not commit.\n  Yesterday, our Nation reached another milestone. The Illinois \nGovernor's Commission on Capital Punishment released its report on the \nIllinois death penalty system. This report details problems with the \nadministration of the death penalty in Illinois and makes dozens of \nrecommendations for reform. This is actually the first comprehensive \nanalysis of a death penalty system undertaken by a Federal or State \ngovernment in the modern death penalty era.\n  Governor George Ryan of Illinois first made history 2 years ago when \nhe was the first Governor in the Nation to step forward and place a \nmoratorium on executions. He recognized that the death penalty system \nis plagued with errors and the risk of executing the innocent. Governor \nRyan, who had supported the death penalty as a State legislator, \nrealized that the death penalty system was so broken that justice could \nno longer be assured. Since reinstatement of capital punishment in \nIllinois in 1977, Illinois had put 12 people to death. But during this \nsame period, 13 people were exonerated and removed from death row.\n  What led to this alarming ratio of 13 exonerations to 12 executions? \nIt was a number of problems--from incompetent counsel, to convictions \nbased on unreliable testimony of jailhouse informants, to mistaken \neyewitness testimony, and, in some cases, police misconduct.\n  As Governor Ryan said when he suspended executions:\n\n       I cannot support a system, which . . . has proven to be so \n     fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate \n     nightmare, the State's taking of innocent life.\n\n  But we know that it is not just Illinois that has come so close to \nthis ultimate nightmare. One hundred innocent people nationwide have \nbeen released from death row. Thirteen are in Illinois, but the \nremaining 87 innocent individuals were convicted and sent to death row \nby justice systems in States such as Arizona, California, Florida, \nMaryland, and Texas.\n  Governor Ryan did the right thing. Before signing off on another \nexecution warrant, he wanted to be sure with moral certainty that no \ninnocent man or women would face a lethal injection. But as he \nsuspended executions, he also created an independent commission to \nreview the death penalty in Illinois. This 14-member, blue ribbon \ncommission includes our former colleague, and dear friend Senator Paul \nSimon; Judge Frank McGarr; Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S. Attorney; and \nBill Martin, a former Cook County prosecutor. Judge William Webster, \nwho has served our Nation with distinction as the former Director of \nthe CIA and the FBI, was a special advisor to the commission.\n  Two years after its creation, I am pleased to report that the \nGovernor's Commission on Capital Punishment has completed its work. \nBoth death penalty supporters and opponents came together to review the \nproblems in Illinois and have made numerous recommendations for reform. \nThe people\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nof Illinois will not determine how to respond to the commission's \nrecommendations.\n  I want to commend Governor Ryan for his leadership and the members of \nthe commission for their dedication throughout this long process. Their \nwork is a credit to Illinois and is a model for the Nation.\n  While Illinois is the only State that has suspended executions, it is \nnot the only State whose death penalty system is fraught with error. In \nfact, according to a Columbia University study, the overall rate of \nserious error in the Illinois death penalty system is 2 percent lower \nthan the national average, which is 68 percent. In other words, from \n1973 to 1995, over two-thirds of death penalty convictions nationwide \nwere reversed on appeal based on serious, reversible error. That is not \njust every once in a while. The experts found that almost 7 out of 10 \ndeath penalty verdicts will be reversed on appeal, and not for \ntechnical reasons, but for substantive, serious reasons.\n  In the vast majority of these cases reversed on appeal, defendants \nwere found to deserve a sentence less than death when the errors were \ncured on retrial. And 7 percent were found to be innocent of the crime \naltogether.\n  These data show that the same kinds of grave errors that Governor \nRyan saw in Illinois exist in death penalty systems across the United \nStates. Incompetent counsel, flimsy or unreliable evidence, and \nsometimes even prosecutorial or police misconduct--all of these have \nled to convicting the innocent or, at a minimum, unfair proceedings. We \nalso know that whether you live or die sometimes depends on the color \nof your skin or where you live. For example, according to a study that \nreviewed capital prosecutions in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1993, Black \ndefendants were nearly four times as likely to receive a death sentence \nthan non-Black defendants who had committed similar murders. These \nerrors and bias in the system are simply wrong and unjust.\n  Fortunately, it is not just Governor Ryan and I who are saying there \nis something terribly amiss. A growing chorus of Americans have come \nforward to say the death penalty system is fraught with error.\n\n  One of those Americans is Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Last summer, \nJustice O'Connor expressed her concern about the risk of executing the \ninnocent. She said:\n\n       Unfortunately, as the rate of executions has increased, \n     problems in the way [in] which the death penalty has been \n     administered have become more apparent.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       Perhaps most alarming among these is the fact that if \n     statistics are any indication, the system may well be \n     allowing some innocent defendants to be executed.\n\n  Madam President, I call on Congress to heed Justice O'Connor's \nwarning and follow the example of the State of Illinois. My bill--a \nbill that I am working with the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine \non--is the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act, and it applies the \nIllinois model to the rest of the Nation. My bill would suspend Federal \nexecutions and urge the States to do the same, while a National \nCommission on the Death Penalty reviews the death penalty systems at \nthe State and Federal levels. The national commission would study \nwhether the administration of the death penalty is consistent with \nconstitutional principles of fairness, justice, equality, and due \nprocess.\n  So, Madam President, I again commend Governor Ryan and the people of \nIllinois for their leadership. I recently had the chance to speak to a \ngathering of pro-moratorium supporters in Illinois, the ``Land of \nLincoln.'' I told them that I believe they are carrying the mantle of \nLincoln. They have given their full devotion to Lincoln's call for \nfreedom and justice throughout the land. In fact, some might say that \nthe struggle for fairness in our Nation's criminal justice system today \nis, in some ways, an unfinished chapter of the struggle for freedom \nfrom slavery earlier in our Nation's history.\n  Madam President, we should follow the lead of our fellow Americans in \nthe ``Land of Lincoln.'' Let us continue their effort with a nationwide \nmoratorium and a reexamination of the administration of the death \npenalty. To continue the status quo and risk the execution of another \ninnocent person is truly unjust and just unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the National Death \nPenalty Moratorium Act.\n  At this point, I yield the floor because I am pleased to see my \ncolleague and tremendous ally in this issue, Senator Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, let me begin by saying how pleased I am \nto stand with Senator Feingold, who is a man of conscience, who has \nspoken out for the need for our Nation to examine the practice and \napplication of the death penalty. His call for a moratorium, as was \nrecently provided in the State of Illinois by their Governor, I think \nis an act of courage and one that is responsible if we all believe in \njustice, the rule of law, and fairness, which is defining to America.\n  As I know Senator Feingold outlined, yesterday a commission in the \nState of Illinois on capital punishment, appointed by Governor George \nRyan, released its report on the death penalty. The report raises \nserious concerns about the fairness of the application of the death \npenalty and about whether justice is being fairly applied. That \ncommission came back with a number of very important recommendations \nand movement for reform.\n  In light of that report, I wish to take this opportunity to truly \nunderscore the effort Senator Feingold has made to raise the level of \ndiscussion about the state of the death penalty as it is applied \nnationally. It is critical that we make sure that the system protects \ninnocent victims and provides for the true application of justice as we \nknow it, making sure fairness and the rule of law are practiced.\n  Last week a man named Ray Krone was released from prison. Mr. Krone \nhad been convicted of murder. He had already served 10 years behind \nbars and had been sentenced to die. But Mr. Krone is, and always had \nbeen, an innocent man. New DNA evidence proved that conclusively. He \nwas convicted for a crime he did not commit. Prosecutors now admit it. \nI think the local county attorney put it: He deserves an apology \nfrom us. That is for sure. To put it mildly, that is an understatement.\n\n  How would any of us feel if we had been charged, tried, and convicted \nby a jury of our peers for a crime we didn't commit and then, to top it \noff, sentenced to die? Ray Krone knows what that feels like and, \nunfortunately, he is not alone. In fact, he was the one-hundredth \nperson, since we reinstated the practice of the death penalty in this \nNation, to be released from death row in the United States, with post-\ntrial proof of the individual's innocence. These 100 innocent people \nhave experienced nothing short of living hell. And the outrageous \ninjustice of their convictions and their sentences should be a wake-up \ncall for all of us.\n  I take second place to no one in my determination to fight the \nscourge of crime. As part of that effort, I believe we need to be very \ntough on violent criminals, including imposing long sentences and the \npotential for no opportunity for parole. But while we get tough on \ncrime, we also need to recognize that our criminal justice system makes \nmistakes--sometimes very serious mistakes. Until recently, it was \nvirtually impossible to know when innocent people were wrongfully \nconvicted. But today, with the advent of DNA technology, it is far less \nlikely to occur if we let the evidence come to light.\n  Why are innocent people convicted and sentenced to death? To a large \nextent, it is because our criminal justice system has some systemic \nflaws and, frankly, some biases as well, in how it is applied.\n  Capital defendants are more likely in some parts of our country to be \nsubject to the death penalty than others, and they certainly would give \nat least the appearance of some racial prejudice administered there.\n  Capital defendants often have lawyers who do a terrible job. Frankly, \nthere are instances where people have shown up inebriated and unable to \ncarry out their functions in court. Sometimes their failures are simply \nas a result of carelessness, or lack of preparation, or inexperience, \nor a failure to find and interview key witnesses, a failure to \nthoroughly read the case law, and a failure to object to unreliable \nevidence. They make a variety of mistakes.\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\n  I don't say this to criticize all defense attorneys. We accept that \nmost of them try to do a good job. But in many cases where people do \nnot have the economic resources to access the kind of talent necessary \nto defend them, they may be outgunned in a court of law. Even if they \nworked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, they may just be overwhelmed by \nthe resources they are fighting against.\n  Ineffective assistance of counsel is just one reason why innocent \npeople find themselves on death row. Sometimes eyewitnesses make honest \nmistakes. Sometimes witnesses give false testimony to protect their own \nhide, such as jailhouse informants seeking reduced sentences. Sometimes \nprosecutors engage in misconduct by withholding evidence that could \nhelp the defendant's case and not following the rule of law, which is \nwhat we are all expected to do. Any of these factors can lead to a \nwrongful conviction. And now we have 100 examples of the circumstances \nthat can provide for that reality.\n  A system that wrongly sends 100 people to death row can be called a \nlot of things, but ``fair'' and ``equitable'' and ``just'' are not \namong them. In fact, our criminal justice system is badly broken, in my \nview. Before we send any more innocent people to death row, we need to \nfix it. That was clearly the conclusion reached by the commission of \ndistinguished experts appointed by Governor Ryan. The Ryan commission \nwas in charge of examining how the death penalty system is working in \nIllinois. But its conclusions, no doubt, are applicable to the Nation \nas a whole.\n\n  The commissioners were unanimous in agreeing that the death penalty \nhad been applied too often and that the system is in need of reform. I \nthink there were 13 overturned death penalty convictions in Illinois \nout of the total of 25 before the commission went to work. Clearly, \nthere were problems in Illinois and the Governor should be commended \nfor recognizing that and moving forward.\n  Now we need to do that as a nation. That commission called for a \nbroad range of specific changes. These include video taping the \nquestioning of capital suspects in a police facility, barring capital \npunishment based exclusively on the testimony of single witnesses--\nparticularly witnesses who are jailhouse convicts--eliminating the \ndeath penalty for people who are mentally retarded, and requiring trial \njudges to agree with the jury about the imposition of a death sentence.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will take a look at the Ryan commission's \nreport and think hard about the need to reform our criminal justice \nsystem, to think about the fairness that is fundamental to what America \nis about. Make no mistake, it is an enormous injustice when the death \npenalty is imposed based on false information.\n  Innocent people have been sent to death row and there will be more if \nwe don't actually take up this charge of reviewing how we got to this \nconclusion. We have a moral obligation to do something about this.\n  I have joined with Senator Feingold--and I am proud to do so--in \ncosponsoring legislation to establish a moratorium on all Federal \nexecutions until a commission, much similar to the Ryan commission, can \nbe established to review the death penalty for our Nation and impose \nmeaningful reforms that give the public a greater sense that we have a \nfair and just system being applied to all Americans.\n  This would not lead to the release of any convicted criminals or \nthreaten public safety in any way. It would simply ensure innocent \npeople are not put to death and that the principles we believe in--\nfairness and rule of law--apply.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Again, I express my \nsincere appreciation for the leadership of Senator Feingold in this \ncritically important matter.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I commend my colleague from New Jersey \nand my colleague from Wisconsin for raising this very important issue. \nIt deserves the attention of every American, not just those who serve \nin this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2694-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2694-S2695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ENHANCED BORDER SECURITY AND VISA ENTRY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, today I rise to address the importance \nof another critical issue, and that is the Enhanced Border Security and \nVisa Entry Reform Act of 2001. I believe this measure needs to be \npassed as soon as possible.\n  Why? Perhaps I speak from a somewhat parochial perspective, but \nrepresenting New York, which is one of our border States, gives me a \nfirsthand view and understanding of the challenges we face in trying to \nmake our northern border as safe and secure as possible.\n  The nearly 4,000-mile-long U.S. border with Canada is about twice the \nlength of the U.S. border with Mexico, but until very recently it has \nreceived but a fraction of the resources available for border security.\n  According to a July 2001 report from the Justice Department's Bureau \nof Justice Statistics, fewer than 4 percent of all the Border Patrol \nagents work along the northern border.\n  Of course, until recently, we did not have to worry too much about \nour northern border. It has historically been the longest, most \npeaceful border in the entire world. Certainly, New York has a great \nstake in having a peaceful border, one that goods and people can cross \neasily because there is so much traffic between our two countries that \ngoes through our heavily trafficked crossings, places particularly like \nPlattsburgh and Buffalo, but also other places--Niagra Falls, Messina--\nand all of the communities along New York's Canadian border are deeply \nconcerned about how that border is protected and managed.\n  For too long, that has not been a concern, but now we know it is, and \nthe Federal Government has to step up to provide permanent, long-term \nprotection.\n\n  Homeland security begins with border security. That is why I strongly \nsupport this bill and am an original cosponsor. It is also why last \nOctober, after the terrible attacks of September 11, I wrote to \nDirector Ridge asking that he create a position within the Office of \nHomeland Security devoted to our northern border and all the issues \nwith Canada about which we are concerned to centralize those issues so \nthere would be one person to whom we could go to deal with our various \nconcerns. This legislation attempts to begin to address these concerns.\n  What does it do? First, it authorizes funding for this year and the \nnext 4 years for an additional 200 INS inspectors and 200 INS \ninvestigators over the amount already authorized in the terrorism bill \nfor the next 5 years. Increased funding is also authorized for training \nfacilities and security-related technologies for INS agents.\n  Second, it enhances information sharing. It contains provisions that \nconcern how we get information that is critical to law enforcement \navailable to all the Federal agencies and State and local law \nenforcement personnel who need to know what should be done to protect \nus and apprehend any violators. The INS, the Border Patrol, the Customs \nagents, the FBI--all of us need to have better cooperation.\n  In October of last year, I also introduced a bill, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Schumer, Leahy, and Hatch, that authorizes and \nencourages Federal intelligence agencies to share relevant information \nwith State and local officials whenever appropriate. It is important, \nif something is known in one Federal agency that could affect residents \nof Niagra Falls, that information be shared in a timely manner.\n  This reform act directs Federal law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies to share information with the INS and the State Department \nabout the admissibility and deportation of non-U.S. citizens.\n  It also calls upon the President to report regarding admission- and \ndeportation-related law enforcement and intelligence information needed \nby the INS and the Department of State to develop a formal information \nsharing plan.\n  Third, it addresses the issue of what is called ``interoperability'' \nof the INS systems. That is a long word which describes that sometimes \nthe right hand of INS does not know what the left hand or the left foot \nis doing. That is why we ended up with this absurd situation in which \nthe INS issued a visa for Mohamed Atta months after he piloted\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\none of those planes into the World Trade Center Towers. It was a \nterrible mistake that never should have happened.\n  The problem is the databases and data systems do not talk to each \nother; they are not up to speed. They would not even pass muster in \nmost businesses in America today. This bill calls upon the President to \ndevelop and implement an interoperable law enforcement and data system \nfor visa admissibility and deportation determination purposes. The INS \nmust integrate their systems. They have antiquated systems that do not \ndo the job, that cannot even talk to each other.\n  It also requires the State Department, upon issuing a visa, to \nprovide the INS with an electronic version of the alien's visa file \nbefore the alien enters the United States. In addition to addressing \nthis issue of interoperability, the bill also requires relevant Federal \nagencies to work toward implementing an integrated entry and exit \nsystem and to move toward developing and using tamper-resistant, \nmachine-readable documents containing biometric identifiers.\n  If we are able to put into the sky robot-controlled, predator \naircraft to track down and take out enemy artillery installations, we \nought to be able to figure out how to have a decent data system for the \nINS that can provide information to us and uses biometric identifiers \nright here on the ground to track down, deport, or arrest wherever \nnecessary anyone who intends to do us harm.\n  Next, we have to have the assurance that citizens of countries that \nsponsor terrorism will not be allowed to enter this country unless the \nSecretary of State determines that the person seeking entry does not \npose a security threat to the United States.\n  We have made it very easy for people to come back and forth. That is \nthe American tradition. Unfortunately, what we learned on 9-11 is that \nsome people in some countries take advantage of our hospitality and our \nwelcome to the United States. We have to support this provision which \nstarts from the premise that if you are coming from a state-sponsored \nterrorism base, even if you are totally innocent--you have nothing to \ndo with the intelligence services, you have nothing to do with \nterrorism--the burden is on you. We need to shift that presumption to \nmake sure we are not letting in people who are part of a terrorist \nnetwork.\n  Finally, with respect to foreign student visas and exchange visitors, \nthe bill requires the Justice Department to develop an electronic means \nof verifying and monitoring the Foreign Student and Exchange Visitor \nInformation Program, including aspects of documentation and visa \nissuance, U.S. admission, institution notification, documentation \ntransmittal, registration, and enrollment.\n  All educational institutions at which foreign students are registered \nmust notify the INS of the failure of such a student or an exchange \nvisitor to enroll within 30 days of the registration deadline.\n  Education is a privilege, and we are very pleased that in our country \nwe offer so many first-rate educational institutions to students from \naround the world, but again we have to be smart about this. We cannot \nlet anyone take advantage of our openness. We have to have a system so \nif someone says he or she is coming to study at one of our \nuniversities, that is not the end; that is the beginning of the process \nto determine whether that actually is the fact or whether, as we \nunfortunately learned post-9-11, there are people who claim to be \ncoming to this country to be students and that is not their intention \nwhatsoever.\n  These are a few of the many provisions in this bill that I believe \nwould make us a safer nation by securing our borders. There are \nprobably no people in our country more committed to passing this \nlegislation than the Families of September 11. I have heard from a \nnumber of the widows and parents of victims who have made it very clear \nthis is their top priority. MaryEllen Salamone, whose husband John was \nkilled by the terrorists on September 11 at the World Trade Center, was \nin Washington this past Friday representing Families of September 11 to \nurge us to act. She appeared before the Immigration Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee and said that all of us need to heed the warnings \nwe now know were flashing but no one could see them, read them, \nunderstand or apply them, so that we must now act to make sure nothing \nlike this can happen again.\n  The legislation is long overdue. It is much needed, and I call upon \nall of our colleagues to support it as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2695-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding today is finally the \nday, after 18 days, that we are going to have the great amendment on \nANWR. After all this time and all the promises, I think it is finally \ncoming up. We are looking with anticipation to this amendment and this \ndebate because this is really what we have been waiting for on the \nbill. We have been told that if we focus on what the Republicans want \non this bill, we will finally get the opportunity to debate it.\n  The reason I say that--and the Chair recognizes I am being a little \nfacetious--is that I have been out here many different days asking, \nWhen? Today? If you don't offer it, we are going to offer it--and all \nof these different things we have tried to do to get something moving \nforward on this legislation. But I do say I am glad it is finally going \nto be offered. It is my understanding it will be offered momentarily.\n  I say that because even though the Alaska wilderness is far removed \nfrom the State of Nevada where I was born and raised, the two climates \nare much alike in the sense that they are both delicate. People think \nthat Nevada deserts can be easily disturbed and that it doesn't matter. \nIn the past, our beautiful deserts have been treated that way in many \nrespects. Right near Searchlight where I was born and raised, during \nthe Second World War when we had the South African campaign, the troops \nwho were going overseas trained right below Searchlight. You can still \nsee today the tank tracks through some parts of that country. Even \nthough it is very arid, disturbance takes a long time to get rid of in \nthe desert.\n  We have in the desert what was called Camp Ibis. In that whole area, \nthere were about 2 million men training for the Second World War and \nfor campaigns around the world. We had, of course, the gunnery range. \nIt was called the Las Vegas Gunnery Range, which is now Nellis Air \nForce Base. We had Indian Springs Air Force Base, Stead Air Force Base, \nthe Fallon Naval Training Center, and the Hawthorne Ammunition Depot. \nThen of course in the high desert in Nevada, we had the Nevada Test \nSite where, to this point, almost 1,000 nuclear devices have been set \noff above ground and underground.\n\n  People have come to recognize that the desert is not a place you can \neasily disturb without having a long-lasting impact.\n  Outside the home I have in Searchlight, there are old Joshua trees \nand yucca trees. We also have creosote bushes, or greasewood trees. \nThey are especially beautiful when it rains because of the smell. The \naroma that comes off those bushes is interesting. You have bushes of \nall sizes, and those that are high off the ground are more than 100 \nyears old. Sometimes they are older than that. They grow little by \nlittle because there is no water in the desert.\n  My point in comparing the Alaska wilderness to what we have in Nevada\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nis that we have to be very careful how we handle and protect it. A \nmajority of the people in America do not want the ANWR disturbed \nbecause they believe there are areas that we should leave pristine and \nuntouched. People thought that in Nevada it didn't matter that the \ndesert tortoise needs lots of open space. We call them turtles, but the \nproper name is desert tortoise. There was a time when they were placed \non the endangered list. To protect these turtles, we have had to really \ndo lots of things differently. Because of the press of population, we \nare killing these animals. And extinction is forever. That is what we \nhave to recognize.\n  I will say what I have said here on a number of occasions. Out of 100 \npercent of the total oil reserves in the world, America, including \nANWR, has 3 percent of the oil reserves; 97 percent of the oil reserves \nare elsewhere. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have about 47 percent. As you \nknow, not only do they have large quantities of oil, but it is very \neasy to get out of the ground.\n  My point is that we must maintain some of our pristine wilderness \nareas. One of those we are going to protect is ANWR.\n  Eighty-seven percent of the land in the State of Nevada is owned by \nthe Federal Government. We are a very densely populated State. People \ndo not understand that. Most say that we are the most densely populated \nState in America. Why? Because 90 percent of the people live in two \nmetropolitan areas--Reno and Las Vegas.\n  Eighty-seven percent of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government. \nWhat does that mean? It means that 87 percent is as much yours as it is \nmine. I think we should do what we can to get more of that land into \nthe private sector. But I recognize that federal lands are as much \nyours as they are mine. That is the same as the ANWR wilderness. That \nland is as much mine as it is the Senator from Alaska.\n  I am going to do everything I can to protect that pristine wilderness \nbecause we don't have many areas in the whole world that are pristine, \nlet alone in the United States.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The underlying amendment was introduced by Senator \nStevens, myself, and Senator Breaux and, as a consequence, I think \ndeserves some explanation relative to the specifics that are in the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The items for consideration, some of which were in H.R. 4, include \nspecifically a 2,000-acre limitation on surface disturbance. \nSpecifically, an export ban of any oil from the refuge cannot under any \ncircumstances be exported, with the provision of authority for exports \nto Israel. Further, we would extend the U.S./Israeli oil supply \narrangement, which is due to expire in the year 2004, to the year 2014.\n  We would further have a wilderness increase designation, adding a \nmillion and a half acres of wilderness from the current refuge \nmanagement in the southern portion of the refuge.\n  Finally, there would be a Presidential finding--and this Presidential \nfinding is quite specific that the refuge would not be open until the \nPresident makes a finding it is in the national security interest of \nthis Nation.\n  There would also be a triggering mechanism such as energy supply, \nthreat to strategic reserves not sufficient to cover.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reflect a little bit on how the \nunderlying amendment was constructed. A great deal of time went into \nthis effort by Members of both parties. I know there has been some \nfrustration about the manner in which this amendment has been brought \nbefore the body, and I know there is a question of why we simply do not \nintroduce the House-passed bill, H.R. 4.\n  The reason is very simple. We have taken a radically different \napproach because, as I have indicated in my opening remarks, the \namendment we offer today does not open ANWR, per se. Let me repeat, the \namendment does not give the authority to open ANWR. Rather, the \namendment grants the President the authority to open the area for safe \nexploration only if he makes a determination it is in the national \nsecurity interest of this country. Obviously, the President has the \npower, given to him in the Constitution, for extraordinary \nresponsibilities associated with the decisionmaking process, and it is \nclearly appropriate in this time of crisis that the President be given \nthat authority.\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n  I think it is fair to say for far too long Congress has proved itself \nincapable of dealing with extreme and difficult issues that have \ndifficult political consequences, and this clearly is one of those \nissues. However, at this time in our Nation's history we can no longer \nafford, for our national security, to be held hostage to the massive \ndisinformation campaigns of some of the extreme environmental groups. \nSo we must move on. That is the responsibility of each Member of this \nbody.\n  Some who oppose opening ANWR are perhaps on autopilot right now and \nare gearing up for their rebuttals, but I ask them to stop for a few \nmoments and listen to what conditions must be met should the President \ndecide this action is in the national interest of the Nation because \nmany of those who will be opposed to this amendment do not know what \nthey are fighting about.\n  If development is moved forward, the following conditions must be \nmet: As I indicated, only 2,000 acres of surface disturbance on the \nCoastal Plain can occur. We have a chart that shows what the footprint \nis. It shows the entire area of ANWR, which is roughly 19 million \nacres, which equates to the size of the State of South Carolina. It \nalso recognizes there is within that 19 million acres both wilderness \nand refuge. We are proposing to add to the wilderness. We are going to \nincrease it from 8 million acres to 9.5 million acres, and we are going \nto reduce the refuge by that amount. So we are increasing the \nwilderness.\n  What does 1.5 million acres equate to? The green area is the 1002 \nANWR Coastal Plain. We are adding wilderness equal to that amount. That \nis the significance of what we believe is a responsible proposal that \naddresses the concerns of many who say in this area where you are \nproposing drilling in 1.5 million acres there should be some \nconsideration to more wilderness.\n\n  The authorization of the footprint in the 1.5 million acres is \nlimited by the House bill, limited in this Senate bill, to 2,000 acres, \nroughly 3.13 square miles. The area proposed is the little red dot. It \nwould be similar to a postage stamp being dropped on the floor of the \nSenate Chamber. That is what we are looking at.\n  For those under the misunderstanding that this area of ANWR is \nuntouched, let me show a few pictures of the actual footprint. There is \nthe village of Kaktovik. There are roughly 3,000 people in that \nvillage. They are American citizens, Alaskans. They have dreams for a \nbetter lifestyle, job opportunities, running water, things we take for \ngranted. That is their community. It is in ANWR. They feel very \nstrongly about supporting this because it improves their lives and \nimproves opportunities for their children, including educational \nopportunities.\n  This is a picture of the village meeting house in Kaktovik. Those are \nreal people, real kids. We have pictures of real kids going to school. \nNobody shovels the snow off the sidewalks in that community. Those are \nhappy Eskimo kids who dream about a better life. They dream about \nhaving running water and sewer lines.\n  Let me show you a honey bucket. Many Members dismiss this, suggesting \nthis is a Third World situation, not something that occurs in the \nUnited States. It does occur. It occurs in my State of Alaska. I will \nshare it. It is not the most pleasant sight in the world, but it \nrepresents a reality, the reality of a people who want a better \nlifestyle and jobs and opportunities associated with oil development. \nThat is a honey bucket. We don't have to look at it too long. It is not \ntoo pleasant.\n  This area is permafrost. That means the ground is frozen year-round. \nWater and sewer lines can only be obtained at great costs. We have that \nin Barrow, AK.\n  It is important to see the contrasts in the Arctic. Contrast the \ndevelopment of the responsible residents of the Arctic Eskimos and \nprimarily those in Barrow, Wainwright, and other villages. You cannot \ngo further north than Barrow, without falling off the top. The \nsignificance is that community has a tax base, revenues. They have \njobs. They have running water and sewer lines, things we take for \ngranted.\n  In this debate, few Members are going to get down into the earthy \nissues of what the people of my State want. That is a little beneath \nthe echelon around here, but it should not be. These are American \ncitizens. Their dreams are like yours and mine.\n  This map shows a small footprint in a very large area. We need to \nrecognize the arguments of today as opposed to the arguments of the \nlate 1960s. We built an 800-mile pipeline, from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. \nIt is 800 miles long. It is one of the construction wonders of the \nworld at a cost of $7.5 to $8 billion. It was supposed to come in at \nunder $1 billion. The pipeline has moved 20 to 25 percent of the total \ncrude oil produced in this country in the last 27 years. It has \nbeen bombed; it has survived earthquakes.\n\n  It has accommodated some of the animals. I will show Members what the \nbears think of the pipeline. They are going for a walk. Why are they \nwalking on the pipeline? It is easier than walking in the snow. There \nis a compatibility there because no one is shooting those bears. They \nblend in with the modest amount of activity.\n  I point out that the infrastructure is already in place. The 800-mile \npipeline is operating at half capacity. The prospects for finding a \nmajor discovery of oil in the 1002 area, according to the geologists, \nrange somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels. That is a lot of \noil.\n  But it is nothing if you don't compare it to something. What can you \ncompare it to? Let's try Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay is the largest \noilfield in North America. That is the harsh reality. It is almost 30-\nyear-old technology. If we have an opportunity to develop ANWR, we can \nmake that footprint much smaller because we went in 30 years to another \nfield called Endicott, which was 56 acres and produced 100,000 barrels \na day, coming on as the 10th largest producing field in North America \nand now is the 7th largest.\n  Getting back to a meaningful comparison, if indeed the estimated \nreserves are somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels, if it is \nhalf, that is roughly 10, and what was Prudhoe Bay supposed to be? It \nwas supposed to be 10 and it is now supplying its 13th billion barrel. \nWhen people say it is insignificant, is 25 percent of the total crude \noil produced insignificant?\n  There is more oil in ANWR than there is in all of Texas. I don't know \nwhat that means to my Texas friends, but it is a reality.\n  This is a jobs issue. This is a jobs issue associated with project \nlabor agreements. This pipeline simply cannot be built without the very \nimportant labor unions and their members. We don't have the skills. \nOnly organized labor has the skill. It is a very significant jobs \nissue. That is why virtually every union supports this effort.\n  There is another issue that has clouded a lot of the debate. That is \nthe issue of oil exports. I have heard time and time again: You will \ndevelop this area and export the oil to Japan. That is a fallacy. We \nhave not exported one drop of oil to Japan or any other nation since 2 \nyears ago last June. We provide Hawaii with oil.\n  Where does our oil go? From Valdez, AK, down the west coast of the \nUnited States, about half of it goes into Puget Sound. Some of it goes \ninto Oregon indirectly because Oregon doesn't have refineries. The rest \nof it goes down to San Francisco and Los Angeles where it is refined. \nThat is where the oil goes.\n  We also have an exclusion for Israel from the export ban, and we \nwould extend the U.S. oil supply arrangement with Israel for 10 more \nyears. The expiration date is 2004; we will extend it to 2014.\n  Let me talk about environment protections, export, labor agreements, \nand so forth because the amendment included almost 20 pages of \ncarefully drafted environmental standards that I suspect all 100 \nSenators should favor. These came in from environmental groups, from \nthe Department of the Interior, from the State of Alaska, the Governor, \nand many others. Among them are the imposition of seasonal limitations \nto protect denning and migration.\n  Let me show the area in the wintertime so you have an idea of what it \nis like about 10 to 10 \\1/2\\ months a year. It is a very harsh \nenvironment. Very harsh. There are no trees. There is ice, snow, and \noccasionally when there is a whiteout, it looks like the other side of \nthe chart. One cannot see the difference between the sky and the \nland. As a consequence, it is very hazardous\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nto fly in unless you are an experienced instrument pilot.\n\n  The point is, the limited activity associated with ANWR is primarily \nin the very short spring when there is a migration through the area. \nThere is not going to be any development. There is not going to be any \nactivity. That is why the imposition by the Secretary of seasonal \nlimitations is so important. It is prudent management.\n  Further, there is a requirement of the lessees to reclaim the leased \nland. If oil is developed there, it is going to have to all be \nreclaimed. It further requires the use of the best commercially \navailable technology. That means the industry has to go out and get the \nvery best.\n  It requires the use of ice roads, ice pads, and ice airstrips for \nexploration. Let me show you what an ice road looks like. That is an \nice road. It is going to a well in the Arctic, in the Prudhoe Bay area. \nFor those who suggest there is something unique about the Prudhoe Bay \narea vis-a-vis the Kaktovik area--it pretty much looks the same.\n  The interesting thing here is this is new technology. We did not use \nthat in Prudhoe Bay because we did not have it. Now it is ice roads. \nYou make your roads out of ice--very limited activity.\n  One of the provisions is to prohibit public use on all pipeline \naccess or service roads. So you are not going to have visitors, \nhunters, fishermen, and so forth.\n  I think we have another chart that shows what the same area looks \nlike in the summertime. That is roughly 2.5 months of the year. That is \nall we really have, free of ice and snow. You can see the small lake--\nthere is a little well there. That is a pretty small footprint. I have \nheard people say you are going to have jet airports, you are going to \nhave cities. That is absolutely preposterous.\n  Further, it requires there be no significant adverse effect on fish \nand wildlife, which is referred to many times throughout this \namendment, and it requires consolidation of facility siting. It \nrequires the Secretary of the Interior to close certain special areas \nof unique character and maybe close additional areas after consultation \nwith local communities.\n  Finally, surface disturbance of 2,000 acres of the Coastal Plain--\n2,000 acres out of 1.5 million acres in the Coastal Plain. And we are \nadding 1.5 million acres of wilderness. That footprint is the size of a \npostage stamp on this floor.\n  Let me chat a little bit about national security because I think that \nis germane to our consideration. This amendment is a matter of national \nsecurity. I do not think we really reflect on the fact that this Nation \nis at war. Just 7 months ago, our Nation was under attack. Regarding \nour dependence on foreign oil, that attack has brought forth more and \nmore awareness of what the merits of reducing our dependence are and \nthe recognition that this is probably more important now than ever, as \nwe look at the chaos in the Mideast. Within the last few days, more \nthan 30 percent of our oil imports are currently threatened with the \nself-imposed Iraqi embargo, and God knows what the political upheaval \nin Venezuela will lead to, plus what is going on in Colombia with \nthreats to the pipeline. Those countries export a large amount of crude \noil to the United States. The point is, we can no longer rely on a \nstable supply of imported oil.\n  I would like to refer to artwork painted by a famous artist who \nhailed from New England, the State of Vermont. It was painted by Norman \nRockwell for the U.S. Office of War in 1943, entitled ``Mining \nAmerica's Coal.'' There is the coal miner. It is a picture of a coal \nminer, and you notice his blue star pin, which shows he had two sons in \nthe war. This type of poster was displayed in America's places of \nwork--the shipyards, the factories--specifically to encourage war-\nrelated industries to increase output.\n\n  We are at war now. Where are the posters? Developing our own \nresources is just as important as it was in World War II. We need oil \nto transport our families, but we also need it to transport our troops, \nand we are going to need it in the future. The reality is that air \npower and naval power cannot function without oil. In spite of what we \ncreate around here, you do not fly out of Washington, DC, on hot air. \nThe Navy no longer uses sails; it is oil.\n  While the public can generalize about alternative energy sources, the \nworld--and the United States--moves on oil. We wish we had another \nalternative, but we do not. In the meantime, the Third World developing \ncountries are going to require more oil, and so this Nation becomes \nmore vulnerable unless we are committed to reduce our dependence on \nimported oil.\n  Some would hint that wind power is viable as an alternative to oil. \nAs I said before, you are not going to be able to move troops on wind \npower or solar power. You are going to need oil.\n  As we look at our relationship with Iraq, opening ANWR will certainly \nmake us less dependent on countries such as Iraq.\n  Let me show you a picture of our friend Saddam Hussein. There he is. \nI do not know how much attention is going to have to be given by \nAmerica and its elected leadership to recognize what this means. Saddam \nHussein is saying: Oil as a weapon.\n  What was the last experience we had with a weapon? It was three \naircraft used as weapons. What happened? Catastrophe for America. \nAmerica will never be the same: The two trade towers are gone; the \nPentagon; the heroic effort to try to take over the control of the \naircraft that crashed in Pennsylvania. Aircraft are now weapons of war. \nOil is a weapon of war.\n  On the first day of April, Iraq's ruling Baath Party confirmed our \nworst fears when it issued a statement saying ``use oil as a weapon in \nthe battle with the enemy.'' Of course they meant Israel. Outrageous \nstatements such as these confirm what we have been saying all along: We \nsimply must not rely on Iraq. We must reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  What is the estimate? USGS, the Department of the Interior, suggest \nthat we could, by opening ANWR, reduce our current dependence, which is \n1 million barrels a day from Iraq. That would provide this Nation with \na 40-year supply, equal to what we import from Iraq. Last year we sent \nIraq over $4 billion.\n  Here are the crude oil imports from Iraq to the United States in \n2001: 283 million barrels. It has gone up each month. In December it \nwas 1.1 million a day.\n  Look at the irony of what happened in September. In September we had \nan all-time high of almost 1.2 million barrels a day from Iraq. We all \nknow what happened in September.\n  We have a photo of our friend Saddam Hussein up here. Here he is: \nAmerican families count on Saddam Hussein for energy.\n  Every time you go to the gas station, you are in effect funding Iraq, \nand Iraq is funding terrorism. Is there a connection there? Members \nsay: Senator Murkowski, this is not going to replace our dependence on \nforeign oil. I certainly acknowledge that. But it is going to reduce \nit. It is going to send a very strong message to the cartels of OPEC, \nand the other nations upon which we depend, that we mean business about \nreducing our dependence on imported oil.\n  In 2001, America imported a total of 287.3 million barrels of oil \nfrom Iraq. Looking at a map of imports, according to the Energy \nInformation Administration, you ought to know who gets some of their \noil. There are different States. I will identify some of the States \nbecause it causes a little reflection. That is just what it should \ncause.\n  Mr. President, 48.1 million barrels of Iraqi oil were imported into \nCalifornia; 4.9 billion barrels of Iraqi oil were imported into New \nJersey; 1\\1/2\\ million barrels into Minnesota; Washington; and the list \ngoes on. Don't think somebody else is getting the oil. It is going into \nall of the States in red--New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, \nKentucky, Missouri, Minnesota, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and \nTexas. That is where it is going.\n  To make matters even worse, Saddam Hussein recently announced that he \nis increasing money relative to the suicide bombers from $10,000 to \n$25,000. We revolt at even the thought of that. But you have to \nrecognize that is an incentive, and it is still going on. Since the \nprices have been raised in the last month, we have had at least 12 \nsuicide bombers who have been successful in their acts of terrorism in \nIsrael. Saddam Hussein is rewarding the acts of murderers who are \nspreading terrorism\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nthroughout the free world. One wonders if it will come to the shores of \nthe United States.\n  As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said:\n\n       Saddam's payments promote a culture of political murder.\n\n  That is a pretty harsh statement. It comes from our Defense \nSecretary. I couldn't agree more. With facts such as these, it is \nimpossible for me to imagine why we would want to send one more \nAmerican dollar to this man.\n  I just looked at an article that appeared today, April 16, in the \nWall Street Journal. It is entitled ``Iraqi President Saddam Hussein \nPraises Suicide Bombers, Urges Iran Oil Halt.''\n  It said:\n\n       Iraq's President Saddam Hussein who sends cash to the \n     families of Palestinian suicide bombers reiterated his \n     support for the attacks, Iraqi media reported Tuesday. The \n     Iraqi leader during a meeting with military officers and \n     engineers on Monday night--today is Tuesday, Mr. President--\n     said, ``Suicide attacks were legitimate means used by people \n     whose land is being occupied.''\n       Moslems have been divided over suicide bombings, with some \n     saying Islam forbids any suicide, others condemning bombers \n     for attacking civilians, and others, such as Saddam, \n     supporting them without reservation. Saddam has made payments \n     up to $10,000 to families of Palestinian suicide bombers \n     since the Israeli-Palestinian clashes began in September \n     2000.\n       In his comments on Monday, Saddam also urged Iran to follow \n     Iraq in cutting off oil exports for 1 month to support the \n     Palestinians and to return 140 Iraqi warplanes and civilian \n     planes that escaped to Iran during the 1991 gulf war. Iran \n     claims only 22 Iraqi planes. He urged the Arab governments \n     not to yield to ``U.S.-Zionist blackmail'' in which Zionism \n     and those from that area are using Hitler's deeds against \n     Jews in addition to the September 11 order to subdue the \n     world.\n\n  Those are the comments of one who obviously is unstable.\n  Saddam gets roughly $25,000 from us, this Nation, for oil every 90 \nseconds that pass. That is one homicide bombing every 90 seconds. Think \nabout it.\n  What are we going to do about it? We are talking about it, but we \nwould like to ignore it because it is very unpleasant. He is rewarding \nthe acts of murderers who are spreading terrorism. As I have indicated, \nour Secretary of Defense called it a ``culture of political murder.''\n  There are a lot of tensions in the Mideast. They are rising \nexponentially each day and each hour. Why some of my colleagues would \nbe interested in continuing our reliance on oil from that part of the \nworld is simply beyond me, especially at this time when we can make a \ncommitment to reduce it.\n  I, for one, would find it very difficult to go back to my home State \nof Alaska and defend that position, especially if I had to look into \nthe eyes of a mother or father such as the American depicted in this \nRockwell work who, as we speak, had a son or daughter overseas fighting \nfor America's freedoms.\n  I have stood on this floor and made the comparison time and time \nagain that as we import oil from Iraq, we are also enforcing an aerial \nblockade and the no-fly zone over Iraq. We have bombed them three times \nalready this year. We take his oil, put it into our airplanes, and go \nbombing. That may be an oversimplification with which the State \nDepartment would argue.\n  But, by the same token, what does Saddam Hussein do with his money? \nHe keeps his Republican Guard well fed, and they keep him alive. He \ndevelops weapons of mass destruction, and aims it at whom? We know he \nhas a missile delivery system capable of going to Israel. We know he is \ndeveloping biological weapons. We suspect he might be developing \nnuclear weapons.\n  When are we going to address that threat? That is a real \nresponsibility for our President because, as we have seen with the \ntragedies associated with September 11, had we known, we would have \ntaken action to prevent that. The same set of circumstances apply to \nSaddam Hussein. There have not been U.N. inspectors in Iraq for over 2 \nyears. He is in violation of his agreement with the U.N. He is a threat \nto the world, and we are still depending on him.\n  Wake up, America. It is time.\n  In addition to the amendment being about national security, it is \nalso about the economic security of this country. It is projected to \ncreate jobs--real jobs. We just came from a rally outside. We had \norganized labor in support of this issue. We have had the veterans \nsaying they would much rather see us open ANWR than send American men \nand women to foreign soil to fight a war over oil. A former Senator in \nthis body, Mark Hatfield, made that statement several times. He said: I \nwill vote for opening ANWR any day rather than sending another American \nsoldier overseas to fight a war over oil on foreign soil.\n  One of the interesting things about that particular study--jobs in \nthe area of 250,000--was it was conducted by a Massachusetts firm, \nMcGraw-Hill. The capability of that firm I will leave to those more \nqualified than I and who reside in the State of Massachusetts. Some \nhave quibbled about the numbers, but it is a step in the right \ndirection. Every single new job created is important, especially in \nthese times, and especially for those who are in the unfortunate \nposition of being unemployed. These aren't service jobs working at \nMcDonald's; these are high-paying jobs associated with responsible \ndevelopment of our resources--jobs created throughout America, not just \nmy State of Alaska.\n  One thing about the movement of oil, as I indicated, is that it goes \nfrom Alaska and down to the west coast of the United States where it is \nconsumed. But it has to go in U.S. ships that are built in U.S. yards \nwith U.S. crews and which carry the U.S. flag because the Jones Act \nmandates that the carriage of any goods between two American ports has \nto be in a U.S.-flagged vessel. There are as many as 19 new double-hull \ntankers to be constructed. That means jobs in America's shipyards--big \njobs, good-paying jobs. This is the largest contribution of tonnage to \nthe American merchant marine.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I just ask a strictly procedural \nquestion of my colleague?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Please, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague--so we can try to get a \nsense of planning how we will proceed--what he would anticipate in \nterms of how long he thinks he may be presenting the amendment. Then we \ncan get a sense of how we might go forward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will probably be talking for another \n20 minutes or thereabouts. There is a second degree pending, and \nSenator Stevens is anticipating recognition to talk about his second \ndegree so I am guessing probably an hour.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska very much. \nAnd I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me again make reference to the creation of what \nthis would do for America's merchant marine.\n  It would result in some 19 new double-hull tankers to be constructed \nin U.S. shipyards, primarily in the gulf and the State of California \nand, I would hope, in the State of Maine.\n  It is estimated that these tankers will pump about $4 billion into \nthe U.S. economy. That will create about 2,000 to 5,000 jobs in our \nshipyards. And this isn't going to require a Government subsidy. These \nare private funds that will build these ships to haul U.S. oil from my \nState of Alaska to Washington, Oregon, and California.\n  Somebody did a little calculation and figured that is equivalent to \n90,000 job-years just for the construction of the tankers alone. Also, \nthe equivalent in infrastructure to be used in ANWR will be constructed \nnot in my State but in the other States of this Nation--not in the \nArctic of Alaska. Therefore, Americans from all over the country will \nbe put to work in this effort.\n  The other alternative is to simply send the dollars overseas, which \naffects the balance of payments and does not keep the jobs or the \ndollars here.\n  Some opponents note that oil will not be flowing the day after the \nANWR amendment is passed. But what they forget is jobs certainly can be \nflowing the day after. Americans could go to work constructing \neverything that will be needed.\n  If you wonder about the numbers, listen to those who are in the \nbusiness, the unions. They will benefit from new ANWR jobs, and they \nhave been behind\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nthis effort 110 percent. And why not? These are American jobs. These \nare American unions. They have already had almost 30 years of \nexperience in the Arctic in Prudhoe Bay, and they know, firsthand, the \nkind of jobs ANWR will create and they know how to do it right. So \nlet's put America to work.\n  The things we have to talk about, as well, are projections because we \nreally do not know how much oil is in ANWR. There has only been one \nwell ever drilled, and it has been on the Native land at Kaktovik shown \nup there at the top of the map I have in the Chamber. But there is one \nwell. The results of that well have been kept confidential by the \nNative community, the State of Alaska, and the two companies, the joint \nventure.\n  But geologists, based on 2-D seismic, prior to 1980, had some access \nin the area. They have gone back and reviewed their analysis, and they \nhave come to the conclusion that, indeed, this area could contain the \nlargest amount of oil in North America.\n\n  Some are going to downplay the amount of oil in ANWR, but even \nnumbers from the Clinton administration, the U.S. Geological Survey \nshowed that the Arctic Coastal Plain clearly was North America's best \nbet for a major oilfield. The Clinton administration's U.S. Geological \nSurvey estimated, in 1998, that there was a 5-percent chance of finding \n16 billion barrels, a 50-percent chance of finding 10.3 billion \nbarrels, and a 95-percent chance of finding 5.7 billion barrels.\n  I want to put this in context. Texas has proven reserves of 5.3 \nbillion barrels. So the projections indicate that ANWR, indeed, has \nmore oil than all of Texas. Is that significant to this body? Is that \nsignificant to Members other than those from the State of Texas?\n  Even if the most conservative effort of 5.7 billion barrels proves to \nbe correct, it would still be the second largest oilfield ever \ndiscovered in the 100-year history of the U.S. oil industry, and it \nwould be second only to what? Second only to Prudhoe Bay. If the 5-\npercent estimate proves right--16 billion barrels--ANWR would be the \nlargest field ever found in North America. To anyone who knows anything \nabout oil and gas in this country, these numbers are truly staggering.\n  Some Members have come to this Chamber and have argued that there is \nonly a 6-month supply there. But I would hope all Members have \nenlightened themselves on that argument because it is so misleading it \nhardly bears a response. But for the benefit of those who might not \nhave come to grips with it, a 6-month supply assumes that there would \nbe no other source of oil, no other source imported, no production in \nthis country of any kind other than ANWR--no imports, no domestic \nsupply.\n  This is a bogus argument. We are going to produce oil. We are going \nto continue to import oil. So it would only be a 6-month supply of oil \nif there was no other oil produced domestically and none imported. So \nthat is a fallacious argument.\n  It is also important to look at how ANWR will impact our domestic \nproduction. Along these lines, it is fair to recognize the Energy \nInformation Administration--which, by the way, provides impartial \nenergy assessment--recently provided an analysis of ANWR's effect on \ndomestic oil production.\n  This is what it said about the project: Assuming the USGS mean case \nfor oil in ANWR, there would be an increase of domestic production by \n13.9 percent.\n  That is the answer to those who say the increase is of no \nconsequence--13.9 percent. They say: Assuming USGS's higher case for \nANWR, that would be an increase of 25.4 percent of domestic production. \nAn increase of domestic production by 25 percent is certainly \nsignificant.\n  Let's put some of the ANWR projections into perspective.\n  If ANWR yields the Clinton administration's medium estimate of 10.4 \nbillion barrels of oil, ANWR would then provide--and I want to go to \nsome States because it is important that States get some comprehension \nof how much that would provide--it would provide Massachusetts with 87 \nyears of its oil needs. That is based on the 117 million barrels used \nin Massachusetts in 1999. It would provide Connecticut with 132 years \nof Connecticut's oil needs; for South Dakota, roughly 479 years, based \non 21 million barrels it used in 1999.\n  How can Members from those States argue that ANWR is not projected to \nhave a lot of oil, with those numbers? It is a lot of oil.\n  We have heard from Members who are a little disillusioned with the \nprogress of the energy bill talk about CAFE. They say: The answer is \nCAFE. If we would just go to CAFE, we could save millions and millions \nof barrels of oil.\n  I think it is interesting to reflect a little bit about CAFE because \nif the proposal of increasing CAFE standards is the answer instead of \nopening ANWR, it reflects on a couple realities. The Senate has already \nrejected the argument, No. 1, and, more importantly, the consumers \nrejected that argument through their purchasing choices.\n  This is important to recognize. The top 10 most fuel-efficient \nvehicles account for less than 2 percent of all vehicle sales. Think \nabout that. The public has a choice, and the top 10 most fuel-efficient \nvehicles account for less than 2 percent of all vehicle sales.\n  What do we want to do here? Do we want to direct the public on what \nkind of automobiles they have to buy? That is one answer. We could put \na tax on heavier automobiles; that is another answer. But the proposal \nthey have been pushing, known as the Kerry amendment, is simply not \nacceptable to the American people, as evidenced by the vote on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  It would force increases in fleet average fuel economy to 36 miles \nper gallon by the year 2016. It would cause massive losses of U.S. auto \nworkers' jobs, roughly 200,000, as the debate pointed out. It would \ncost several tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy. It would \nput American lives at risk in smaller, lighter vehicles. The Senate \ntook these concerns into consideration when it addressed CAFE several \nweeks ago and rejected the Kerry amendment. Instead, the Senate voted \nfor the Levin-Bond approach, which resolved the issue in favor of \nletting the experts--not the Congress, the Senate--at NHTSA do their \njobs.\n\n  Opening ANWR doesn't take away jobs or cost lives. Opening ANWR would \ncreate jobs for hard-working Americans. When we get into the argument \nof CAFE, be very careful and reflect on the debate that took place; it \nwould be a convenient copout for the argument against reality. The \nworld moves on oil. America moves on oil. As the Third World develops, \nthere is going to be more and more requirements for oil, until such \ntime as we obviously reduce our dependence by increasing production \nhere at home.\n  The time to act is now, and for those who suggest that somehow we are \nrushing into ANWR, let me tell you, I have been in this body for almost \n22 years. I have been with it all the time and so has Senator Stevens \nand others. Amazingly, some of the biggest opponents of ANWR have \nindicated we are rushing into this issue and we are moving it through \nthe system too fast.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. Some of the same Senators \nhave been involved in this debate for years, as I have said. You can go \nback to 1980, when Congress passed the Alaskan National Interest \nConservation Act and included the section 1002 area, which is up on top \nin the green on the chart.\n  The 1002 area required that the Department of the Interior report to \nthe Congress on the biological resources and the oil and gas potential \non the Coastal Plain of ANWR--this green area. The Department of the \nInterior extensively researched the issue and, after 7 years, a final \nlegislative environmental impact statement was submitted to Congress \nrecommending that ANWR's Coastal Plain be opened. That was the \nDepartment of the Interior, after 7 years of research.\n  Now, when we talk about CAFE and about increasing the vehicle fuel \nefficiency standard, we want it to be done rationally, safe--not just \npicking a mileage standard out of the air.\n  We talked about the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration. We talked about the fact that Democrats and Republicans \noverwhelmingly rejected what was an arbitrary new standard because it \nwould force American families to buy unsafe cars in the name of fuel \nefficiency. That was a conscious decision. The American people knew we \ncould get higher CAFE, but they didn't want to\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\ntrade safety for it. As a consequence, I don't want Washington ordering \nAmerican families to buy certain types of vehicles. We can talk about \nsolar and wind, and that isn't going to help us in this argument and we \nknow that.\n  Now, Congress has addressed ANWR. At other times, we have had \nlegislation introduced. We have had hearings. In 1995, a conference \nreport authorized the opening of ANWR and it was passed. So in 1995, \nCongress passed ANWR, but it was vetoed by the Clinton administration. \nIf it had not been vetoed in 1995, we would have oil already flowing \nfrom ANWR, as I speak today.\n  Now, there is a projection of revenue from the sale of royalties and \nthe royalty bids, and the lease bids alone will produce roughly $1.5 \nbillion in Federal funds. This is not with any appropriation or \nauthorization. This is the private sector funding, if you will, this \nlevel of activity in bonus bids and royalties. Where does the money go? \nIt goes into the Treasury basically because these are Federal lands. \nThis amount does not include the billions of dollars that will be \ngenerated from royalties in the outyears because, again, we have been \nproducing in Prudhoe Bay for 27 years, to be exact.\n\n  ANWR is the only provision in this bill that generates any revenue. I \nwill repeat that. In this entire energy bill that we have labored over \nfor some 5 weeks, ANWR is the only provision that generates revenue of \nany consequence, and this is from the private sector, not \nappropriations. Many other provisions in this bill do the exact \nopposite. They simply authorize new programs that would require further \nGovernment spending.\n  Now, there used to be a policy around here--and Senator Stevens is \nwell aware of it; he has been here longer than I--that was evident when \nI came here in 1981. Senator Scoop Jackson was certainly one who \nfostered it. It was kind of the general feeling that if the two \nSenators from the State supported an issue, the consensus was they \nprobably knew what was best for their State and what was best in \nrepresenting the people of that State. So don't forget, there is a \nStates right issue here. Don't forget what Alaska's attitude in this \nis. The entire congressional delegation supports it, including the \nGovernor, Lieutenant Governor, and the Alaska State Legislature. Most \nimportantly of all, the Eskimo people, the residents, of the Coastal \nPlain and nearly 75 percent of Alaskans support it.\n  There is a photo of some of the Eskimo kids who are looking to the \nfuture. They want running water. They want to have an educational \nopportunity, a job opportunity. It is important to remember this \nbecause on many occasions other Senators have made passionate arguments \nregarding activities in their States.\n  Although we talk about agricultural supports, and various other \nissues, I am reminded of the Senator from Florida and his attitude \nregarding lease sale 181 last summer, representing the wishes of the \npeople of Florida. As a result of the Florida delegation's advocacy, \nthe lease sale boundaries were scaled back by the administration.\n  Senator Stevens and I are doing the same thing. We are representing \nthe wishes of our State. It is unfair for people from other parts of \nthe Nation to obstruct the will of our citizens. Florida has said ``not \nin my backyard'' and that is fine. They have a right to do that, and I \nrespect that. But there is a bit of a reciprocity here. Alaskans are \nwilling to have environmentally sound exploration take place in their \nbackyard, so why not let them?\n  We have a chart that shows development, if you will, on the east \ncoast and the west coast and, hopefully, we have it--yes. I think it \nrepresents ``not in my backyard.'' If you look at that chart, you can \nsee the blue area off the east coast of the United States. That is \nroughly 31 trillion cubic feet of gas. The only problem is, there is no \nauthorization or authority for exploration. That is from Maine to \nFlorida. That is off limits. They don't want it in their backyard. If \nyou go down to the gulf, there is a good portion of it.\n  On the west coast--Washington, Oregon, and California--no way; no \nlease sales offshore.\n  If you go into the overthrust belt, in Wyoming, Montana, and \nColorado, there is a significant potential for oil production. It has \nbeen withdrawn by the previous administration as a consequence of the \nroadless area language.\n  If it is not in my backyard, where is it? One spot, obviously, is \nAlaska, and I think we have made the case that clearly the State of \nAlaska supports this.\n  We have had debates in this Chamber. I remember when the Senator from \nCalifornia announced her displeasure with the current administration's \ndecision to appeal a case impacting 36 drilling leases off the \nCalifornia shore. She stated that there is a disregard for States to \nmake decisions about their own environment.\n  The Senator from California proposes that leases be withdrawn from \nCalifornia's coast and swapped to Louisiana's coast. She actually said:\n\n       We are going to swap it so that the oil companies can drill \n     where people want them to drill.\n\n  In other words, the industry can drill where there is support for it. \nUnfortunately, that does not seem to apply to Alaska.\n  It is the old saying: Not in my backyard. The people of Florida and \nCalifornia should remember that if oil is not found in other parts of \nthe country, there may come a time when we are forced to explore closer \nto their shores. In fact, the Senator from Massachusetts has suggested \nwe focus on more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. He has even called for \nfour times more drilling in the gulf.\n  Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is fine, but I do not understand why \nMembers should think it is any better for the wildlife than development \nin ANWR. It should be noted there are many more species in the Gulf of \nMexico than there are in ANWR.\n  Speaking of other Senators, let's look at the New England States. New \nEngland enjoys the benefit of getting their natural gas from big \noffshore platforms off Nova Scotia. When it comes to America getting \noil from its own land in ANWR, some of the Senators from the east coast \nare trying to lead the challenge for the opposition. Although the \ndrilling for natural gas may be offshore, off the coast of Nova Scotia, \nit requires onshore gas processing facilities on Canadian land. \nRemember, whatever happens to Canada's environment is closely linked \nwith our own. If they really thought drilling for energy was so bad for \nthe environment, they would have sponsored a bill barring the Canadian \ngas from entering the United States. But, obviously, charity begins at \nhome.\n  If there is concern about the effects on the environment, I would \nthink some of the Senators would have concerns with the effects of \noffshore drilling on New England's fisheries, but that is never brought \nup. When it comes to Alaska, they are standing in the way of something \nthat at least 75 percent of Alaskans support.\n  Looking at other activities, in the State of Massachusetts, the ``big \ndig'' has been dragging on for years. Some environmentalists are not \npleased with it, but the ``big dig'' has not been interrupted. Instead, \nit has produced thousands and thousands of jobs in Massachusetts, and \nthat is good for Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts Senators should \ntake credit for it. But why can't citizens of Alaska be permitted the \nsame rights?\n  Finally, let's not forget the only people who are located within the \nboundaries of ANWR are our Native people. In fact, they reside on their \nown land.\n  I am going to put up the picture of Kaktovik again because I think it \nis representative of reality. Many people choose to overlook reality \nand think there is no footprint, there is nobody there. That is not the \ncase. They are the Inupiats, a proud people, and they live in the \nKaktovik by choice. They have lived there for thousands of years and \nsupport opening ANWR.\n\n  They graciously invited some of the most outspoken opponents of ANWR \nto Kaktovik so they could see firsthand their way of life. \nUnfortunately, the Inupiats did not get the courtesy of a reply because \nof the intervention of the Sierra Club and some environmental groups \nwho used their influence, if you will--and I am being gracious--to not \nallow the people associated with some of the villages that occupy the \nGwich'in nation even to go up and look at the prosperity associated \nwith the Eskimos in the Barrow and Wainwright area.\n  A number of invitations have been extended to Members of the Senate\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nfrom the Inupiat Eskimos. It is too bad Senators have not taken them up \non their offer because the Inupiats have a very interesting and \ncompelling story to tell. They are for self-determination. They want \nthe right to improve their lifestyle and that of their children, and \nthis amendment supports that right of self-determination and their \nright to develop and live on their land as they please.\n  They have some 92,000 acres that have been held hostage by the \nFederal Government long enough. The opponents often gloss over the fact \nthat the Inupiat Eskimos hold title to the land in the Coastal Plain. \nThey do not pay any attention to it. They assume those people up there \nwill just have to somehow work out their lives, but only Congress can \ngive them the authority to have access.\n  Without congressional approval to open the Coastal Plain, they are \nunable to develop their privately owned land. There are the 95,000 \nacres consisting of the village of Kaktovik and the one well that was \ndrilled in that area. Responsible development will allow the Inupiat \nEskimos to provide for themselves, heat their homes, provide education, \nand live in sanitary conditions.\n  Again, the plumbing in the Arctic is not sanitary. It is not \npleasant. There are honey buckets. They want a better lifestyle. They \nbelieve responsible development in the area is their fundamental human \nright to economic self-determination.\n  This amendment would still allow the Inupiat Eskimos to enforce \nregulatory powers to make sure the wildlife and traditional \nenvironmental values are respected and protected. After all, who is \nmore concerned about the caribou than the Native people who reside \nthere and live off them?\n  Let me show another picture about the caribou. It reflects the \nreality. My colleagues have seen it before, but these are not stuffed \ncaribou, these are real caribou, and they are roaming the fields of \nPrudhoe Bay. Nobody is running them down with a snow machine. Nobody is \nshooting at them. They are protected, and they wander, and they \nincrease.\n  When we hear debate about the Porcupine herd--this is the western \nArctic herd right in the heart of the oil fields. When we started 27 \nyears ago, there were 3,000 or 4,000 animals. Today there are 26,000 \nanimals. We do not want to confuse the Inupiat Eskimo or the Gwich'ins \nwho live hundreds of miles away from the Coastal Plain, but we have \ncharts that show a little activity on the Canadian side because, as my \ncolleagues know, Alaska does share a border with Canada, and the \nGwich'ins are on both sides of Alaska and Canada.\n  It is known that while the Inupiat Eskimos living on the Coastal \nPlain support opening ANWR, clearly the environmental groups have had \nto search far and wide for someone to foster their cause, and roughly \n150 miles south of Kaktovik beyond the Brooks Range outside the ANWR \nboundary, they have found significant support, an Arctic village and \nother villages, the basic traditional home of the Gwich'ins.\n  I admire and respect the Gwich'ins for their wishes, but I hate to \nsee environmentalists trotting this indigenous group around saying \nopening ANWR will hurt their caribou. There is no evidence to suggest \nthat.\n  The greatest harm to the caribou--this is rather significant because \nwhile it may seem confusing, everything on the right of the line \nstraight up and down is Canada and everything on the left is Alaska. \nOne can see the purple. This is the Porcupine caribou herd as they move \naround during migration. They are on the edge of the 1002 area for a \nshort time during the short summer, but in their migration they do go \nthrough Canada. They cross the Dempster Highway.\n  At the Dempster Highway during their migration, there is a \nsignificant number of caribou that are taken for subsistence, sport, \nand for, obviously, those who need them, the point being, the Gwich'ins \nhave under previous discussions entered into leases for their own land.\n  This is a copy of the actual lease, Native Village of Venetie. They \nindicated a willingness in March of 1994 to lease their land. For \nanyone who questions the details, I am happy to provide a copy of the \nlease. I am simply saying they have a right to choose what they want to \ndo, but at that particular time they were willing to lease their land. \nUnfortunately, there was not much interest in it because the prospects \nfor oil discovery were not in the area.\n  So I think what we should recognize is the central Arctic caribou \nherd is a herd with which we have had experience. They have increased \nfrom 6,000 to 26,000, increasing by more than four times. As the \nenvironmentalists have addressed this argument, why, it is pretty weak \nto suggest we cannot manage this herd for the benefit of the indigenous \npeople. I think it is fair to say, as we look at development, there is \nno evident harm to these lands or the potential of anything of any \nconsequence affecting the lifestyle of those people.\n  As we have tried to address the concerns of the Gwich'ins, the \ndifficulty has been encouraging them to simply visit the Eskimos of the \nArctic to reflect on what development has meant to their standard of \nliving. What we have in this amendment are protections. We have \nrecommendations that require all the lands be returned to their natural \nstate, and we also have the recognition that, while the Gwich'ins have \nbeen opposing activity on the Alaska side, they have been very \naggressively pursuing it on the Canadian side. The Gwich'ins in Canada \nhave formed development corporations, as they should. They have an \noilfield service company, which they have every right to do.\n  So this debate should not revolve simply around the Gwich'ins, \nrecognizing that many of them do not live near the Coastal Plain. \nInstead, we should remember the Inupiat Eskimos who own land right in \nthe Coastal Plain. So there is a difference, and I encourage Members to \nreflect on it.\n  Finally, the Inupiat argument is compelling. It is an important one. \nMy friend Jacob Adams, who is an Inupiat, is president of the Arctic \nSlope Regional Corporation, one of the Fortune 500 companies, a very \nsuccessful corporation in my State, and I quote his statement:\n\n       I love my life in the Arctic. But, it is harsh, expensive \n     and, for many, short. My people want decent homes, \n     electricity, and education. We do not want to be undisturbed. \n     Undisturbed means abandoned. It means sod huts and \n     deprivation.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       By locking up ANWR, the Inupiat people are asked to become \n     museum pieces, not a dynamic and living culture. We are asked \n     to suffer the burdens of locking up our lands forever as if \n     we were in a zoo or on display for the rich tourists that can \n     afford to travel to our remote part of Alaska. This is not \n     acceptable.\n\n  I agree, it is not acceptable. I recognize this entire debate is \ncomplex and sometimes puts Members in uncomfortable positions, but I \nalso realize this energy debate, especially in regard to ANWR, has been \nused as a soapbox for some of the most extreme and crafty environmental \ngroups in our country, groups that have treasure chests to support \ntheir agenda.\n  While the issues are complex and the debate has at times become \nheated, the big picture can still be framed very simply. Is it not \nbetter to have a strong domestic energy policy that safeguards our \nenvironment and our national security rather than to rely on the likes \nof Saddam Hussein to supply our energy? The answer is clearly yes.\n  I, unfortunately, realize that some in this Chamber have found that \nANWR has become a political issue. It is another piece of the political \npuzzle. They could not be more wrong. I have been around long enough to \nknow that lots of people do things for their own reason, but when their \nactions sell short the American family, the American service man or \nwoman, the American laborer, America's future and America's security, \nwe must not let their efforts succeed.\n  Do not sell short America's national security. We cannot keep relying \non increasing imports from foreign nations such as Iraq, which has \npublicly said they will use oil as a weapon. How many times do they \nhave to say that before we believe them? Please do not sell America \nshort in order to support the extreme environmentalists' latest popular \ncause, because we know once we authorize the opening of ANWR these \ngroups are going to move on to another cause. They are not created for \none specific cause.\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\n  By the way, do not worry about those environmental groups. They are \nstill going to be around, as I indicated. They will find another cause, \nas I stated. Remember, energy is not about politics and an agenda. It \nis about families across the Nation wondering if their jobs will be \nthere when they get up in the morning. It is about looking for our \nNation's independence.\n  I believe in a country that is dependent on no one but God alone. We \nhave every right to look out for our Nation's independence.\n  Our President, President George W. Bush, has asked time and time \nagain for the Senate to follow the example of the House of \nRepresentatives and pass an energy bill. The House has done so. H.R. 4 \nhas ANWR in it.\n  On numerous occasions, the President has expressed specifically his \nstrong support for opening ANWR. He knows it means more jobs for \nAmerica. It means security for our Nation, which is especially \nimportant at this time. He knows as long as we are dependent on other \nnations for our energy our very security is threatened and our future \nis at stake.\n\n  So the task of this body is clearly to deliver to the President an \nenergy bill that reduces our reliance on foreign oil while at the same \ntime creates thousands of new American jobs. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to recognize the weight of the task we are \nstarting on. Agendas need to be pushed aside and Members have to muster \nthe courage to do the right thing, even on difficult issues such as \nANWR. We need to do what is right for American workers, what is right \nfor our national security, what is right for the Inupiat Eskimos who \nlive in the Coastal Plain, and what is right for America's future.\n  There has been talk this amendment will put the environment in the \nhands of big oil. Let me say something about big oil. Big oil is a \ncitizen of my State--Exxon, BP, a number of companies. In reality, \nthose companies are doing business in Alaska because they can make a \nreturn on investment. They qualify as good citizens. They have the \ncapability to get oil all over the world and bring it to the United \nStates. Some have said: Where is big oil on the issue of ANWR? There is \nPhillips Petroleum, other companies. We have not really seen much of \nthem. There is a good reason for that. They are international oil \ncompanies. They will come to Alaska if it is open, but if it is not \nopen they will go wherever, and they will import the oil into the \nUnited States. That development will not have the oversight that \nAlaskan oil development will.\n  Make no mistake about it, Prudhoe Bay is the best oilfield in the \nworld. One of the things I find very frustrating is Members do not seem \nto care where oil comes from, as long as they get it. But if we can \ndevelop it at home, with our environmental laws, both Federal \nGovernment and State, is that not in the best interest of Alaska? So we \nshould make sure we recognize big oil for what it is.\n  The talk that this amendment will put the environment in the hands of \nbig oil is unrealistic. In reality, the environment will be directly in \nthe hands of the American worker who will be working up there, and he \nand she knows how to do it.\n  If Members oppose the lease amendment, they are really saying to the \nAmerican worker: I don't trust you. Instead, send the right signal and \ndo the right thing. Vote for the American worker and show them we trust \nthem to be good stewards at work, that we trust them to take pride in \ntheir jobs, and we trust them to help America keep strong and safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Alaska to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked me to announce \nthere will be no rollcall votes tonight. It is my understanding the \nSenator from Alaska will speak for a considerable period of time this \nevening, is that not correct, I ask Senator Stevens?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I don't know how long.\n  Mr. REID. We have had a number of inquiries. I think it would be \nappropriate we announce there will be no rollcall votes. The majority \nleader authorized me to do that.\n  Has the Senator from New Mexico entered the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am informed the Senator from Alaska objects to any \nunanimous consent agreement and, therefore, he would go ahead and speak \ntoday. Tomorrow I will seek recognition when we get back on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have just had a marvelous experience \nacross from the Capitol grounds. We had a press conference attended by \nthe leaders of organized labor, many Senators, a great many members \nfrom organized labor, and members of the Alaska Native community. We \nought to take time to see whether that settles in with the American \npublic. Three of the greatest labor leaders in the country were there \nand another representing the fourth. They say they want this project to \ngo forward. They want this area to be drilled.\n  The concept of extended debate is to give a chance for the public to \nlisten to debate on an issue and to determine whether they should \ncontact their Senators about the issue. I hope that can happen. I hope \nit is still possible to have the country listen to the leaders of \norganized labor, listen to the leaders of the State of Alaska and \nconsider whether or not it is safe to drill in the area set aside 21 \nyears ago for just that purpose--to drill in the 1.5 million acres on \nthe Arctic Coastal Plain.\n  I have been through this before. I asked myself today: Why are we \nhere? Why are we doing this now? The normal process for handling this \nlegislation, which has been passed by the House of Representatives, \nwould be to go to the committee, come to the Senate, be assigned to a \ncommittee, be considered by that committee, and report it back to the \nfloor. This bill does not do that. It went to the committee. The \ncommittee voted to include the drilling of the Arctic Coastal Plain, \nANWR, and the leadership said: No, you cannot report that bill to the \nfloor. Instead, we will draft our own bill.\n  The majority of the committee that has jurisdiction over this bill \nvoted to report it in the manner we would like to see it approved. We \ndon't get that chance. It comes on the floor, it is a different bill, \ndrafted by the leadership of the majority side of the Senate. We are \ntold: Take it or leave it. Get 60 votes for your amendment or forget \nabout it--as though we are filibustering. They are filibustering our \namendment, but we have to have the 60 votes in order to stop them from \nfilibustering our amendment.\n  This is a point of frustration for someone who has lived through this \ncontinuum dealing with Alaskan lands. I talked about it before and I \nwill talk about it ad nauseam until we get the point across that the \nState of Alaska made a commitment to the Federal Government in 1980 \nthat we would accept the bill that had been outlined by the leaders of \nthe Democratic Party in the Senate, Mr. Jackson in particular, God rest \nhis soul, but he was a great friend. He opposed us in many ways. We \nreached a consensus on the issue of this Arctic Coastal Plain.\n  So everyone understands, we are talking about 1.5 million acres on \nthe Arctic Coastal Plain that was set aside in 1980 for the purpose of \noil and gas exploration. Anyone who comes to the floor and says this is \nwilderness is a liar--a liar. Anyone who tries to pretend that somehow \nor another we are violating the law is a liar. If it was back in the \nold days, I would challenge them to a duel. I am up to my ears in what \nI have been hearing about this that is absolutely untrue.\n  The ANWR area was set aside by the Jackson-Tsongas amendment for the \npurpose of allowing exploration. It does not become a working part of \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge until that is complete. The difficulty is, \npeople say it is wilderness. This area, the ANWR Coastal Plain, is not \nwilderness. The area of the Arctic Wildlife Range south of that, in the \nlight brown, is 8 million acres of wilderness. But that 1.5 million \nacres is not wilderness.\n\n  Reading the Wilderness Society publication one would think we are \ninvading the most pristine place on Earth. It is hell in the \nwintertime--60 below. I took the Postmaster General there and the \ndigital thermometer said minus 99 because of the windchill factor. This \nis not some pristine place that should be protected. It should be \nprotected at a time when it needs protection, which is\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nthe summer. And we do that. We do not drill for oil and gas in the \nsummertime.\n  Why are we here? We are here because some people on that side of the \naisle, the majority side of the Senate, have decided they will block \nthis. They do not honor the commitment made by the United States and \nthe President of the United States when the 1980 act was signed. That \nwas a commitment to our people in Alaska.\n  In 1980, these areas that are marked and checked were withdrawn by \nthe act of Congress called the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act. All of that was withdrawn in 1978.\n  My colleague, Senator Gravel, blocked a bill to do this because they \ncould not build up there. In 1980, he still objected, but I reached an \nagreement with Senator Tsongas and Senator Jackson that I would help \nget this bill done in exchange for an absolute commitment in the law \nthat that area would remain open to oil and gas acres, the 1.5 million \nacres, and the bill was signed by the President of the United States.\n  Now they are saying that is a pristine area; you cannot do it. And \nthe Democratic Party has put this in their platform, ``Don't drill in \nAlaska's Arctic,'' as though the Democratic Party owns Alaska. Someone \nasked: Who owns Alaska? The public owns Alaska. The public owned all \nthose places, too, but they were set aside for the elite few.\n  There are no roads there, no airport in there, no way to get there \nexcept through guided tours, twin-engine planes with guides and \nmillionaires visiting those areas of Alaska. Eighty percent of the \nparklands in the United States are there. There are only three parks \nyou can get to by road.\n  What we are talking about is coddling to the radical \nenvironmentalists of this country. We have half the coal of the United \nStates in Alaska. Did you know that? One time when Ed Muskie was \nrunning for President, he decided he needed some environmental votes \nand he came up with an amendment that said: If you mine for coal in the \nState of Alaska, you must restore the natural contour after you are \nthrough.\n  In Alaska, coal comes with ice lenses, permafrost. When you put the \nsteam points down to melt it, the water runs off. Take the coal off and \nthere is no way in God's Earth you can restore the natural \ncontour. Since Ed Muskie's amendment, not one new coal mine has been \nopened--30 years, with half the coal in the United States. No, no, we \ncannot do that.\n\n  When I first went to Alaska, I worked on the Rampart Dam on the Yukon \nRiver. It would have been the largest power project in the United \nStates. It would have provided my whole State with electrical power. It \nwas economically feasible. There is no question about it. The \nenvironmentalists said, ``No, you cannot build that dam,'' and they \nblocked it. It is gone.\n  We had, when I came to the Senate, the great forests of Alaska. \nForests here, here, and here: The largest forests in the United States. \nWe were cutting 1.3 billion board feet of timber a year on a cutting \ncycle of 103 years. We would not cut the same place twice in 103 years.\n  As part of ANILCA, that was lowered to 450 million board feet a year. \nLast year, we cut 47 million. Why? The environmentalists have decided \nthat timber in Alaska should not be cut. Notwithstanding the sustained \nuse/yield concept that was in place, they just blocked it.\n  When we passed this bill in 1980, we had six world class mines--six. \nThey are all closed now but one. Why? Environmental litigation. You \ncannot mine in Alaska now. We have 32 of the 37 strategic and critical \nminerals and metals of the United States. None of them are being mined \nexcept one mine up in the Kotzebue area, the Red Dog Mine, the zinc \nmine, the largest in the world. Why are they closed? Environmental \nlitigation from radical conservationists, environmentalists.\n  We get down to the question of oil and gas. When we argued this bill \nin the period of the 1970s and 1980s, there were 50-odd wildcat \noperators in Alaska drilling for oil and gas. There is not one today. \nNot one. Do you know why? The last administration closed it all down. \nThere are no permits to go out and explore for oil and gas on Federal \nlands, outside of the great Prudhoe Bay--which is State land. It is not \nFederal land at all, it is State land.\n  The continuum of what we have been through as a State makes a lot of \nus wonder if we were right to seek statehood. Were we right? Many of \nour people wanted to be a commonwealth. Canada was then a commonwealth \nto the British empire. Some of our people wanted to be a commonwealth \nin the U.S. system. We said no, we want to be a State. We are \nAmericans. We believe in America. The highest level of enlistment in \nthe U.S. military in World War II was from Alaska, the highest level of \nveterans per capita today in the United States is in Alaska, from all \nperiods of wars in this past century.\n  The question is, Why are we here? We are here because an elite few \nhave decided that Alaska should be their playground. The working people \ntoday woke up. That meeting outside, across from the Capitol, is a bell \ntolling for the Democratic Party, and it better listen. It better \nlisten because the working people want jobs. This is a jobs bill.\n  We will provide jobs. Instead of sending our money over to buy Saddam \nHussein's oil, we will produce it on our own shores. We will produce it \nfrom Alaska. There are 15 sedimentary basins in Alaska. We have drilled \nthree of them. This will be the fourth. No one knows whether it has oil \nor gas. We believe it does. We have still a lot left to drill in \nAlaska, provided some future generation removes some of those lines. \nThose lines were drawn to prevent development.\n  We are at the crossroads now with this bill, of whether or not we \nlisten to the President of the United States and, because of the \ninterests of national security and economic security we proceed as was \npromised in the 1980s to develop this land.\n\n  You cannot really understand the 1980 act unless you go back in \nhistory. When you go back in history, you go back to the Statehood Act. \nI was in the Interior Department at the time of statehood. Part of that \nStatehood Act was section 4. It was a commitment to the Alaskan Native \npeople that once Alaska became a State, Congress would address the \nquestion of the claims of the Native people against the United States--\nnot against the State but against the United States, their claims as \naboriginal people.\n  We did that. As a matter of fact, I helped prepare some of that when \nI was still with the Eisenhower administration. After that came to an \nend, I went back to Alaska, worked on many things, came back here in \n1968, and one of the first things we started working on when I became a \nSenator was the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act. That became \nlaw in 1971. It was the only time in history that Congress has settled \nclaims against the United States of aboriginal people--of our \ncontinent. It was necessary because of the very diverse number of \ntribes in Alaska and the size of Alaska.\n  I forgot to mention it earlier today, but let me mention it now: \nAlaska is 20 percent of the land that the American flag flies over. The \nState of Alaska is one-fifth of all the land of the United States.\n  On that land were a series of tribes that had claims against the \nUnited States. We worked for 3 years and finally, in December of 1971, \npassed the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act. One of the \nconditions of that act was section 17(d)(2). That condition said: \nBefore the Native people of the State of Alaska take their lands--\nAlaska was guaranteed some lands as it became a State; the Native \npeople received some lands in settlement of their claims against the \nUnited States--there must be a study of what land should be set aside \nin the national interest, in Alaska. That was 1971.\n  For 9 years we argued over that, 9 full years. It became a slogan in \nAlaska, the (d)(2), 17(d)(2). We called it the ``(d)(2)'' issue; (d)(2) \nmeant how much of the State was going to be set aside, and the State \nwas prevented from taking it so it could be used to support the economy \nof the State. How much of it is going to be set aside to prevent the \nAlaskan Native people from getting the claims they really claim because \nit is set aside by these people who sought these withdrawals? In fact, \nthe (d)(2) issue is what built the empire of the radical \nenvironmentalists in America.\n  For 9 years they raised money, advertised, went throughout the \ncountry, if not the world, to raise money to ``save Alaska.'' Save it \nfrom what? There was not any development proposed in any of those \nareas. There are no roads in\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\nthere. There are fewer roads in Alaska than there are in King County, \nWA.\n  Those are diverse people, living in five different sectors of the \nlargest State in the Union. But, no, it was an issue to withdraw them \nto prevent the State from getting them--prevent the Natives from \ngetting them; because if we got them, we might develop them. The one \narea that was not set aside was that area; the 1.5 million acres was \nset aside for us to use to keep the pipeline filled.\n  In the time of the Persian Gulf war, I went to the oil industry and I \nsaid: You have to increase the throughput of the pipeline. It was \ndesigned for 1 million barrels per day. It was running at about 1.9 \nmillion barrels a day. They looked into it and reported back they could \ndo it. They increased it to 2.1 million barrels per day in the \ninterests of national defense because we were shut off from a lot of \naccess to oil at that time of the Persian Gulf war.\n\n  Today, it is 950,000 barrels a day. We do not have enough reserves to \nkeep the oil pipeline, the 48-inch in diameter, half-inch-thick \npipeline, 800 miles from the North Slope to Valdez--we do not have \nenough oil to keep it filled now. Where do we get the oil in between \ntime? My colleagues say we are getting the oil from Saddam Hussein. The \nonly oil increase we have gotten since our throughput went down is the \nincrease in imports from Saddam Hussein.\n  We do not buy it directly from him; we buy it from the Food For Oil \nProgram, and he gets the money from that. So we are not really giving \nhim American dollars; we are going through some other exchange. We are \nwashing the money going into Iraq because we don't want people to think \nwe are dealing with Iraq, but it is Iraqi oil and we all know it.\n  What does he do with it? He is rebuilding his military. Senator \nInouye and I have just gone around the world, really--went into \nAfghanistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and we talked to people over there \nabout what is going on over there. We went to China, Singapore, \nIndonesia, the Philippines--looking at what is happening with terrorism \nin the world. Who is supporting them? Who do you think? Saddam Hussein \nis supporting them. It is known he is supporting them.\n  Where is he getting the money? From everybody who buys oil in those \nStates that Senator Murkowski showed, where the oil is going.\n  We paid Saddam Hussein $6.5 billion in 2001--$6.5 billion went to \nSaddam Hussein for his oil. The only way we can replace that is to \nproduce our own.\n  We are some sort of people who listen to these obstructionists who \ntell us to not keep the commitment Congress made to Alaska in 1980: \nForget about that. We don't need that oil.\n  Let me tell you that we need a lot more than that oil.\n  There was an interesting article in U.S. News & World Report on April \n1 of this year. It was called ``A waste of energy?''\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           A Waste of Energy?\n\n                           (By Gloria Borger)\n\n       Pity the poor caribou. There they are, minding their own \n     business, roaming silently in the snow and soft tundra of the \n     desolate Arctic landscape. Then, suddenly, they're \n     everywhere: migrating through green Web sites worldwide, \n     their survival the subject of urgent concern. If Big Oil \n     starts drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     enviros say, the lovely reindeer are at risk. Antlers, unite!\n       Enough already. The caribou are fine. In fact, since \n     exploration started around Alaska's Prudhoe Bay in 1968, the \n     local herd has thrived. And in case you're interested, the \n     polar bears roaming ANWR are doing nicely, too. But don't get \n     confused: This fight over 2,000 Arctic acres is not about \n     wildlife. It's not even about oil. It's about political \n     theology--and a small piece of land that has become a huge \n     symbol and great fodder for fundraising. ``We need a poster \n     on the wall, and here it is,'' says Bruce Babbitt, ex-Clinton \n     interior secretary, who opposes drilling in ANWR yet keeps a \n     certain perspective on it. ``Why do we spend so much time \n     quarreling over this tiny sliver that has no real implication \n     for energy independence?''\n       Good question. Here we are, in a war likely to expand \n     throughout the world's oil-producing region, and we're \n     importing 57 percent of our oil--including 790,000 barrels a \n     day indirectly from our buddy, Saddam Hussein. Has this \n     focused the nation on a serious plan for both conservation \n     and production? Hardly. Competing energy plans are stuck in \n     Congress, which is oddly bent on choosing either conservation \n     or production--and could get nothing as a result. ``Energy \n     policy doesn't have to involve either-or choices,'' says Tony \n     Knowles, Alaska's pro-development Democratic governor. Then \n     again, he hasn't spent much time in Congress lately.\n       To wit: The Senate disgraced itself recently when it killed \n     a gradual increase in gasoline mileage standards for cars \n     that could save as many as 1 million barrels a day. Soon it \n     will most likely kill any drilling in ANWR, which might have \n     provided a small start in the right direction. ``We shouldn't \n     let this debate paralyze a real debate over energy policy,'' \n     says John Holdren, an environmental policy guru at Harvard, \n     who opposes ANWR drilling. But it has. ``People have given up \n     on the really big issues'' like clean-air policy and climate \n     control, he adds.\n       That's because ANWR is too easy to spin. Consider the \n     numbers: Drilling proponents say that ANWR will produce a \n     tremendous amount of oil; opponents counter that it's a \n     mirage, less than a six-month supply. The truth is that no \n     one really knows. Kenneth Bird, leader of a U.S. Geological \n     Survey project that studied the potential for oil in the \n     refuge, says the range of ``technically recoverable'' oil \n     is somewhere between a relatively modest 4.3 billion and \n     11.8 billion barrels. Different groups use different \n     numbers. ``One could spend the entire day writing letters \n     to the editor,'' Bird sighs. What's more, his estimates \n     were done in 1985. ``We might be able to see more with \n     modern seismic equipment,'' he says. But is anybody \n     proposing a new federal study? Of course not.\n       Then there's the Big Oil argument. To hear the opponents \n     tell the story, oil companies are salivating at the prospect \n     of drilling in ANWR. They're not--at least not now, because \n     oil prices aren't high enough and they're not clamoring to \n     spend the next decade in litigation. In fact, says Babbitt, \n     ``oil companies might not bother with it.'' So why is the \n     administration pushing it? Because oil prices are bound to go \n     up--and Republicans like oil production, which has become a \n     popular national security issue.\n       And what about the environment? Sure, there's bound to be \n     some impact. Technology has advanced, but drilling is never \n     going to be a perfectly clean business. Purists say that's \n     enough to bag the effort, even though no one is predicting \n     ecological disaster. ``I asked an environmentalist whether he \n     would oppose the drilling if it were on just 1 acre, and he \n     said he would,'' says a pro-drilling Democrat, Sen. John \n     Breaux of Louisiana. ``How can you fight that ideology?''\n       You can't. There's too much at stake here politically for \n     either side to give. And so the nation continues to feed its \n     oil addiction without increasing homegrown production. \n     Meantime, real energy policy languishes while the symbols \n     thrive. And the poor caribou start looking more like Chicken \n     Littles every day.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will read portions of it. It says: ``A \nwaste of energy?''\n\n       Pity the poor caribou. There they are, minding their own \n     business, roaming silently in the snow and soft tundra of the \n     desolate Arctic landscape. Then, suddenly, they're \n     everywhere: migrating through green Web sites worldwide, \n     their survival the subject of urgent concern. If Big Oil \n     starts drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     environs say, the lovely reindeer are at risk. Antlers, \n     unite!\n       Enough already. The caribou are fine. In fact, since \n     exploration started around Alaska's Prudhoe Bay in 1968, the \n     local herd has thrived. And in case you're interested, the \n     polar bears roaming ANWR are doing nicely, too. But don't get \n     confused: This fight over 2,000 Arctic acres is not about \n     wildlife. It's not even about oil. It's about political \n     theology--and a small piece of land that has become a huge \n     symbol and great fodder for fundraising. ``We need a poster \n     on the wall, and here it is,'' says Bruce Babbitt, ex-Clinton \n     interior secretary, who opposes drilling in ANWR yet keeps a \n     certain perspective on it. ``Why do we spend so much time \n     quarreling over this tiny sliver that has no real \n     implications for energy independence?''\n       Good question. Here we are, in a war likely to expand \n     throughout the world's oil-producing region, and we're \n     importing 57 percent of our oil--including 790,000 barrels a \n     day indirectly from our buddy, Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Remember that this is U.S. News & World Report, not Senator Stevens.\n\n     Has this focused the nation on a serious plan for both \n     conservation and production? Hardly. Competing energy plans \n     are stuck in Congress, which is oddly bent on choosing either \n     conservation or production--and could get nothing as a \n     result. ``Energy policy doesn't have to involve either-or \n     choices,'' says Tony Knowles, Alaska's pro-development \n     Democratic governor. Then again, he hasn't spent much time in \n     Congress lately.\n       To wit: The Senate disgraced itself recently when it killed \n     a gradual increase in gasoline mileage standards for cars \n     that could save as many as 1 million barrels a day. Soon it \n     will most likely kill any drilling in ANWR, which might have \n     provided a small start in the right direction. ``We shouldn't \n     let this debate paralyze a real debate over energy policy,'' \n     says John Holdren, an environmental policy guru at Harvard,\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\n     who opposes ANWR drilling. But it has. ``People have given up \n     on the really big issues'' like clean-air policy and climate \n     control, he adds.\n       That's because ANWR is too easy to spin. Consider the \n     numbers: Drilling proponents say that ANWR will produce a \n     tremendous amount of oil; opponents counter that it's a \n     mirage, less than a six-month supply.\n\n  If there was ever a lie, that is a lie.\n\n     The trust is that no one really knows. Kenneth Bird, leader \n     of a U.S. Geological Survey project that studied the \n     potential for oil in the refuge, says the range of \n     ``technically recoverable'' oil is somewhere between a \n     relatively modest 4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels.\n\n  It goes on. I wanted to get to that because I want to get back to \nPrudhoe Bay.\n  Prudhoe Bay's estimate was 1 billion barrels. When they looked at \nthat, we had the fight over whether or not Prudhoe Bay should be opened \nand whether the oil could be transported through the Alaska oil \npipeline. The estimate was approximately 1 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil. We have produced now over 13 billion barrels. If this \nestimate is similar to the other conservative estimates in terms of oil \nand gas, this is more oil than is dreamed of.\n  Why can't we drill it? Why can't people here understand that the \ncommitments that were made ought to be kept by the Congress? It is a \ncommitment in the law--not just a promise. It was a hard-fought battle \nfor 9 years, as I said.\n  I remember that night when Senator Gravel blocked the 1978 act. It \nwas really a bill that we passed out of conference. But the House had \nalready passed it. We were ready to adjourn. The Senator from Alaska \nasked that the bill be read after the adjournment resolution could be \nagreed to. He couldn't read that bill in the time left for that \nCongress, and it died. It died.\n  I went home with a group of people called the Citizens for Management \nof Alaska Lands, and we decided we would start raising money for the \nnext Congress. We chartered a plane to go from Juneau to Anchorage, and \nit crashed. I was on it with my wife Ann and five people. Only one \nother person--our former Ambassador, Tony Motley--and I survived. We \npicked ourselves up from that disaster, went back and reorganized. We \nstarted working again in 1979 and 1980 and committed ourselves to try \nto get the issue settled.\n  Do you know why? We couldn't select our Alaska State land. There was \nwhat we call a freeze on it. The Interior Department refused to process \nthe State's request for the lands it was entitled to under the \nStatehood Act until this issue was settled. The Natives couldn't get \ntheir hands on it until this issue was settled. We had to agree to the \n1980 act. We had no alternative. We are a land-poor society. We are a \nresource-based State. So we entered into the agreement. We said: All \nright. There were a few little tweaks and things made here.\n  There are some interesting things. The occupant of the chair might be \ninterested in this.\n  We call this the foot of the gate of the Arctic. That withdrawal was \nnot there in 1978. It was put there to block this road from going over \nto that mining district. They did not want to withdraw that area, so \nthey just blocked the access.\n  There is a similar block of access here--the road into Seward. There \nis a similar block of access here, and a block of access in here, and a \ntotal block of access in the southeast--no roads.\n  That is what that 1980 act meant. There will never be, as long as \nthose withdrawals persist, roads to connect the State of Alaska from \npoint to point. We depend on airports and on water courses. We have \nonly one road system that goes from Anchorage into Fairbanks and down \nthe Alaska Highway to Canada.\n  I hope people listen to these things. I am not sure they do.\n  I will tell you a little aside. When I lost the leadership election \nin 1984, my friend from Kansas Bob Dole became leader. He asked me if I \nwould help bring television to the Senate. It was then opposed by my \nfriend Russ Long and a couple of other Senators. I conferred with them. \nWe and the distinguished current President pro tempore decided we would \nallow it. We worked out bringing television to the Senate.\n\n  I do not know whether that is educational or not. We are going to \nhave a chance this week to find that out. At least for me, this is the \nfirst time I have used the concept of the public coverage by television \nof the proceedings on the floor of the Senate to try to interest people \nfrom other States in an issue that affects my State so vitally. That is \nwhy I mentioned the labor leaders' meeting in the front of the Capitol \ntoday and the invitation I received this morning to speak to the \nbuilding trades convention of the AFL-CIO, which I was pleased to do.\n  It is because people are thinking about jobs.\n  When I started thinking about this bill--let me go back to this. It \nis a good idea to go through this again. I want to make sure people \nunderstand what we are talking about. We are talking about section 1002 \nof the Jackson-Tsongas amendment of December 1980, signed by President \nCarter after he lost the election in 1980. This is the provision \ndrafted by the two Democratic leaders at the time on this legislation. \nIt said:\n\n       The purpose of this section is to provide for a \n     comprehensive and continuing inventory and assessment of the \n     fish and wildlife resources of the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an analysis of the impacts \n     of oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and \n     to authorize exploratory activity within the coastal plain in \n     a manner that avoids significant adverse effects on the fish \n     and wildlife and other resources.\n\n  That is not an inconsistent position by Senator Jackson.\n  Where is a copy of that letter?\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of this letter be \nplaced on every Senator's desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is dated July 3, 1980, signed by Henry M. Jackson, \nchairman, and Mark Hatfield, ranking minority member, of the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources. It says:\n\n       In this year of sharply heightened national concern over \n     the economy, energy and national defense, the Senate is about \n     to consider Alaska lands legislation--an issue which would \n     have a profound effect on each of these vital subjects.\n       We write to ask for your full support of the Alaska lands \n     bill approved by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \n     After extensive hearings, study and mark-up, the Committee \n     approved this bill by an overwhelming and bi-partisan vote of \n     17-1.\n       The Committee bill is a balanced, carefully crafted measure \n     which is both a landmark environmental achievement and a \n     means of protecting the national interest in the future \n     development of Alaska and its vital resources. The bill more \n     than doubles the land area designated by Congress as part of \n     the National Park and National Wildlife Refuge systems; it \n     triples the size of the National Wilderness Preservation \n     system. It protects the so-called Crown Jewels of Alaska. At \n     the same time, it preserves the capability of that mammoth \n     state to contribute far beyond its share to our national \n     energy and defense needs.\n       A series of five major amendments to the bill and an entire \n     substitute for it will be offered on the Senate floor. The \n     amendments in total would make the bill virtually an \n     equivalent of the measure approved last year by the House. \n     Each amendment in its own way would destroy the balance of \n     the bill.\n       While the bill is a gigantic environmental accomplishment, \n     it also is crucial to the nation's attempt to achieve energy \n     independence. One-third of our known petroleum reserves are \n     in Alaska, along with an even greater proportion of our \n     potential reserves. Actions such as preventing even the \n     exploration of the Arctic Wildlife Range, a ban sought by one \n     amendment, is an ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our \n     nation in this time of energy crisis.\n\n  That was 1980.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Instability of certain nations abroad repeatedly emphasizes \n     our need for a stronger domestic supply of strategic and \n     critical minerals. Each of the five proposed amendments would \n     either restrict mineral areas from development or block \n     effective access to those areas. Four of the seven world-\n     class mineral finds in Alaska would be effectively barred \n     from development by the amendments. That simply is too high a \n     price for this nation to pay.\n       Present and potential employment both in Alaska and in the \n     other states would be significantly damaged if the committee \n     bill is amended. Cutting off development of the four mineral \n     finds discussed above would alone cost thousands of potential \n     jobs, many of them in the Lower 48 states. The amendment on \n     national forests would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs in the \n     southeast Alaska timber-related economy.\n       We urge you to focus on the central fact that the Alaska \n     lands bill is not just an environmental issue. It is an \n     energy issue. It is a national defense issue. It is an \n     economic issue. It is not an easy vote for one constituency \n     that effects only a remote, far-away\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n     area. It is a compelling national issue which demands the \n     balanced solution crafted by the Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee.\n       We look forward to your support.\n           Cordially,\n     Mark O. Hatfield,\n       Ranking Minority Member.\n     Henry M. Jackson,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Madam President, do you know why I read that letter? Three of the \nfour amendments that they urged for the Senate not to adopt were, in \nfact, adopted. The environmental people, at that time, were growing in \nstrength, as I said before. They won every issue but one--every issue \nbut one. There was only one issue that the State of Alaska prevailed on \nthat was a major issue.\n  There were some minor changes of boundaries that we argued about, \nwhether this part of this town should be in that withdrawal or another \npart in some other area. But there were four major issues that the \nchairman and ranking member raised, and Alaska lost three of the four. \nWe won one. We had a solemn commitment from the two leaders. Senator \nTsongas had those four amendments that Senator Jackson and Senator \nHatfield talked about. Senator Jackson and Senator Hatfield had the \ncommittee bill. They melded it. They took three of the Tsongas \namendments. But they left one out. They left us access to the Coastal \nPlain for oil and gas exploration and development.\n  One wonders whether history should have anything to do with \nsubsequent action by the Senate of the United States. One Congress \ncannot bind another Congress. But one Congress can enact a law that it \ntakes another Congress to enact and have a President sign it. This is \none of the things that was required, and it was the great error of my \ncareer in agreeing that the area would be open only if a subsequent law \nwas passed by Congress approving the process which was set up.\n  The process was that an area would be available for oil and gas \nleasing. There would be an environmental impact statement. There would \nbe seismic research to see if there was a possibility of recovering \noil. If both of those proved positive, then there would be a request of \nCongress to authorize the use for exploration of oil and gas.\n  Senator Jackson later that year, on August 18, addressed the Senate. \nOn page 21651 of the Congressional Record of August 18, 1980, he said:\n\n       Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute offered \n     by the Senator from Massachusetts. During the past several \n     weeks, Senator Tsongas and I, as well as Senators Roth, \n     Hatfield, and Cranston, have attempted to draft a compromise \n     substitute amendment. We have before us an amendment which we \n     believe represents an equitable solution to the Alaska lands \n     issue.\n\n  He goes on to say later in that same timeframe:\n\n       The substitute retains the Senate Energy Committee's \n     language relative to an oil and gas exploration program on \n     the Arctic Coastal Plain in the existing Arctic Wildlife \n     Range. Several changes in the committee's provisions were \n     incorporated regarding the wildlife portion of the Arctic \n     Slope study. The timing of the seismic exploration program \n     and the Secretary's report to the Congress regarding further \n     oil and gas exploration on the plain were also modified \n     slightly. . . .\n       Taken together, this approach provides adequate protection \n     for the affected wildlife in the area--including the \n     Porcupine caribou herd--while insuring that an assessment of \n     the area's oil and gas potential is undertaken.\n\n  We won one issue, and now the majority party wants to deny us that \ncompromise.\n  It is an interesting area, the Arctic. Did you know, Madam President, \nfollowing the great Teapot Dome scandal in 1923--the year of my birth, \nincidentally--the President, President Harding, withdrew 25 million \nacres of Alaska as a national petroleum reserve to salve the national \nconscience about the Teapot Dome scandal. That is what it was. That \narea has never really been explored for oil and gas. It was set up in \n1923.\n  In 1943, during the conduct of the war, Abe Fortas, who many of us \nknew, the then-Acting Secretary of the Interior, withdrew all lands in \nthe State of Alaska--all lands in the State of Alaska--about 20 miles \nsouth of the Circle. All of that land was withdrawn. Nothing at all \ncould be done up there by Alaskans, the people who lived there and \nstayed there. He withdrew other lands--the so-called public land order \n82--in the Katagkak region down here--it was a broad-scale thing--and \nin the Cape Lisburne area. This is the area we are talking about now \nthat was withdrawn in 1943--not from oil and gas but from any kind of \nactivity. That persisted until we got to the Statehood Act. And just \nprior to the Statehood, the Kobuk gas field was discovered just south \nof the Alaska Range, in that area right there.\n\n  While I was at the Interior Department, the Secretary of the \nInterior, Fred Seaton, amended public land order 82 allowing oil and \ngas exploration to take place in the Kobuk gas field. As a matter of \nfact, later in 1959, after we obtained statehood, Secretary Seaton \nfurther modified it to affect lands up around the national petroleum \nreserve of Alaska created by President Harding. And then, in December \nof 1960, he in effect repealed that land order. He really did it by \namending the previous land order and making it possible for Alaska to \nselect lands in that area because under the Statehood Act the State of \nAlaska could not explore north of the Arctic Circle without prior \napproval.\n  He gave the State the authority to select the lands. The area they \nselected was Prudhoe Bay. That was really divine guidance that took us \nto that place because that was the only place we could drill in the \nArctic at the time. Alaskans found the largest supply of oil on the \nNorth American continent at that time--on State lands, not Federal \nlands. Those Federal lands have never been opened to oil and gas, as \nintended by Secretary Seaton or by President Eisenhower. Subsequent \nadministrations have found some way to frustrate access to the oil and \ngas resources of that area.\n\n  I have talked for a long time. I will talk a while longer because I \nwill go into this amendment I filed in the second degree. I will speak \nmore about the Arctic wildlife area and what it means. I filed an \namendment in the second degree because, as I looked at the House-passed \nbill, it approved ANWR and it limited the amount of land that could be \nused to 2,000 acres out of that 1.5 million acres. All that can be used \nis 2,000 surface acres. But it postulates that there will be a series \nof bonus bids for the right to lease the land, somewhere between $1.6 \nbillion and $2.7 billion. The House bill channels a portion of that \nmoney to what I would call a little carrot--a little conservation \nrestoration of the areas already withdrawn from parts of the refuge.\n  I thought about that, and I thought about where the drilling in the \nArctic wildlife refuge area--ANWR area, the 1002 area--would take us. \nIt takes us a step further toward building the Alaska natural gas \npipeline--something the American public should learn about, something \non which I hope the great unions of this country and the steel industry \nand others will start educating the public.\n  At the time Prudhoe Bay oil was discovered, we found that gas was \nassociated with the oil. There was no means to transport the gas, so a \nseries of reinjection facilities was constructed and, as the oil and \ngas is produced, the gas is separated and it is reinjected into the \nground. There are now 50 trillion to 70 trillion cubic feet of gas \nknown to exist under State land in the Prudhoe Bay area.\n  We now propose that we build a natural gas pipeline to take that gas \nto the midwestern part of the United States. It is the largest amount \nof gas we know of that is not transportable so far. It would transport, \nwhen built, a pipeline 52 inches in diameter, 1 inch thick, running \n3,000 miles from the North Slope to Chicago, down the Alaska Highway, \nthrough Canada, and into the Midwest. Along with that, it takes 15,000 \nmiles of gathering pipelines and adjunct lines.\n  Originally, they thought about bringing the pipeline through the \npristine part of Canada. That has been abandoned. The State wants it to \ncome this way. This is the area here. We are going to follow, \npartially, the Alaska pipeline right-of-way and come down the Alaska \nHighway and go through Canada, along the route of the current pipeline \nthrough Canada.\n  People said: What does that have to do with drilling in the Arctic \nregion of the Alaska Coastal Plain?\n  Mr. President, there is no source of funds that I can see, with the \nexisting economic situation, in the foreseeable\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nfuture to help get that Alaska gas pipeline started other than funds \nfrom the production of oil in the Arctic Plain. The more I study, the \nmore I find we have a really interesting situation in steel. Obviously, \nI am not from steel country. I don't know a lot about steel. But I have \nbeen learning a lot about it since we started this effort.\n  Since the year 2000, approximately 30 steel companies in the United \nStates have entered bankruptcy, and 60,000 workers are already out of \njobs in those places. In 1980, there were more than 500,000 U.S. \nsteelworkers. By the year 2000, there were 224,000. That was 2 years \nago. Since that time, we have had, as I have indicated, 30 more steel \ncompanies fold.\n  One of the contracts that exist between the steel companies and their \nworkers is the benefits program--a promise that was made for the \ncontribution to their past work in our society. It was an agreement to \npay health benefits for the retirees. There are presently estimated to \nbe 600,000 of those retirees, at a minimum. The companies they worked \nfor are going bankrupt. There is a plan to try to consolidate the U.S. \nsteel companies, but there is a little hitch. These workers have the \nright to put a lien on those assets before they are consolidated. So a \nplan was devised, and it is a difficult one to follow through. But it \nis a plan to use the fund to pay the cost of the health care delivery \nfor the retirees and let the assets go into a consolidated steel \nindustry that would be capable of contributing to major projects such \nas our Alaska natural gas pipeline.\n  The plan is the legacy plan, and the legacy would be to keep the \ncommitment made to the retirees. It requires a cashflow for 30 years of \n$18 billion. If the steel industry does not find $18 billion, it is my \njudgment they will not be able to consolidate. If they do not \nconsolidate, we will not have a steel industry capable of meeting our \nneeds.\n  I do not know if you know it, Madam President, but recently Robert \nMiller, chairman and CEO of Bethlehem Steel, testified that:\n\n       Bethlehem Steel was the only domestic company with the \n     capability to provide the special steel plate that was \n     required to repair the U.S.S. Cole.\n\n  One steel company left in the United States could meet our national \ndefense needs--one.\n  I told the union group today I believe there are three things that \nkeep a democracy alive: One is food, one is oil, and one is steel. That \ngives us the ability to maintain our economy and to defend ourselves.\n  We have taken very ample care of the farmers, I have to say that. In \ngoing through this, I found that in the last 10 years we have spent \n$656 billion on the farm community in regular bills and $17 billion in \nthe last 10 years on special emergency bills for the farm communities. \nHow much have we spent for steelworkers? How much have we spent for \noil? Nothing. They are part of the private enterprise system and must \nsurvive themselves.\n  How can they survive if Congress gets in their way? We are supposed \nto facilitate the development of this country and maintain our economic \nviability. We are supposed to provide for our national defense. As a \nmatter of fact, that is one of our constitutional duties--to provide \nfor the national defense and promote the general welfare of this \ncountry.\n  I find it hard to believe we are getting so much criticism of the \namendment that I have suggested. What it does is it takes part of the \nmoney that would come to the Federal Government and channels it into a \nfund which will address the health care costs for those retirees, \nenable the industry to be reconstituted, revitalized, provide money to \nthe Department of Commerce to help with some loans and grants to those \nsteel companies to get them going again, and provide money to the \nDepartment of Labor to train people to do some of the work we are going \nto need.\n  It is a gigantic project. There are two steel mills in the world \ntoday that are capable of rolling the pipe for the Alaska gas \npipeline--two. The design of that pipeline will require one-half of the \nworld's capability to produce steel pipe for a period of over 5 years. \nOne project. In order to get it started by 2010, the orders have to be \nplaced by next year. It is not possible to place those orders unless we \nknow where there is a cashflow to take care of the problems of the \nretirees.\n  This project of ours will take 5.2 million tons of steel. It will \ninvolve $3 billion to $5 billion in initial steel orders alone. We are \nnot talking about the 15,000 miles of gathering pipe. We are not \ntalking about the hundreds of trucks that will carry that pipe down \nthat long 3,000-mile road. We are not talking about the trucks and \nequipment that will improve the roads so the trucks can run on them. \nMost of those areas do not have roads that can hold trucks that size.\n  This is a gigantic project, and one must ask himself or herself: Is \ngas essential to our economy? Is gas essential to our national \nsecurity? Is this something on which we should have a partisan dispute? \nIs this something that we should be here debating about a procedural \nissue, an issue designed to permit a group of Senators to delay action \non a bill until the rest of the country can learn about it?\n\n  Actually, I am grateful to them for their filibuster against our \namendments and their threat of requiring a cloture vote to terminate \nour debate because it means we are going to be here for a while talking \nabout this subject. As we talk about it, I hope more and more people \nlearn about it.\n  We establish in my amendment a trust fund for conservation, jobs, and \nsteel reinvestment. It would provide $155 million for conservation \nprograms. It would provide $232 million for commerce grants to retool \nindustries to get ready for the gas pipeline. It would provide \napproximately $900 million to reestablish and make solvent the Coal \nMiners Health Fund. It would provide $7 billion over 30 years to \nprovide for the Legacy Benefits Program I described.\n  This is not the only money that goes into the legacy fund. The \nPresident has already put in effect the tariffs on imported steel. That \nmoney goes into the legacy fund. The companies are in the process of \nagreeing, as I understand it, to pay $6 per ton on steel produced in \nthe United States into the fund. But it is woefully short of money to \nmeet the needs for those 600,000-plus retirees. That is not enough \nmoney to make it work.\n  How do we get our gas pipeline started? We try to find a way to put \ntogether the exploration and development of this continent's largest \noilfield with the problems of developing a gas pipeline to transmit \ngases already there. We do not have to look for it. It is known gas. It \nis just not transportable because there is no mechanism to transport \nit. I believe we can do that.\n  I am intrigued with some of the statistics as to this pipe. As I \nsaid, it is 52 inches, 1 inch thick, and it is called X-80 pipe. It has \nnever been tested before. In order to make it available, a portion of \nit will have to be rolled to test to see if the theory that has been \nworked out on computer is correct: That this is the type of pipe that \ncan withstand the pressure necessary to move that gas over 3,000 miles.\n  Alaska now has the Alaska oil pipeline. It is a 750-mile pipeline. We \ncall it 800, but it is 750 miles of the really big pipe. That weighed \n1.2 million tons. Roads had to be specially created for that pipe to be \nput in place.\n  Alberta now has a 1,435-mile pipeline. It weighed 2.1 million tons \nand cost $1.8 billion delivered. We are looking at, as I said, an \nenormous amount beyond either of those. The pipeline will be almost as \nlong as the Great Wall of China.\n  One of the interesting things about it is, eight pipe-bending \nmachines will cost more than $1 million each and a 2-year lead time \nwill be needed to get that pipe into place. They estimate they are \ngoing to need 115 backhoes, 27 D-10 bulldozers, 90 D-9s, and 16 to 20 \nof the large, magnum class chain trenchers.\n  In terms of manpower, the workforce in Alaska alone would be 2,300 \njobs; in Canada 3,400 jobs. But there are jobs throughout the United \nStates into the hundreds of thousands to build the valves, gathering \nthe pipelines and the various pieces of equipment that are necessary to \nconstruct this pipeline.\n  I am saddened to say a lot of people say: That is a crass and cynical \nthing to do. You are just looking for votes.\n  That is right. We are looking for votes to open this area to oil and \ngas exploration so we can get the money to\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nstart this pipeline. If taking care of and helping the steelworkers and \ncoal workers is necessary to reconstruct the American steel industry so \nit can participate in it, we should do it.\n  I think the real problem I have is to try and figure out how we can \nput this into real context. With due respect to the Democratic \nSenators, they are shilling for a bunch of radical environmentalists \nwho control the country now in many ways. Tomorrow I am going to speak \nat length about the articles that were in the Sacramento Bee about the \nway these people seek to control what the Sacramento Bee called ``the \nfat of the land.'' They document it in a series of articles. I have \nthose articles and I will read some of them tomorrow to make sure we \nknow who our enemy is.\n  It is not the Senators from these various States. They are responding \nto constituents. They represent 2 to 3 percent of the constituency in \nmost House districts, a little less than that in most elections \nstatewide. They are very powerful, and at times such as we are in right \nnow, look at--we were balanced 50-50. Until Senator Jeffords changed \nhis mind, we were 50-50. We are a nation divided. That is when these \nminorities sneaked in and took control, and that is what the radical \nenvironmentalists have done.\n  I intend to go into that at length tomorrow. I will go further \ntomorrow into some more statistics about the steelworkers' problems and \nthe reasons I have persisted, even though I must say I do not know so \nfar any Senators who represent the steel States or the steelworker \nStates who have agreed to assist us in this matter. I challenge them to \nfind another cashflow area, another stream of money that will save \ntheir workers' retirement benefits. I challenge them.\n  This is not new. We did it for the black lung disease people in 1992. \nWe have done it a series of times, where we have taken money from one \ncashflow and put it into an objective where we could not get the money \notherwise, but we had a new cashflow and before it was committed, we \ncommitted it to good things. I say it this way: Take the airport \ndevelopment fund. All of those taxes do not go into the Treasury. They \ngo into the fund and they pay for airports, they pay for the runways. \nAs to the highway fund, those highway taxes go to pay for a great many \nthings.\n  Take the emergency agricultural appropriations. Where do they go? \nThey pay the John Deere bill. They pay for the medical insurance for \nthe employees and the farmers. They pay the grocery bill when farmers \nhave trouble. But somehow or another that is normal, right?\n  When we bring in an emergency bill for agriculture, we do not argue \nabout that at all. We only ask how much more can we raise it because \nthey are farmers. My farmers love them. I voted for those bills; I am \nnot criticizing. I am saying why only the farm community when there are \ntwo other streams that we must maintain to keep this democracy alive? \nOne is oil and one is steel. I want a bill that matches them both.\n\n  I thank the Chair for her patience, and I thank my friend from North \nDakota. I mean no personal offense in any way in what I say, but I \nthink I have a right now to be disturbed. I have argued this matter in \nthe Senate for more than 21 years. It actually started 31 years ago in \nDecember of 1971. I have been in the Senate that whole time. There has \nnot been a year gone by we have not had an issue concerning these \nreactionary radical environmental groups and what their demands are on \nour State. Why?\n  There are only three of us. We are way up there. When Senator \nMurkowski and I are at home, we are closer to Beijing than we are to \nWashington, DC. These environmentalists raise money by telling people \nthe harm we are liable to do to that land, but less than one-half of 1 \npercent of Alaska is occupied by man. It is almost the least populated \narea in the world; yet it is threatened. It is threatened every day. \nThere is another ad on the TV, another ad in a major paper about how \nthis terrible bunch of people are about ready to destroy this land. \nLess than one-half of 1 percent has been occupied by man.\n  It is an amazing thing for me to get involved in this, but I intend \nto stay involved in it. Let's see if the process works. Let's see if \nthe theory of extended debate for the education of our people still has \nmeaning. Do people listen to us? Are they interested in what the labor \nleaders in the country say? Are they interested in the plight of the \nsteelworkers? Are they interested in the plight of the coal workers? \nAre they interested in the future of building that gigantic pipeline \nthat will bring the equivalent of more than a million barrels of oil \nand gas a day to the central part of the United States?\n  It would assure that the central part of the United States would have \nall the gas it needs for 40 years. Is that worth thinking about, worth \ntaking some time of my colleagues to listen to me shout a little bit? I \nthink it is, and I hope the system works.\n  I remember as a young man seeing ``Mr. Smith Comes to Washington.'' I \nam not Mr. Smith, but I think the issue is more acute than the one he \nfaced. The issue we face is survival. Do we go on increasing our \ndependence on foreign oil? How much more are we going to import?\n  The report I had today was it is at 57 percent in terms of imported \noil. I thought it was lower than that. During the crisis that led to an \nembargo in the 1970s, it was less than 35 percent.\n  What about steel? During World War II, we produced steel for the \nworld. We produced the steel for the allies. We rebuilt Europe. We \nbuilt the tanks in the United States, and the planes and the ships that \nsaved the world. Could we do it again? Are we willing to contemplate \ndoing it even to save our own system?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I will talk for a few minutes on a \ncouple of points. One is a letter we received from the Secretary of \nEnergy, the Honorable Spencer Abraham. It is a letter to me. I will \nread excerpts.\n  The letter reads in part:\n\n       As everyone knows, gasoline prices have been increasing for \n     the past several weeks in anticipation of the historically \n     higher demand seen during the summer driving season. These \n     increases are a source of serious concern to this \n     Administration and I know they are of serious concern to you.\n       As I committed to you last year, I intend to keep you \n     apprised of circumstances affecting our oil and gasoline \n     markets and of the steps we are taking to mitigate their \n     effects in the short term and address them in the long term.\n       Briefly, prices for crude oil have risen by over $7 per \n     barrel since late February--an increase of over 30 percent--\n     adding as much as 20 cents per gallon to the retail cost of \n     gasoline. Crude oil prices are rising because of global \n     economic growth, OPEC production restraints, and concern over \n     the current tensions in the Middle East and Venezuela. Of \n     course, we are closely monitoring international developments \n     affecting our petroleum markets.\n       Partly as a result of rising oil costs, the Energy \n     Information Agency (EIA) expects an average price of $1.46 \n     for regular grade gasoline over the next 6 months. However, \n     gasoline prices will peak somewhat higher in certain regions \n     this summer. Higher gas prices strain the budget of America's \n     working families, raise the cost of goods and services, \n     increase harvest costs for American farmers, and ultimately \n     create a drag on the economy that can impact the livelihood \n     of working Americans.\n\n  He advises:\n\n       For more detailed market information, please refer to EIA's \n     Short-Term Energy Outlook . . . online.\n\n  He further states:\n\n       Our gasoline market will be in a delicate balance this \n     summer, as it has in the past few years. It only takes one \n     refinery fire--as we saw last August when a fire destroyed \n     part of Citgo's Lemont, Illinois, refinery--or a pipeline \n     disruption--like we experienced the previous June during the \n     Wolverine Pipeline break between Chicago and Detroit--to \n     cause price spikes.\n       The onset of the driving season coincides with the annual \n     changeover at refineries from winter fuels to specially \n     formulated, cleaner-burning summer fuels that cost more to \n     refine. These fuels are required to protect the public health \n     during the peak ozone season. As recommended in the \n     President's National Energy Plan, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has already improved some of the rules \n     governing the transition from winter to summer gasoline, \n     including a provision for increased flexibility in blending \n     and reclassification of certain fuels. However, the gasoline \n     market is still constrained\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\n     at times by refinery and pipeline capacity shortages in \n     America.\n       As we did last year, Department of Energy will continue to \n     keep track of gasoline supplies and pricing. We have already \n     reinstated our 24 hour Gasoline Hotline--a 1-800 number for \n     consumers concerned about gasoline prices (800-244-3301).\n\n  He further indicated he would be meeting with the American Automobile \nAssociation to identify ways to encourage Americans to drive smarter \nand prepare their cars to operate more efficiently--and save fuel and \nmoney.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: As everyone knows, gasoline prices \n     have been increasing for the past several weeks in \n     anticipation of the historically higher demand seen during \n     the summer driving season. These increases are a source of \n     serious concern to this Administration, and I know they are \n     of serious concern to you.\n       As I committed to you last year, I intend to keep you \n     apprised of circumstances affecting our oil and gasoline \n     markets and of the steps we are taking to mitigate their \n     effects in the short term and address them in the long term.\n       Briefly, prices for crude oil have risen by over $7 per \n     barrel since late February--an increase of over 30 percent--\n     adding as much as 20 cents per gallon to the retail cost of \n     gasoline.

We have already \n     reinstated our 24 hour Gasoline Hotline--a 1-800 number for \n     consumers concerned about gasoline prices (800-244-3301). I \n     have also directed EIA to produce its Energy Situation \n     Analysis Report (ESAR) each weekday in order to monitor world \n     events that could disrupt supplies. The ESAR is released on \n     EIA's website (http://www.eia.doe.gov/) daily after 5 p.m.\n       I will be meeting this week with the American Automobile \n     Association (AAA) to identify ways to encourage Americans to \n     drive smarter, prepare their cars to operate more \n     efficiently--and save fuel and money. I also intend to meet \n     with both refiners and gas station owners to ensure that our \n     distribution system works well from the wellhead to the fuel \n     pump. A flawless distribution system will help to minimize \n     price spikes this year should disruptions occur. As we \n     identify solutions and ideas that help consumers, we will of \n     course provide you that information immediately.\n       These measures can mitigate somewhat the effects of rising \n     gasoline prices, but the solution is more long term. We must \n     reduce our dependence on OPEC imports of crude oil by \n     promoting energy conservation, increasing domestic oil \n     production, and diversifying our foreign sources of crude \n     oil. We strongly urge Congress to send comprehensive and \n     balanced energy legislation with all of these elements to the \n     President.\n       Please let me know if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Spencer Abraham.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we have been generalizing a bit on \nthis side, relative to the National Environmental Policy Act, about \ngroups in opposition to opening ANWR. On the other hand, I was somewhat \nrelieved to see an ad that appeared in the Washington Post. It is \nentitled:\n\n       Think All Environmentalists Oppose President Bush's Energy \n     Plan? . . . Think Again . . .''\n\n  I am going to read a couple of excerpts because I think it addresses, \nindeed, some of the more balanced and responsible environmental groups \nand their opinions on activities associated with relieving our \ndependence on imported oil. The first is from Douglas Wheeler, former \nexecutive director of the Sierra Club:\n\n       The exploration and development of energy resources in the \n     United States is governed by the world's most stringent \n     environmental constraints, and to force development elsewhere \n     is to accept the inevitability of less rigorous oversight.\n\n  What he is saying in these few words is that we can do it right in \nthe United States because we have the most stringent environmental \noversight on resource development, particularly oil and gas. He implies \nthat is not necessarily the case in other parts of the world, and we \nseem very nonchalant about taking for granted where our oil comes from. \nThere is very little concern whether the development is harmonious with \nthe environment because our only bottom line is: We have to have the \noil.\n  There is another statement, from James C. Wheat, III, trustee for the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation:\n\n       The conservation community should take this opportunity to \n     work closely with Congress to ensure that exploration of ANWR \n     results in net environmental gains.\n\n  I certainly take Mr. Wheat at his word.\n  Further, Brian Ball, former chairman of the Nature Conservancy of \nVirginia:\n\n       Technology advances and increased ecological awareness have \n     made this kind of exploration possible while leaving a \n     minimum footprint on the surrounding environment.\n\n  Again, I will show that footprint on the chart here, which indicates \nthe little area in red which identifies, obviously, the limitation in \nthis legislation, which is 2,000 acres.\n  We also received from the Laborers' International Union of North \nAmerica, Terence O'Sullivan, president, writing to each Member of this \nbody:\n       On behalf of the more than 800,000 members of the Laborers' \n     International Union of North America, I am writing to express \n     our strong support for opening the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge (ANWR) on Alaska's North Slope for new oil \n     exploration. I am requesting that you not only support an \n     amendment to open ANWR as a part of comprehensive energy \n     legislation, but also any effort to invoke cloture on the \n     issue if necessary.\n       The benefits of including ANWR in a comprehensive energy \n     bill are clear. Alaska currently provides 25% of the nation's \n     domestic oil and opening ANWR could boost that figure to more \n     than 50%. New drilling technologies will lessen the oil \n     industry's ``footprint'' on the surrounding environment by \n     increasing the length of directional drills and allowing for \n     smaller and more compact production pads; if Prudhoe Bay were \n     built today it would affect an area of land 65% smaller. \n     Thousands of good-paying jobs would be created across the \n     country by opening ANWR, 130,000 in construction alone. And \n     best of all, Alaskans support drilling in ANWR by a margin of \n     3-1. If ANWR is not appropriate as a domestic source of oil \n     production, then where in the U.S. is?\n       While exploration in ANWR is only one piece, it is a very \n     important piece of a national energy policy that should \n     include increased construction of power plants, including \n     nuclear facilities, oil and gas pipelines, refineries and \n     other energy production facilities. A national energy policy \n     will insure a reliable and affordable source of energy while \n     creating tens of thousands of jobs nationwide.\n       The Laborers and the entire building trades have a long and \n     illustrious history on the North Slope of Alaska of training \n     a highly skilled workforce, building a solid infrastructure, \n     deploying the new drilling technologies and protecting the \n     environment. That record of success is at least one reason \n     for the strong support among Alaskans for drilling in ANWR.\n       For all these reasons and more, we strongly urge you to not \n     only support an amendment to open ANWR as part of a \n     comprehensive energy legislation, but also any effort to \n     invoke cloture in order to allow a fair debate on the issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            TERENCE M. O'SULLIVAN,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Finally, I noted the debate that covered the second-degree amendment \nwhich is pending to the underlying\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\namendment to open up ANWR. I would like to, again, highlight what this \nsecond-degree amendment specifically does because it gives America's \nsteel industry an opportunity that otherwise it would not have--\nbasically to rejuvenate and reconstruct the industry so it can be \ncompetitive.\n  We are all aware the administration provided a 30-percent protective \ntariff to American steel. That is going to be binding for a 3-year \nperiod of time. But what we have done here in the crafting of the \nsecond-degree amendment, which Senator Stevens is offering, is to take \nthe funding that would be generated from a combination of royalty and \nbonus bids--somewhere in the area of $12 billion over 30 years--and \ntake the royalty Federal share and apply it over a period of time to \nspecifically address the unpaid legacy associated with health benefits \nfor the steel industry. The proposal is to contribute approximately $8 \nbillion to the steel legacy benefit program.\n  I ask, Where is this money going to come from if we do not identify a \nsource? We have the source. The source, of course, is from the revenues \ngenerated from the royalties and the bonus bids in opening ANWR.\n  America's steel industry is not going to get another shot at this. \nThis is an identified source. As Senator Stevens indicated, the \nprospects for the renewal of our steel industry, for it to become \ncompetitive, is given an extraordinary opportunity as a consequence of \nthe reality that we are going to need steel in this country to build \nthat gas pipeline.\n  The estimated cost of that project is about $20 billion. My \nunderstanding is the order for the steel will be somewhere in the area \nof $4 billion to $5 billion. The last time we built a pipeline across \nthe length of Alaska, from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, it was 800 miles. Do \nyou know where the steel came from? It came from Japan; it came from \nKorea; it came from Italy. That was 48-inch pipe.\n  The pipe on this steel proposal is approximately 56-inch or \nthereabouts--52 to 56. It is X-80 to X-100, depending on the tensile \nstrength of the steel.\n  If it is not built in the United States, we know where it is going to \ncome from. It is going to come from foreign countries. Why wouldn't \nthis proposal stimulate the steel industry, both management and labor, \nto recognize we have a extraordinary opportunity to revitalize the \nsteel industry in this country?\n  They have the problem obviously associated with funding of the health \nbenefits for some 600,000 potentially retired employees. But this is an \nextraordinary opportunity.\n  In addition to the steel industry's opportunity for the major link \nassociated with the transportation, that is 3 thousand miles roughly \nfrom the Coastal Plain to the Chicago city gate. That is what we are \ntalking about. We are also talking about virtually thousands of miles \nof additional pipe associated with development in the Arctic--with both \nANWR and the ultimate development of the gas that has been discovered \nwhile looking for oil in Prudhoe Bay. That gas is about 36 trillion \ncubic feet of proven gas reserves.\n  I emphasize that as one who looks at opportunities for labor and \nopportunities for capital to come together with this kind of \nidentification of a funding mechanism of $8 billion to contribute to \nthe steel legacy fund, there is an additional $1 billion to the United \nMine Workers combined benefit fund--this is another fund that organized \nlabor and the coal mining industry has had a shortfall in--the \ncontribution of $232 million in commerce grants to retool the industry \nto compete in this project, as well as labor training through the \nDepartment of Labor of roughly $155 million, training steelworkers in \nthe new technologies associated with making this pipe, as well as the \ndirection of funds; and $155 million for National Park Service \nmaintenance backlog, habitat restoration, and conservation programs.\n  Isn't this a pretty attractive disposition, if you will, of funds \nassociated with the lease sale and the royalties to be generated from \nopening ANWR or is there a higher need? You take it into the General \nTreasury, and you can appropriate. But what we are doing, and what \nSenator Stevens has identified so clearly, is trying to meld two \nopportunities. That gas is going to be developed. The reason it is \ngoing to be developed is quite obvious. We are using our gas reserves \nnow faster than we are finding new reserves. Where are we going to get \nthe gas? We go down to the Gulf Coast States, and we are pulling down \nour gas reserves very rapidly there. We get a significant decline. It \nis estimated to be about 40 percent when we pull down offshore gas \nreserves. It lasts a little longer on land.\n  The reference to putting together an opportunity to revitalize our \nindustry and basically work together to train workers to address some \nof the combined benefits that the United Mine Workers and the coal \nindustry are short, as well as contribute to the steel legacy benefit \nprogram, is one that needs more examination by the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, we have not been able to go through a committee \nprocess, as we know, in bringing an energy bill to the floor. We would \nhave been able to pass ANWR out of committee, but the majority leader \nsaw fit to pull it. As a consequence, we have labored on various \naspects of the energy bill because it did not go through the committee \nprocess, which is indeed unfortunate. But we have to make the best of \nthe situation.\n  As a consequence, the second degree that is pending gives America's \nsteel industry an opportunity for a new lease on life. Are we simply \ngoing to lie back, address and debate the issues of the steel \nindustry's legacy shortfall or are we going to do anything about \nrejuvenating this industry?\n  I think Senator Stevens indicated in his comments that we need steel, \nwe need energy, and we need food to be a great Nation. Are we going to \nsimply let the steel industry drop off, slough off, and become more \ndependent on imported steel? We have already given them 3 years.\n  It surprises me there is not more interest from the industry. I \nrecognize there is a good deal of politics involved. I know Senator \nRockefeller has been working on this issue. I see in the Wall Street \nJournal of April 16 a reference where Senator Rockefeller says any deal \nthat would bind opening ANWR with steel is probably dead because the \nWhite House and the House Republican leaders won't provide letters of \nsupport for the steel bailout. But he said further that commitments \nfrom both camps were crucial to guarantees. They are.\n  We are going to do something with the revenue from ANWR if indeed we \nauthorize it to be opened. The question is, Do we want to, by ourselves \nhere collectively, come together as a bipartisan group and say this is \nwhat we want the money used for?\n  I have the greatest respect for Senator Rockefeller. He is a good \nfriend of mine. He said in the article that commitment from both camps \nwas crucial to the guarantee that the aid would survive final House-\nSenate negotiations on the broader energy bill now before the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                GOP Bid for Support on Drilling Founders\n\n       Washington.--A steel state Democrat announced he would \n     oppose drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, dashing a Republican bid to build Senate support for \n     ANWR by providing aid to retired steelworkers.\n       Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) said the deal fell through \n     because the White House and House Republican leaders won't \n     provide letters of support for the steel bailout. He said a \n     commitment from both camps was crucial to guarantee that the \n     aid would survive final House-Senate negotiations on the \n     broader energy bill now before the Senate.\n       The steel issue stems from President Bush's March 5 \n     decision to rescue the U.S. steel industry with temporary \n     tariffs on most steel imports.\n       Drilling in the Arctic is a top priority of the White House \n     and Republicans, as part of their push to reduce dependency \n     on foreign oil. But many Republicans were dismayed at the \n     steel offer, having opposed Mr. Bush's March 5 decision as a \n     political ploy that undermined the U.S.'s free-trade \n     credentials.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think the Senator from West Virginia \nis failing to recognize the obligation and opportunity we have to \ndesignate those funds. If we designate those funds for steel, that is \nwhere they are going to go. When Senator Rockefeller says he is opposed \nto ANWR, I would respectfully advise him that if you can support the \nfunding determination which is covered in Senator Stevens'\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\nsecond degree, then the funding can only come from one source, and that \nis ANWR.\n  If this body directs the funds to come from that source, it seems to \nme that certainly allays Senator Rockefeller's concern that somehow \nRepublicans wouldn't go along with the arrangement. We can dictate the \narrangement. We can make it law.\n  Finally, since we are discussing this, I would like to share a little \nbit about the status of the steel industry in this country.\n  I am told there are approximately 50 impacted steel-associated \nfacilities that have been closed since the year 2000--50 impacted \nfacilities--and 25 million tons of steelmaking capacity impacted or \neliminated since the year 2000; 25,430 lost steel jobs; idle \nsteelmaking facilities: 6 closed steelmaking facilities in Indiana, \nOhio, Utah, Alabama, Arizona, and Tennessee, 15 in Pennsylvania, 3 in \nIllinois, 4 in New York; in Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, and \nAlabama, 2 each; iron-rolling mills, and other steel-related and iron \nore facilities: 1 in Michigan; closed rolling mills in other steel-\nrelated and iron ore facilities: In Missouri, Michigan, 2; Texas, Ohio, \n6; Illinois, 4; Pennsylvania, 4; New York, Arkansas, Connecticut, 2; \nIndiana, California, Minnesota, Maryland, Alabama, Louisiana, 2.\n  Those are U.S. steel industry and ANWR production key facts.\n  Let me share with you the U.S. steel employment levels in 1980. There \nwere more than 500,000 U.S. steelworkers in this country. In the year \n2000, there were 224,000. It is estimated, in the year 2010, there will \nbe 176,000--an anticipated loss of 21 percent for U.S. steel-related \njobs. That is a statistic by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n  What does that mean? It means 23,000 jobs lost between 1998 and \nSeptember 2001; 270,000 steel jobs lost between 1980 and 1987. There \nare 600,000 current U.S. steel retirees. This is what we are talking \nabout: their health care benefits alone. That is what we can address in \nthis second-degree amendment. We are proposing to contribute $8 \nbillion.\n  Where is U.S. Steel? Where is Bethlehem? Where are they? Where are \nthe workers? Where are the retirees? Where are the unions on this one?\n  It is a source of revenue. Somebody is going to get that revenue when \nwe open ANWR. We are talking about a marriage, if you will, of U.S. \nsteel and U.S. jobs to build the largest pipeline ever conceived in \nNorth America, from Alaska to Chicago. What an opportunity. It is a \nwin-win-win situation. Where is the downside?\n  What does that clean gas do to our environment? It cleans up our air. \nForty-seven percent of U.S. steelworkers are employed in Pennsylvania, \nOhio, and Indiana. Forty-five percent of U.S. steel jobs are related \ndirectly to production. Eighteen percent of the jobs are related to \ninstallation, maintenance, repair, and construction. Sixteen percent \nare related to transportation and material-moving workers. Twenty \npercent are related to manager, professional sales, and administrative \nsupport occupations.\n  In 2000, 40 percent of steelworkers were covered by union contracts \ncompared with 16.2 percent in durable goods manufacturing and 14.9 \npercent in all industries.\n  Bringing new production capacity online--that is what we are talking \nabout--means thousands of new union members or reemploying laid-off \nunion members.\n  U.S. steel financial data: Domestic steel shipments down 14 percent \nin the first quarter of 2001.\n  Between 1997 and 2001, 31 steel companies in the United States filed \nfor bankruptcy and are in chapter 11. This represents more than 21 \npercent of U.S. steel's capacity.\n  In the late 2001 timeframe, U.S. steel prices fell to some of their \nlowest levels in 20 years. Nearly half of U.S. steel employees work in \nfactories with at least 1,000 employees.\n  Building new high-end, 52-inch X-100 steel capacity in the United \nStates--that is the pipeline we would build in the United States--would \nmean more factories that could employ thousands of new workers.\n  This is a $5 billion contract. The cost of building the new 52-inch \nX-100 pipeline rolling capacity--it is estimated to run somewhere in \nthe area of $250 million per facility because we are going to need more \nthan one facility.\n  Where are we going to buy it if we do not buy it in the United \nStates? We are going to buy it from Korea, we are going to buy it from \nJapan, and we are probably going to buy some from Italy because that is \nwhere we got it the last time when we built the TransAlaska Pipeline.\n  The total market capitalization of U.S. steel companies, as of March \n19, 2002, is $12.8 billion. Contracts worth $4 billion or more in steel \nfor the Alaska natural gas pipeline equals one-third of the total value \nof the entire U.S. steel industry.\n  Need I say more? I can go through the companies that have filed for \nbankruptcy. I think I will because it may awaken, if you will, some of \nthe folks out there who are following the debate.\n\n  This is an opportunity to rejuvenate America's steel industry--those \nwho are not covered by the steel legacy benefits for their health care, \nthe unfunded health programs, those who are unemployed, those who have \nbeen laid off. This is an opportunity for those companies that are \nstill in business to come together and recognize this is an \nopportunity.\n  When is the last time we had an opportunity such as this? We debated \nChrysler years ago. It was a question of whether we should give a \nguarantee to keep Chrysler afloat. We debated that heavily in the \nCongress. It was one of the first real debates we had on whether we \nwere going to save a traditional well-known corporation in this \ncountry. We decided to go ahead with that guarantee.\n  The results? Chrysler is still in business today. They are a \nprofitable corporation. But the premise of what we did was gambling on \nLee Iacocca and his imagination to rebuild the company.\n  For Heaven's sake, don't we have that same initiative left somewhere \nin America's steel industry, some CEO who wants to take the challenge? \nLet's make American steel competitive again. Let's make it great again. \nWe have that opportunity.\n  And the opportunity is good for all of America because it brings \ntogether, if you will, the components. We have the gas. We found it \nwhile developing Prudhoe Bay. We need the gas because we are pulling \ndown our reserves faster than we are finding new ones. We are going to \nbuild it sooner or later. It is going to require a pipeline.\n  For Heaven's sake, why not come together with America's steel \nindustry and ensure it is built in America, and get on with \nrevitalizing, if you will, this important industry?\n  We talk about national security. We can talk a lot about oil. I think \nSenator Stevens put it very succinctly when he said: You have to have \noil and energy. You have to have food. You have to have steel. So that \nis what we are talking about here.\n  States with steel companies filing for bankruptcy: In Indiana, Action \nSteel, Galv Pro, Great Lakes Metals, Heartland Steel, and Qualitech \nSteel; in Oklahoma, Sheffield Steel; in Texas, Metals USA; in \nPennsylvania, Bethlehem Steel, Riverview Steel, Edgewater Steel, \nFreedom Forge, Erie Forge & Steel, J Structural, and Worldclass \nProcessing; in Missouri, Excaliber Holding Co. and Laclede Steel; in \nCalifornia, Precision Steel; in Ohio, Republic Technologies, CSC Ltd., \nand LTV Corporation; in Alabama, Trico Steel and Gulf States Steel; in \nLouisiana, American Iron; in North Carolina, GS Industries; in \nIllinois, Northwestern Steel & Wire; in West Virginia, Wheeling-\nPittsburgh; in Michigan, Vision Metals; in Utah, Geneva Steel; in New \nYork, Al Tech Specialty and ACME Metals. That is 62,500 jobs. That is \nwhat is lost.\n  We are going to be debating this issue extensively, but I did want to \nfollow a little bit on the second degree and challenge America's steel \nindustry, challenge a couple CEOs out there who might have a little of \nthe Lee Iacocca spirit to try to bring America's steel industry \ntogether and come to grips with an opportunity.\n  If we do not open ANWR, clearly it is not going to fund the \nrejuvenation of America's steel industry. That is apparent. That is why \nI hope, as we proceed with this debate, there will be a critical \nevaluation of the merits of opening ANWR, what it can do for our \nnational security, and what it can do for American labor.\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska is absolutely right \nin his remarks about the need for the natural gas pipeline that is in \nthis bill. One of the first things we did--I cannot remember if it was \nthe Senator from Nevada or the majority leader who offered the \namendment--but we offered the amendment that would create the \nopportunity to build a gasline from Alaska to Chicago, basically. It \nwould be 3,500 miles long. That gasline would be 52 inches in diameter, \nand there would be a need for 5 million tons of steel to build that \npipeline. It is estimated that pipeline alone would create 400,000 \njobs.\n  So it would seem to me, we would be well advised to move this piece \nof legislation based on something we can all agree on; and that is, to \nbring natural gas from the North Slope to the lower 48 States. It is \nnoncontroversial in the sense that it is bipartisan in nature. We have \nnot only authorized the direction of that pipeline, we have also \nprovided, in the legislation, loan guarantees for the private sector to \nbuild that pipeline. But we have gotten off on a tangent here on \nsomething that both sides have their own opinion of what is best for \nthe country. As a result of that, ANWR is not going to happen.\n  But it should be recognized that the pipeline should happen. We \nshould join together and quickly handle the remaining amendments. We \nare working over here to get rid of as many as we can and move this \nlegislation forward.\n  The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, has worked so hard on this \nissue that he and Senator Stevens believe in so fervently. I am glad we \nhave the amendment before us. It is important we do that. Simply \nbecause I disagree with these two fine Senators from Alaska doesn't \ntake away from the fervor they feel about this amendment. We will find \nduring the debate that will take place in the next couple of days that \nthere are people who believe just as fervently that this amendment is a \nbad idea.\n  That is what the Senate is all about--the ability to debate publicly \nissues of extreme importance to the country. The decision to be made on \nANWR is important to the country.\n  As I have indicated, building a pipeline would not only create \nthousands of new jobs but would provide a huge opportunity for the \nsteel industry. The Senate has already spoken that we encourage the use \nof American steel and union labor in the construction of the pipeline. \nThe total cost of the Alaska natural gas pipeline is estimated to be as \nmuch as $20 billion. That is a real shot in the arm.\n  In addition to these enormous supplies of natural gas from existing \noilfields, there is another substantial opportunity to obtain \nadditional oil and gas resources from the Alaska North Slope. It is the \nNational Petroleum Reserve--Alaska. This reserve is 23 million acres, \nas I understand it, of public land approximately the size of the State \nof Indiana. It was created to secure the Nation's petroleum reserves.\n  It is administered by the BLM which, in 1999, offered 4 million acres \nin the northeast portion of this for leasing. The result was an \nextremely successful lease sale.\n\n  That sale had a high level of interest from the industry with about \n$105 million in bonus bids for 133 leases on about 860,000 acres. \nExploratory drilling has already occurred, and there have been major \nfinds by the industry there.\n  A second lease sale is scheduled to take place this summer. Planning \nis being undertaken to open an additional portion of this for leasing. \nAgain, no new law needs to be passed in order to drill here. We are not \ntalking about a piece of land the size of a postage stamp. We are \ntalking about 23 million acres.\n  As I said while I was waiting earlier today for Senator Murkowski to \noffer his amendment, I am very happy it is being offered. Tomorrow \nmorning we hope Senator Bingaman will have the opportunity to speak. He \nhas managed this bill. He has sat here patiently waiting for this \namendment. He has some things to say. I spoke to Senator Breaux this \nafternoon. He is on the side of the Senators from Alaska. He wishes to \nspeak tomorrow. Senator Kerry from Massachusetts believes very \npassionately that drilling in ANWR is absolutely wrong, and he will \nspeak for a considerable period of time to lay out his position. \nSenator Lieberman is scheduled to come as soon as he has an opportunity \nto speak in opposition to the two fine Senators from Alaska.\n  This is going to be a good debate. I personally look forward to it, \non a very serious note, and would hope the debate is, for lack of a \nbetter description, as high class as it has been to this point. There \nis a lot to talk about. This is an issue that is important to the \ncountry, and it is time we laid our cards on the table and at a \nsubsequent time vote as the Senate will allow us to do, either on a \nprocedural matter or on a substantive matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I very much appreciate the remarks of my good friend \nthe majority whip. The only question I would have is whether or not the \nmajority whip realizes that not one single steel mill in the United \nStates has the capacity currently to make the 52-inch steel pipe that \nis needed for the Alaska pipeline. They neither have the capacity nor \nare they familiar with this particular strength of steel. It is 80 to \n100 in the dimension.\n  So I ask the majority whip, my good friend from Nevada, how does he \npropose we are going to go through this transition of America's steel \nindustry achieving the capability to make the investment when indeed a \ngood portion of the industry is in bankruptcy, another portion of the \nindustry is in the process of not being able to pay its fund for health \ncare, the legacy costs?\n  It is important as we get into this debate that we not generalize \nthat somehow America's steel industry is going to participate without \nidentifying where the funds are going to come from because the private \nsector is going to be very reluctant to invest in America's steel \nindustry. That is why, obviously, the financial community did not see \nfit to invest in Chrysler when they had their troubled times. They \nexhausted all their alternatives. They came to the Congress, and the \nCongress came forward with a guarantee.\n  I ask my friend from Nevada how he proposes that any steel mill, \nsince not one in the United States currently makes 52-inch X-80 steel \npipe, how is the industry going to develop to meet the challenge of the \norder which we anticipate will be forthcoming?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to respond to my friend from Alaska. First of \nall, the American Iron and Steel Institute has stated that no one in \nthe world can make this pipe right now. But they also go on to say that \nif in fact there is an opportunity to do this pipeline, American \nentrepreneurship can do this. Remember, this legislation that we have \nalready accepted in this bill provides loan guarantees.\n  I also say to my friend from Alaska, I have great faith in the \nAmerican labor force and those, as I have said, entrepreneurs who have \nan opportunity to do good things for the country but also make money.\n  As far as the steel manufacturers, we have worked hard on this. As \nyou remember, last year Senator Byrd worked long and hard on something \nto bail out the industry. Of course, we received little help from your \nside of the aisle.\n  Senator Rockefeller, with whom I have spoken about this, recognizes \nthat if we are going to do something for the steel industry--and we \nare--that it is going to take real money. We look forward to working \nwith the steel State Senators. It is my understanding steel is now \nmanufactured in some form or fashion in about 16 States.\n  We are committed to do everything we can to help that industry, not \nonly from the management side but also for those workers who are \nentitled to a lot of things, not the least of which is pensions.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the response of the \nmajority whip. I guess my frustration is in knowing how to get the two \nsides together. I am referring to the article in the Wall Street \nJournal today where they quoted Senator Rockefeller saying that, \nsupposedly, the deal was ANWR revenues for steel. He said:\n\n       The deal fell through because the White House and the House \n     Republican leaders would not provide letters of support for \n     the steel industry--\n\n  He used the word ``bailout.'' I prefer ``rejuvenation.''\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\n  I ask my friend, don't we have the power in the Senate to direct the \nuse of these funds, as opposed to what the White House happens to think \nis in the best interest of the industry or politics? We have the \nauthority, do we not, to direct these funds for the benefit of the \nsteel industry if we authorize ANWR to be opened?\n  I ask my friend if, indeed, he can explain to me the logic that \nSenator Rockefeller proposes because he simply says the deal fell \nthrough because the White House and the Republican leaders would not \nprovide letters of support for the steel bailout. Why don't we just \npass the law here and designate the funds for the industry? That in \nitself should address the concerns of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I recognize it is not appropriate to ask the majority whip to explain \nthe rationale of Senator Rockefeller; nevertheless, I think the \nprinciple is here. If we wanted to pass this, we could, could we not?\n  Mr. REID. First of all, while I don't like to admit it, I don't read \nthe Wall Street Journal, so I don't know what it said. I have not read \nthat. Senator Rockefeller would have to respond to his questions. I \nhave my own reasons why I think it would be a very bad program, not the \nleast of which is I don't think ANWR would be improved. You would have \nto talk to Senator Rockefeller about that. All I know is that the \ndevelopment of this pipeline would create jobs in steel production, \npipe manufacturing, pipe laying, and construction. It would create lots \nof jobs. By any estimate I am aware of, the pipeline would create \nprobably at least 300 percent more jobs than the ANWR project.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think the hour is late and I am sure \nwe are about to wind up. I look forward to continuing the debate. I \nhope we can have, from the organization that represents the American \nsteel industry, some indication by tomorrow's debate just what their \nattitude would be toward their ability to restructure, to meet the \nanticipated order associated with the 3,000-mile natural gas pipeline \nfrom Alaska to Chicago. We will attempt to contact them in the 24 hours \nthat we have before we start the debate tomorrow to obtain their views \non their ability to meet this demand and what conditions would have to \nbe met in order for them to be competitive.\n  I think it is rather interesting, also--and I simply call this to the \nattention of my good friend, Senator Reid--it is my understanding that \nsomeone in the debate, regarding the merits of the 30-percent tariff \nthat was set for imported steel, specifically excluded 52-inch pipe. \nNow, I encourage Members to check on that because, to me, that pretty \nmuch gives an out for American steel. In effect, it says that all steel \ncoming into the United States is subject to a 30-percent import tariff, \nexcept 52-inch pipe. It seems to me that is not in the best interest of \nwhat we are talking about here, to try to encourage the American steel \nindustry to gear up for the largest order, by specifically exempting \n52-inch pipe, which is what this argument is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Stevens \n     amendment No. 3133, regarding drilling in ANWR:\n         Tom Daschle, Kent Conrad, Harry Reid, Ben Nelson, Barbara \n           Mikulski, Patty Murray, Dianne Feinstein, Tim Johnson, \n           Tom Carper, Jeff Bingaman, Byron Dorgan, Richard \n           Durbin, Mark Dayton, Jay Rockefeller, Patrick Leahy, \n           Jack Reed.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Murkowski \n     ANWR amendment No. 3132 to S. 517, the Energy Bill:\n         Tim Johnson, Tom Carper, John Kerry, Jeff Bingaman, \n           Patrick Leahy, Tom Harkin, Tom Daschle, Harry Reid, \n           Hillary Rodham Clinton, Max Cleland, Maria Cantwell, \n           Jack Reed, Ron Wyden, Carl Levin, Patty Murray, Max \n           Baucus.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only remaining business is to wrap up. \nWe will do that as soon as the Senator from Alaska allows me to go \nforward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I find it rather interesting that here \nwe are, and we have started on this bill roughly at 3 o'clock; it is \nnow roughly 6:35. I think it is extraordinary that the majority would \nfile cloture on this amendment when not one single Member has risen in \nopposition to either amendment. I do grant the whip that he did mention \nit briefly--his opinion on certain aspects of it.\n  But in view of the fact that no one has spoken on the other side, I \nhope that these amendments could just be accepted. Obviously, that is \nwishful thinking. I think it, again, represents a terrible departure \nfrom the traditions of this body in the way this entire energy bill has \nbeen handled. From the beginning, it was taken away from the committee \nof jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It was \ntaken away by the majority leader because he knew we had the votes to \ninclude ANWR in the energy bill and present it to the floor for debate.\n  Now, he also knew that, from a political point of view, he could \nramrod his bill without the benefit of the committee process. Yet he \nhas seen fit to take to task our side for delaying the bill.\n  Let me tell you what happened in this bill. It was an educational \nprocess. Most Members didn't have an idea of certain aspects of the \nrenewable portfolio, the electric portfolio. So he has opted out of the \ntradition of this body in the handling of this bill, and we have been \non it for a very short period of time. I am talking about, obviously, \nthe lightning rod, which is ANWR, and we all knew it. Now he has seen \nfit to file cloture on this amendment when not one single Member has \nrisen in opposition to either amendment. This means that debate around \nhere is no longer of any significance because everybody has their mind \nmade up ahead of time.\n\n  I think it is a sorry day for the Senate when we come to this impasse \nand address the disposition of this paramount issue by a cloture motion \nso early in the debate.\n  Outside of expressing my extreme disappointment in the manner this \nhas been handled, I hope that as we address the debate from here on in, \nit will be represented by factual information, not innuendoes, and that \nthose speaking in opposition have some knowledge because I will venture \nto say virtually every Member who will speak in opposition tomorrow has \nnever been to ANWR, has never been to Prudhoe Bay, and has never ever \nconsidered the significance of what this legislation would do for the \nNative indigenous people of the North Slope; namely, the Eskimo people \nof Kaktovik.\n  I am going to leave one thing for this body as we go out, and that is \nto reflect on the honey bucket in Kaktovik. That is the difference \nbetween a Third World nation and the realities of what a lifestyle \nwould bring to those people who want to have the same conveniences we \ntake for granted; that is, running water and sewer facilities. They can \nhave it if we can open up ANWR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, by any standard one can come up with, in any \nbody, especially any deliberative body, being on a bill since February \n18, being on a bill 19 full days of debating would be a pretty good \namount of debate. By any standard, being on a bill this long, one would \nsay is enough, but we have not had enough because under the rules of \nthe Senate which protect debate, we are not only going to be able to \ndebate all tomorrow, we can go all night tomorrow if anyone wants to \ntalk. That is what this is all about.\n  It seems to me we have had every opportunity to have this brought \nbefore us. I have been on this floor many\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\ntimes, most of the time representing the majority leader, saying: \nPlease bring this forward. Could you do it tomorrow? I even said I \nthink I will offer the amendment out of the House just to speed things \nup. Yesterday I asked: Can we start this in the morning?\n  The reason we have not had other people speaking in opposition to the \namendment is that the two Alaska Senators would not allow us to have \nanybody. We wanted to intersperse speakers. Senator Bingaman, the \nmanager of the bill, wanted to propound a unanimous consent request to \nset up an orderly process to debate. Senator Bingaman, being the \ngentleman he is, sat down and did not say a word. It is unusual that \nthe manager of the bill has not had the opportunity to speak. He waited \naround, I guess, but he has been here all day.\n  Senator Bingaman is going to speak tomorrow against these amendments. \nI announced this earlier. I said Senator Bingaman is going to speak \nagainst the amendment, and Senator Breaux is going to speak in favor. \nSenator Kerry wants to speak for an extended period of time. If anybody \nis looking for opposition to this amendment, I spoke in opposition to \nit today. I compared the Arctic wilderness to my home in Searchlight, \nNV. I compared the desert to the wilds of Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I respectfully request the reference \nnot be to the Arctic wilderness because, obviously, we are all aware \nthat this is not a designated wilderness. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to restate it: ANWR, and anyplace in my \nremarks in the last few minutes where I said ``Arctic wilderness,'' I \nwas simply saying not wilderness in the sense of legislative \nwilderness, but it is a very remote area. The place around Searchlight \nis not wilderness either in the true sense of the word, but it is \npretty wild desert. I did not mean to connote any legal term when I \nsaid ``wilderness.'' It is just a place out there all alone, Mr. \nPresident.\n  My friend from Alaska used the words ``extreme disappointment.'' I \ncan relate the extreme disappointment I have had on this bill in the \nlast 18 days waiting, waiting, waiting to get to ANWR. That is the crux \nof this bill. We know that. If ANWR is disposed of one way or another, \nwe have a bill.\n  My friends from Alaska said they knew they had the votes. We will \nfind out when we vote on this. Under a procedure of the Senate, unless \nsomething changes, we are going to vote on this an hour after the \nSenate comes in on Thursday. That is under the rules of the Senate. I \nknow--and I repeat what I said a few minutes ago--the Senators from \nAlaska believe in what they are doing. I repeat the words fervently. I \ndo not take a bit of credit away from them for doing that. That is \ntheir job, and they have done a good job. But there are certain things \nthat are not really--I should say they are not factual in some \nrespects.\n  For example, on the energy bill, there have been a lot of hearings in \nthe committee on which Senator Murkowski sat as the chairman; now \nSenator Bingaman is the chairman. We went through this before. There \nwere 12 hearings. Senator Murkowski is right, maybe we should have had \nmore hearings. There are not a lot of bills around here that have that \nmany hearings on them. Anytime there is important legislation--which \nthis is, setting the energy policy of this country--it is hard to \nsatisfy everybody.\n\n  Senator Daschle did the best he could. He brought a bill before the \nSenate. I lost track of the time: 18, 19 days--a long time ago. We \nstarted on the 18th day of February. Senator Daschle has done fine \ngetting it to this point. I think the legislation is moving along. I \nlook forward to the debate tomorrow.\n  Senator Murkowski wants to hear people in opposition to this. He is \ngoing to hear some. They will be just as believable as the Senators \nfrom Alaska in presenting their case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend will yield. I \nhate to prolong this, but I have to stay here as long as he does. I \nguess we have a little bit of a standoff. With respect to the committee \nprocess, I certainly concur we have had a lot of hearings, but I ask \nthe majority whip why we did not have any markups. Why did the majority \nleader forbid our committee from having markups after the hearings, \nwhen a majority of the committee supported ANWR? I would certainly \nappreciate any enlightenment. The only thing I have ever heard is that \nit was perhaps controversial. But I certainly defer to the whip to \nadvise us as to what the rationale was of forbidding any markups.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from Alaska--\nwe have been through this before, but I am happy to go through it \nagain--I had an exchange on the floor with my counterpart, Senator \nNickles, who said we had no hearings, and I listed by date the hearings \nwe had. He said we had no markup, and there was not a markup on this \nbill. That is acknowledged. Perhaps we learned something from when the \nRepublicans were in control of the Senate because their last energy \nbill had no markup.\n  We do not need to have this tit for tat. This is the Senate. There \nare different ways of moving things forward. Senator Daschle did \neverything by the rules of the Senate. He did not do anything that was \nshady or try to contrive something. He certainly did not do anything \nthat the Republicans had not done when they were in the majority, \nexcept I believe we had a lot more hearings on our bill than they had \non their bill.\n  As I say, in the legislative process, this is used so many times, but \nit certainly is as descriptive as I can be: There are two things one \ndoes not want to watch: Sausage being made and the Senate creating \nlegislation because it is not a lot of times an orderly process, but we \ndo it by the rules, just as when the Republicans were in the majority \nthey did it by the rules.\n  Sometimes we wish we did not have these rules, but they are here, and \nthey are here for a reason. We have played by the rules, and we will \ncontinue to play by the rules and do the best we can.\n  The important issue is when we vote. That is when the real decisions \nare made. On occasions it is hard to get to a vote, as it has been on \nthis issue. On Thursday morning we are going to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate, however, \nsince we have the responsibility for some consistency, to refer to the \nmanner in which the Pickering nomination was handled.\n  A quote from the majority leader on March 6 states:\n\n       If we respect the committee process at all, I think you \n     have to respect the decisions of every committee. I will \n     respect the wishes and the decisions made by that committee, \n     as I would with any other committee.\n\n  Then at a news conference March 14, after the disposition:\n\n       Committees are there for a reason, and I think we have to \n     respect the committee jurisdiction, responsibility and \n     leadership, and that's what I intend to do.\n\n  Obviously, there was never an opportunity for the committee as a \nwhole to bring the matter to the floor, and I think we all can reflect \non that bit of inconsistency.\n  I conclude by referring to the release on October 9, 2001. It was \nentitled: Energy Committee Suspends Markups; Will Propose Comprehensive \nand Balanced Energy Legislation to Majority Leader. This was by \nChairman Jeff Bingaman, and it says:\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further markup of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress. Instead, the \n     chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added by the majority leader to the \n     Senate calendar for potential action prior to adjournment. \n     Noted Bingaman, it has become increasingly clear to the \n     majority leader and to me that much of what we are doing in \n     our committee is starting to encroach on the jurisdictions of \n     other committees. Additionally, with the few weeks remaining \n     in this session, it is now obvious to all how difficult it is \n     going to be for these various committees to finish their work \n     on energy-related provisions.\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Senator Bingaman \n     said, the Senate's leadership sincerely wants to avoid \n     quarrelsome, divisive votes in committees. At a time\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\n     when Americans all over the world are pulling together with a \n     sense of oneness and purpose, Congress has an obligation at \n     the moment to avoid these contentious issues that divide \n     rather than unite us.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these quotes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Congress Daily AM, Apr. 16, 2002]\n\n         GOP Plan To Link Drilling With Steel Aid Falls Through\n\n                   (By Geoff Earle and Brody Mullins)\n\n       An idea that top Republicans had been considering to link a \n     steel program with an amendment oil drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge has fallen through, according to \n     Sen. John (Jay) Rockefeller, D-W. Va.\n       ``It's quite dead,'' Rockefeller said. ``The deal was nixed \n     by the White House.''\n       Rockefeller said that Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, \n     approached him last week about linking provisions to provide \n     healthcare and retirement benefits to steelworkers using ANWR \n     royalties. Rockefeller said that Stevens told him, ``I need \n     oil, you need steel, let's see if we can work together.''\n       Rockefeller, who has opposed ANWR in the past, said he \n     would be willing to back ANWR if it included so-called steel \n     legacy provisions. But Rockefeller said he would not go along \n     unless Republicans could produce letters from the president \n     or vice president. Speaker Hastert, and House Energy and \n     Commerce Chairman Tauzin, to ensure that the provisions are \n     included in a final bill after a conference committee.\n       But Rockefeller said the administration told him that while \n     a letter might be possible, ``you get us 60 votes first.''\n       Sixty votes will be needed to break a filibuster of an ANWR \n     amendment.\n       Rockefeller said he did not think there were more than 54 \n     votes for a clean ANWR bill. ``The deal being off, they'll be \n     lucky if they're at 50,'' he said. Rockefeller added he was \n     searching for other vehicles to move steel legislation.\n       Rockefeller said he was able to draw conclusions about the \n     lack of interest on the part of the White House from a \n     conversation with Commerce Secretary Evans.\n       ``The White House isn't behind it, you can forget the whole \n     thing,'' he said. Rockefeller added that he plans to vote \n     against ANWR.\n       Meanwhile, the Senate is expected to begin debate today on \n     the ANWR amendment. Energy and Natural Resources ranking \n     member Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, had considered delaying \n     action until Wednesday, but debate on the measure now is \n     expected to begin today.\n       Majority Leader Daschle is expected to debate an amendment \n     offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Paul \n     Wellstone, D-Minn., to give the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission new authority to safeguard electricity consumers.\n       On other controversial amendments, Consumers Union called \n     Monday on the Senate to strip from the energy bill a far-\n     reaching ethanol compromise that would triple the amount of \n     ethanol-produced gasoline.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Energy Committee Suspends Mark-Ups; Will Propose Comprehensive and \n             Balanced Energy Legislation to Majority Leader\n\n  (By Jeff Bingaman, Chairman Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n                        Resources, Oct. 9, 2001)\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further mark-up of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress.

I will \n     respect the wishes and the decisions made by that committee, \n     as I would with any other committee.--Senator Tom Daschle, \n     News Conference, March 6, 2002.\n       Committee are there for a reason, and I think we have to \n     respect the committee jurisdiction, responsibility, and \n     leadership, and that's what I intend to do.--Senator Tom \n     Daschle, News Conference, March 14, 2002.\n       For whatever reason, the Republicans are slow-walking the \n     energy bill. They appear not to want to move this to final \n     passage or to a conclusion. We're not sure why they're not \n     more supportive of bringing the debate to a close, but they \n     have yet to offer the ANWR amendment and some of the other \n     more controversial amendments. So we've been on the \n     legislation 12 days already, and, you know, that's almost \n     three weeks, and we have--we have very little prospect of \n     finishing the legislation any time in the foreseeable future. \n     So we're going to have to make some decisions about cloture \n     when we get back, but its disappointing that they have not \n     been more willing to move the legislation forward than we've \n     seen so far.--Senator Tom Daschle, News Conference, March 21, \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think it speaks for itself that indeed there is an \ninconsistency. When it benefits the other side, they basically \nsteamroll the process by excluding the committee. They have seen fit to \ndo so, and the energy bill is certainly the most recent, and I think \nthe most blatant, inconsistency associated with the administration of \nthe leadership. I think this is certainly evidenced even further by the \nmanner in which the cloture motion has been laid down this evening, \nafter only less than 3 hours of debate on what, indeed, the majority \nwhip identified as the major issue in the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this indicates how tough Senator Daschle's \njob is. He is criticized for doing something in the committee. He is \ncriticized by the minority for doing the work in the Committee on the \nJudiciary. When he does that, he is criticized. When he does not do it, \nhe is criticized on the energy bill.\n  We do not need this tit for tat stuff, but at least having been in \nthe Senate during the time the Republicans controlled the Judiciary \nCommittee we are at least having hearings for the judges. They would \nnot even do that. We had judges who waited 4 years and did not even get \na hearing. I do not think the Judge Pickering nomination is a good \nexample because if they use how they treated our judicial nominees, \nthat is those under President Clinton, we would win that in a slam \ndunk.\n  We are moving judges more rapidly than they did. We are giving all \nthe judges hearings as quickly as possible. My personal feeling is the \nPickering nomination is not a good example of how the Republicans have \ntreated us with the Judiciary Committee. Maybe some other committee but \nnot Judiciary, because we, for lack of a better description, took it in \nthe shorts with our judicial nominees.\n\n\n               low income home energy assistance program\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am delighted to participate in a colloquy with \nSenator Kennedy on the important issue of the Low Income Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  I want to recognize Senator Kennedy's tireless work on behalf of the \npeople in need that this program strives to serve. In particular, I \nwant to laud his efforts to increase LIHEAP authorizations. For too \nlong, this program has not kept pace with Congress' original intent. No \none has been more acutely aware of this than Senator Kennedy himself. \nHe has worked diligently to ensure LIHEAP is fully funded, including an \neffort to commit $3.4 billion to the program.\n  Unfortunately, it takes more than the tireless work of even such a \ndistinguished Chairman as Senator Kennedy to make this change. It takes \neach of us in Congress, and a willing administration as well. \nUnfortunately, that will has not yet been there. In fact, LIHEAP's \naverage annual appropriation since 1984 has been $1.4 billion.\n  Mr. President, 22 years ago, LIHEAP was amended, following its \noriginal enactment in 1981. With the 1984 amendments, Congress put in \nplace an elegant, simple and straightforward mechanism to ensure these \nscarce Federal resources got to those low-income Americans in greatest \nneed. It accommodates: Annual updates of State expenditures for low-\nincome home energy requirements--regardless of fuel source--for heating \nand cooling. Changes in weather--including heating/cooling degree days \nand fuel price volatility--for electricity, fuel oil, liquid petroleum \ngases and natural gas.\n  I have just described to you as near-perfect a means as possible to \nget the\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nfunds to those low-income Americans in greatest need. This mechanism \ncan get funds to low-income Californians reeling from gas and electric \nprice shocks, or Georgians who last summer endured crushing gas bills.\n  However, LIHEAP funds do not flow to all the places they are needed \ntoday but instead where they were needed in 1979 and 1980.\n  Back then, it was assumed that LIHEAP appropriations would rise, and \nthe allocation mechanism mentioned above has been cast aside. The law \nstates that unless LIHEAP appropriations exceed $1.975 billion, the \nelements described above do not control. Instead, the controlling \nfactor is a state's receipt of funds in 1981.\n  Much can happen in 22 years. For example, from 1980 to 2000: Dallas' \npopulation grew from 904,074 to 1,118,580; Clark County, NV's \npopulation grew from 463,087 to 1,375,765; Greater Phoenix, Arizona \ngrew from 1,509,000 to 3,072,000.\n  It would be unfortunate, if we were unable to respond to such \nsituations, in these areas, or to the needs of the citizens of my own \nState of Louisiana, merely because LIHEAP was locked into the past. We \nneed to address today's problems as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her comments \nand commend her for her steadfast commitment to the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. She is an outstanding advocate for needy \nfamilies in Louisiana and across the country. She is correct that the \nprogram demands and deserves significantly more funding than it \ncurrently receives. I'm sure she's as pleased as I am that LIHEAP's \nauthorization levels are increased in the underlying bill. I look \nforward to working with her and with her colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee to increase funding for this vital program.\n  Senator Landrieu has raised some very important concerns about the \nprogram which must be addressed during the re-authorization process. I \nplan to hold hearings on this issue and invite Senator Landrieu to \ntestify. Her proposals will play a very serious role during \nconsideration of LIHEAP re-authorization.\n  Senator Landrieu raises a critical point regarding the vulnerability \nof our poorest citizens to extreme weather conditions. My State is the \nhome of ground-breaking research on the negative health impacts of \nextreme temperatures, particularly on poor children with chronic \nillnesses suffering through cold winters. Research at the Failure to \nThrive Clinic at Boston Medical Center has indicated that needy \nchildren often start to lose weight and suffer additional problems \nassociated with malnutrition, because their families are spending less \nof their meager incomes on food and medicine, and more on fuel bills. \nNo family should have to choose between energy, rent, prescription \ndrugs, or food. LIHEAP helps families meet their home energy needs, so \nthey can meet other immediate priorities, too.\n  From 1979 to 1998, the Centers for Disease Control reports that there \nwere 7,421 deaths in the United States due to heat stroke. Over the \nsame time period, CDC says 13,970 people died of hypothermia, or \nexposure to cold. In Massachusetts, people who cannot afford to heat \ntheir homes efficiently often employ more dangerous methods of heat--\nsuch as using space heaters or simply leaving oven doors open. In \nwinter 2000, an unseasonably cold winter for my state, deaths from home \nfires due to space heaters surged in Massachusetts. Nearly one out of \nevery five fire deaths in Massachusetts in 2000 was caused by a space \nheater.\n  Had LIHEAP been fully funded, and had the program reacted more \neffectively to crises, we would have been able to save lives. The real \ntragedy of this debate is that the flexibility already in LIHEAP isn't \nbeing utilized. Emergency LIHEAP funding, desperately needed in \nLouisiana, Massachusetts, and across the country, is still sitting at \nthe White House.\n  The Bush administration is sitting on $600 million in LIHEAP funds \nthat can be placed wherever it is needed most. Half of this emergency \nfunding was approved by Congress in the previous fiscal year. LIHEAP \napplications keep increasing, the economy still struggles, and States \nare forced to cut LIHEAP benefits for our people--but the \nadministration keeps claiming an ``emergency'' doesn't exist while \nthousands of families are still facing the terrible choice of heat, \ncooling, or food. The Bush administration can reach the families it \nmentioned in its budget message right now by releasing the emergency \nfunds. Until it does so, the administration can't discuss improving \nLIHEAP with any credibility.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his interest and commitment to \naddressing this issue during reauthorization. I look forward to working \nclosely with Chairman Kennedy on this matter next year as well as the \nopportunity to testify before his committee. Throughout the South and \nthe Southwest there is an urgent need for this reform and I am grateful \nfor Senator Kennedy's support.\n\n\n                      Renewable Portfolio Standard\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have heard hours of debate on the \nSenate energy bill. One of the messages that we've heard repeated in \nstatements on many different energy related subjects is that energy \npolicy is highly influenced by region. Energy policy that works in one \nregion may not work in another, nor do policy decisions necessarily \ntranslate from state to state. For example, Florida's unique \ntopographic, climatic, and geological conditions make it impossible to \nharness certain forms of renewable energy, such as wind and hydropower. \nJust as it would be difficult for the State of Alaska to rely on solar \nenergy during its dark winter months. For these reasons, I have \nexpressed my concern to the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator \nBingaman, that a broadly applied renewable portfolio standard will not \nwork optimally for all fifty states of the union. While I remain \nsupportive of expanding the use of renewable energy supplies as an \nimportant part of our national energy portfolio, I prefer an approach \nthat treats regions and states with deference to their unique \ncircumstances. An RPS standard cannot be rigid, but must be flexible.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have been working with my colleagues from Florida for \nsome time to address their concerns with the renewable portfolio \nstandard in the Senate energy bill. Let me say that I think it is \ncritical to increase the use of renewables in order to decrease our \ndependence on fossil fuels and foreign imports. However, I also \nappreciate the differences that occur from region to region and State \nto State. I would like to extend an offer to Senators Graham and Nelson \nto work in conference to find some method that will enable a renewable \nportfolio standard to accomplish the goal of increasing renewables \nwhile recognizing the legitimate differences among States. I believe \nthat we can find an appropriate way to help each state include a \nrenewable standard as part of their overall energy production, and I am \ncommitted to working with Senator Graham to accomplish this.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to thank Senator Bingaman for his work on the \nenergy bill and for his offer to help address on my concerns with the \nrenewable standard specifically. I look forward to working together on \nthis important provision, and I withdraw my related amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2717-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I join all Vermonters in congratulating \nDavid and Ann Scoville on receiving the National Crime Victim Service \nAward of 2002. We thank them for all they do to help the victims of \ncrime and to help the public understand victims' needs.\n  Nearly 20 years ago the Scovilles suffered every parent's nightmare--\nthe disappearance and murder of their daughter, Patricia. The crime \nthat took her from them remains unsolved to this day--a situation that \nhas compounded the Scovilles' suffering and\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\none that also torments many other families.\n  Through their lives and examples, the Scovilles have become role \nmodels for grieving families who have suffered similar losses. They \nhave summoned the courage and compassion to harness their pain for \npositive outcomes. They have made it their work to help other families \nescape the anguish they endured, and to help raise the awareness of \npublic officials about the importance of victims' participation \nthroughout all phases of the criminal justice process.\n  Victims of murder, rape, domestic violence, sexual assault and other \ncrimes deserve the understanding and support of the American people and \nof the Congress. We have a duty to ensure that the criminal justice \nsystem is one that respects the rights and dignity of crime victims, \nrather than one that complicates or even exacerbates the suffering of \nthose already victimized.\n  Congress has listened to their counsel and to the counsel of other \nvictims of crime. Over the past two decades many of us have worked hard \nto pass laws that have provided victims with greater rights and \nassistance, including stronger protection for witnesses of crime; a \nVictims' Bill of Rights; protection for female victims of violence; \nmandatory restitution for crime victims; special awareness of the needs \nof victims with disabilities; special programs for victims of \nterrorism; and an act for victims of trafficking.\n  We continue the fight to win more rights and help for victims of \ncrime, largely because the victims' rights agenda in Congress has been \nadvanced, year by year, by advocates like the Scovilles. I, with \nSenator Kennedy, have introduced the Crime Victims Assistance Act of \n2001, which focuses on protecting victims' rights, including victims' \nenhanced participatory rights at trial and sentencing.\n  This legislation requires that a responsible official consult with \nvictims prior to detention hearings, and consider victims' views about \nany contemplated plea agreement. It calls for the presiding judge to \ninquire regarding victims' views on detention, and prohibits the court \nfrom entering a judgment upon a guilty plea without regarding victims' \nviews. The bill also provides for enhanced victims' rights regarding \nthe right to attend the trial and sentencing. Victims are also given \nspecific rights regarding notice of sentence adjustment, discharge from \na psychiatric facility and executive clemency.\n  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, this \nlegislation proposes several programs to help States provide better \nassistance for victims of State crimes. These programs would improve \ncompliance with State victims' rights laws, promote the development of \nstate-of-the-art notification systems to keep victims informed of case \ndevelopments and important dates on a timely and efficient basis, and \nencourage further experimentation with the community-based restorative \njustice model in the juvenile court setting.\n  We were able to include much of the Crime Victims Assistance Act in \nlast year's USA PATRIOT Act supported by Republicans and Democrats. One \nmajor provision that remains to be achieved, however, is to eliminate \nthe artificial cap on the Crime Victims' Fund, which has prevented \nmillions of dollars from reaching victims and from supporting essential \nservices for them.\n  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs \nand made advances in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have \nmore to do. I commend David and Ann Scoville for their leadership and \nlook forward to continuing to work with them to advance crime victims' \nrights legislation, and to make a difference in the lives of crime \nvictims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2718-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2718-S2719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   HOLOCAUST EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, during these Days of \nRemembrance, to remind my colleagues about those who perished, but also \nthose who persevered, in the unimaginable atrocities of the Holocaust.\n  Through remembering the Holocaust and teaching generation after \ngeneration about the atrocities that occurred over 60 years ago, we can \nhelp ensure that such tragedies do not repeat themselves. General \nDwight D. Eisenhower recognized this long ago. After visiting the \nOhrdruf concentration camp in 1945, General Dwight Eisenhower arranged \nfor mass witnessing of the camps by military, press reporters, and \nphotographers. ``Let the world see,'' ordered Eisenhower. He realized \nthat the world must bear witness to the atrocities of the Holocaust, \nand that it was necessary to teach our children about what had \nhappened.\n  To help make sure that future generations continue to learn about and \nremember the Holocaust, my friend and colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, and I introduced a bill last week, called the ``Holocaust \nEducation Assistance Act.'' Our new bill would authorize two million \ndollars for grants to schools and school districts to develop a \ncurriculum that teaches our students about the Holocaust, the triumph \nof the Jewish people, and all who helped them persevere.\n  At the same time, it is also important to teach our children about \nthe thousands of individuals, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who took a \nstand against the persecution and killing of innocent people. I am \nreminded today of an obituary I read in the New York Times a couple of \nyears ago, of a man named Jan Karski, who was one of the first to stand \nup to the injustice of the Holocaust.

Mr. President, I rise today, during these Days of \nRemembrance, to remind my colleagues about those who perished, but also \nthose who persevered, in the unimaginable atrocities of the Holocaust.\n  Through remembering the Holocaust and teaching generation after \ngeneration about the atrocities that occurred over 60 years ago, we can \nhelp ensure that such tragedies do not repeat themselves. General \nDwight D. Eisenhower recognized this long ago. After visiting the \nOhrdruf concentration camp in 1945, General Dwight Eisenhower arranged \nfor mass witnessing of the camps by military, press reporters, and \nphotographers. ``Let the world see,'' ordered Eisenhower. He realized \nthat the world must bear witness to the atrocities of the Holocaust, \nand that it was necessary to teach our children about what had \nhappened.\n  To help make sure that future generations continue to learn about and \nremember the Holocaust, my friend and colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, and I introduced a bill last week, called the ``Holocaust \nEducation Assistance Act.'' Our new bill would authorize two million \ndollars for grants to schools and school districts to develop a \ncurriculum that teaches our students about the Holocaust, the triumph \nof the Jewish people, and all who helped them persevere.\n  At the same time, it is also important to teach our children about \nthe thousands of individuals, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who took a \nstand against the persecution and killing of innocent people. I am \nreminded today of an obituary I read in the New York Times a couple of \nyears ago, of a man named Jan Karski, who was one of the first to stand \nup to the injustice of the Holocaust. I am reminded of the role he, and \nmany others, played in our modern history. He had a unique view of an \nappalling and shameful era of history. Let me explain.\n  During World War II, Jan Karski brought Allied leaders in the West--\nat no small risk to his own life--what is believed to be the first \neyewitness reports of Hitler's indescribable acts of hate and cruelty \nagainst the Jews.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nstrengthening our medical care community against the threat of \nbioterrorism. As chairman of the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I held a hearing in July \n2001 where representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nand the Department of Health and Human Services discussed the \nactivities underway by dedicated Federal employees across the \nGovernment to prepare our communities for a biological crisis. On \nOctober 17, 2001, I co-chaired a joint Subcommittee/Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearing to discuss further the public health \nimplications of bioterrorism. Coincidentally the hearing was held on \nthe same day the Hart Senate Office Building was shut down because of \nthe anthrax attack.\n  Through these hearings, and several others held in both the House and \nSenate, we have learned that the Federal Government is not unprepared \nto deal with bioterrorism. However, preparedness levels are not uniform \nor consistent across the United States, and there are considerable and \nserious problems. As I said during our hearing in October, while not \nunprepared, America is clearly under prepared.\n  Now, almost 6 months to the day after the first anthrax letter \narrived in Hart, I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring two \ninitiatives that are modest in nature but which have profound impact on \nour fight against bioterrorism.\n  The first initiative, S. 1560 the Biological Agent-Environmental \nDetection Act, will increase our efforts to develop the necessary tools \nto minimize the impact of bioterrorism by reducing the number of people \nexposed and alerting authorities and medical personnel to a threat \nbefore symptoms occur. Current methods are not adequate to monitor the \nair, water, and food supply continuously in order to detect rapidly the \npresence of biological agents.\n  The Biological Agent-Environmental Detection Act establishes an \ninteragency task force to coordinate public-private research in \nenvironmental monitoring and detection tools of bioterrorist agents. \nThe act authorized appropriations totaling $40 million to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to encourage cooperative \nagreements between Federal Government and industry or academic \nlaboratory centers, and pursue new technologies, approaches and \nprograms to identify clandestine laboratory locations. The act also \nestablishes a means of testing, verifying and calibrating new detection \nand surveillance tools and techniques developed by the private sector. \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Thompson supported this \nlegislation and the authorization amount during the Subcommittee/\nGovernmental Affairs Committee Hearing in October.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I introduced S. 1561 Strengthening \nbioterrorism preparedness through expanded National Disaster Medical \nSystem training programs. This measure provides training for health \ncare workers for bioterrorism or any biological crisis. Strengthening \nthe public health system is very important and is being addressed by \nseveral congressional and administrative initiatives. But public health \ndoes not translate necessarily to the medical community. Creating a \ncritical line of defense against bioterrorism must involve health care \nprofessionals. Training of emergency medical technicians, physicians, \nand nurses has been hindered by a lack of economic incentives for \nhospitals and clinics to make available formal training opportunities.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, was \nappropriated $800,000 to establish a training program for VA staff for \nthe National Disaster Medical System, which is made up of VA and the \nDepartments of Defense and Health and Human Services, and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  One such training program, open to VA and Department of Defense staff \nas well as their community counterparts, took place earlier this year. \nThe Akaka-Rockefeller bill expands this program by drawing on \nestablished partnerships between the 173 VA hospitals and community \nhospitals and using existing VA resources to implement a telemedicine \nand training program for local health care providers in bioterrorism \npreparedness and response.\n  In formulating a congressional response to bioterrorism, we must not \nforget the role our local and community hospitals would play in such a \ncrisis. We must provide our professionals, public health officials, and \nemergency managers the earliest possible warning of pending outbreaks. \nI know our scientists and engineers can develop robust, effective, and \naccurate detection methods. Likewise, I believe we have the best and \nmost dedicated health care staff in the world. They deserve to have the \ntraining and information needed to protect and treat Americans in \ninstances of biological terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2719-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is with a great deal of pride that \nI share with my colleagues the names of several Wyoming students who \nare being honored for their outstanding community service with a \nPrudential Spirit of Community Award.\n  These awards, in their seventh year, are presented by Prudential \nFinancial, together with the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals. They honor the young people of our State who were nominated \nfor their remarkable acts of volunteerism. This year a record 28,000 \nyoung men and women were considered for this special award.\n  The two top youth volunteers from my State are Chelsie Gorzalka, 17, \nof Clearmont and Tabetha Waits, 12, of Rawlins. We can be proud of each \nof them for the difference they have made in their communities. Their \nefforts help to make their home towns better places to live.\n  Chelsie Gorzalka is a member of the Sheridan County Extension 4-H and \na senior at Arvada/Clearmont High School. Chelsie received her \nnomination for the puppet plays she puts on around the State in an \neffort to educate our young children about the dangers of tobacco and \ndrugs.\n  Tabetha Waits of Rawlins Middle School was nominated for her \norganization of ``You Can't Break Our Stride'' an all-school walkathon \nthat raised nearly $10,000 to assist the families of those who were \naffected by the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  These two award winners, along with the two honorees who have \nreceived this award from each of the other States, the District of \nColumbia and Puerto Rico, will receive a $1,000 award, an engraved \nsilver medallion, and a trip to the Nation's capital. During their stay \nhere, ten from among that group of finalists will be named America's \ntop youth volunteers for 2002.\n  In addition to Chelsie and Tabetha, I would like to congratulate our \nState's two distinguished finalists.\n  Cory Poulos, 18, was nominated by Natrona County High School. He \norganized and participated in a Roof-Sit fundraiser that collected more \nthan $5,000 to benefit ``Families of Freedom,'' a post secondary \neducation fund for children whose parents were injured or killed in the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks.\n  Mark Sabec, 17, was nominated by Natrona County High School as well. \nHe created ``No Casualties,'' a peer and adult mentoring project aimed \nat reducing the number of school dropouts in his community.\n  Our congratulations goes out to these fine young people and to all \nthose who participated in the awards program. Thanks to them, it is \nclear that our future is in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2719-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2719-S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN SUPPORT OF ONCOLOGY NURSES AND ONCOLOGY NURSING SOCIETY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues the important role that oncology nurses play \nin the care of patients diagnosed with cancer.\n  This year alone 1,284,900 Americans will hear the words ``You have \ncancer''. Everyday, oncology nurses see the pain and suffering caused \nby cancer and understand the physical, emotional, and financial \nchallenges that people with cancer face throughout their diagnosis and \ntreatment.\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\n  Cancer is a complex, multifaceted, and chronic disease, and people \nwith cancer are best served by a multidisciplinary health care team \nspecialized in oncology care, including nurses who are certified in \nthat specialty. Oncology nurses play a central role in the provision of \nquality cancer care as they are principally involved in the \nadministration and monitoring of chemotherapy and the associated side-\neffects patients may experience. As anyone ever treated for cancer will \ntell you, oncology nurses are intelligent, well-trained, highly \nskilled, kind-hearted angels who provide quality clinical, \npsychosocial, and supportive care to patients and their families. In \nshort, they are integral to our nation's cancer care delivery system.\n  The Oncology Nursing Society, ONS, is the largest organization of \noncology health professionals in the world with more than 30,000 \nregistered nurses and other health care professionals. Since 1975, the \nOncology Nursing Society has been dedicated to excellence in patient \ncare, teaching, research, administration and education in the field of \noncology. The Society's mission is to promote excellence in oncology \nnursing and quality cancer care. To that end, ONS honors and maintains \nnursing's historical and essential commitment to advocacy for the \npublic good by providing nurses and healthcare professionals with \naccess to the highest quality educational programs, cancer-care \nresources, research opportunities, and networks for peer support.\n  The ONS has a chapter that serves the state of Rhode Island and the \nsoutheastern Massachusetts areas. This chapter helps them to continue \nto provide high quality cancer care to those patients and their \nfamilies. On behalf of the people of Rhode Island, I want to express my \nappreciation for all that these amazing nurses do to advance the health \nand well-being of people with cancer and to further the practice of \noncology nursing.\n  Despite significant breakthroughs in the treatment, early detection, \nand prevention of cancer, two-thirds of new cancer cases strike people \nover the age of 65 and the number of new cancer cases diagnosed among \nthe elderly is projected to more than double by 2030 as the Baby Boom \ngeneration ages. The impact that cancer has on our nation, especially \non the Medicare Program, cannot be underestimated or overlooked. In \naddition, more than 115,000 nursing positions will go unfilled by the \nyear 2015--a factor which--taken with eroding Medicare payment for \noutpatient cancer care--further exacerbates the challenge of a growing \nnumber of cancer cases.\n  This week more than 5,000 oncology nurses from around the country \nhave traveled to Washington, DC to attend the Oncology Nursing \nSociety's 27th Annual Congress. This year's theme is aptly titled ``The \nMany Faces of Oncology Nursing.'' The attendees will increase their \nknowledge of the newest cancer treatments, learn the latest \ndevelopments in cancer nursing research, and enhance their clinical \nskills and contribute to their professional development. In addition, \napproximately 550 of these nurses--representing 49 states--will come to \nCapitol Hill to discuss issues.\n  I would like to commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of its \nefforts over the last 27 years and to thank the Society and its members \nfor their ongoing commitment to improving and assuring access to \nquality cancer care for all cancer patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2720-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYGNUS\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Cygnus, \nInc. of Ponderay, ID on being recognized as one of Boeing's Top 25 \nSuppliers for the C-17.\n  As we all know, the C-17 is one of our key aircraft. Since it was \nfirst put into service in 1993, the C-17 has proven its worthiness as \nan extremely flexible airlift aircraft vital to our national security. \nLately, Congress has reaffirmed its commitment to the C-17 by \nauthorizing the purchase of additional aircraft. This is the right \nthing to do and I applaud my colleagues. In this day and age, we need a \nrapid-deployment airlift aircraft that can reach remote areas. The C-17 \ndelivers and we must continue to support the program. Not only is it \nimportant for our national defense, it is money well spent because of \nquality subcontractors like Cygnus.\n  Cygnus has supplied top-notch parts for the C-17 since the first \naircraft rolled off the assembly line. Today, Boeing and Cygnus \ncelebrated the delivery of the parts for the 100th C-17 and Boeing will \nrecognize Cygnus as one of the top 25 suppliers for the program.\n  Cygnus is a real success story of Idaho. It started in 1998 and since \nthen has grown to sixty-five employees, forty-five of which work on its \nC-17 program. What is truly remarkable is they have taken those 65 \nemployees, who didn't have experience in the aerospace manufacturing \nfield, and turned them into a stellar team supplying our Nation's \nmilitary. Because they have chosen to locate in Ponderay, ID, they have \nhelped to diversify the local economy from a natural resource dependent \neconomy to one that has a diverse industrial base.\n  Boeing is not the only one to recognize Cygnus' performance. In 2000, \nRegion 10 of the Small Business Administration recognized Cygnus as the \nSubcontractor of the Year for their outstanding work on the U.S. Navy's \nF-18 E/F program.\n  Since September 11, our country has recognized, more than ever, the \nsacrifice that our Nation's military gives to protect our freedoms. \nToday, I also want to recognize the effort that our civilian laborers \nput into the effort. Much like Rosie the Riveter assisted our troops in \nWorld War II, our civilian manufacturers of today, working with our \nmilitary, will ensure the freedoms we all enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2720-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REVEREND DR.

Mr. President, the congregation of Christ Church \nand the Village of Garden City experienced a great loss when the \nReverend Dr. Byron Howell Brown, Jr. passed away on Saturday, April 13. \nFather Brown, as he was affectionately known by all those who knew him, \nwas a life-long resident of Garden City and was instituted as Rector of \nChrist Church in 1967. Throughout his tenure as Rector, Father Brown \nwas the spiritual leader of several generations of parishioners, but it \nwould be impossible to quantify how many lives he touched. Father Brown \ntruly practiced the lessons that he preached. He was a faithful and \ncommitted rector, husband, father, grandfather, coach, counselor, \nmentor, and friend. He will be deeply missed by all those who were \nfortunate enough to know him, learn from him, and hear his message of \nGod's abiding love. Through his devotion and kindness to his \ncongregation, his family, and all those he served, he set a standard to \nwhich we should all aspire.\n  Father Brown will be laid to rest tomorrow, with a mass of Christian \nburial at the Cathedral of the Incarnation. But Father Brown's spirit \nand kindness will live on through his beloved wife Marylou, his \nchildren Jeanne, Thomas, Timothy and Janice, his daughters in law Lisa, \nand Mary Patricia, and especially through his grandchildren Aidan \nByron, Sarah Margaret, Frances Anne, and Matthew George.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2720-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2720-S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

These sales were sold under the \nsalvage rider, enacted in 1996 by the 104th Congress. During my floor \nspeech, I reiterated my opposition to the salvage rider, but also \ninadvertently referred to salvage sales instead of confining my remarks \nto salvage rider sales.\n  I have been, and will continue to be, a supporter of salvage sales \ninvolving the commercial recovery of dead or dying timber, when such \nsales make sense for the health of the forest. In fact, I worked very \nhard to make sure that a salvage sale project went forward in the wake \nof the 1996 Summit and Tower fires, and I continue to support \nconstructive salvage work being done to improve forest health \nthroughout the National Forests.\n  As I continue to work toward comprehensive forestry legislation which \nwill include both active forest management and old growth protection, I \nthought it important to correct the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2721-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNITION OF JOYCE MAISH\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I take this moment to recognize \nJoyce Maish, a high school business teacher in Augusta, KS. Joyce was \none of twelve teachers across the United States who was named Teacher \nof the Year by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship.\n  Joyce has been a teacher at Augusta High School for twenty-five \nyears. At the high school, Joyce conducts a ``Youth Entrepreneurs for \nKansas'' class, in which she attempts to focus the ideas and dreams of \nher students on the possibility that they could someday start their own \nbusinesses. Moreover, she has done an outstanding job of bringing in \nlocal business owners and officials from Augusta and Wichita to speak \nto her students to teach them about the realities of business \nenterprise.\n  Joyce Maish is a role model teacher for Kansas and for the Nation. I \nam very pleased that the National Foundation for Teaching \nEntrepreneurship has honored Joyce for her years of excellence. I wish \nJoyce continued success in all of her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2721-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD LUCK TO HIGHLANDS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate the \nyoung men and women of Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, KY for \nbeing chosen to represent the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the national \nfinals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution \nprogram. The competition will take place May 4-6 here in Washington and \nwill include more than 1,200 students from across the United States.\n  The three-day national competition is appropriately modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. The hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on \nvarious constitutional topics. Questions ranging from factual concerns \nof how the framers created the Constitution to more analytical \nquestions such as how a member of Congress should represent his or her \nconstituency will be directed at the students to determine their depth \nof understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  The We the People . . . program, directed by the Center for Civic \nEducation and funded by the U.S. Department of Education, has provided \ncurricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school \nlevels for more than 2.5 million students nationwide. By providing \nstudents with a working knowledge of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, \nand principles of democratic government, We the People . . . gives our \nnext generation of leaders an opportunity to study in depth the \ndocuments and ideals that have bound this nation together for so many \nyears. I thank the U.S. Department of Education for continuing to \nprovide fiscal support to this great program and the Center of Civic \nEducation for their ongoing commitment to the education of our Nation's \nfuture. It is truly inspiring to see that so many young people are \ninterested in furthering the democratic ideals brought forth by our \nforefathers so many years ago.\n  The class from Highlands High School, led by teacher Brian Robinson, \nhas proven without a doubt that they are dedicated to representing \nKentucky in the most admirable fashion possible in this year's \ncompetition. They are currently conducting thorough research and \npreparing for their upcoming participation in the national finals. I \nwould like to wish all of these students the best of luck at the We the \nPeople . . . national finals. It is comforting to know what one of \nthese students may one day be standing in my place, representing the \ngreat people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2721-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2721-5", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2721-6", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2721-S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-6483.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2132. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of medical emergency preparedness centers in the \nVeterans\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nHealth Administration, to provide for the enhancement of the medical \nresearch activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce \nlegislation that would establish four medical emergency preparedness \nresearch centers within the Department of Veterans Affairs. These \ncenters would make the most of VA's expertise in basic and clinical \nresearch to shape new strategies for coping with, or preventing, the \nmedical crisis that could result from a terrorist attack against the \nAmerican people.\n  The threats posed by biological, chemical, radiological, and \nincendiary weapons demand that we prepare immediately, using our \nexisting national resources as efficiently as possible. Although many \nof my colleagues know that VA operates the Nation's largest integrated \nhealthcare system, fewer may know that VA manages the largest health \nprofessionals training program in the United States. VA's clinical \nresearch programs investigate both cutting-edge technology and best \nmedical practices, and included over 15,000 projects last year.\n  Through its reach, its educational programs, and its research \ncapacity, VA stands ready to make a significant contribution to \nprotecting veterans and the public from the medical consequences of a \nterrorist attack. Only a few weeks ago, VA researchers announced that \nthey have developed the most promising drug yet to protect the public \nshould a terrorist deliberately release smallpox virus. I remain \nconfident that this is only the first of many such scientific \nbreakthroughs by VA scientists.\n  VA already plays a key role in supporting Federal disaster \npreparedness, including maintaining pharmaceutical stockpiles, jointly \nadministering the National Disaster Medical System, serving as primary \nmedical back-up to the Department of Defense, and sharing medical \npersonnel and supplies with communities whose own resources are \noverwhelmed. The legislation that I propose today would add another \ndimension to VA's role in emergency preparedness by acknowledging its \nexpertise in developing clinical approaches to public health.\n  The centers authorized by this legislation would foster research by \nVA scientists and clinicians in the diagnosis, prevention, and \ntreatment of illnesses or injuries that might arise from the use of \nterrorist weapons. These centers would encourage cooperation between VA \nresearchers and professionals at affiliated schools of medicine and \npublic health to bring new findings and ideas as quickly as possible to \nthe Nation's caregivers. The legislation that I have proposed would \npromote fruitful collaboration between VA, academic, and other Federal \nresearchers, so that we can integrate research, public health, and \ndomestic security efforts expeditiously.\n  The legislation I introduce today also makes two changes in law which \naffect VA's non-profit research corporations. These two changes are \ntechnical in nature and are designed to clarify existing provisions of \nlaw: one clarifies that research corporation employees are covered \nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act, FTCA, and the other provision \nclarifies that VA Medical Centers may enter into contracts or other \nforms of agreements with nonprofit research corporations to provide \nservices to facilitate VA research and education.\n  On the issue of FTCA coverage, a recent Department of Justice opinion \ndetermined that physicians employed by the VA-affiliated nonprofit \nresearch did not enjoy FTCA coverage, despite the fact that they have \nVA appointments. Prior to this opinion, the understanding was that the \ncorporations' employees were covered, subject to a certification that \ntheir activities were within the scope of government work. Since \nresearch corporations were authorized in 1988, not a single suite has \nbeen filed against a corporation employee. Nevertheless, it is critical \nthat employees working on VA approved research and education be \nprotected. It is estimated that nationwide, the corporations have \n1,500-2,000 research employees.\n  These non-profit research corporations have been placed in a \ndifficult spot. Corporations must decide whether to take their chances \nthat the FTCA will cover a suit despite the Department of Justice \nprovision, as the VA General Counsel believes; to reduce their \nactivities by only hiring employees with access to private sector \ninsurance; to use funds normally devoted to supporting research to buy \nan expensive blanket insurance policy; or to close down entirely. The \nbetter choice, is to be explicit in providing FTCA coverage to \ncorporation employees engaged in activities that further VA's research \nand education missions.\n  The second change relates to contracts between VA Medical Centers and \nresearch corporations. Many times, VA Medical Centers need help to \nprovide services which are ancillary to research, such as travel \ncoordination, technical services, and conference management.\n  I believe that a precedent for such contracts already exists. VA \nMedical Centers can enter into agreements with closely affiliated \nuniversities. For more than 50 years, the VAMCs and universities have \ncontracted with each other for goods and services. In my view, we need \nto bring this kind of thinking to the non-profit research corporations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on Dichlorobenzidine \nDihydrochloride; to the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Voinovich, to introduce legislation that would \ntemporarily suspend the import duty on Dichlorobenzidine, DCB.\n  DCB is a chemical used to produce organic pigments for printing ink. \nIt is reacted with other materials to form various yellow organic \npigments. These yellow pigments are used extensively by the printing \nink industry because yellow is one of the three primary colors used in \nprinting and is used in nearly all color printing applications. DCB \nalso is used to produce certain red and orange pigments.\n  The U.S. printing ink industry is facing increasingly aggressive \ncompetition from low-cost foreign producers. Despite its widespread \nuse, DCB is no longer produced in the United States and is unlikely to \nbe produced here in the foreseeable future. Domestic manufacturers of \nsynthetic organic pigments must import all of the DCB required for \ntheir production of yellow pigment. These imports are currently subject \nto high duties despite the fact that there is no longer a domestic DCB \nindustry to protect.\n  Our duty suspension bill would help U.S. producers remain competitive \nin the global market, and it would remove unnecessary costs on U.S. \npigment, ink, and printing industries and on millions of consumers of \nprinted products.\n  Though our bill is quite simple, its effects would be widespread. It \nwould suspend the duty on DCB, therefore eliminating a significant and \nunnecessary cost for U.S. pigment producers. That action, by itself, \nwould have a significant positive impact on our domestic industry\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this legislative \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Nickles, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Warner, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2134. A bill to allow American victims of state sponsored \nterrorism to received compensation from blocked as-sets of those \nstates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined by \nmy Republican colleague, Senator George Allen of Virginia, in \nintroducing the Terrorism Victim's Access to Compensation Act of 2002. \nSenators Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Schumer, Nickles,\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nClinton, Warner, Mikulski, Burns, and Craig are also original co-\nsponsors of this much-needed, bipartisan legislation.\n  The war against terrorism must be fought and won on multiple fronts. \nAnd we cannot forget that terrorist acts are ultimately stories of \nhuman tragedy. The dedicated, professional woman from Iowa, Kathryn \nKoob, seeking to build cross-cultural ties between the Iranian people \nand the American people only to be held captive for 444 days in the \nU.S. Embassy in Tehran. The teenage boy from Iowa, Taleb Subh, visiting \nfamily in Kuwait, terrorized by Saddam Hussein at the outbreak of the \nPersian Gulf War. The U.S. aid worker from Virginia, Charles Hegna, \ntortured and killed in 1984 by Iranian-backed hijackers in order ``to \npunish'' the United States. These are only a few of the people we know; \nAmericans in all 50 States have suffered. What do we say to these \nfamilies, the wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters?\n  We believe that those who sponsor as well as those who commit these \ninhumane acts must pay a price. In 1996, the Congress passed a \nsignificant law without partisan divide, and with the support of the \nU.S. State Department. This law allows Americans to pursue justice in \nU.S. Federal courts. The idea behind this law is to make the terrorists \nand their sponsors pay an immediate price for attacks against Americans \nabroad. For example, the money of foreign sponsors of terrorism and \ntheir agents that we hold here in the United States could be used to \ncompensate innocent Americans who are victimized by their attacks for \ntheir pain, suffering and losses. Make the bad guys pay.\n  This law only applies to ``terrorist states'', currently a list of \nseven foreign governments officially designated as state sponsors of \nterrorism (i.e. Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea, and \nCuba). It is those state sponsors of international terrorism, not the \nAmerican taxpayer, who must be compelled to pay these costs first and \nforemost.\n  Currently, the U.S. Treasury Department lawfully controls at least \n$3.7 billion in blocked or frozen assets of these seven state sponsors \nof terrorism. But officials of the U.S. Treasury and State Departments \noppose using these funds to compensate American victims of terrorism \nwho have brought lawsuits in Federal courts, won their cases on the \nmerits, and secured court-ordered judgments and compensation awards \nagainst the rogue governments that are responsible for the attacks upon \nthem and their families. To summarize, these American victims have been \nencouraged to pursue justice in U.S. Federal courts, have complied with \nexisting U.S. law, but have been denied what little justice they were \nencouraged to pursue. Unelected bureaucrats, instead, want American \ntaxpayers apparently to foot the bill for what could amount to hundreds \nof millions of dollars. In fact, in the pending case involving the 53 \nAmericans taken hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979 and held in \ncaptivity for 444 days and their families, U.S. Justice and State \nDepartment attorneys have gone into Federal court in recent months to \nhave their lawsuit dismissed in its entirety, thus de facto siding with \nthe Government of Iran.\n  This policy is wrong-headed and counterproductive for at least three \nreasons.\n  First, paying American victims of terrorism from the blocked and \nfrozen assets of these rogue governments and their agents will really \npunish and impose a heavy cost on those aiding and abetting the \nterrorists; this tougher policy will provide a new, powerful \ndisincentive for any foreign government to continue sponsoring \nterrorist attacks on Americans, while also discouraging any regimes \ntempted to get into the ugly business of sponsoring future terrorist \nattacks.\n  Second, making the state sponsors actually lose billions of dollars \nwill more effectively deter future acts of terrorism than keeping their \nassets blocked or frozen in perpetuity in pursuit of the delusion that \nlong-standing, undemocratic, brutish governments like those in Iran and \nIraq can be moderated.\n  Third, the American wives, husbands, sons, and daughters will have a \nsense of justice, they will have the public condemnation by the U.S. \nGovernment and statement of guilt, but they will have also made those \nterrorists responsible for the attacks and their sponsors pay a price.\n  In his last days in office, former President Clinton signed a law \nendorsing a policy of paying American victims of terrorism from blocked \nassets, while simultaneously signing a waiver of the means to make this \npolicy work. But the Bush administration hasn't registered an opinion \nyet on this crucial test of our nation's resolve to fight state-\nsponsored terrorism. That is why we are pushing bipartisan legislation \nto establish two new policy cornerstones in our Nation's war against \nterrorism. First, we seek to require that compensation be paid from the \nblocked and frozen assets of the state sponsors of terrorism in cases \nwhere American victims of terrorism secure a final judgment in our \nFederal courts and are awarded compensation accordingly. Second, we \nwill provide a level playing field for all American victims of state-\nsponsored terrorism who are pursuing redress by providing equal access \nto our federal courts.\n  American victims of state-sponsored terrorism deserve and want to be \ncompensated for their losses from those who perpetrated the attacks \nupon them. The Congress should clear the way for them to get some \nsatisfaction of court-ordered judgments and, in so doing, deter future \nacts of state-sponsored terrorism against innocent Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorism Victim's Access to \n     Compensation Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) The war against international terrorism must be fought \n     and won on multiple fronts.\n       (2) The state sponsors of international terrorism \n     (including their agencies and instrumentalities) are \n     ultimately responsible for the damages, pain, and suffering \n     inflicted upon Americans who are victimized by terrorist \n     acts. It is the state sponsors, not the American taxpayer, \n     who must be compelled to pay those costs.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Treasury lawfully controls \n     billions of dollars in blocked assets of several governments \n     which the President and the Department of State have \n     determined to be state sponsors of international terrorism \n     and responsible for multiple terrorist attacks on United \n     States citizens abroad.\n       (4) There have been multiple Federal lawsuits brought since \n     1996 by American victims of state sponsored terrorism abroad \n     and final judgments and financial awards in some of those \n     cases have been paid appropriately by using some of the \n     blocked assets of state sponsors of terrorism. Additional \n     cases are still pending.\n       (5) Paying victims of state sponsored terrorism from the \n     blocked assets of state sponsors of acts of terrorism \n     (including their agencies and instrumentalities) will punish \n     those entities, deter future acts of terrorism, and provide a \n     powerful incentive for any foreign government to stop \n     sponsoring terrorist attacks on Americans.\n       (6) There must be a level playing field for all American \n     victims of state sponsored terrorism who are pursuing redress \n     in the Federal courts and compensation from the blocked \n     assets of state sponsors of terrorism (including their \n     agencies and instrumentalities).\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       Considering the policy set forth in this Act, the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, and in \n     the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of \n     2000, it is the sense of Congress that it should be the \n     policy of the United States--\n       (1) to use the blocked assets of state sponsors of acts of \n     terrorism (including their agencies and instrumentalities) \n     that are under the control of the Secretary of the Treasury \n     to pay court-ordered judgments and awards made to United \n     States nationals harmed by such acts; and\n       (2) to provide equal access to all United States victims of \n     state sponsored terrorism who have secured judgments and \n     awards in Federal courts against state sponsors of terrorism \n     (including their agencies and instrumentalities) and that \n     those judgments and awards be paid by state sponsors of \n     terrorism (including their agencies and instrumentalities) \n     from any of their blocked assets controlled by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury.\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title X of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a 5-year extension of the authorization for appropriations \nfor certain Medicare rural grants; to the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nHospital Access and Improvement Act of 2002. I am pleased to be joined \nby Senators Grassley, Daschle, Thomas, Conrad, Jeffords, Rockefeller, \nBingaman, Harkin, Johnson, and Roberts in sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Simply put, this bill is about keeping small hospitals open in rural \nareas. It's about preserving access to quality health care for farmers \nand ranchers and their families. It's about protecting the health of \nfolks who live in small towns and hamlets across our Nation.\n  I think these are goals that every one of us can agree on.\n  But the fight to preserve access to health care in rural America has \nnever been an easy one. Hospitals in rural areas constantly struggle \nwith the difficulties of operating in a low-volume environment. Their \nemergency rooms might see two or three patients a day. Or some days, \nnone at all. They lack the economies of scale that urban and suburban \nfacilities enjoy. They have a hard time hiring health professionals. \nAnd with every passing year, they face a growing regulatory burden that \ntakes time and energy away from patients.\n  In the face of all these obstacles, many small, rural communities \nhave confronted the unthinkable: losing their hospital altogether. I \nhave no doubt that I speak for the vast majority of Senators when I say \nwe should never let this happen. We should never allow a community to \ngo without the health care services it needs to stay healthy. To borrow \nfrom the flight director of Apollo 13, I suggest that failure is not an \noption.\n  This was the message that Congress sent fives years ago, when it took \ntwo giant strides towards helping rural communities keep their \nhospitals. First, it passed legislation allowing small hospitals in \nrural and frontier areas to become Critical Access Hospitals, or CAHs. \nCAHs are reimbursed by Medicare based on their actual costs, not fixed \nor limited payments. They can organize their staff and facilities based \non their patients' needs, not on rules made for large, urban \nfacilities. In short, they are given flexibility to adapt to the unique \nchallenges of providing health care in rural areas.\n  This concept was a perfect fit for rural America. In the past five \nyears, over 500 facilities have converted to CAH status. By taking \nadvantage of the CAH option, these hospitals have remained open and \ncontinue to serve patients. This success is not surprising. After all, \nthe Critical Access Hospital concept was modeled on a demonstration \nproject that had already been working for years in hospitals across \nMontana.\n  The second step Congress took in 1997 was to authorize $25 million a \nyear for the Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant Program, or, as I like to \ncall it, the Flex grant. This program awards grants to States to help \nhospitals convert to CAH status. Already, over 1,000 health care \nfacilities have been assisted by these funds. In my State nearly half \nof our hospitals, about two dozen facilities, have converted to CAH \nstatus. About a dozen more are on the way.\n\n  Now the Senate has an opportunity to renew its commitment to rural \nhealth care. The legislation I have introduced today would reauthorize \nthe Flex grant at a level of $40 million a year. This would continue \nthe work that we have already begun, by helping hundreds more rural \nhospitals covert to CAH status.\n  In the latest count, nearly 600 hospitals across the Nation were \neligible to become CAHs, but have not yet converted. By increasing the \nsize of the Flex grant program, Congress can reach out to these \nfacilities. At the same time, Congress will continue its support for \nexisting CAHs by providing technical assistance and helping them access \ncapital for their physical plants. These funds will also advance the \nimportant process of coordinating between emergency medical services \nproviders and other health care providers in rural areas. In the wake \nof September 11 and the bioterrorist attacks of last fall, this work \nmust move forward without delay.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their support of the Critical \nAccess Hospital program and the Flex grant over the past five years. \nThrough their efforts, over 500 rural communities have kept their \nhospitals up and running. Now, I hope they will continue this work by \nsupporting the Rural Hospital Access and Improvement Act of 2002 an \nreauthorizing the Flex grant at a level of $40 million a year.\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the Rural Hospital Access and Improvement Act of 2002, along \nwith Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, in \naddition to other distinguished colleagues with an interest in rural \nhealth care. This legislation reauthorizes the Medicare Rural Hospital \nFlexibility program, known as the ``flex'' program, which has become a \nkey component in stabilizing rural health care delivery networks.\n  The ``flex'' program was created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nto improve access to essential health care services through the \nestablishment of Critical Access Hospitals, (CAHs), rural health \nnetworks and rural emergency medical services. To date, flex grants \nhave provided assistance to 1,170 rural hospitals for technical \nassistance and education, 881 rural emergency medical services projects \nand 557 communities for needs assessment and community development \nactivities. As a result, almost 600 hospitals that were on the verge of \nclosing have been certified as Critical Access Hospitals. Over half of \nCAHs serve counties that are designated as a Health Professional \nShortage Area. It is quite obvious that this innovative program works \nand merits continued congressional support.\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\n  In my State of Wyoming, the South Big Horn County Hospital District \nhas been certified as a Critical Access Hospital and several more are \ninterested in converting to CAH status. Additionally, my State has used \nflex grant dollars to shore up rural emergency medical services in many \nof our frontier communities.\n  The bill I am introducing today with several of my colleagues will \ncontinue to build upon the early success of this program by increasing \nthe annual funding authorization from $25 million to $40 million. \nAdditional funding is necessary to expand quality improvement \ninitiatives within network development plans, enhance the development \nof rural emergency medical services and continue technical support to \nCritical Access Hospitals. I strongly urge all my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important rural health care legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2136.

A bill to facilitate the protection of minors using the \nInternet from\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nmaterial that is harmful to minors, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I want to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Family Privacy Protection Act. Let \nme just take a few minutes to explain this bill to my colleagues.\n  In this age of high-technology, we are blessed with many things that \nour ancestors did not have. Cell phones and e-mail allow us to \ncommunicate quickly. Advances in medical science are allowing our \ncitizens to live much longer and healthier lives. And advances in \ncomputers and other equipment help make workers and businesses many \ntimes more productive. However, technology is a double-edged sword. \nSometimes the bad comes with the good. This fact hit home in the most \ntragic way when it was learned that the September 11 hijackers had \ncommunicated through e-mail and cell phones.\n  As frightening as this is, it is not the only example of the problems \nassociated with advances in technology. There are day-to-day issues \nthat must be resolved. For instance, technology has exposed our \ncitizens to breaches of privacy that could never have taken place \nbefore the days of the Internet and other advances.\n  Former Chief Justice Earl Warren once said, ``The fantastic advances \nin the field of communication constitute a grave danger to the privacy \nof the individual.'' If Chief Justice Warren were alive today to offer \nhis remarks, he might substitute the word ``technology'' for \n``communication.'' Let me give one example of an incident which \nhighlights this fact.\n  In the early 1990's, a shocking thing happened to a family in Monroe, \nLouisiana. Monroe is a relatively small city, at least by the standards \nof most parts of the country, but it is the largest city in the \nnortheastern section of my state. I want to talk about a family who \nlives in Monroe, the Wilsons. Susan Wilson was just an average woman \nwith an average family.\n  Unfortunately, something terrible happened, which tore apart the \nquiet life of this family. A family friend, a former deacon at the \nWilson's church, did something despicable. While the Wilson's weren't \nhome, this man broke into their house and planted a video camera in \ntheir bathroom. The Wilson's eventually learned that, for almost 2 \nyears, video cameras had been filming everything in their bathroom. \nThis man filmed all of their private moments for the past years for his \nown sick and twisted purposes.\n  But even then, the family's nightmare wasn't over. You see, \nunder Louisiana state law, and the law of most States, there was no \ncrime under which this man could be charged for filming the family \nwithout their consent. Although he was eventually charged with \nunauthorized entry, there was no way to punish this man for the more \nserious crime he committed.\n\n  The State legislature remedied this in 1999, passing a law making \nvideo voyeurism a crime. This was thanks in large part to Susan Wilson, \nwho spoke with the media, testified before committees--in short, give \nup her privacy and put her life on public display, doing everything she \nhad to do to call attention to this problem. In short, she has \nsacrificed so that women such as herself will not have to experience \nthe pain of watching the individuals who devastated their lives walk \naway virtually untouched by the law.\n  And she continues to make this sacrifice to this day. There was even \na recent movie detailing Susan's story, some of my colleagues may have \nseen it. It aired February 6 on Lifetime, starring Angie Harmon. It was \na very compelling, though obviously disturbing, film, and if my \ncolleagues have not seen it I would urge them to do so.\n  Since the law was passed in Louisiana, several individuals have been \nprosecuted under it. Let me just give a couple of examples. Two years \nago, a New Orleans man was arrested under the law after a video camera \nwas found in his neighbor's air conditioning vent. In nearby Marrero \njust a couple of months before, a man was arrested for allegedly \npointing a video camera in someone's window. And just before that, a \nman was arrested under the video voyeurism law and charged with \nvideotaping a woman during intercourse and then trying to sell the \ntape. And, just over a month ago in Lafayette, LA, a man was charged \nfor undressing a sleeping woman and videotaping her in his apartment.\n  This law has also be used in conjunction with laws already on the \nbooks, to give police another tool with which to charge offenders. For \ninstance, last year in Slidell, LA, a man was charged with seven counts \nof video voyeurism in addition to various pornography-related charges. \nAnd in Leesville, LA, a year ago, three people, including a Sheriff's \ndeputy, were arrested and charged with video voyeurism and juvenile \npornography.\n  Louisiana is not the only State to pass this law, or to charge \noffenders with violating it. A principal in Arkansas was charged with \nthe crime, although the charges were later dropped. And in Milwaukee, a \nman was arrested late last year and charged with videotaping guests in \nhis house while they showered and undressed.\n  These are terrible crimes; they are a violation of privacy, and more. \nThey strike at the very heart of one of our most cherished personal \nfreedoms, the right to live our lives free of the fear of people \nwatching us perform the most regular of tasks, bathing, getting \ndressed, or sleeping.\n  In the past, someone who looked in another person's window at night \nwas called a ``Peeping Tom.'' We are not dealing with people looking in \nwindows anymore, we are dealing with technologies like video cameras \nsmall enough to fit in an air conditioning vent. In the past, that \nperson looking in the window could be caught by police and charged with \na crime. Unfortunately, for the person who plants the camera in the air \nconditioning duct, as things stand now, except for a few states that \nhave passed this type of legislation, that person can at best only be \ncharged with a crime like unlawful entry.\n\n  This brings me to the first provision of the legislation that I am \nintroducing today. I met with Susan last year, and promised her I would \nintroduce Federal legislation addressing this crime. Currently, only \nfive states have laws dealing with video voyeurism. This is one of the \nreasons I am here today to introduce my legislation, the Family Privacy \nProtection Act.\n  This measure contains several important provisions, but the first one \nI want to focus on today is the video voyeurism section. This bill will \nmake it a Federal crime to film someone in these circumstances without \ntheir consent. The bill provides exceptions for legitimate purposes \nsuch as police investigations and security; but the bottom line is that \nthis legislation would hold these individuals responsible for their \nactions.\n  Actress Judy Garland, speaking of her lack of privacy, once said, \n``I've never looked through a keyhole without finding someone was \nlooking back.'' How frightening it would be for all of our citizens to \nfeel this way; that they are not safe from prying eyes in their own \nhome.\n  The video voyeurism component, while important, is only one part of \nthis bill. This bill also contains a provision to protect children from \nInternet websites with pornographic material. A recent study showed \nthat 31 percent of children aged 10-17 who used the Internet have \naccidentally come across a pornographic website. That includes 75 \npercent ages 15-17.\n  One of the problems is that companies and individuals who have \nwebsites make money from ``hits'' by Internet users. It doesn't matter \nwhether someone intentionally visits a website or does so on accident, \nit still counts as a ``hit''. So some of these companies that set up \npornographic websites specifically choose names that will cause people \nto accidentally find them. Let me give a quick example. As I'm sure all \nof my colleagues know, the web address for the White House is \nwww.whitehouse.gov. But if you make a mistake--and it's not a difficult \nmistake, I know many people who have made it, and type a slightly \ndifferent address, www.whitehouse.com, you will access a different site \naltogether, a pornographic website. While I'm sure these companies are \nnot targeting children specifically, they inevitably come across these \ninappropriate sites.\n  I have already mentioned some statistics on how many children have \naccidentally visited inappropriate\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\nwebsites. I just want to share a few examples. An 11-year-old boy was \nsearching for game sites, typed in ``fun.com'', and a pornographic site \ncame up. A 15-year-old boy was looking for info on cars, did a search \nfor ``escort'', and an escort service site came up.\n  And, in one of the most disturbing examples that I came across, in \none instance a 15-year-old boy was doing a report on wolves, and found \na site on bestiality. I just want my colleagues to imagine for a moment \nthis happening to their son or daughter. I think we can all agree that \nthis is something that we need to be concerned about.\n\n  The American people are certainly concerned about it. In the same \nKaiser study, 84 percent of the American people worry about the \navailability of pornography online, and 61 percent say the government \nshould regulate it. Sixty-one percent. And I am certain that number is \nmuch higher among parents.\n  That is why I believe this legislation is so important. I understand \nthat these websites are protected by the First Amendment. This bill \ndoes not intrude upon these sites' right to free speech. Instead, it \nwould set up a whole new domain name for pornographic material. A \ndomain name, as my colleagues know, is the three letters at the end of \nthe web address. Dot-com, dot-gov, dot-org, dot-net--these are all \ndomain names. My legislation would instruct the Internet Corporation \nfor Assigned Names and Numbers to set up a new domain name for \npornographic websites. The owners of these sites would have 12 months \nto move their sites to the new domain.\n  This is a very simple yet effective method of protecting our children \nfrom these sites. A new domain would make ``filter'' programs, which \nscreen out these pornographic sites, much more effective. It would \neliminate mistakes like the whitehouse dot-gov, dot-com, problem that I \nmentioned earlier. And, I firmly believe this bill passes First \nAmendment tests for freedom of speech.\n  I understand that some people will not agree with me, saying that \nthis bill does not go far enough and that this type of material should \nbe banned altogether. But the First Amendment to the Constitution \nprotects even material of this kind, whether or not we may agree with \nit. My bill would not infringe on the right of free speech, but would \nsimply restrict where this type of speech could be presented on the \nInternet. As one of my constituents from Louisiana said, ``We need to \nput it where the people who want to see it can get to it, and the ones \nwho don't want to see it don't have to.'' That is all this provision \ndoes.\n  Finally, a similar provision in the bill provides protection for \nchildren from pornographic e-mails. This language is very similar to a \nbill that was introduced in the House of Representatives by \nCongresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California. I wanted to take a second to \nacknowledge Congresswoman Lofgren for her efforts, and I hope to work \nwith her on this initiative.\n  In short, the bill would require that e-mail advertisements be \nclearly labeled as containing sexually oriented material. We are all \nfamiliar with receive e-mails with subjects that say ``Lose weight \nnow'' or ``You have won!'' that in reality contain pornographic \nmaterial. Many of us simply delete these e-mails without look at them, \nknowing them to be deceptive or junk. However, it is easy to be fooled. \nI have received letters from several constituents who were offended, \nand rightly so, after opening falsely labeled e-mails.\n  As you can imagine, children are particularly vulnerable to this type \nof deceptive e-mail. In a study done for Congress by the Crimes Against \nChildren Research Center, 25 percent of children studied were exposed \nto unwanted sexual pictures in the previous year. Of these exposures, \n28 percent occurred by opening or clicking on an e-mail.\n\n  There is one case that upsets me in particular. A 12-year-old girl, a \nlittle girl who collects Beanie Babies, received an e-mail with a \nsubject line saying ``Free Beanie Babies.'' As you can imagine, this \nexcited little girl quickly opened the e-mail, only to be confronted \nwith pictures of naked people. Again, I'd like my colleagues to stop \nfor a moment and imagine that this was their child.\n  Let me just conclude with a few more facts. The Kaiser study also \nlooked at the consequence on these children from encountering these \npornographic websites and e-mails. Fifty-seven percent of those age 15-\n17 who were studied believed that exposure to online pornography could \nhave a serious impact on those under 18. And 76 percent of children \nsurveyed by Kaiser said that pornography that kids can see is a ``big \nproblem.''\n  I just want to add that I am hopeful that, in the future, we can take \neven stronger steps to address the problem of pornographic e-mails. \nHowever, at the moment, this bill will at least ensure that Internet \nusers, particularly children, know that an e-mail contains sexually \noriented material before opening it.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important \nlegislation. It is intended to protect our most vulnerable citizens, \nour children, while protecting the right of individuals to free speech. \nI believe this is something that we can all support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2730-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2730-S2731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 242--DESIGNATING AUGUST 16, 2002 AS ``NATIONAL \n                             AIRBORNE DAY''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a \nSenate resolution which designates August 16, 2002 as ``National \nAirborne Day.''\n  On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test \nPlatoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The \nParachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed \nthe first official army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success \nof the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne \ncontingent that has served from World War Two until the present.\n  I was privileged to serve with the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the \nfirst airborne divisions to be organized. In a two-year period during \nWorld War Two, the regiments of the 82nd served in Italy at Anzio, in \nFrance at Normandy (where I landed with them), and at the Battle of the \nBulge.\n  The 11th, 13th, 17th, and 101st Airborne Divisions and numerous other \nregimental and battalion size airborne units were also organized \nfollowing the success of the Parachute Test Platoon. In the last sixty-\ntwo years, these airborne forces have performed in important military \nand peace-keeping operations all over the world, and it is only \nappropriate that we designate a day to salute the contributions they \nhave made to this Nation.\n  Through passage of ``National Airborne Day,'' the Senate will \nreaffirm our support for the members of the airborne community and also \nshow our gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's \ndefense and ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2731-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2731-S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 243--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF APRIL 21 THROUGH APRIL \n              28, 2002, AS ``NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEK''\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Bond, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Craig, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Jeffords, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nHelms, Mr. Frist, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nCampbell, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nKerry, and Mr. Thurmond) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senators \nDodd, Murray, Hatch, Specter, Bond, Bingaman, Craig, Torricelli, Biden, \nJeffords, Corzine, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Kennedy, Helms, Frist, Breaux, \nEdwards, Crapo, Collins, Campbell, Sessions, Inhofe, Carnahan, Durbin, \nKerry, and Thurmond to submit a Senate Resolution declaring the Week of \nApril 21-April 27, 2002, as ``National Biotechnology Week.''\n  There have been incredible advancements in science over the last few \nyears that are allowing us to improve health care, increase crop \nyields, reduce the use of pesticides, and replace costly industrial \nprocesses involving harsh chemicals with cheaper, safer, biological \nprocesses. These advancements have occurred due to the hard work and \ndiligence of scientists and researchers in the United States, and all \naround the world, who have spent their lives promoting and perfecting \nthe practice of biotechnology.\n  In addition, biotechnology and the tools and devices developed for \nthis technology will be essential as our country continues to heighten \nits efforts to combat bioterrorism. One of the first challenges in \ncombating bioterrorism is detection. Quick analysis of pathogens using \ngene chips and advanced techniques derived from biotechnology will \nallow health providers to quickly identify the type and nature of any \nbiological attack. Also, there is a need to be able to respond to a \nbiological attack. The tools of biotechnology will allow us to develop \nthe vaccines and treatments needed for this purpose. Because of its \ngreat potential, biotechnology is a key component of promoting national \nsecurity.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, the potential for biotechnology as a \nmotor for driving economic growth is just taking hold. Innovative \nresearch at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and the \nUniversity of Arkansas Medical School is paving the way for many small \nstart-up companies at the state's incubation centers. In addition, \nresearch at Arkansas Children's Hospital and new genomics research at \nthe National Center for Toxicological Research is leading to greater \nunderstanding of the impact that diets have on health. Also, there is \ngreat economic potential for a biotechnology corridor between Little \nRock and the Pine Bluff Arsenal where the research community would be \nwelcome to grow and thrive in our State.\n  With all of these benefits, there is no doubt that biotechnology is \ntouching our lives and improving our world. But, along with this \ntechnology comes the responsibility to understand and carefully \nevaluate it. It is essential that this technology be used to improve \nour world and preserve our humanity. If there is to be a future for \nthis technology, and we are to fully realize its benefits and \npotential, elected officials and the public must be informed and \nengaged about the basics of technology itself and its incredible \nbenefits.\n  This is why my colleagues and I are pleased to introduce this \nresolution declaring April 21-27, 2002, as ``National Biotechnology \nWeek.'' It is our hope\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nthat public officials, community leaders, researchers, professors, and \nschool teachers across the country will take this week to actively \npromote understanding of biotechnology in their communities and their \nclassrooms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/16/senate-section/article/S2732-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3132.
