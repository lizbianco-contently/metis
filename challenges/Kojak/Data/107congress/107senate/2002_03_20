The Senate will vote on \ncloture at 1 p.m. We have received word there may be an effort to move \nthe vote up a little bit because of a meeting at the White House. We \nwill be happy to take that under consideration. If cloture is invoked, \nthere will be an additional 3 hours of debate prior to final passage of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  We have already had a number of requests for people to speak between \n12 and 1 p.m. We would like to reserve that time for the two leaders \nand those who have been so active in supporting this bill: Senators \nFeingold and McCain, and Senators McConnell and Gramm in opposition \nthereto. People desiring to speak on this legislation should get over \nhere and do that now because the time between 12 and when we vote on \nthis will be jammed with Members most directly involved on the bill.\n  We will move this vote up if the minority wants us to do that, and we \nask Members to move as quickly as possible.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have ended up with a little more \ntime on this debate than we earlier thought. As the principal opponent \nof the bill, I want to lock in a time for my final statement on the \nbill. Should cloture be invoked and we are in the 3-hour postcloture \nperiod, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to give my final statement \nat 2 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize to Senator Reid. I came in as he \nwas wrapping up his remarks.\n  With regard to the time on the vote at 1 p.m., there has been some \nindication maybe we could start that vote 10 minutes earlier. What is \nanticipated?\n  Mr. REID. I indicated there has been some talk of that. I will \ndiscuss that with the majority leader. It probably would work to \neveryone's advantage to move that up. We will do that as soon as \npossible.\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Kentucky, just so \nwe could have some idea because other people wish to speak, do you have \nan idea how long you wish to speak at 2 p.m.? You can have as much time \nas you want.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I control the time on this side, unless the \nleader wants to control the time. I could use up to an hour during that \nperiod, beginning at 2 p.m.\n  I have one other request on this side for an extensive amount of \ntime, and that is Senator Gramm of Texas, who was going to speak from \n12 to 1, but I gather others are requesting that same period.\n  Mr. REID. In response to my friend from Kentucky, what we are going \nto try to do, even though it is not part of the consent, is work back \nand forth on the time. Senator Gramm certainly deserves extended time \non this most important issue. I was thinking we would do it by process \nof elimination: majority leader, the minority leader wishes\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nto speak, you wish to speak during that period, Senators McCain and \nFeingold don't wish to speak. Then we will get back to you right away \nand maybe you want to speak later or both times.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since I will be controlling an hour and a half of the \nprecloture time, I will try to work that out in such a way to \naccommodate Senator Gramm. Senator Hutchison of Texas is here to use \nsome of our time. We will be happy to begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2096-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I yield to the distinguished Senator from Texas such \ntime as she may desire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nleading the effort to point out some of the flaws in this campaign \nfinance reform bill. This has been a long process. Everyone knows how \nhard it is to get a bill into final form. Frankly, we are being asked \nto vote cloture on a bill that we have not debated since it came from \nthe House. There are some flaws in this bill. I don't think it is \nunreasonable to request the ability to have some amendments to try to \ncorrect the flaws.\n  Most people would like to see campaign finance reform. There are \nflaws in the current system. However, this bill does not fix all of \nthem. It does some harm, in place of good. To have no amendment capable \nof changing it is a very bad process that will result in a bad bill.\n  Last year I proposed several reforms that were in a bill I \nintroduced. I am glad to see included in the current legislation a \nprovision that limits the amount of loans a candidate can repay, loans \nmade to his or her own race. But there are several provisions I \nintroduced that are not included in the bill.\n  First, I believe an inordinate amount of campaign contributions can \ncome from outside a person's home State or district. You can say: Make \nthat an issue. Just tell everyone the majority of a person's \ncontributions are coming from outside the State.\n  But what we are doing in this bill is exacerbating the problem. In \nthe bill I introduced last year, I said that 60 percent of campaign \ncontributions should come from a Member or candidate's home State or \ndistrict, because I do not think a group from outside the State should \nbe able to drown out the people of the State or district. The bill that \nis before us today is going to allow outside groups, whose contributors \nwe do not know, to have unregulated access to the system and limit the \ncapability of parties whose contributors are made public. We are going \nto have situations, especially in a small State, where the people of \nthat State can be totally drowned out by interest groups in Washington, \nDC.\n  I think we are creating a monster by not putting in a limitation on \nhow much you can raise outside the State. I think that could severely \nhamper the people of the State, especially a small State, from having \ntheir views, expressed through their contributions, able to be heard \nand not be drowned out by outside groups from another State or \ndistrict. So that was not good in the bill, and I think the provisions \nthat are in the bill make it worse.\n  One of the provisions that is in the bill that I am very worried \nabout allows unregulated special interest groups to raise and spend \nunlimited amounts of soft money without any real reporting \nrequirements. I really do not know who the contributors are to a \nprivate group that decides to become politically active, which they \nhave the right to do. It is their freedom of speech. Anyone can buy \ntime for a television ad or newspaper ad or send out a flier. You do \nnot have to know who the contributors are. But we have elevated the \nstatus of groups such as that by curtailing the ability of our \npolitical parties, which have played a vital role in getting out the \nvote and informing people about the nominees of that political party. \nWe are limiting the amount of soft money that can go to the political \nparties while outside groups are not limited at all. I think that is a \nblow to the political system, and I think it is really against what the \nbill's backers would want.\n  In addition, I think the bill tramples the principle of freedom of \nspeech by restricting broadcast advertising for 60 days before an \nelection. This is the part of the bill that I think is \nunconstitutional. How many times have we heard that a large portion of \nthe voting public really doesn't focus on the campaign until 2 weeks \nbefore the election? A poll taken 2 weeks before an election is not \nreally valid, and any candidate will tell you that, because so much can \nhappen in that last 2 weeks. That is when the majority of the public \nbegins to collect the data they have been getting in the mail to start \nstudying it. They start to listen to what is being said on television, \nwhich is where most people get their news. Now people are just \nbeginning to tune in, the heat is on, and we are restricting the \ncapability for that broadcast message.\n  I think this is an area of free speech with which we cannot afford to \ntamper, to lessen the capability to be heard in this medium. I think \nthis is what will be thrown out in the end.\n\n  I have to say I do not like the idea of voting cloture on a bill that \nhas just come back from the House, has been amended in the House, and \nto say the Senate really should not have the ability to amend the bill \nbecause if we do that, somehow it will delay it further and we may not \never get it to the President. That goes against everything we stand for \nin a representative democracy where we have two bodies. Specifically, \nwe have two bodies so you can make sure you cover all the bases because \nwhen one body passes a bill, the other one may see something that is \ndifferent or they may find a mistake. We have seen that happen many \ntimes. To say: do not tamper with this bill that the House just passed, \npass it intact, is an incredible statement, especially when the \nsponsors of a bill say they are trying to open the political system.\n  We are closing the Senate in an effort to open the political system? \nSomehow that does not pass the logic test.\n  I am going to vote against cloture. I think it is premature. If the \nbill is closed to debate, if cloture is invoked, I will certainly vote \nagainst a bill that I think has tremendous flaws in its treatment of \nfundamental rights in our country.\n  I would like to see some reforms in our system. I introduced a bill \nthat I thought had legitimate reforms. The few parts of my legislation \nthat are included I appreciate. I think there are good parts of this \nbill. But I cannot in good conscience vote for a bill that I think will \nhamper free speech and will tilt the balance of power away from \naccountable political parties in favor of unaccountable interest groups \nfrom Washington, DC, whose supporters I do not even know, I have no \nidea who they are, and I will not be able to get that information in \nany reasonable manner under the bill that is being tested today on the \nSenate floor if we invoke cloture and the bill is passed without any \namendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Texas leaves the floor, I \nwould like to commend her for an outstanding statement. I listened \ncarefully to all her words. I just would point out what a wise \nobservation she made about the 60-day blackout period. This bill seeks \nto make people go register with the Federal Government and raise hard \ndollars in order to have the right to say anything about any of us \nwithin 60 days of an election--unless you own a newspaper. If you own a \nnewspaper, you are exempt from everything.\n  This bill, I say to my friend from Texas, sort of singles out various \ngroups for preferential treatment. If you are a big corporation that \nowns a newspaper, you have no restraints. If you are a big corporation \nthat doesn't own a newspaper, you have a bunch of restraints. So the \neffort here is to give some people more first amendment rights than \nothers. That is among the things, in my judgment, that make this bill \nconstitutionally flawed.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Texas for her comments and \nobservations.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I think that is \nthe part that is going to go first under the constitutional challenge. \nWe have been, for over 200 years in this country, protective of every \nmedia outlet, trying to assure that there is no outlet that will be \nclosed--other than the person who yells ``Fire!'' in a crowded theater, \nwho could do harm. But other than that, to pick one medium and say you \nare going to have severe restrictions and redtape and bureaucracy \nbefore anything can be heard on your medium, but the other medium would \nhave no restrictions whatsoever, is beyond comprehension when you read \nthe Bill of Rights. It is beyond comprehension.\n\n  I can't imagine that our Founding Fathers would have envisioned we \nwould even attempt something such as this. At least they had the \nforesight to put speech as our most important right and gave the \nSupreme Court the capability to check the Congress when they would \nviolate such an important right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is as if the supporters of this bill and the owners \nof the newspapers who are so enthusiastically behind this bill think \nthat newspapers have greater first amendment rights than any of the \nrest of us. The court decisions over the years have made it very clear \nthat, while we do have freedom of the press--I support that, and the \nSenator from Texas supports that--everyone else has a right to speak at \nany time without undue interference.\n  The Senator from Texas has pointed out one of the obvious flaws. \nThere are others, all of which will now unfortunately have to go \nthrough the courts to be sorted out.\n  I thank her for her statement. I thought it was an important \ncontribution to our closing debate today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for continuing to \nlook at these bills in great detail. We have tried to offer amendments \nthat might clear these constitutional challenges. I know the Senator \nfrom Kentucky has tried to do that without success. That is why we are \nhere today. But our Founding Fathers, who probably never envisioned \ntelevision, had the foresight to know that freedom of speech was \ninviolate under our Constitution. They gave us the clear language of \nthe Bill of Rights, and they gave us a third branch of government--the \nSupreme Court--to protect us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, the time will be equally divided on both \nsides.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry: Does that happen \nautomatically? If there are no speakers, the time runs equally on both \nsides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nI ask that the time be equally divided under the quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I wish to speak today about the campaign finance reform bill. This is \na step in the right direction, for sure.\n  When this bill came to the floor in 1995, I was an original cosponsor \nwith Senator Thompson. First of all, there are a couple of ways in \nwhich it is weaker than before. One of the ways has to do with raising \nthe individual spending limits to $2,000.\n  It is interesting that during the last election 4 citizens out of \nevery 10,000 Americans made contributions greater than $200. Only \n232,000 Americans gave contributions of $1,000 or more. That was one-\nninth of 1 percent of the voting-age population. By bumping the \nspending limits up, I think we just simply further maximize the \nleverage and the influence, and, frankly, the power of the wealthiest \ncitizens in the country. I regret that. I oppose it. But it is part of \nthe bill.\n  There was an amendment I had in the bill which would have changed a \nword or two in the Federal Election Commission Code that would have \nallowed States to voluntarily move toward a public system, a system of \npublic financing, or partial public financing--a kind of clean money/\nclean election effort. I think we received 36 votes for that amendment. \nI would like to have seen the sponsors of the legislation support it \nbecause I think we could have passed it. I think it would have \nstrengthened the bill.\n  Frankly, I think you would have a lot of energy back in the States--\nin the States of Minnesota and Nebraska--where people could say: \nListen, if we in our State want to have some kind of public or partial-\npublic financing, it would have to be an agreed upon spending limit \napplied to Federal races, let us do it.\n  I think it would have been wonderful to see the energy back at the \nState level and see people have more of a chance to organize. I dearly \nwould have liked to have seen that amendment agreed to.\n  However, I think we need to have some victories. I think that passing \nthis legislation--I thank both Senators McCain and Feingold for their \neffort--will whet people's appetite for more. I think we need victories \nin the reform area. That is why I support this legislation far more \nthan any other reason. I don't like to increase spending limits. I \nwould like to have seen limits on public financing if States wanted to \nmove forward with that. I certainly will be introducing that bill \nseparately. I certainly will have another vote on that. I think we can \nget to 50 votes. Ultimately, I would like to see a system of clean \nmoney/clean elections. But I believe overall, even with some \nmisgivings, that their piece of legislation represents a huge step \nforward.\n  Let me point out again by way of analysis that the problem is 80 \npercent of the money is hard money. No one should have any illusion \nthat if we pass this legislation we are getting big money out of \npolitics. This legislation is the first step. It is not the last step. \nIt is important that we have a victory. It is important that people in \nthe country can say now we can do more. I hope that will be the \ndirection in which we go.\n  I want to, however, talk to what I think is the strength of this \nbill, which has to do with the prohibition on soft money, getting \nunaccounted for money contributions--$200,000, $300,000, $400,000, \n$500,000 or whatever--out of politics. Of course, what the political \nparties said, at least initially what some people said is we can't give \nup all of that soft money; it will weaken political parties. I don't \nthink so. I think it would be wonderful to see both political parties \nhave to get back to more rational politics. I think it would be \nwonderful to see both political parties have to rely on smaller \ncontributions. I think it would be wonderful to see both\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\npolitical parties having to be more connected to the ordinary citizens, \nwhich I mean in a positive way, not in a pejorative sense.\n  The most controversial provision of this legislation was an amendment \nI submitted on the floor of the Senate. I would like to speak about \nthis amendment. This was one of the toughest fights I have had in the \nSenate.\n  When you see an editorial in the New York Times in which you are \ncharacterized as not being a reformer, and having offered an antireform \namendment, it is hard to take because, for me, ever since I have been \nin the Senate, after the 1990 election, reform has been at the top of \nmy agenda.\n  I do not know how many amendments I have brought to the floor dealing \nwith this whole question of how you get money out of politics. I do not \nknow how many battles I have fought. I cannot recount them all. As I \nsaid, I was pleased to be one of original two cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  But when this bill came to the floor of the Senate, my concern was \nthat we would have a prohibition of the soft money going to the \npolitical parties and to corporations and unions but there would be no \nprohibition of soft money going to all kinds of other groups and \norganizations that would proliferate and would basically raise soft \nmoney and go on television with these sham issue ads, in which case I \nwas not even sure the legislation would be a step forward.\n  If we had less of this money going to the parties but more of it \ngoing to all kinds of independent groups and organizations--``Americans \nFor This'' and ``Americans For That''--that could raise $200,000, \n$300,000, $400,000, $500,000 at a crack and put it into these sham \nissue ads, I do not think we would be any better off.\n  So the amendment I offered to this bill said we would also have the \nsame prohibition on soft money applied to all of these independent \ngroups that applied to all of these sham ads. This is not to say that \nany organization cannot raise money and put on ads 60 days before an \nelection. But what we do say is, you have to abide by the same spending \nlimits as everybody else. That was the amendment.\n  I say to colleagues in this Senate Chamber, I do not think I have \never done this more than once in the last 11\\1/2\\ years--I hope not \nbecause it will come off a little self-serving--but I am really proud \nof that amendment, and I feel vindicated because--do you what want to \nknow something?--in the House of Representatives, there were many \nMembers who wanted to make sure we did not create this huge loophole, \nwho wanted to make sure the prohibition of soft money would apply to \nthese sham issue ads as well. That was part of the reason they \nsupported this legislation.\n  So by having the same feature, the same provision in both bills, we \ndid not have to make this change in the House It kept this bill out of \na conference committee. I remind my colleagues of that. We did not have \nto go to conference committee. We were able to get the necessary number \nof votes in the House of Representatives. The bill came back to the \nSenate, and we are where we are.\n  This is one of the two major provisions of this campaign finance \nreform bill. I point out to Senators, on both sides of the aisle, in my \nview, this is one of the critical features because, again, I am pleased \nto go after the soft money. I wish we did not raise the hard money \ncontributions. I still think we have a lot of work to go after big \nmoney in politics. But if we were going to have a prohibition on the \nsoft money to the parties, and to the unions and corporations, and we \nwere not going to be doing anything about all kinds of other groups and \norganizations that could then raise all this money, in huge sums, and \nthen put on these sham issue ads, then we would not have been any \nbetter off. We would have had a huge loophole.\n  I am proud of the fact that I brought that amendment to the floor. I \nregret how tough a fight it was, although I do not mind tough fights. \nIt was a victory. I certainly regret some of the characterization of \nthat amendment. I would remind any number of different newspapers, as a \nmatter of fact, subsequent to that battle in the Senate, many papers \nhave now editorialized for that amendment. It is one of the critical \nprovisions in the bill. It made it possible for us to pass it in the \nHouse because many Representatives were saying: Wait a minute, if you \nhave this loophole, we are going to weaken the parties and we are going \nto enhance the strength of all these different interest groups \neverywhere. So it made it possible to pass it in the House. It meant \nthat the House bill and the Senate bill--because certainly Congressmen \nMeehan and Shays wanted this feature in the bill--were in identical \nform. It meant we did not have to go to conference committee. It meant \nwe got the bill before us. And it means we are going to pass the bill \nbefore us today.\n\n  So I am really proud of that work. For me, this has been 11 years of \nfighting over this issue. I do not think there is anything more \nimportant we can do than to pass this legislation. I am sure we will \nget cloture, if we have a cloture vote. I am sure this bill will pass \nby the end of the day. I am sure this bill will be a significant reform \nand a significant step forward. It will not be a great leap sideways.\n  I am sure people in the country will feel better about the fact we \nhave passed some reform legislation. I am also sure no one in Minnesota \nand no one in the United States of America should believe we have now \ncreated a level playing field, where you do not have to be a \nmillionaire to run, where you do not have to depend upon big money to \nwin, where you get a lot of the big money out of politics and you get \nmore ordinary citizens back into politics.\n  We are not there yet. This bill does not get us there. But do you \nknow what? It is a step forward. It is a victory for the citizens in \nthe country. I think it is a victory for good government. It is not \nHeaven on Earth, but it makes the political Earth a little better on \nEarth.\n  I am very pleased we are finally at this point. For me, there have \nbeen many years of struggle on this question. And I will finish where I \nstarted, and I will say this. I apologize, in a kind of a self-\naggrandizing way--I am fiercely proud of the fact that this \ncontroversial provision and amendment was an amendment I brought to the \nSenate. We won it in a tough fight. There was plenty of attack over it. \nWe needed to plug that loophole. We needed to make sure the soft money \ndid not flow to all these different interest groups that would \nbasically then take over all the campaigns. I am honored to be a part \nof this reform bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I commend our colleague from \nMinnesota for his typical eloquence. I, too, think he offered a very \nvaluable amendment and one that, as he has explained, ran the risk of \nsinking the legislation, but that did not make the amendment any less \nworthy. For oftentimes, in a situation where a proposal makes all the \nsense in the world, for a variety of other reasons it may make it \ndifficult to continue the process.\n  But his point about treating some organizations differently than \nothers is based on sound logic. I commend him for his efforts and his \nparticipation in the debate on this subject matter and for his \nlongstanding commitment to the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  Today is, in fact, one of those historic days. It may not look that \nway at this particular moment in the Chamber where every seat is not \noccupied, but we are coming down to the final hours of what has been a \nvery lengthy, contentious, and highly charged debate, going back years \nin this country. It will come to a culmination, I am told, possibly as \nearly as this afternoon. We will vote, finally, on a package dealing \nwith campaign finance reform.\n  It is an issue I have supported over the years, since arriving in the \nCongress, for that matter, in the other body, where I served for some 6 \nyears before coming to the Senate 21 years ago.\n  The issue of campaign finance reform--in the wake of Watergate in the \nmid-1970s, which spawned the underlying legislation that dealt with \nPresidential races and campaign finance issues--has been an ongoing \ndiscussion and debate for many years and one I have associated myself \nwith as both a Member of the other body and a Member of this body.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n  The action we are going to take later today is going to rewrite one \nof our Nation's Federal campaign finance laws in a very fundamental \nway. As has been stated over and over again, the Senate will approve \nlegislation addressing what the American people believe is maybe the \nsingle most egregious abuse of our campaign finance system, and that is \nthe raising and spending of unlimited and unregulated so-called soft \nmoney in our Federal elections.\n  It is not the only problem in our campaign finance laws. It is not \nthe only answer. But it is the answer around which a majority of \nMembers here could coalesce. I would have preferred a system that has \nbeen used at the Presidential level, which I think has worked very \nwell. And every American President, regardless of party, has embraced \nit, going back to the late 1970s: Ex-Presidents Ronald Reagan, George \nBush, Sr., the father, as well as President Clinton, and President \nBush, the son. All have embraced the principle of matching campaign \ncontributions, public support, with limits, prohibitions, and \ndisclosure on the amounts spent on campaigns. To their credit, every \nRepublican candidate and Democratic candidate have done so.\n\n  While it is extremely expensive to run for President, in the absence \nof that structure, I think we would have watched the cost in \nPresidential campaigns double, triple, maybe quadruple what it is \ntoday.\n  Today, there is not a majority of Members of this body or the any \nother body who would support a similar structure for congressional \nraces, Senate or House. So no matter how good the idea may be, if you \ncan't muster 51 votes here and a majority in the House, then the idea \nis only that: it is a good idea, but it lacks the ability to build the \nnecessary majority support for the idea to become law.\n  This is the formula we have been able to coalesce around, to either \nban, or place specific and real limits, on soft money in our Federal \nelections. While others may wish we had a different formula, it seems \nto me that not to do anything because you are unable to get your \nformula adopted would be a huge mistake.\n  I strongly support this approach, although I might have preferred \nothers.\n  The exploding use of soft money that permeates our campaign system \nis, of course, having, in the minds of many, a corrupting influence, \nsuggesting that large contributions by donors to officeholders, \ncandidates, and political parties provide those donors with preferred \naccess and influence over public policy.\n  Whether or not that is the case is immaterial, I have never \nsuggested, I have never known of a particular Member whom I thought \ncast a ballot because of a contribution. In the minds of most people--a \nsad commentary--maybe not most, but many people, that is the case. That \nis what they think happens. So it then becomes a fact to them. Whether \nor not the reality lines up with that perception is something else. But \nif in the minds of Americans, our public citizens at large, in whom we \nmust maintain the confidence of an electoral democratic process, our \ncampaign financing system is so corrupted by large contributions, that \nis a stark reality with which we have to contend.\n  That is what our distinguished colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin, \nSenators McCain and Feingold, and their supporters have had in mind \nover the years.\n  It is not unreasonable that the public perception of even the \nappearance of corruption erodes public confidence in the integrity of \nour electoral process and the independence of our democracy. If the \nMcCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan legislation does nothing else but \neviscerate the soft money loophole, it will be considered the most \neffective reform in decades. I am convinced this legislation is \nnarrowly tailored to strike the appropriate and constitutionally sound \nbalance between the two competing values scrutinized by the Supreme \nCourt in the historic case of Buckley v. Valeo: Protecting free speech \nand limiting ``the actuality and the appearance of corruption.''\n  It has been decades since Congress took similar comprehensive action \nwith enactment of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The one \nthing we cannot afford to do is wait any longer. Now is the time to \nenact the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan legislation. The American people \nhave shown an incredible amount of patience in waiting for this law to \nbe enacted.\n\n  I predict this debate will find its place in history. The debate, \ngoing back to the end of March and early April of 2001, will go down as \none of the most significant, worthwhile debates in the recent history \nof this institution. Everyone had a chance to offer whatever amendments \nthey wanted to on the bill. It was free flowing. It was actually an \nongoing debate and discussion about ideas. The Senator from Minnesota, \nduring that period, offered his amendment. We had many other ideas \nbeing offered by a number of Senators that had a chance for full \ndiscussion and airing. We then had the opportunity to vote those \namendments.\n  I compliment the Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, for his willingness \nand his leadership in providing the opportunity for every Member to \nhave full input in the rush of passage. This issue was of paramount \nimportance to the continued health of our democracy. The majority \nleader's handling in the winding-down process of the campaign finance \ndebate exemplified the Senate at its best. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid, played a very important role as well in seeing to it that \neveryone had a chance to be heard as we went through that historic \ndebate last year.\n  Now, as we prepare for the final passage, the unrestricted \nopportunity to offer and debate amendments, the unrestricted \nopportunity for all parties to complete negotiations for a technical \ncorrections bill, and the opportunity for all Members to be heard are \nthe hallmarks of the world's greatest deliberative body. We should all \nbe proud to be Members of it, as we finalize this product.\n  At the same time, I also acknowledge the influence and the passion \nthe Senator from Kentucky has brought to this issue. He is the ranking \nmember of the Rules Committee, the former chairman. I have said on \nother occasions, he embraces an unyielding belief in how the financing \nof our campaigns should be accomplished. There are concerns about the \nconstitutionality of certain provisions, whether or not this is the way \nwe ought to be regulating speech in this country. I disagree with \nSenator McConnell with respect to his conclusions that most or some of \nthese provisions are unconstitutional with respect to first amendment \nright to free speech and association. However, I admire people who have \nstrong beliefs and are willing to fight for them. Whatever else one may \nsay about the substance of this debate, we all admire the commitment \nand strength of Senator McConnell and his commitment to his ideas and \nhow hard he has fought for them.\n  Certainly Senators Feingold and McCain, Congressman Shays, and \nCongressman Meehan deserve the lion's share of credit for pursuing this \nissue. They have been unyielding in their determination in the face of \na lot of criticism, a lot of people pushing in the other direction. \nThey stuck with it. As a result, we are about to adopt historic \nlegislation that will bear their names. Whatever else they may \naccomplish--and they have in many other areas--I know for Senators \nFeingold and McCain, the accomplishment of campaign finance reform will \nculminate one of their finest hours of public service. They have \nrightly received the acknowledgment for their efforts in bringing this \nbill to its final conclusion.\n  I support this legislation. I thank the Democratic leader and whip, \nSenator Reid, the two sponsors of the bill in the Senate, and those who \nhave opposed it. This has been one of the finer debates in which I have \nparticipated in my service in the Senate, the culmination of which is \nnot going to alter the course of history, but it is going to bring a \nsignificant, profound, and worthwhile change in how we finance our \ncampaigns for public office at the Federal level.\n  For all these reasons, I am privileged and honored to be associated \nwith campaign finance reform legislation and commend those who have \nbeen engaged in this debate in helping us to arrive at this moment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut, in his usual \nway, passed a lot of accolades to everyone\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\nexcept himself. This was one of the most difficult to manage bills I \nhave seen on the floor. Senator Dodd managed that bill as well as I \nhave ever seen a bill managed during the time I have been in the \nSenate. I thank him for his compliments to the leader and to me. We \njust basically stood and watched him do all that he did to get to the \npoint where it passed. It was extremely difficult. I thank him.\n  Based on a conversation I had this morning on the floor with the \nRepublican leader, I ask unanimous consent that time beginning at 12:30 \ntoday be equally divided and controlled as follows: Senator Lott or a \ndesignee from 12:30 to 12:40; Senator Daschle or a designee from 12:40 \nto 12:50.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dodd, who would normally manage the bill, has other \nobligations. The majority leader has asked that the time be controlled \nand designated by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, whose name \nis associated with this important legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I \nstrongly agree with him with regard to the outstanding job the Senator \nfrom Connecticut did in managing this bill. It was truly masterful and \nessential, given the open and difficult nature of the process. I thank \nhim for his kind words.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 44 minutes at this time, \nnot counting the time for the leadership just prior to the vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am about to yield to one of the Senators who was very helpful on \nthis issue. I have been through many of the turning points on this \nissue over 7 years. One of the clear turning points was the group of \nSenators who arrived after the 2000 election. None has been more loyal \nand helpful in the process than the Senator from Missouri. I am \ngrateful for her support on this issue.\n  I yield 10 minutes to Senator Carnahan from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today marks the final stage for \ncongressional action on campaign finance reform legislation. That we \nhave reached this point is a testament to the leadership of my \ncolleagues, John McCain and Russ Feingold. I thank them for their \ndedication. The American people are grateful to them for helping to \nrestore our democracy.\n  Our Founding Fathers gave us a tremendous gift: the experiment in \nself-government, an experiment that embodies faith in mankind, a \nrevolutionary idea of governance.\n  To those who say Americans have deviated from this course, to those \nwho say Americans have become apathetic or disinterested, I say \nAmericans cherish their democracy as never before.\n  Dating back to the birth of our Nation, numerous observers have \nvisited America's shores to witness firsthand the wonders of this \nGovernment. In ``Democracy in America,'' Alexis de Tocqueville \ncommented on the trust vested by the American people in their elected \nofficials. He said:\n\n       The electors see their representatives not only as a \n     legislator for the state, but also as the natural protector \n     of local interests in the legislature; indeed, they almost \n     seem to think that he has a power of attorney to represent \n     each constituent.\n\n  Certainly, De Tocqueville identified a sacred trust--a trust still \nheld and cherished by the American people. We, as elected officials, \nmust not jeopardize that trust. Voters understand the danger of money \nin politics. Voters understand that the so-called special interests can \nhave an insidious effect on good government. They have seen Enron reel \nand topple. Between 1989 and 2001, Enron contributed nearly $6 million \nto Federal parties and candidates. It is fair for our constituents --\nmany of whom lost their savings when Enron collapsed--to ask what Enron \ngot in return. Now voters are calling for our Government to take action \nto prevent special interests from having the ability to whisper in the \near of elected officials simply because their campaign coffers have \nbeen filled.\n  The clarion call for action can no longer be ignored. We must have \nsystemic change. The legislation before us today cleans up our system \nand strengthens our democracy. Banning unlimited contributions \neliminates the very worst aspect of our campaign finance system: huge \ncontributions that distort the democratic process.\n  Banning soft money will not make our system perfect, but it will \ncleanse our politics and make it possible for the voices of ordinary \nAmericans to be heard. No longer will wealthy special interest groups \nhave an advantage over average, hard-working citizens. By diminishing \nthe role of money in politics, this bill will help to ensure that \nelected officials spend less time fundraising and more time doing the \njob they were elected to do.\n  This bill will strengthen democracy by strengthening the faith that \nAmericans have in their elected officials and Government. No one \nunderstands the connection between campaign finance reform and love of \ncountry better than my colleague, John McCain. His service and his \nsacrifice for the Nation stand as an inspiration for all of us. His \ndedication to the cause of reform is a continuation of that service.\n  Vaclav Havel once said that ``democracy is like a horizon, always \napproaching.'' Democracy has always been a work in progress.\n  In fact, I am reminded of a story once told about \nPresident Eisenhower, who had a painting hung in his office--the Oval \nOffice. It was a painting of the signing of the Declaration of \nIndependence. The strange thing about the painting was that it was not \ncompleted. It was only two-thirds complete. There was some raw, \nunfinished canvas in one corner. Someone asked him: ``Why did you hang \nsuch a picture?'' He said: ``I found it in the basement of the White \nHouse. The painting had been commissioned many years earlier, but the \npainter had died before the work was completed.'' But Eisenhower hung \nit anyhow because he said it reminded him that democracy is an \nunfinished work and that there is room in the picture for all of us. \nCampaign finance reform reminds us that democracy is an unfinished \nwork, and the passage of this bill will ensure us that there is room in \nthe picture for all of us.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to one of our most \nsteadfast supporters of this bill from the time we began, from the time \nwe were sworn in together as Senators, the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to Senator Feingold, thank you very \nmuch for your work on this bill that we are about to pass. You and \nSenator McCain were steadfast, and you never gave up. You focused and \nyou fought, and every time there was back sliding, you refused to give \nup. I think it is a model for all of us, and it is a model for young \npeople to see that if you have a goal and you stick with it, and it is \nright, you are going to win in the end--eventually.\n  Having said that, I just hope this is the start of going back to one \nof the original ideas of Senators Feingold and McCain, which was really \nto limit campaign spending. There are a couple of wonderful things \nabout the bill on which we are about to vote for which I want to say \nthank you.\n  No longer will Federal candidates have to go and ask for unlimited \nsums of money for our parties and be put in a position where, even if, \nof course, we are not going to give special privilege to the people \ngiving it, it has that appearance of a conflict of interest. And the \nAmerican people have every right to question what we do if they look \nand see the large sums of money we receive. I think the Enron scandal \nbrought this home. I think people felt terrible that they had taken \nthese sums. That was the system. They may have done absolutely nothing \nto help a company that had gone astray, but it looks bad.\n  I say to Senators Feingold and McCain, thank you for that provision.\n  Soft money is out of the picture for Federal candidates, and that is \na good thing for us. We still have to raise, however, large sums of \nmoney. In the case of California, it is an obscene amount of money \nbecause of the cost of television, the cost of mail, the cost of\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\ngrassroots organizing in a State of 34 million people--we are talking \nabout sums required in excess of $20 million. Believe me, when I say \n$20 million, that is on the low side of what you really need to spend \nin order to get your message across in light of vicious attacks that \nwill come.\n  Another good thing about McCain-Feingold: Those vicious attacks that \nhave come from large soft money contributions will not be able to come \n60 days before your election. That is a big plus because that is what \nwe find--that candidates at the end simply cannot respond to this \nbarrage of activity.\n  So I feel personally grateful, going into an election cycle, that in \n2004 candidates will not have this burden to raise hundreds of \nthousands of dollars from one source in soft money. That will not be \nallowed. I think that is good for the candidate. I think that is good \nfor the country, it is good for the legislative process. We will not be \nhit by these last-minute ads with unregulated soft money at the end, to \nwhich we will be unable to respond.\n  I want to work on this further. We still have a big problem. One \nthing got knocked out of the bill, which was ensuring that the lowest \nrates would be available to us on television. That got knocked out of \nthe bill. I am still forced, and so are my colleagues from these high-\ncost States, to have to scramble to raise funds from individuals to get \nour message out on TV.\n\n  Unfortunately--although I always run a grassroots campaign, as many \nof my colleagues do--in these large States, even if one works 24 hours \na day, morning, noon, and night, one cannot meet all the voters, the \nmillions of voters. We have to rely on TV and radio. It is very costly. \nWe will still have to do that, a few thousand dollars at a time, which \nmeans we are going to be very busy.\n  Until we can limit campaign spending, we are going to be in this \nterrible situation. We all know, including Senator Feingold, this bill \nis not the be-all or the end-all, but it is a strong start, and I am \nproud to stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues on this one. I \nhope we get an overwhelming vote and can celebrate the fact that, after \nall these many years, we are moving to get control of a system that is \nout of control.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \ncould not agree with her more. This is a modest step, it is a first \nstep, it is an essential step, but it does not even begin to address, \nin some ways, the fundamental problems that exist with the hard money \naspect of the system.\n  I pledge to work with Senator Boxer and everybody else to continue \nthe efforts to accomplish more.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 32 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 45 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this issue has been talked about at great \nlength, and has been the focus of attention in Washington, DC, but I do \nnot believe it has been or is the focus of attention on Main Street, \nAmerica.\n  We are coming to the end of the debate where it appears this bill \nwill be passed by the Senate in the same form it was passed by the \nHouse, then sent to the President, and signed into law.\n  I wish this morning to talk about the issue that is before us and to \nexplain why I am very strongly opposed to the bill. I think it is a \ncase study in the power of special interest. I thank Senator McConnell \nfor his leadership on the issue.\n  I will begin with another observation. I congratulate Senator McCain \nand Senator Feingold. If there is anything we know about democracy, it \nis that majority rule does not exist in practice. In a democracy, \nintensity determines the outcome of debate on public policy. It is the \nwillingness of often a small number of people who care passionately \nabout something, who have overriding and burning interest, their \nwillingness to stay with that issue and to fight for it day after day, \nweek after week, month after month, and to ultimately wear down those \nwho do not care equally.\n  Anyone who does not understand that does not understand American \ndemocracy. We are here today because of the intense desire of a \nrelatively small number of people to see this bill become law. I \ncongratulate Senator Feingold and Senator McCain. I believe they are \nboth wrong, but they are not wronghearted. In my opinion, they are \nwrongheaded on this issue even though they both believe that what they \nare doing is in the interest of America. As Thomas Jefferson said long \nago: Good men with the same facts often disagree.\n  Why am I so strongly against this bill? First of all, I am not \nrunning again. I am about to close out my public life and exit the \npublic stage, as Washington expressed it.\n  I am profoundly opposed to this bill, first because it is clearly \nunconstitutional.\n  Elected officials take an oath to support and defend the Constitution \nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic. In the early days of the \nRepublic, the oath was taken very seriously. Officials took it as a \ncharge to themselves, given their individual capacity. I went to Korea \nwhen the first real election in history had occurred, and they swore in \na new President. It really came home to me how different our system is. \nWhen he swore on behalf of the people of Korea, he swore an oath to the \npeople. Under our system we do not swear any oath to the people. I took \nno oath to the people of Texas. The oath I took was to uphold, protect, \nand defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. \nThat was the oath.\n  In the early days, each individual who took that oath took it upon \nthemselves to make a judgment, to determine what was and what was not \nconstitutional. Since they had put their hand on the Bible, they took \nconstitutionality issues very seriously. I am sure John Marshall, when \nhe introduced judicial review in his famous Supreme Court rulings that \nhad a profound, positive impact on America, never foresaw the day would \ncome when Members of Congress might put their hands on the Bible and \nswore to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution and then say: It \nis not up to me to make a determination as to whether something is \nconstitutional; that is up to the courts.\n  Long ago, 24 years ago, when I took the oath, I did not say I swear \nto uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution based on what the \ncourts may some year in the future decide. I swore to uphold, protect, \nand defend the Constitution given my ability to read and understand \nthat document.\n  On that basis alone, I oppose this bill. This bill is as blatantly \nunconstitutional as any bill which has ever been written, any bill \nwhich has ever been adopted by the Congress of the United States.\n  I want to mention two areas where it is clearly unconstitutional. I \nam a free man and an American, and if I discovered that living in \nCollege Station, TX, was a new Thomas Jefferson--and I am waiting for \nanother one to come back--and I wanted to sell my house and raise money \nto tell the country about it, do I not have that right?\n  When the Founders wrote the first amendment, they were not concerned \nabout commercial speech. They were concerned about free speech, and \nthey wrote: Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of \nreligion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the \nfreedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people to \npeaceably assemble and to petition the Government for the redress of \ngrievances.\n  Does anybody doubt that my right to sell my property and tell the \nNation another Thomas Jefferson is in our midst is guaranteed under the \nfirst amendment of the Constitution of the\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nUnited States? How dare anybody tell me I cannot sell my property or \nmortgage my future, or disinherit my children in order to tell the \nworld there is another Thomas Jefferson.\n  The Founding Fathers would be amazed that any such proposal could \never be considered seriously. They would be astounded it could happen.\n  I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will use the flaming letter of \nthe Constitution to strike down this bill.\n  The second problem with this bill has to do with equal justice under \nthe law. If I am the New York Times, I am a for-profit company. My \nstock is on the New York Stock Exchange. I am driven by the same \nmotives--many of our colleagues would say greedy motives--as every \nother for-profit institution in America. Does anybody doubt the New \nYork Times, the Washington Post, or the Dallas Morning News is a for-\nprofit business? If they doubt it, they should have been on the \nCommerce Committee when the head of the Washington Post testified in \nfavor of legislation to prevent any telephone company from getting into \nthe communication business to compete with the Washington Post.\n  The New York Times is a for-profit enterprise, and so is the New York \nStock Exchange. They are both equally committed to making money. They \nare both driven by the bottom line.\n  They are both good investments today. Yet under this bill the New \nYork Times has freedom of speech. They can editorialize all they want \nin editorial space that would cost hundreds of thousands, and perhaps \nmillions of dollars, for the New York Stock Exchange to purchase. They \ncan routinely state their views on the editorial page and, quite \nfrankly, through their news reporting, and they do it every single day \non the front page and on the editorial page. They have a right to do \nit. But why should the New York Times have a larger say in the election \nof the President of the United States than the New York Stock Exchange?\n  When did God decree freedom of speech existed only if one owns a \nnewspaper or a television station or if they are a commentator? What \nabout people who work for a living and who want to be heard?\n  How can we write a law that treats the New York Stock Exchange \ndifferently from the New York Times?\n  What this bill provides is unequal speech, privileged speech. So I am \nopposed to this bill because it is patently unconstitutional.\n  Let me try to explain, as best I can in the time I have, how all of \nthis came about, in my opinion, and what this is all about. First of \nall, you have heard the endless hollering about political influence. \nPolitical influence arises from the fact people want to influence the \nGovernment. In fact, the Founders understood that and they wrote it \ninto the first amendment of the Constitution that the right to petition \nthe Government would not be abridged.\n\n  People want to influence the Government for two reasons, it seems to \nme. One, the Government spends $2 trillion a year. Most of it, it \nspends without competitive bidding. The Government grants privileges \nworth billions of dollars, grants special favors routinely, even sets \nthe price of milk to benefit people who have assets of $800,000 by \nstealing from schoolchildren who are poor. That is the Government, and \npeople want to influence it.\n  The second reason people want to influence Government is because they \nlove their country and they want to affect its future. I assume no one \nis interested in preventing that kind of influence. This bill does \nthat.\n  Let me set that aside because that is not what we are debating. Does \nanybody believe if we stop this massive flow of money into the process, \nthat the Government is going to stop setting the price of milk? Does \nanybody believe if we stop this soft money corruption of the political \nprocess, that the Government is not going to give away $2 trillion this \nyear? By limiting the ability of people to petition their Government, \nwe do not eliminate political power; we simply redistribute it. We take \nit away from one group; we give it to another.\n  The proponents of this bill would have Members believe that by \nbanning soft money we are reducing political influence. We are not \nreducing political influence at all. We are redistributing political \ninfluence. Who are we taking it away from? We are taking it away from \npeople who are willing and able to use their money to enhance their \nfree speech guaranteed by the Constitution. Who are we giving it to? We \nare giving it to the people who have unequal free speech under this \nbill. We are giving it to the media. We are giving it to the so-called \npublic interest groups. What a misstatement of fact. These are the same \npeople, the Common Causes and the Ralph Naders who won't tell you where \nthey get their money.\n  Under this bill, Ralph Nader can come to my State and denounce me as \nhe has on many occasion. I wear it as a badge of honor. But he will \nnever have to tell anybody under this bill where he gets his soft \nmoney.\n  We have had ads run in favor of this bill by groups spending soft \nmoney. They are not talking about banning their ability to spend it. \nThey are talking about banning everybody else's ability to spend it. \nWhat blatant hypocrisy. But there it is.\n  What this bill does is not reduce political influence but \nredistribute it, take it away from working people who commit their own \nmoney to enhance their speech and give it to the media and the special \ninterest groups that use the media to magnify their speech.\n  Is it not amazing when you list those who support this bill, they all \nfall into the category of the people who gain political power from the \npassage of this bill? The New York Times never tires of editorializing \nin favor of this bill. But they are perhaps close with the Washington \nPost as the biggest beneficiaries of this bill, because their speech \nwill still ring while the speech of others will be muted. So a one-eyed \nman is king in a world of the blind.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The New York Times and the Washington \nPost editorialized on this subject an average of once every 5\\1/2\\ days \nfor the last 5 years.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. But they have done more than editorialize. They have \nengaged in a type of McCarthyism. Let me explain.\n  Every day we read in the paper that the Senator from Kentucky or the \nSenator from Texas or the Senator from Rhode Island or the Senator from \nWisconsin get so much money from Arthur Andersen or Enron or U.S. \nSteel. Yet, verifiably, none of us ever received money from Arthur \nAndersen or Enron or U.S. Steel or any other company. Those who say we \ndid, know we did not, because it is illegal. Corporations cannot \ncontribute to campaigns.\n  Yet all one has to do is open the daily paper to find that almost on \nany issue now, as this has turned into a great symphony, almost on any \nissue that is being debated, if you care about something, everybody who \nagrees with you who has ever contributed to you is listed--but not as \nindividuals. They are listed by what profession they are in or what \ncompany they work for.\n  It is McCarthyism to say that all the accountants who contributed to \nme--and God knows if there is a living CPA who has not contributed to \nme, shame on you; shame on you--every CPA in America should have \ncontributed to me. I understand debits and credits. I have spent a \npolitical lifetime talking about balancing the books. If you are a CPA \nand you have not contributed to me, you may be guilty of malpractice.\n  This is the point. To say that the people in my State who work for \nArthur Andersen were representing Arthur Andersen when they contributed \nto me is totally false and it is exactly the guilt-by-association \nprocess that the media has denounced over and over again. Yet in the \nmost effective way, they promoted this bill. They have committed \nMcCarthyism routinely. Routinely. I defy them to go to any accounting \nfirm in America--and there isn't one where there are not a lot of \npeople who have supported me--and find where there was a directive from \nthe company to give me money. Everybody knows that is a felony. That is \nillegal.\n  Yet long ago the Washington Post, the New York Times, and virtually \nevery other newspaper in America stopped saying a Senator received \ncontributions from employees of Arthur Andersen. They say he received \nfunds from Arthur Andersen.\n  It is not just editorializing every 5 days. It is changing the very \nmeaning\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\nof words, and distorting the very English language to create this \nconception that somehow the whole system is corrupted by free speech, \nall the while knowing they will be the biggest beneficiaries of \nlimiting other people's free speech.\n  The Dallas Morning News, I am proud to say, the most important paper \nin my State--maybe I should say the Houston Chronicle--has always \nendorsed me. But in any election I probably have 80,000 or 100,000 \nindividual donors and they contribute and give me the ability to tell \nmy side of the story. So if the newspaper or the television station or \nsomebody who has the ability to express an opinion has an opinion \ndifferent than mine, I have an opportunity to tell my side of the \nstory. Under this bill, that ability is limited, and that is profoundly \nwrong and unconstitutional.\n\n  The problem, it seems to me, goes even further because in the end we \nare tilting the balance of power to a very small group of people. It \nwas the involvement of people in contributing their money that \ndestroyed the smoke-filled room, that ended the back-room deal, that \nliterally brought politics into everybody's living room. This bill is a \nmovement back to the smoke-filled room. This concentrates political \npower in fewer and fewer and fewer hands. This is fundamentally anti-\ndemocratic. It violates what the Founding Fathers understood as being \nimportant.\n  The Founders knew the country was not peopled by angels because they \nwere not angels. The Founders understood that people had their own \nspecial interests, that people could have corrupt views. So they \nprovided the maximum number of people with influence so the evil of the \nfew was offset.\n  As I often say, I love the issues that are hotly debated. Because if \npoliticians know they are going to catch hell no matter what they do, \nthey will normally do the right thing. It is when nobody is paying \nattention on one side and everybody on the other side is organized that \nbad things happen.\n  I have heard my colleagues say: I don't want these outside groups \ninvolved in my election. Pardon me? Since when was it their election? \nWhen I am running for public office, it is not my election. It doesn't \nbelong to me. It belongs to the people of Texas. Often, when I ran, \nthere have been mean groups that have come to the State and said bad \nthings about me.\n  This election does not belong to me. It does not belong to my \nopponent. It belongs to the people--and not just the people of Texas \nbecause I am a United States Senator. I cast votes that affect people \nwho live everywhere. My service has affected people who live in every \nState in the Union, every town in every State in the Union. They have a \nright to be involved in my campaign. They don't have a right to vote, \nbut they have a right to speak.\n  Many of my colleagues have said: I don't want those groups involved. \nThere is an inconvenience in free speech--if people aren't saying what \nyou want them to say. But is it not dangerous to end their ability to \nspeak? If this bill really stood--and I do not believe it will--I think \nyou would have a concentration of power in the media and in these \nspecial interest groups that use the media--Common Cause, Nader--it \nwould be harder and harder for people to get their view out if their \nview differs with the established power structure. More and more \ndecisions about who wins elections would be made by editors and by \nspecial interest groups.\n  There will be more smoke-filled rooms--I don't guess people smoke \nanymore, but whatever it is they do in these rooms, there will be more \nof it. You will have more athletes elected, you will have more \ncelebrities elected.\n  The problem is, this new Thomas Jefferson may not be a star. He may \nnot even be attractive. He might not be extraordinarily articulate. The \noriginal Thomas Jefferson was a very poor speaker, from all we \nknow. But his ideas were revolutionary. In fact, I think if you had to \nchoose the most important man of the last thousand years--you would \nhave to give it to two people: Thomas Jefferson for political freedom; \nand Adam Smith for economic freedom. The two of them together had the \nrevolutionary idea of our time.\n\n  I am afraid, under this bill, that we will not discover the next \nThomas Jefferson. I am afraid, under this bill, that other things will \nbe more important. As you narrow the vision of a great country, you \nnarrow its future. The Bible says, ``Where there is no vision, people \nperish.''\n  I wonder what will occur when the American people are ready to be led \nin another direction, but the power structure does not want to go \nthere. How are the people ever going to hear the other side of the \nstory?\n  These are very important issues. We have never debated an issue more \nimportant than this. Yet there is no interest in this issue because, as \na result of all these years of distorting the English language, keeping \nup a drumbeat, gradually politicians have been worn down. Now people \ncan say: I can violate the Constitution, I can endanger the future of \nAmerica, or I can get a bad editorial in the New York Times. Of course \nthey decide they do not want the bad editorial in the New York Times.\n  So that is where we are. I am relatively confident this bill will be \nstruck down by the Supreme Court. What a paradox it will be, what a \nhappy day it will be for me and for the Senator from Kentucky, since \nthis bill has no severability clause in it, if it is struck down, only \nthe parts struck down die. What a great triumph for freedom it would be \nif all of the parts of the bill that limited free speech were struck \ndown as unconstitutional, and only the part of the bill that enhances \nfree speech by simply updating for inflation the limits on individual \ncontributions remained. Could it happen? It has happened before.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to vote for \nthis, in large part because they believe this tilts the playing field \ntoward them.\n  It may very well be that it will not. It may very well be that, in \nthe end, we did not fulfill our oath, but our Constitution is a \npowerful document, and when we pass a law and the President signs it \nbecause of the pressures of the moment and the consensus in the media, \nthen it has to stand the test of the Supreme Court. They are only \nacross the street. But across the top of their building is written, \n``Equal Justice Under Law.'' This bill destroys equal justice under the \nlaw. And anyone who could sit under that roof with a good conscience is \ngoing to feel called upon to take the Constitution seriously and will \nstrike down this law. In doing so, they will live up to the high \nexpectations of the founders.\n  Let me conclude by congratulating the Senator from Kentucky. It is \nfun to be in front of television cameras. It makes you feel important. \nIt gives you sort of a notoriety. People recognize you. It doesn't last \nvery long, but they do. And it is awfully easy to stand up and defend \nthings that are popular. It is very difficult to defend ideas that are \nunpopular, to be attacked every day in the media because of the \nposition you take.\n  There are not many people who are tough enough to do that. There are \nprobably only three or four--five people in the Senate, and I am being \ngenerous.\n  A lot of people get into politics because they want to be loved. \nThen, when an issue comes along where your principles are on one side \nand love is on the other, it is hard.\n  I have watched and I have read those editorials vilifying the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I know it has been hard, and I just want to say that I \ndon't know whether they will ever build a monument to the Senator from \nKentucky, but he is already memorialized in my heart. I will never \nforget the fight he has made on this bill. I thank him.\n  The Constitution does not work by itself. It requires a few good men. \nThe Senator from Kentucky is one of those good men.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nask that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, unfortunately, he has left the floor, \nbut I just wanted to thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for his \nbrilliant speech outlining the deficiencies of the bill, which will \npass later today. I am extraordinarily grateful for his overly generous \ncomments about my work on this issue. I assure him that the vote today \nis not the end. There is litigation ahead. We will have announcements \nabout the litigation team in the near future. I share the hope of the \nSenator from Texas that the unfortunate parts of this bill, which he \noutlined so skillfully, will indeed be struck down in the courts. I can \nassure him that we are going to give it our best shot and that we will \nhave an extraordinarily talented legal team spanning the illogical \ndivide in this country to take this case forward and to give it our \nvery best effort and to protect the first amendment, which he outlined \nso skillfully in his comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nunder the quorum call about to begin be equally charged against both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n   Mr. President, on September 7, 1995, 6\\1/2\\ years ago, the senior \nSenator from Arizona and I introduced the first version of the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reform bill. It was a different bill from the \nbill we are about to pass today, but it was a different world then. The \nSenate that year was controlled by the Republican party. The majority \nleader was Bob Dole. The occupant of the White House was a Democrat, \nBill Clinton, still in his first term. Still far in the future, \nunimaginable to any of us then, were an impeachment trial, an \nimpossibly close Presidential election, and of course, September 11.\n  The world of campaign finance was much different, too. Still to come \nwas the 1996 Presidential campaign with campaign finance abuses that by \nnow we refer to in shorthand--the White House coffees, the Lincoln \nBedroom, the Buddhist temple fundraiser, Roger Tamraz. Still ahead were \nthe extraordinary revelations of the Thompson investigation concerning \nfundraising abuses by both political parties. Still in the future was \nthe explosion of phony issue ads by outside groups and by the political \nparties--hundreds of millions of dollars spent to influence elections \nthrough a loophole that assumes that the advertising is not meant to \ninfluence elections.\n  Most amazing, as I look back on these many years, is the growth since \nthen of the soft money outrage, which has become the central focus of \nour campaign finance reform effort over the past several years. When we \nfirst introduced our bill--I have to be honest about this--soft money \nwas still in, if not its infancy, then, at the most, it was in its \nadolescence.\n  When we first introduced the bill in 1995, banning soft money was on \nour list of provisions, but we listed it, actually, as the sixth \ncomponent of the bill, coming after, believe it or not, the problem of \nreforming the congressional franking privilege. I noted in that speech, \nwith some emerging outrage, that the political parties had raised--I \nkid you not--``tens of millions of dollars'' in 1995 alone, a figure \nthat, of course, is absolutely nothing compared to what we see today.\n  The soft money loophole surely came of age in the 1996 elections, and \nhas only kept growing since then. In the 1992 election cycle, the \nparties raised a total of $86 million. In 1996, that number more than \ntripled to $262 million. And in 2000, soft money receipts nearly \ndoubled again to $495 million, nearly half a billion dollars.\n  As the world of campaign finance has changed, so has the McCain-\nFeingold bill. In late 1997, in the wake of the Thompson investigation, \nwe reluctantly concluded that we needed to first focus our efforts on \nclosing the biggest loopholes in the system: the soft money and the \nphony issue ads. But narrowing the bill, obviously, did not make it \neasy to pass. As those two loopholes have grown in importance, and more \nand more money has flowed through them into our elections, the \ncommitment of the major players in the political system to protect them \nhas only increased.\n  Indeed, there was a time when the opponents of campaign finance \nreform called soft money ``sewer money'' and proposed banning it in \ntheir own alternative bill. Now, instead, they champion soft money as \nessential to the health and stability of the political parties and that \nit is somehow now protected by the first amendment, even though they \nwanted to eliminate it and called it ``sewer money'' before.\n  But a few things have not changed a bit since Senator McCain and I \nbegan this journey together. One is our commitment to bipartisan \nreform. Both Senator McCain and I mentioned this in our first speeches \nin 1995. We knew then that a partisan effort on this issue would be \ndoomed to failure.\n  In my speech, I noted that we were both speaking to Members of both \nparties about our bill, and that ``we are not dividing up the Senate \nbecause this has to be a product of the Senate.'' This had to be a \nproduct of the whole Senate, both parties.\n  That hope was put to the test last year when this body engaged in an \nextraordinary 2-week floor debate on campaign finance reform, with an \nopen amendment process and a vote on final passage for the first time \nsince 1993. We had 27 rollcall votes in that debate. Thirty-eight \namendments to the bill were offered and 17 were adopted. This bill is \ntruly the work product of the Senate as a whole. That is a major reason \nwhy it will soon be headed to the President for signature.\n  Another thing that has not changed since 1995, of course, is the need \nfor reform. If anything, it has increased as much as the amount of soft \nmoney contributed to the parties has increased. In 1995, I noted that \nthe public had reason for concern when big money was being poured into \nlegislative efforts such as the telecommunications bill and regulatory \nreform legislation. Since then, the list of legislative battles where \nmoney has seemed to call the shots has gotten longer and longer: the \nbankruptcy bill, product liability legislation, the tobacco wars, \nfinancial services modernization, the Patients' Bill of Rights, China \nMFN. I could, obviously, go on and on.\n\n  I have called the bankroll on this floor more than 30 times since \nJune 1999. These days, major legislation almost never comes to this \nfloor without interests, often on both sides, that have made major soft \nmoney contributions to the political parties. We need to look no \nfurther than the work we do on this Senate floor to see the appearance \nof corruption--the appearance of corruption--that justifies banning \nsoft money.\n  A few years ago an advocacy group unveiled a huge ``FOR SALE'' sign \nand held it up for an afternoon on the steps of the east front of the \nCapitol. We have seen similar images for years in political cartoons. A \nconstituent once wrote to me that perhaps Senators should wear jackets \nwith corporate logos on them like race cars. We laugh at these images, \nbut inside we cringe, because this great center of democracy is truly \ntainted by money. Particularly after September 11, all of us in this \nChamber hope the public will look to the Capitol and look to the Senate \nwith reverence and pride, not with derision. Our task today is to \nrestore some of that pride. I believe we can undertake that task with \nour own sense of pride, because we know it is the right thing to do, \nand we know it has to be done.\n  Another thing that has not changed since we first introduced the \nMcCain-Feingold bill in 1995 is the determination of the opposition to \ndefeat reform. Early in 1996, when we were approaching our first vote \non the McCain-Feingold bill and the first filibuster against our bill, \na coalition began to meet to plot our defeat. The Washington Post\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\ndescribed the coalition as ``an unusual alliance of unions, businesses, \nand liberal and conservative groups.''\n  I called them at the time--and continue to call them--the Washington \ngatekeepers: the major players in politics and policy in this town for \nwhom campaign money is the currency of influence.\n  The National Association of Business PACs even began to run ads \nagainst House Members who cosponsored the bill, and they threatened to \nwithhold financial support in the next election. Even before our bill \nhad seen its first debate, the status quo had organized to kill it. And \ntheir efforts have continued unabated throughout the last 6\\1/2\\ years.\n  The opposition has plainly made our task more difficult, but it also \nnow makes our victory more satisfying. Because as we stand on the verge \nof enacting this major accomplishment, we in the Congress who have \nsupported this effort know we have acted not out of self-interest, and \nnot for the special interests but for the public interest. This bill is \nfor the American people, for our democracy, and for the future of our \ncountry.\n  When a previous effort to reform the campaign finance system failed \nin an end-of-session filibuster in late 1994, then-Majority Leader \nGeorge Mitchell said this on the floor:\n\n       The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, every Senator \n     knows this system stinks. Every Senator who participates in \n     it knows this system stinks. And the American people are \n     right when they mistrust this system, where what matters most \n     in seeking public office is not integrity, not ability, not \n     judgment, not reason, not responsibility, not experience, not \n     intelligence, but money.\n\n  This bill will not fix every problem in our campaign finance system. \nThe Presiding Officer and I have talked about this throughout the years \nof his steadfast support for our efforts. This bill will not \nmiraculously erase distrust and suspicion of the Congress overnight. It \nwill not completely end the primacy of money in politics that so \ndisturbed Senator Mitchell. But the bill is a step in the right \ndirection. It is a step in the right direction.\n  After so many years of effort, and so many disappointments, the \npublic has reason to be gratified by what we are about to do, and to \nlook with hope to what we can accomplish together when the monkey of \nsoft money is finally lifted off our backs.\n  As elated as we are about finally finishing this long battle for \nreform, I cannot leave the floor without noting that the war is not \nover. We must be vigilant as the Federal Election Commission \npromulgates regulations to implement the legislation. And, of course, \nwe face a certain court challenge by opponents of reform who will argue \nthat it violates the Constitution.\n  I assure my colleagues of two things: First, we have had one eye on \nthe eventual court challenge ever since we started this process. This \nbill has been carefully crafted to take account of the Supreme Court's \ndecisions in this area. Can I guarantee that every provision will \nsurvive a Court challenge? Of course not. But I can tell you that we \nhave done our very best to design these reforms in a constitutional \nmanner.\n  Second, we plan to be active participants in the legal fight that \nwill undoubtedly end in the Supreme Court of the United States, perhaps \nas early as a year from now.\n  We will be similarly active in pressing the FEC to promulgate \nregulations that fulfill--that fulfill, not frustrate--the intent of \nthe Congress in passing this bill. The Senator from Arizona and I did \nnot fight for 6\\1/2\\ years to pass these reforms only to see them \nundone by a hostile FEC. The role of the FEC is to carry out the will \nof the Congress, to implement and enforce the law, not to undermine it.\n  I call on each of the Commissioners, regardless of political party or \npersonal views on our reform effort, to be true to that role and to the \noaths of office they took.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in overseeing the crucial work \nof the FEC and to participate in its rulemaking proceedings where \nappropriate.\n  In addition, even after we have enacted this law, there will be other \nreforms to do. We need to look at the cost of broadcast advertising and \nconsider whether those having a license to use the public airwaves \nought to be required to provide free airtime to promote democratic \ndiscourse during election campaigns.\n  In my opinion, we need to again consider the possibility of public \nfunding of congressional elections, following the very successful \nexperience with clean money systems in Maine and Arizona.\n  Finally, we must remain vigilant to guard against the next abuse of \nthe campaign finance system when it comes, as it surely will.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their patience and their support. I \nknow this battle has been difficult for many of them. The pressure to \npreserve the status quo was intense. Inertia is a powerful force \nagainst change. We have all compromised at least a little in order to \nachieve this final result. Many Members have cast difficult votes. They \nhave sometimes followed Senator McCain and me down a path without \nknowing exactly where it would lead. I am grateful for the trust they \nhave shown in us, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart.\n  Before I close, I pay special tribute to my partner in this effort, \nthe Senator from Arizona. When Senator McCain called me shortly after \nthe 1994 elections and asked me to join with him in bipartisan reform \nefforts, I could never have imagined we would be standing here together \non this day on the verge of a great victory for the American people. He \njust didn't tell me how long it would take. I truly believe his courage \nand dedication, demonstrated in so many ways over so many years, are \nthe reasons the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 will soon become \nthe law of the land.\n  My respect for him has grown with every challenge we have faced \ntogether. He is a great legislator, a great leader, and, above all, a \ngreat friend.\n  Our work on this bill, John McCain, has been the highlight of my \nprofessional life. Your friendship means more to me than you will ever \nknow. Thanks, John.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think I am the last Senator on this \nside of the aisle who served on the conference committee that produced \nthe bill that was declared unconstitutional in Buckley v. Valeo. In the \n8 years I served as assistant Republican leader on the floor, many \ntimes I was involved in debates concerning actions to try to get back \nto the subject of campaign reform.\n  On May 26, 1983, I introduced the constitutional amendment to allow \nCongress to regulate and limit expenditures and contributions in \nFederal elections.\n  In 1986, I put in the Record a campaign finance study which showed \nvery strong public opposition to publicly funded congressional \ncampaigns, and I have maintained this stance against publicly funded \ncampaigns for Congress since.\n  In 1986, Senator Hollings introduced a constitutional amendment, and \nI cosponsored that with him, again trying to limit expenditures in \nFederal elections.\n  In 1987, I was part of the debate on S. 2, which would have provided \npublicly funded Senate campaigns. And it was my argument then that we \nshould have full disclosure of soft money and that the issue ad \nsponsorship and subsidized mail rates for 501(c) nonprofits should be \nregulated, as well as limiting the PAC influence on our elections.\n  In June of 1987, I introduced S. 1326, which required unions, \ncorporations, PACs, and all parties to report all attempts to influence \nFederal elections, including voter registration and get-out-the-vote \ndrives. It would have required notice and disclosure of independent \nexpenditures and prohibited coordination of independent expenditures, \nbut it would have increased contribution limits for individuals facing \nwealthy opponents.\n  I am pleased to say that at that time I was ranking member of the \nCommittee on Rules, in 1987, and that Senators McConnell and McCain \ncosponsored S. 1326.\n  In this Congress, I voted to send the Senate campaign finance bill to \nconference committee and stated at the time it was my hope that a \nconference would produce a fair and balanced bill. This bill has not \ngone to conference. Instead, now we have a bill that tilts the balance \nof power away from accountable political parties towards\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\nnonprofit interest groups whose donors are often shielded from \ndisclosure. These nonprofits often exist side by side: 501(c)(3) and \n501(c)(4) corporations use tax-deductible contributions to support \ntheir overhead expenses, which allows them to spend more money on issue \nads which are not regulated by this bill.\n  As ranking member of the Rules Committee in 1987, I tried to \neliminate all soft money. That legislation, I believe, would have \nprovided substantial new disclosure requirements to rein in the \nnonprofit groups which now overwhelm the political process.\n  In terms of this legislation, I have reached the conclusion that it, \ntoo, is unconstitutional. If the bill that was reviewed in Buckley v. \nValeo was unconstitutional, this one surely is. It does not provide a \nlevel playing field. It does not deal with the pernicious problem of \n501(c)(3) and (c)(4) nonprofit corporations. I will not put it in the \nRecord now, but Senator Kasten at one time made a study of the \ninfluence of those corporations, and he has been gone for a long while. \nTheir influence has grown. This bill just gives them more and more \npower over the election process.\n  In my opinion, we should stop picking at the edges of this issue and \npass a constitutional amendment to solve the problems created by the \nSupreme Court in the Buckley case.\n  I shall vote against this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are concluding a great debate that has \nlasted for years. I compliment the primary sponsors of this \nlegislation, Senators McCain and Feingold, for their tenacity, \nperseverance, and stubbornness in making this event happen. They have \nbeen very committed to their cause, and I compliment them for that. I \nlike to see my colleagues and friends who have very strong beliefs work \nto enact legislation to implement those beliefs. They have done that \ntoday. They will be successful today. I congratulate them and \ncompliment them.\n  I also compliment my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, as well \nas Senator Gramm, for their tenacity in opposing this particular \nlegislation. I happen to agree with them on the substance of the issue. \nIt is great to see a deliberative body, a body that is able to have \nfriendships that are very strong and opinions that are very strong, \nexpress itself and do so in the form of debate and with significant \ndiscussion. We have done that. We have done it, frankly, over the \ncourse not just of this legislative session, but over 2 or 3 years.\n  Looking at the substance of this legislation, we have had a great \ndebate. We have had good leadership. We have had very dedicated \nindividuals who have committed a great portion of their legislative \ncareer either promoting or opposing this legislation. It has been good \nfor the body. It has been a good debate on strong issues--strong issues \nbecause we are dealing with the Constitution.\n  When we are sworn to take the office of a U.S. Senator, we are sworn \nto uphold the Constitution. It is not done lightly. It is done by every \nMember of the Senate.\n  The Constitution says that Congress shall make no law respecting \nestablishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof or \nabridging the freedom of speech.\n  Our forefathers believed so strongly about this particular section, \nit is the first amendment. If you read the papers at the time, some of \nour forefathers thought that wasn't necessary; it was almost a given. \nOthers said: No, we need to make sure we have the fundamental freedoms \nof religion, speech and assembly. Let's make it the first amendment, \neven though it is self-evident. So they did. This was the first \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Now we are going to be telling some groups: Wait a minute you can \ninfluence ads or have involvement in campaigns, but if you want to say \nSenator Gramm from Texas is the best Senator ever, you have to do that \nin a particular way.\n  Well, you can only do that with certain kinds of money, but not other \nkinds. Maybe you think he is the worst Senator and you want to run an \nad that says that. Some groups are going to have a hard time doing \nthat. They are going to have to abide by a host of new legalities. We \nare infringing on free speech, in my opinion; though that will \nultimately be contested in court.\n  I happen to have faith and confidence in the judicial branch. It will \nbe a very interesting argument before the Supreme Court, and I have no \ndoubt that my colleagues from Arizona, Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas, \nand perhaps from Oklahoma, will witness that argument before the \nSupreme Court. It may be one of the most exciting and interesting hours \nof debate before the highest court in the land. I look forward to that. \nI won't dwell on it much further. I think the bill has a constitutional \nproblem. I think we are, in some ways, infringing and impeding free \nspeech.\n  I want to talk about a few other components in the legislation. In \nsome ways, I think the bill was improved from the way it left the \nSenate. When this bill left the Senate, it had a provision that said \npoliticians get lower broadcasting rates--the so-called Torricelli \namendment. I opposed that amendment vigorously, but I lost on the floor \nof the Senate. I am pleased to say the provision was removed in the \nHouse. I didn't think we should pass campaign reform, act as if we are \ndoing great things, then have people find out that politicians get \npreferential rates over others.\n  I find the bill faulty when it says we are going to ban soft money, \nbut with an effective date that is after the next election. If we are \ngoing to do it, shouldn't it be immediate? Now you are going to see a \nlittle splurge of spending, with groups trying to raise all the soft \nmoney they can. I also find the bill to be faulty from the standpoint \nthat it will limit soft money going to local parties, but not soft \nmoney and other funding going to interest groups that will certainly \ntry to influence elections. My guess is that we will hamper or reduce \nthe influence and effectiveness of national parties. However, now you \nwill soon have a lot of special interest groups that will grow in their \ninfluence, that will raise a lot more money, that will enhance their \nget-out-the-vote efforts, et cetera. So you are going to have a \nmultiplication of special interest groups, where their power will grow, \nwhere they will be outside the national party effort, but they will be \nindependent--maybe--and they will be very much trying to influence \nelections.\n  So instead of having, more or less, two major political parties, you \nmay have a multitude of special interest groups with a lot of money \ntrying to influence elections. We will have to see. I think you can win \nelections if you have the best candidates, no matter what the rules \nare. So it is in the interest of both parties to recruit the best \ncandidates, and may the best candidates win.\n  One other comment where the bill falls short, and where I tried to \nfix this on the floor and was not successful. Unfortunately, we didn't \nmake sure that all political contributions were voluntary. It bothers \nme to think we are going to have campaign reform and still have \nmillions of Americans who are compelled to contribute to campaigns \nagainst their will, with which they don't agree, which they are opposed \nto; that is still the law of the land. It should not be, but it is. We \ncould have fixed it and we did not. So to have, in this day and age, \npeople who are compelled to contribute to organizations who make \ncontributions to political parties against their will, I think is \nwrong. And then to say, yes, they can file for a refund, and maybe get \nsome of it back eventually, after the election, after the money has \nbeen used for the purpose with which they disagree, is not a \nsatisfactory solution. Nobody should be compelled to contribute unless \nthey agree to it in advance, including any political cause with which \nthey disagree. They should not be compelled to contribute to an \norganization or political party unless they agree with it. We didn't \nfix that in this legislation, unfortunately. I hoped we could pass \nlegislation that I could be supportive of and which would meet the \nconstitutional test. I don't believe this particular bill does.\n\n  I don't think this bill is the end of the world, as some have \nindicated. We will let the courts decide whether or not it is \nconstitutional. The bill has some positive provisions. I think indexing \nor updating the hard money\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\namount, allowing individuals to contribute more is a positive change. \nSo I compliment our colleagues for that. It has some other sections \ndealing with running against a millionaire candidate, and so on. I \nthink those are good sections as well. So it is not all wrong. I do \nhate to pass anything that would curb an individual's or group's \nability to participate in the election process.\n  Regretfully, I will be voting against this bill--again, with no angst \nor anxiety against the proponent. I compliment them for their efforts \nand their success today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona such \ntime as he may require.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \nkind remarks about those of us who support legislation that he opposes. \nIt is typical of his generosity and spirit. I thank him very much.\n  I also want to thank my friend from Wisconsin, about whom I will \nspeak later on today. As always, he contradicts Harry Truman's old \nadage that ``if you want a friend in Washington, go out and buy a \ndog,'' because he is a very dear friend, and it has been one of the \ngreat privileges of my life to get close to him. It is a privilege \nknowing a truly honest man.\n  Mr. President, we have reached, at long last, the point when \nmeaningful reform in our campaign finance laws is within our reach; in \nfact, it appears to be imminent. Although some of the measure's \ndetractors have argued that the American public doesn't care about this \nissue, I think the outpouring of public support proves otherwise.\n  In an online poll conducted by Harris Interactive, 65 percent of \nthose polled favored campaign reform to ban soft money. While my \ncolleague from Texas, who spoke earlier, was correct in saying that we \nare determined, he is incorrect in asserting that we are a determined \nminority. In a CNN/Time poll last March, 77 percent of Americans \ndescribed the current way in which candidates for Federal office raise \nmoney for campaigns as either ``corrupt'' or ``unethical.''\n  There has been some shrill media opposition to this bill, \nparticularly in the weeks since the House approved it by a vote of 240 \nto 189. The support for campaign finance reform that is reflected in \nnewspapers around the country, I think, more accurately reflects the \npublic sentiment on the issue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat several articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 17, 2002]\n\n          Bush 2000 Adviser Offered To Use Clout to Help Enron\n\n                           (By Joe Stephens)\n\n       Just before the last presidential election, Bush campaign \n     adviser Ralph Reed offered to help Enron Corp. deregulate the \n     electricity industry by working his ``good friends'' in \n     Washington and by mobilizing religious leaders and pro-family \n     groups for the cause.\n       For a $380,000 fee, the conservative political strategist \n     proposed a broad lobbying strategy that included using major \n     campaign contributors, conservative talk shows and nonprofits \n     to press Congress for favorable legislation. Reed said he \n     could place letters from community leaders in the opinion \n     pages of major newspapers, producing clips that Reed would \n     ``blast fax'' to Capitol Hill.\n       ``We are a loyal member of your team and are prepared to do \n     whatever fits your strategic plan,'' Reed wrote in an Oct. \n     23, 2000, memo obtained by The Washington Post. ``In public \n     policy,'' he wrote, ``it matters less who has the best \n     arguments and more who gets heard--and by whom.''\n       The memo offers a glimpse into the relationship between \n     Enron and the influential conservative, who was first \n     recommended to the company in 1997 by Karl Rove, now a senior \n     adviser to President Bush. Reed, head of the Altanta-based \n     consulting firm Century Strategies, is the former executive \n     director of the Christian Coalition and current chairman of \n     the Georgia Republican Party.\n       Reed has drawn criticism for his 1997 work on one Enron \n     issue, a Pennsylvania deregulation matter, but Century \n     Strategies Vice President Tim Phillips said yesterday the \n     firm's relationship with Enron continued until October 2001, \n     when it ended by ``mutual agreement.''\n       Phillips said Enron never finalized the specific lobbying \n     job outlined in Reed's memo, but he declined to answer \n     questions about what tasks Reed did carry out for the Houston \n     company. Reed did not return phone calls.\n       Last month Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, \n     asked for a federal investigation into whether Rove arranged \n     the 1997 Enron contract to avoid paying Reed from Bush \n     campaign funds. Others have questioned whether the Bush \n     camp had hoped to ensure Reed's allegiance during the \n     early days of the campaign.\n       Enron has offered little information about its dealings \n     with Reed, one of many prominent political figures and \n     commentators the company cultivated ties with before it \n     collapsed in bankruptcy late last year. Rick Shapiro, the \n     Enron vice president to whom Reed addressed the memo, \n     declined to comment.\n       Reed's influence has escalated over the last decade. He \n     claims credit for helping Bush win several key presidential \n     primary victories, and he has served as an adviser to members \n     of Congress. Since 1997, when Reed opened Century Strategies, \n     his consulting clients have included political candidates and \n     corporations with interests in Washington. He dropped \n     Microsoft Corp. as a client in 2000 after charges that he had \n     lobbied Bush on behalf of the software company while bush was \n     governor of Texas.\n       The seven-page memo to Enron illustrates for the first time \n     how Reed pitches his services to major corporations and how \n     he draws on alliances he forged during ideological battles \n     fought alongside conservative religious leaders. It also \n     shows how political consultants have increasingly brought \n     tactics once seen only in campaigns into the legislative \n     arena.\n       Enlisting Reed's aid would have been in character with \n     Enron's strategy of aligning itself with high-visibility \n     political figures and pundits. Those who have accepted pay \n     from Enron for their advice and other help include Bush \n     economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey, Weekly Standard editor \n     William Kristol, economist Paul Krugman, CNBC commentator \n     Larry Kudlow, U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick \n     and incoming Republican National Committee chairman Marc \n     Racicot.\n       Reed referenced his previous Enron work in the October 2000 \n     memo, noting Enron had seen his ``capabilities at work in the \n     1997 effort in Pennsylvania,'' where Reed helped Enron build \n     support for electricity deregulation. ``Since that time, we \n     have built a formidable network of grass-roots operatives in \n     32 states,'' he wrote.\n       Reed offered to mobilize that network in an effort to \n     deregulate the electricity market. At the time, Enron was \n     seeking open access to the nation's power grid so it could \n     compete with traditional utilities.\n       Reed's memo stresses that his firm's ``long history of \n     organizing these groups makes us ideally situated to build a \n     broad coalition'' benefiting Enron. He said Enron's arguments \n     for deregulation were less important than commanding \n     attention by enlisting the aid of elected officials' friends \n     and supporters.\n       ``There are certain people--a friend or family member, key \n     party person, civic or business leader, or major donor--whose \n     correspondence must be presented to the [elected] official \n     for his personal reading and response,'' Reed wrote.\n       Such prominent figures could act as surrogates for Enron \n     while pressing lawmakers to rewrite statues, Reed said.\n       ``We have the capacity to generate dozens of high-touch \n     letters from an elected official's strongest supporters and \n     the most influential opinion leaders in his district,'' he \n     wrote. ``Elected officials and regulators will be predisposed \n     to favor greater market-oriented solutions if they hear from \n     business, civic, and religious leaders in their \n     communities.''\n       Reed's memo said his organization had a record of \n     harnessing the ``minority community'' and the ``faith \n     community'' to support his clients.\n       Reed proposed two lobbying strategies, one costing $177,000 \n     and the other $386,500.\n       ``I will assume personal responsibility for the overall \n     vision and strategy of the project,'' he wrote. ``I have \n     long-term friendships with many members of Congress.''\n       Reed proposed sending 20 ``facilitating letters'' to each \n     of 17 members of the congressional commerce committees that \n     handle deregulation. Under the proposal, Enron would pay \n     Reed's firm $170,000 for generating the letters, each signed \n     by a third party.\n       Reed asked Enron to pay his firm $25,000 to generate \n     letters to the editors of newspapers, each signed by a \n     prominent figure. ``These op-eds and letters are then blast \n     faxed to elected officials, opinion leaders and civic \n     activists for use in their own letters and public \n     statements.'' He said his firm had recently ``placed'' \n     opinion pieces in The Washington Post and the New York Times.\n       A $79,500 telemarketing campaign would have cold-called \n     citizens and offered to immediately patch them through to \n     Congress.\n       ``For one recent client, we generated more calls to a U.S. \n     Senate office than had been received since impeachment'' of \n     President Bill Clinton, he wrote. ``The result was a major \n     victory for the client.''\n       Finally, Reed said he had enjoyed ``great success'' in \n     using conservative news-talk programs to spread his clients' \n     message to ``faith-based activists.''\n       ``Our public relations team has extensive experience \n     booking guests on talk radio shows, and has excellent working \n     relationships with many hosts,'' he wrote, proposing a \n     $30,000 fee.\n       ``We look forward to working with Enron,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2001]\n\n                Why This Lobbyist Backs McCain-Feingold\n\n                         (By Wright H. Andrews)\n\n       As a Washington lobbyist for more than 25 years, I urge \n     Congress to make a meaningful start on campaign finance \n     reform and pass the McCain-Feingold bill. While many \n     lobbyists privately express dismay and disgust with today's \n     campaign finance process and are in favor of reforms, most \n     have not expressed their views publicly. I hope more \n     lobbyists will do so after reading this ``true confession'' \n     by one of their own.\n       I am not an ivory-tower liberal, nor do I naively believe \n     we can or should seek to end the influence of money on \n     politics. I have engaged in many activities most reformers \n     abhor, including: (1) making thousands of dollars in personal \n     political contributions over the years, (2) raising hundreds \n     of thousands of dollars, including ``soft money,'' for both \n     political parties and (3) counseling clients on how to use \n     their money and ``issue ads'' legally to influence elections \n     and legislative decisions. Why, then, does someone like me \n     now openly call for new campaign finance restraints, at least \n     on ``soft'' money and ``issue'' advertising? Quite simply \n     because, as a Washington insider, I know that on the campaign \n     finance front things have mushroomed out of control. In the \n     years I have been in this business I have seen our federal \n     campaign finance system and its effect on the legislative \n     process change dramatically--and not for the better.\n       I believe that individuals and interests generally have a \n     right to use their money to influence legislative decisions. \n     Nevertheless, I know that lobbyists, legislators and the \n     interests represented increasingly operate in a legislative \n     environment dominated by the campaign finance process, and \n     its excesses are like a cancer eating away at our democratic \n     system.\n       There is no realistic hope of change until Congress \n     legislates. I readily admit that I will continue, and expand, \n     my own campaign finance activities--just as will most of my \n     colleagues--until the rules are changed.\n       Right now there is an ever-increasing and seemingly \n     insatiable bipartisan demand for more contributions, both \n     ``hard'' and ``soft'' dollars. The Federal Election \n     Commission has reported that overall Senate and House \n     candidates raised a record $908.3 million during the 1999-\n     2000 election cycle, up 37 percent from the 1997-1998 \n     cycle. The Republican and Democratic parties also raised \n     at least $1.2 billion in hard and soft money, double what \n     they raised in the prior cycle. Soft-money donations from \n     wealthy individuals, corporations, labor groups, trade \n     associations and other interests have shown explosive \n     growth. In addition, millions of dollars in unregulated \n     ``non-contribution'' contributions are being plowed into \n     the system through ``issue ads.''\n       Today's levels of political contributions and expenditures \n     are undercutting the integrity of our legislative process.\n       Ironically, congressional lobbyists in general are better, \n     more professional, more ethical and represent more diverse \n     interests than in the past. Our elected officials today also \n     are generally honest, hard-working and well-meaning. But \n     millions of Americans are convinced that lobbyists and the \n     interests we represent are unprincipled sleazeballs who, in \n     effect, use great sums of money to bribe a corrupt Congress.\n       Many citizens believe that using money to try to influence \n     decisions is inherently wrong, unethical and unfair. While \n     supporting reforms and recognizing citizen's concerns, I \n     disagree; I find little problem with political interests \n     seeking to influence elected officials through contributions \n     and expenditures at moderate levels, provided this is \n     publicly disclosed and not done on a quid-pro-quo basis. The \n     First Amendment allows every individual and interest to use \n     its money to try, within reason, to influence Congress. And \n     influence comes not just from political contributions; it \n     also comes from using money, for example, to hire lobbyists, \n     purchase newspaper ads and retain firms to generate ``grass-\n     roots'' support.\n       I nonetheless think the time has come to temper this right. \n     We have reached the point at which other interests and rights \n     must come into play. Campaign-related contributions and \n     expenditures at today's excessive levels increasingly have a \n     disproportionate influence on certain legislative actions. \n     Unlimited ``soft'' money donations and ``issue ad'' \n     expenditures in particular are making a joke of contribution \n     limits and are allowing some of the wealthiest interests far \n     too much power and influence.\n       Moreover, the ability of legislators to do their work is \n     being reduced by the demands of today's campaign finance \n     system. Many, especially senators, now must devote enormous \n     amounts of time to fundraising.\n       Any significant new campaign finance limits that Congress \n     adopts will have to survive certain challenges in the Supreme \n     Court. If Congress carefully crafts legislative restrictions, \n     the court will, I believe, uphold reasonable limits by \n     following reasoning such as it used in the Nixon v. Shrink \n     Missouri Government PAC case, in which it noted that ``the \n     prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption'' \n     is an important interest that can offset the interest of \n     unfettered free speech.\n       Some lobbyists continue to support the present campaign \n     finance system because their own abilities to influence \n     decisions, and their economic livelihoods, are far more \n     dependent on using political contributions and expenditures \n     than on the merits of their causes. Others feel strongly that \n     virtually no campaign contribution and expenditure limits are \n     permissible because of the First Amendment's protections. And \n     some, like me, believe additional restraints on campaign \n     finance are required and allowable if properly drafted.\n       As to those in the last category, I invite and encourage \n     them to work with me in Lobbyists for Campaign Reform, a \n     coalition to urge Congress to pass meaningful campaign \n     finance reforms, starting with the basic McCain-Feingold \n     provisions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 2002]\n\n                               Just do It\n\n       The Senate has already voted once in favor of campaign \n     finance reform legislation; now it's time to step up again \n     and finish the job. Last month House reformers won passage of \n     their version of the bill, fighting off ``poison pill'' \n     amendments to produce legislation that the Senate could \n     accept without a conference. Since that vote, even two \n     senators who oppose the bill have acknowledged that it's time \n     to move ahead on this issue: Sens. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) and \n     Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) said they won't support a filibuster to \n     block the measure. But Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell, a leading opponent, continues to seek delay. Today \n     he is expected to ask Senate Republicans to help him hold up \n     consideration of the bill until he can win approval of a \n     package of what he describes as technical amendments. But \n     Republicans shouldn't go along. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \n     says it's time to bring the measure to a vote, and he's \n     right. Stop the foot-dragging. Majority Leader Tom Daschle \n     ought to bring the House bill to the floor as soon as \n     possible. Senators should approve it, rejecting any \n     amendments that would force a conference, and the president \n     should sign it. The bill, as we've said before, doesn't solve \n     every problem or close every loophole. Some needed reforms \n     aren't addressed; other problems will doubtless arise as time \n     goes on. But this measure takes on the trouble that's \n     dragging down the system right now: the exponential growth of \n     unregulated ``soft-money'' donations from corporations, \n     unions and wealthy individuals. This flood of money, nearly \n     $500 million in the 2000 election cycle, eats away at public \n     trust by creating the sense that those big-money donations \n     aim to buy access. It creates an atmosphere in which at least \n     some businesses feel obliged to contribute in order to \n     protect their interests. It blows away the limits that the \n     1974 campaign finance law attempted to impose on the \n     influence of the wealthiest donors.\n       This is a system that needs changing. The bill would do \n     that by banning soft-money contributions to national parties \n     and taking federal candidates out of the business of \n     soliciting big soft-money gifts for political parties. A \n     majority of both houses is on record in support of these \n     reforms. It's now up to the Senate to make sure the effort \n     doesn't falter. End the delaying tactics. Just do it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 11, 2002]\n\n                               Armageddon\n\n       We don't see it in quite the same apocalyptic terms as \n     Speaker Dennis Hastert, who likened this Wednesday's House \n     vote on campaign finance reform to Armageddon. But the vote \n     is plenty important. Lawmakers can wash some $500 million in \n     big-money contributions out of the federal system: the cash \n     from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals that was \n     supposed to be banned from individual campaigns but that \n     parties and officeholders have learned to use for the benefit \n     of specific candidates. These are the funds that often come \n     from players who give to both sides in a contest, \n     contributions clearly aimed at buying access to \n     officeholders. It's long been clear that this corrupting \n     flood should be stanched. The House has recognized it twice \n     before, when members passed essentially the same legislation \n     that will be before them on Wednesday. Now they need to \n     summon the courage to do it again, when it counts.\n       It's because the vote actually matters that it might feel \n     like the end of the world to Mr. Hastert. He and other \n     Republican leaders are putting on the pressure, warning \n     Republican members that the GOP stands to lose its majority \n     in the House if this reform becomes law. Of course Rep. Tom \n     Davis of Fairfax, who chairs the Republican House campaign \n     committee, has been arguing the opposite, pointing out that \n     his party has a big lead in raising the $1,000 contributions \n     that would remain legal and taunting Democrats that they're \n     the ones who would be hurt by reform. The truth is that \n     incumbents on both sides of the aisle are addicted to the big \n     bucks and, like all addicts, they'll say anything to \n     safeguard their supply--including pretending to favor reform \n     while they look for a hundred different ways to derail it. \n     But most legislators also know that their dependence on big-\n     money lobbyists hurts democracy and curdles public attitudes \n     toward government. Reform will prevail if members who \n     supported it before stay the course. ``There are a hundred \n     ways to defeat this bill.'' Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) \n     told reporters last week. ``But only one way to win.''\n       He ought to know: He's been down this road before. \n     Reformers have been trying unsuccessfully to rein in the soft \n     money system for many years. The bill he and Rep. Martin \n     Meehan (D-Mass.) sponsored passed the House in 1998 and 1999. \n     In both those years\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n     the leadership tried to block a vote. Both times supporters \n     began the unusual maneuver of gathering signatures for a \n     discharge petition to require the measure to be brought \n     before the House; leaders compromised when the petitions \n     looked likely to succeed, and voluntarily scheduled votes. \n     This year Speaker Hastert threw up the barricades again, only \n     this time he didn't move until supporters actually obtained \n     the required 218 signatures, a majority of the House. Local \n     Republican Reps. Connie Morella, Wayne Gilchrest and Frank \n     Wolf deserve credit for signing the petition despite the \n     opposition of their own party leaders. Now the bill will come \n     to the floor under a complicated rule that allows \n     consideration of two substitute measures and a series of \n     amendments.\n       The procedure may be complex, but the goal is simple: Pass \n     the Shays-Meehan bill in a form that will allow the Senate, \n     which has already passed a companion measure, to accept it \n     without a conference committee. A vote that leads to any \n     other outcome is a vote to kill campaign finance reform. That \n     means members must reject the alternative proposed by Rep. \n     Robert Ney (R-Ohio) and unfortunately cosponsored by \n     Democratic Rep. Al Wynn of Prince George's County. That bill \n     purports to cap soft money contributions rather than ban them \n     outright, but it is sham reform. Its limits are so high that \n     it would have permitted 80 percent or more of the soft money \n     donations made in the last campaign cycle. Members must also \n     reject ``poison pill'' amendments that would derail the bill \n     in the Senate. And no one can get away with claiming that he \n     or she is voting against Shays-Meehan because amendments \n     approved in the Senate have made the reform bill too weak. \n     The alternative to this bill is no real reform at all. And \n     that's not an alternative that anyone, least of all voters, \n     should accept.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Feb. 15, 2002]\n\n                        Campaign Reform, at Last\n\n       Thanks, Enron.\n       Twenty-seven years after Watergate-era reforms sought to \n     curb the clout of megabuck money in politics, Congress \n     finally voted Thursday to close a loophole that has allowed \n     the law to be flouted since 1988.\n       Following on last year's Senate passage of a similar bill, \n     the victory is sweet. But it required a bitter, uphill fight \n     against House leaders who shamelessly fought to keep a half-\n     billion-dollar stream of ``gifts'' pouring in.\n       Ironically, reformers probably have the corporate \n     scoundrels at Enron to credit for their success. For more \n     than a decade, Republicans and Democrats, the House, Senate \n     and White House took turns killing campaign reform. Twice in \n     the late 1990s, House-passed reforms were blocked by Senate \n     filibusters. Last year, the House sidetracked a Senate-passed \n     reform bill.\n       This time, defenders of the seamy status quo were counting \n     on an about-face by colleagues who previously had postured as \n     reformers, confident changes would never become law.\n       Enron made that politically impossible. The company clearly \n     enjoyed exceptional clout in energy-policy decisions and \n     appointments, even though the $6 million Enron and its \n     executives showered on federal politicians during the past \n     decade didn't place it at the top of the list of generous \n     special pleaders.\n       Still, Enron's outrageous abuse of investors and employees, \n     coupled with its exceptional political charity--greasing the \n     treasuries of 95% of the Senate and 67% of the House--made it \n     a poster child for the sordid intersection of money and \n     politics.\n       The long-overdue reform would largely prohibit what's \n     called ``soft money''--dollars from corporations, labor \n     unions and wealthy individuals that are given to political \n     parties, then funneled into federal campaigns to avoid \n     Watergate-era contribution limits. They made up the bulk of \n     Enron's giving.\n       Reform still faces hurdles: repassage in the Senate over a \n     filibuster threat and President Bush's equivocations. Even if \n     the victory stands, those determined to keep buying what's \n     euphemistically called ``access'' to politicians--access that \n     ordinary folk don't have--are already testing new evasions.\n       The ultimate answer is public financing, allowing qualified \n     candidates to run without pandering themselves to monied \n     interests. Four states are trying that now.\n       But closing the outrageous loophole for special interests \n     is a vital first step in restoring democracy to the \n     democratic process.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, following the cloture vote, assuming the \noutcome of the vote is what I hope and believe it will be, I will again \nseek recognition to offer further comments on what I consider to be one \nof the most critical legislative measures on which I have had the \nprivilege to work. Today's vote, as reflected in these and other \ncountless newspaper articles and editorials, is about curbing the \ninfluence of special interests. Now is the time to enact real reform \nand return the power to the people and restore their faith in the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, next to me--the next speaker--is a person who played a \nvery key and vital role in the formulation of this legislation. A lot \nwill be written about how this 7-year odyssey came to an end. One of \nthe chapters in that book will be the time when Senator Thompson, the \nSenator from Tennessee, and Senator Feinstein, the Senator from \nCalifornia, engaged in delicate operations. The bill was basically dead \nwhen they began those negotiations. I won't go into the details of \nthem. But through a near miraculous turn of events, because of the \ndedicated efforts of Senator Thompson and Senator Feinstein, we reached \nan agreement on crucial parts of the bill, and we were able to move \nforward. I will be grateful to my friend from Tennessee for many \nreasons, but that is only one of them in the long list of debts that I \nowe him. I thank my friend from Tennessee, who will speak next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee as \nwell. He was there from the very beginning. He has been incredibly \nhelpful on the floor and in negotiations. I yield him such time as he \nmay require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Wisconsin and \nArizona. Their leadership in this matter has been noted many times. It \ncannot be stressed too much.\n  It is another indication that people who are intent on doing \nsomething they believe is good for the country can, if they are willing \nto spend a few years on it, take something that has apparently little \nsupport and wind up having substantial support.\n  We are about to see that happen, and Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold are to be congratulated for leading the fight, taking the \nslings and arrows, and doing something that I think is going to wind up \nbenefiting our political system, this institution, and, most \nimportantly, what we are supposed to be about more than anything else, \nbenefiting the Nation.\n  It has been pointed out that there are problems with this \nlegislation. It is pretty extensive. No doubt the opponents of this \nlegislation are correct in that. I know of no legislation of this type \nthat is not complex and without problems.\n  It has been pointed out there will probably be some unintended \nconsequences. No doubt that is correct.\n  It has been pointed out that people will start from day 1, after this \nis over, looking for loopholes, looking for the soft spots. ``You \ncannot do anything about money,'' they say. And there is no doubt \npeople will be looking for loopholes.\n  They even say that certain portions are unconstitutional. They are \nprobably correct about that. Fortunately, we have a clause that will \nnot cause the rest of the bill to fall. I believe the major portions of \nthe bill and the more important parts of the bill are constitutional, \naccording to decisions the Supreme Court has already made.\n  I am willing to concede those points. Those points are not unusual or \nindigenous to this bill. They are things we see all the time. Once we \nget through the meat grinder, the legislative process, we rarely come \nwith a perfect piece of legislation. This has an awful lot of good in \nit, and it is going to do some good.\n  The argument that we will have to change it in another 20 years does \nnot concern me that much. We had legislation that worked in this area \nfor about 20 years, and it did a pretty good job. Then we had to change \nit, and that is what we are doing now. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. There is nothing to be afraid of with regard to that.\n  We have to keep in mind the history--where we have been--to know \nwhere we are going. It is true that loopholes developed in the law. \nThat is what we are about today. It has been said of the last law that \nwas passed in 1974, major legislation, that it was a failure. I \ndisagree. That law was a public financing system for Presidential \nelections, and it was pretty much an even playing field. The candidates \nspent about the same amount of money. There was not any scandal, \nDemocratic or Republican, during that period of time. Sometimes the \nincumbent won, sometimes the challenger won. To me, that is the United \nStates of America. That situation prevailed for approximately 20 years.\n  In the 1990s all that changed. We had an administration that was \nwilling to\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\ntake chances with the law and legal interpretations that no one, until \nthat point, was willing to take. We had a regulatory environment in \nwhich decisions were made that were inconsistent, contradictory, \ncomplex, and hard to understand.\n  If we put all that together, we wind up with the result we have \ntoday. But we should not denigrate the fact that we can legislate in \nthis area to some good effect.\n  I have spent a lot of time in this Chamber talking about reasons we \nshould not regulate in many areas. I believe the government closest to \nthe people is the best. I believe in our principles of federalism. I \nbelieve State and local governments should step up and assume the \nresponsibilities they traditionally have had in this country for 200 \nyears. I believe all of that. But surely the most conservative of us \nmust recognize that there are certain areas which are within the \nFederal province.\n\n  Certainly national defense comes to mind. Recently we have been \nworking on our national parks and what is happening to them. Those are \nresponsibilities the Federal Government has taken on. We have taken on \nthe responsibility of our infrastructure and items of that nature.\n  I believe the election of Federal officials falls into that category. \nIf we as a body cannot take a look at our system, why it is working and \nnot working, and legislate in that area, I do not know in what area we \ncan properly regulate. I have no problem stepping up to the plate, as \nwe did in 1974, and saying we are going to place some limitations on \ncontributions and we are going to have a system of Presidential \ncampaigns where we are not going to have millions and millions of \ndollars of soft money pouring in from unions and corporations \nthroughout this Nation. It worked for a good period of time, and we are \nabout to do something that is going to work for another good period of \ntime.\n  It is important that we keep in mind the nature of the problem we are \ntrying to address. We are not federalizing something that does not \npertain to the Federal Government. We are not creating some new \nregulatory scheme. We probably cannot get all the regulations under the \ncurrent system in this Chamber. They are complex. They are confusing. \nThey are extensive. We already have that system.\n  Explain to me the rules that pertain to what the State parties can do \nvis-a-vis the national parties. They can trade money back and forth, \npercentages for this, percentages for that. It would take the brain \npower of a nuclear scientist to figure it out. That is the current \nsituation. So we should not be bashful about stepping up, recognizing \nthe problem, and believing we can do something about it. It is our \nresponsibility to do something about it.\n  What is that problem? The problem simply is this: We have gone from a \nsituation in this country where we financed our Federal campaigns with \nsmall contributions and a lot of people to a system where we are more \nand more dependent on huge entities giving tremendous amounts of money \nand a future that points toward fewer people being involved in the \nprocess.\n  We have gone from a situation where the maximum contribution \nsolicited was $1,000 to a situation where those raising the money would \nconsider themselves foolish if they spent too much time on raising \nthose hard dollars when they can pick up the phone to these big outfits \nand raise it many times that. You are not a player anymore unless you \nhave $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, or $100,000.\n  The same entities pick up our expenses for the convention. There is a \ntremendous amount of money now coming into play that was not there a \nshort time ago. We have a system now that benefits the politicians and \nbenefits the parties, and we try to make folks think it is our \nbirthright. It has not always been that way. It is a recent creation, \nand it is not a good creation.\n  Why is it not good? It is not good to have legislators or Presidents \nbe too dependent on people for whom they are supposed to be making laws \nthat affect their lives. When the very people who have legislation \nbefore you are coming to you with greater and greater amounts of money \nfor your political campaign, that creates a potential conflict of \ninterest that we simply do not need. It does not look good. The \nAmerican people think, the average Joe on the street thinks, that with \nthat much money being paid to that few people, they are expecting \nsomething for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. Twenty-six seconds remain in \nopposition.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee have 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate that, Mr. President. I will wind up by \nsaying we have a chance to address this constant scandal waiting to \nhappen. We are making headway to do something that will reduce the \ncynicism in this country that will help this body, that will help us \nindividually, and will trade increased hard money limits for the \nreduction of soft money, a tradeoff that will help challengers reach a \nthreshold credibility when they want to challenge us in these races.\n  So I commend my colleagues for this legislation. There is much more \ngood in this than ill, and I think it will help this institution and \nultimately this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleague from Tennessee for all his support \nand his excellent statement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the many this \nmorning who have spoken with some relief and satisfaction and \nconfidence about the outcome of the vote. There are many who can take \ncredit for the success we are about to experience, but none more than \nthe colleague who is sitting to my left, Senator Feingold. He and \nSenator McCain have been extraordinary in their persistence and their \nwillingness to negotiate, to compromise but yet to hold fast to the \nprinciples that make this legislation worthy of its passage and \nhistoric in its nature.\n  We are concluding one of the most important debates we will have had \nin this Congress. Thomas Paine, the famed revolutionary, once offered \nan explanation for why corrupt systems often last so long. He said:\n\n       A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a \n     superficial appearance of being right and raises, at first, a \n     formidable cry in defense of custom.\n\n  That is certainly true of the way we pay for campaigns in this \ncountry. Our reliance on special interest money to run political \ncampaigns is such an old habit that for a long time it had the \nsuperficial appearance of being right. But not anymore. The American \npeople understand that special interest money too often influences who \nruns, who wins, and how they govern.\n\n  While there is still a vocal minority who deny it, a clear majority \nof this Congress and an overwhelming majority of the American people \nknow our current campaign finance system is broken. Now is the time to \nfix it.\n  Almost 1 year ago, the Senate passed the McCain-Feingold campaign \nfinance reform bill. At the time, we had 2 solid weeks of debate and we \npassed a good, strong bill. Opponents of reform in the House used every \nargument and excuse, every imaginable ploy, to stop the bill from \nbecoming law.\n  For a while, it looked as if they had won, but 1 month ago the \nreformers turned the tide. The House passed the Shays-Meehan bill, and \nthe President has indicated he will sign it. Now it falls to the \nSenate, which started this process, to finish it, and today with this \nvote we will.\n  I am a realist. I know this bill does not address every flaw in our \nsystem, and I know there are those who are already looking for ways to \nwork around this bill. But as Senator Feingold has often said, it does \nshow the public we understand the current system does not do our \ndemocracy justice.\n  It curbs some of the most egregious injustices. It bans soft money, \nthe unlimited, unregulated contributions to political parties. It curbs \nissue ads, those special interest ads that clearly\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\ntarget particular candidates in an attempt to influence the outcome of \nan election. It calls for greater disclosure and increases penalties \nfor violation of the law.\n  Often those who are the loudest and decry the abuses of our current \nsystem are the staunchest defenders of that system.\n  If you really are outraged by the abuses, you need to fix the system \nthat invites them. If you want to fix the system, now is the time to do \nit. There are those who have argued and will continue to argue that in \nan attempt to make things better we will only make things worse. But \nsince its founding, the goal of America has been to strive for that \nmore perfect union our Founders envisioned.\n  To say we should not attempt to make things better begs the question: \n``Is what we have now good enough?'' Is it ``good enough'' that half of \nthe government has to recuse itself from an investigation of a failed \ncompany because it spread around so much money to those who were \ninvolved, to so many people in that community? Is it ``good enough'' \nthat in every election the amount of money spent goes up and the number \nof people voting goes down? Is it ``good enough'' that the current \nsystem is more loophole than law?\n  If we look at the rising tide of money in politics, the influence \nthat money buys and the corrosive effect it has on people's faith in \ngovernment, the answer, then, is clearly no.\n  Ours is a government ``of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.'' It is not a government of, by, and for some of the people.\n  With this vote, we stand on the verge of putting the reigns of \ngovernment back into the hands of all people. We owe that in large \nmeasure to the stewardship and commitment of our colleagues, Senators \nMcCain and Feingold. Time and again, they have refused to compromise \ntheir principles in the face of incredible pressure, but time and again \nthey have acted in the national interest rather than their respective \npartisan interests. So I thank them for their service to our Republic \nand to the Senate.\n  It has taken us a long time to get to this point. The last time \nCongress strengthened our political system by loosening the grip of \nspecial interest money was 1974, more than a generation ago. Congress \nmay not have another chance to pass real campaign reform for yet \nanother generation, long after most of us will have left.\n\n  Passing this bill will likely have a profound impact on each of us \nfor the rest of our time here, and none of us can be absolutely sure \nwhat that impact will be. But we know this: The status quo is not \nacceptable and today it will end. The currency of politics should be \nideas, not dollars. It is time for us to start putting the currency \nback into circulation.\n  After years of debate and months of delay, let us do this one final \nthing. Let us take the power away from special interests and give it \nback today to the American people where it belongs. We can do that \ntoday. The time is now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 12:50 has arrived. Under the \nprevious order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     318, H.R. 2356, a bill to provide bipartisan campaign reform:\n         Russell D.

Mr. President, is it correct that there are now going \nto be 3 hours of debate on the bill equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are enormously gratified by the vote \non cloture. We know that some Members who don't even support the \nunderlying bill thought it was appropriate and correct to bring the \ndebate to a close at this point. We thank all of our colleagues for \nsuch a tremendous showing of support to bring this issue to a \nconclusion.\n  With that, I am very pleased to yield 7 minutes to one of the \nstrongest supporters of this legislation and a tremendous ally, the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleagues, the \nSenators from Arizona and Wisconsin, as well as our majority leader, \nfor the great job they have done. We even reached more than two-thirds. \nSo if they ever change the law, go back to the old filibuster law, we \nwill still have an ability to win this vote. My hat is off to both \nSenators for their focus, their steadfastness, and for their great \nvictory today.\n  I rise in strong support of this bill on the campaign finance system. \nIt has been a long time in coming, but we are now on the verge of \nmaking history. With this vote, we are one giant step closer to a new \nera of campaign finance, a new era of voter confidence in our \ngovernment, and a new era of better and stronger democracy.\n  Again, I thank everyone, particularly Senators McCain and Feingold, \nand Senator Daschle, for their unyielding leadership and their \ndedication to seeing these reforms enacted. It takes more than you can \neven imagine to get something such as this done. Senators, you did it. \nOur Nation owes you our thanks.\n  We all know that soft money is slowly but inexorably poisoning the \nbody politic. One hundred years ago, we outlawed corporate \ncontributions to campaigns; we thought we did. Twenty-five years ago, \nwe outlawed unlimited giving to campaigns, or believed we did then, \ntoo. But today soft money makes a mockery of all three of these rules. \nThe $450 million in soft money raised by the two parties in the last \nelection doubled the amount given in the 1996 election. It had no \nlimit, but the size of the donors' bank account was obviously intended \nto influence Federal elections.\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n  We have to restore the system of regulated contributions. If we \ndon't, the cynicism and distrust and lack of engagement that are \nalready so pervasive will continue to spread. Our citizens are \nincreasingly tuned out from our democratic process. Voter turnout for \nthe 1998 election was 36 percent, the lowest turnout for a \nnonpresidential election in 56 years. In presidential elections, \nturnout has declined 13 percent since 1960.\n\n  We all know that banning soft money won't cure all of this by itself, \nbut it will help restore the impression and the reality that politics \nis more than a game played by and for only those who can afford to \ngive.\n  This bill creates new requirements that will ensure the integrity of \nour campaign system. It bans national parties from raising and spending \nsoft money. It bans Federal candidates and officeholders from raising \nsoft money. It bans State and local parties from using soft money to \npay for TV ads and election activities that mention specific \ncandidates. It bans corporate and union funding of sham issue ads prior \nto elections, and it requires disclosure of individual and group \ndonations for these ads.\n  Opponents of campaign finance reform claim this bill will harm \ngrassroots politics because the spending limits will force the national \nparties to focus on national candidates and not on the local \ncandidates. The bill's opponents have it wrong. Campaign finance will \nstrengthen our grassroots political system by breaking the parties' \nreliance on a handful of very wealthy contributors and forcing them to \nbuild a wider base of small donors and grassroots supporters \neverywhere.\n  In addition, the bill includes a narrow exemption so that local \npolitical parties can raise a limited amount of soft money.\n  There are some who believe this infringes on the first amendment. I \ncannot believe the Founding Fathers thought that the right to put the \nsame commercial on 5,112 times was intended to be protected by the \nfirst amendment. No amendment is absolute--not the first, not the \nsecond, not any of them. This seems to me to be a reasonable \nlimitation.\n  In fact, I hope the Supreme Court will reconsider Buckley v. Valeo so \nthat we can go further in terms of reform because this bill takes us \nalmost as far as you can get given the constraints of Buckley. And that \nseems to me to be one of the worst decisions rendered by the Supreme \nCourt in the last 25 years.\n  We take an important step by voting for campaign finance reform. I \nhope we will complete the job, either this week or next month, of \nstrengthening our electoral system by passing electoral reform as well.\n  Chairman Dodd has been heroic in his efforts to get the bipartisan \nbill finalized and back to the Senate floor. I will do everything I can \nto help him meet that goal. Once we have enacted this legislation and \nelection reform--one that shuts down loopholes in financing of \ncampaigns and the other that modernizes the actual voting mechanisms; \none limiting some influence from the top, the other increasing \ninfluence at the bottom--we will have brought our democracy into the \n21st century and made it stronger and more vital than it has been in \nyears.\n  The first step, today's step, is to vote for campaign finance reform. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in doing what we all know is the right \nthing: to support this bill and to remove soft money from our \nelections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have permission from Senator McConnell \nto yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Iowa, I be recognized for 10 minutes, as authorized by the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to explain my opposition to this \nbill but also to point out that I voted for cloture because it is quite \nobvious that we have reached closure on this bill, and we might as well \nget to final passage and move on.\n  I could just as well vote yes and look like a reformer, but looking \nat it cynically and looking at the history of the 1974 legislation, \nprevious reform attempts have evolved into a money machine for \npolitics. Congress meant to reform the process in 1974, but it has been \nproven that legally money is going to find its way in to support \npolitical speech. I could find a way to rationalize voting yes on this \nbill to look like a reformer.\n  Still, down the road there are going to be people who are very astute \nat finding a way within the law to spend money in the support of \npolitical speech. Because the democratic process in the United States \nis so central to our way of life, there should not be any impediments \nwhatsoever put in the way of getting political ideas adequately \nexplored, particularly during a Presidential election. I am not going \nto look like a reformer. I am going to vote no on this legislation. And \nthe reason is this: I see people get worked up about the fact that \ncandidates spend large sums of money in their campaigns--I will use \nmyself as an example. Every sixth year my campaign might spend roughly \n$2.3 million to get reelected. My campaign does. My junior partner from \nIowa has generally spent about $6.5 million. But whether it is $2.5 \nmillion or $6.5 million, it is all spent to promote ideas. That is what \nour form of government is all about--the expression of ideas and the \nimplementation of ideas. What is wrong with that? But to do so, I might \nspend, let's say, $2.3 million, to be reelected.\n\n  Now, why do people get all worked up about $2.3 million, when you \nwatch the Super Bowl commercial on Super Bowl Sunday, and one 30-second \ncommercial costs about $2.3 million? Are we ready to say that it is OK \non one Sunday afternoon out of a year that it is OK for commercial free \nspeech, for people to spend $2.3 million for a 30-second ad, and it is \nwrong for a candidate and his supporters for a whole year of an \nelection to spend approximately that amount of money? No.\n  I think political speech is even more important than commercial free \nspeech, and that we ought to do everything we can to perpetuate more \npolitical free speech than we do, instead of trying to curb it.\n  It is quite obvious that I think we should not pass this legislation. \nThe American people deserve an open system--one that shines in the full \nlight of day on campaign contributions, and that ought to be the ruling \nforce--not the amount of money.\n  At the same time, we should make it easier for citizens to become \nengaged in the electoral process. However, the campaign finance bill \nbefore us contains fatal flaws. The one I am going to mention has been \ntalked about so much that I almost do not need to repeat it. That is \nthe most egregious problem with this legislation--the provision that \nlimits the free speech of some organizations 60 days before an \nelection. Whether it is an individual or an organization, why curb \ndiscussion of any political issue in America? Groups from across the \npolitical spectrum would be prohibited from communicating their views \nif they even refer to a candidate for Federal office. I don't think we \nshould put a damper on any organization speaking at any time in the \nUnited States about political ideas, but especially 60 days before an \nelection. Limiting political discourse at election time solves nothing \nand it curbs the advancement of democracy.\n  It also goes against the grain of one of our most fundamental rights, \nthe right of freedom of speech. Political speech is what the authors of \nthe Bill of Rights were talking about, although it has been expanded \nway beyond political speech, to even cover commercial speech.\n  But I also believe that the complete ban on soft money in this bill \ngoes too far. Political parties raise this money to finance voter \nregistration drives, get out the vote activities, and communications \nabout issues that parties stand for. These are essential functions of a \npolitical party. They are also activities that increase voter \nparticipation.\n  Effective limitations on soft money are necessary to reduce real and \nperceived corruptions in the system, but a complete ban would undermine \nthe role of national political parties. Who is going to fill the void \nin the process if we tie the hands of the parties? The\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nDemocrats have always relied upon labor unions to man phone banks and \nget people to the polls. That would not change the result of this bill. \nThe Republicans, however, don't have an external organization to fall \nback on. Republicans rely on the party to build and mobilize their \ngrassroots network. This bill takes the Republicans' organizational \nability and cuts it off at the knees, but it leaves the other party \nuntouched. They have legitimate ideas that ought to be explored, but so \ndo we. That is hardly a balanced approach.\n\n  A big reason why soft money spending has increased in the first place \nis the limitations on campaign contributions by individuals. The cap on \nindividual donations has been frozen at the same level since 1974. This \nmade the individual contributions work less and less over the years.\n  I am pleased that this bill increases the individual contribution \nlimit amount and indexes it for inflation. It is high time we put more \nemphasis back on individuals by individual citizens instead of \ncorporations or unions.\n  On the other hand, the new prohibitions on soft money will simply \ncause an increase in spending on other areas. For instance, spending on \nissue ads can impact a campaign but is not regulated. Some have \nadvertised the new restrictions as getting the money out of politics, \nbut they don't get the money out of politics--or they don't get rid of \nthe money in politics. They only shift it from one place to another.\n  In fact, this point is illustrated by an article that appeared in \nRoll Call, February 21, entitled ``House Democrats Make Plans to \nCircumvent Campaign Reform.'' This article described a promise that was \nmade, apparently, by the House minority leader to a group of Democratic \nMembers. He assured them that he would help raise money for certain \noutside groups aligned with the Democrats, despite the new fundraising \nrestrictions that he supported. These groups can then turn around and \nuse this money to run unregulated issue ads to the benefit of Democrat \ncandidates. This example belies the contention that a soft money ban \nwill solve the problem of money in politics.\n  The best method of combating the influence of money in politics is to \nrequire full disclosure of campaign donations. I don't care even if it \nis to the penny. We can try to regulate ethical behavior by \npoliticians, but the surest way to cleanse the system is to let the Sun \nshine in. We must allow the voters to hold candidates accountable.\n  I have been a longtime advocate of comprehensive disclosure \nrequirements. In fact, this bill contains several positive reforms. It \nincreases the number of times candidates have to report contributions \nto the FEC, and it makes report information more accessible to the \npublic. This bill also increases penalties for campaign finance law \nviolations and provides for tough new sentencing guidelines. These are \nprecisely the sorts of reforms of which we should be doing more. \nHowever, some of the purported reforms in this bill simply won't work \nand may even be counterproductive. I am not the only one to spot the \nproblems in this bill.\n  Recent editorials in the two largest newspapers in the State of Iowa \nhighlight many of the same concerns I have just outlined.\n  Many attempts were made in both the House and the Senate to fix the \nproblems with this bill, but to no avail.\n  If this bill passes in its current form, I believe we will have lost \nan important opportunity to enact a balanced and sensible package of \nreal reforms to our campaign finance system. Therefore, I must \nreluctantly vote against the final passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print several editorials \nand an article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Cedar Rapids (IA) Gazette, Feb. 22, 2002]\n\n              Not Much ``Reform'' in Campaign Finance Bill\n\n       How much reform will actually emerge from campaign finance \n     legislation now being fine-tuned in Washington?\n       One has to wonder, given comments by Rep. Jim Nussle, R-2nd \n     District, to the Gazette editorial board Monday. On the \n     morning of its final vote, Nussle observed, he felt ``Shays-\n     Meehan no longer looked like Shays-Meehan.''\n       One provision ``that was snuck in, in the middle of the \n     night'' said the reforms don't apply to the 2002 election. \n     ``If it's so bad, and so corrupting and so illegal and so \n     rotten, then let's get rid of it,'' Nussle said. But that \n     stayed in, so that makes me suspicious.\n       ``The other thing that makes me suspicious is that you can \n     borrow against soft money. You can borrow hard money with \n     your soft money, and after the election, pay off your debt of \n     hard money, with soft money. That was another exception.'' \n     Soft money refers to unlimited and unregulated donations to \n     national political parties. hard money, which falls under \n     federal regulation, involves contributions by individuals to \n     candidates or a party committee. ``Now all these parties are \n     going to be borrowing money,'' Nussle said.\n       That didn't get much attention, Nussle continued, ``because \n     Shays-Meehan has now become a slogan. You either vote for \n     Shays-Meehan or you're against campaign finance reform.''\n       The final version of Shays-Meehan allows either party to \n     build or buy a building, ``even though only one party is \n     going to do this,'' Nussle continued: ``You can't do that \n     now. You can't do any of those activities now, but they're \n     all made exceptions as part of this bill.''\n       Nussle believes in full disclosure. That's the Gazette's \n     long-held view. (He also said he doesn't use, raise or need \n     ``soft money.'')\n       Nussle claims to be one of only 13 in Congress who fully \n     disclose contributions, ``following the letter of the law.''\n       ``I've always thought that maybe it should be the 13 of us \n     who write the bill and not the other 400-500 and whatever \n     that would be, because, quite honestly, unless you're willing \n     to follow the law, you don't have much standing to complain \n     about the law.'' Good point.\n       Reform? Change? No way. This legislation is only so much \n     post-Enron chest-thumping--an attempt to appear to be doing \n     something. Money, meanwhile, will just find new routes to \n     intended targets. Had Congress enacted real measures to \n     better assure that voters know who's contributing to who, at \n     least then you'd have a basis on which to judge candidates.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Des Moines Register]\n\n                     Campaign ``Reform'' Won't Work\n\n       While members of the U.S. House of Representatives engaged \n     in what Speaker Dennis Hastert called political \n     ``Armageddon'' over campaign finance last week, most \n     Americans were riveted by a scandal unfolding at the Winter \n     Olympics.\n       It's worth considering how the two events are alike, and \n     how they are different. While both politics and sports would \n     be ruled by merit, not money, the question is who makes the \n     decisions.\n       What drew extra attention to the Olympics was the \n     allegation of misconduct in the judging of the figure-skating \n     competition. But putting aside the issue of possible \n     corruption, the question is whether medals should be awarded \n     by a panel of judges or by applause meters. Obviously, \n     experts should make the call.\n       In the case of American-style democracy, however, the \n     applause meter is supposed to rule, but a lot of people \n     believe the meter is broken by the corrupting influence of \n     campaign money. Legislation designed to fix it was passed by \n     the House in the small hours of the morning Thursday.\n       But it no cure, and could make matters worse.\n       The Shays-Meehan campaign finance ``reform'' is advertised \n     as preventing ``special interests' from buying influence in \n     Congress. It would, among other things, ban ``soft money'' \n     given to national political parties to evade the limits on \n     contributions to individual candidates.\n       Like previous efforts to ``reform'' campaign financing, \n     this one would simply channel the money into a different \n     pocket. Just as the post-Watergate cap on individual \n     contributions led to political-action committees and soft \n     money. Those with the will and the wallet to influence the \n     political process will find a way around this legislation, \n     too, if it becomes law.\n       Meanwhile, the bill adds to the already burdensome \n     regulatory bureaucracy that terrorizes the poor candidate who \n     does not have an army of lawyers and accountants to figure \n     out the rules. For incumbents with big treasuries, however, \n     there is much to like in this bill: It doubles the amount an \n     individual may give to a candidate for federal office, and it \n     would prohibit ``special interest'' groups from putting \n     ``attack ads'' on TV within two months of election day.\n       Besides raising obvious constitutional questions, this bill \n     is wrong in principal. If people desire to spend their own \n     money on a political candidate or a cause, they have that \n     right under the First Amendment. ``Special interest'' include \n     ordinary people in groups, whether it's the National Rifle \n     Association or the National Abortion Rights Action League.\n       The law stops short of banning independently wealthy \n     individuals from using their own money to get themselves \n     elected. Why shouldn't someone with the same resources be \n     able to put his or her money on someone else?\n       It is naive to believe it possible to legislate good \n     behavior by politicians. Instead, let the democratic applause \n     meter do its work: Give citizens quick and easy access to \n     campaign-finance reports, and if they don't like what they \n     see, they can boo the rascals off the ice.\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                    [From Roll Call, Feb. 21, 2002]\n\n          House Dems Make Plans to Circumvent Campaign Reform\n\n                         (By Alexander Bolton)\n\n       As comprehensive campaign finance reform nears its expected \n     enactment, House Democratic lawmakers have already adopted \n     strategies for redirecting the flow of large contributions to \n     outside groups aligned with their party, a move they hope \n     will help them regain control of the Chamber.\n       House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) has assured \n     African-American members of his caucus that he will raise \n     money for groups such as the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Southwest Voter \n     Project to pay for their voter registration and get-out-the-\n     vote operations.\n       Reform legislation sponsored by Reps. Chris Shays (R-Conn.) \n     and Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) that passed the House last week \n     bans soft money but allows federal lawmakers to raise funds \n     in $20,000 increments for outside organizations as long as \n     those groups are ``nonpartisan.'' The loose restrictions \n     would allow party leaders to direct hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars for such groups.\n       Though the NAACP is officially nonpartisan, many \n     Republicans believe it is closely allied with the Democratic \n     Party. One GOP operative said Gephardt's plans are a cynical \n     attempt to exploit legal loop-holes for political gain.\n       ``It's disgusting they're crying for reform when they're \n     already cutting deals with tax-exempt organizations like the \n     NAACP that were playing politics in the 2000 election,'' said \n     Matt Keelan, a prominent Republican fundraiser who has \n     approximately 20 clients in the House.\n       Keelan and many other Republicans are still steamed over an \n     NAACP-funded ad from the 2000 campaign that reminded black \n     voters of the racially motivated murder of James Byrd Jr. \n     They feel it was an implicit attack on then-Gov. George \n     Bush's commitment to civil liberties, and one of the reasons \n     Bush garnered few votes from the black community.\n       Other Democrats say they will also raise funds for outside \n     groups to turn out the party's base on Election Day.\n       ``I would formulate voter education and registration \n     projects that would be funded by people like myself,'' said \n     Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.). ``We can go to all the people \n     that we know. There's no limit on nonprofit organizations.''\n       ``The Democratic Party has to do that as well,'' Hastings \n     added.\n       Gephardt pledged to raise the funds for outside groups last \n     week during a private meeting with Reps. Jim Clyburn (D-\n     S.C.), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), Earl \n     Hilliard (D-Ala.) and Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-Mich.), \n     who were wavering in the support for the Shays-Meehan \n     legislation.\n       A representative from the NAACP also attended the meeting.\n       Republicans say the ability of outside groups to continue \n     campaign activities on behalf of the parties is one of the \n     reasons Shays-Meehan is unfair.\n       ``The bill still does not create a level playing field,'' \n     said Rich Bond, former chairman of the Republican Party. ``An \n     inherent advantage has been given to outside groups that are \n     predominantly Democratic.''\n       Clyburn, a onetime opponent who voted for the bill, said he \n     switched his position because of Gephardt's assurances. Clay \n     and Kilpatrick also voted for the bill.\n       However, some lawmakers were not convinced that outside \n     groups could replace the party's grassroots activities, \n     activities that will be curtailed by a soft-money ban.\n       ``I've been involved in too many elections in my lifetime \n     to leave questions unanswered to the point where I have to \n     just take people at their word,'' said Thompson, referring to \n     Gephardt's promise. ``The opportunity for [minority] \n     participation and the opportunity for [minorities to \n     participate in] elections in the South has been hard fought \n     for.''\n       ``I was not satisfied enough with what was on the table at \n     the time to change my vote,'' he added. ``There were not \n     enough specifics to give me comfort.''\n       Thompson's spokesman, Lanier Avant, said that state parties \n     do not have the resources to mobilize voters.\n       ``We have no confidence in the state parties to fund those \n     efforts,'' Lanier said. ``We need the national soft \n     dollars.''\n       ``We'll see if [Gephardt] comes through on his word to \n     redirect his money to the NAACP,'' he added.\n       Rep. Harold Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.), a supporter of Shays-Meehan \n     and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that \n     anxiety over minority voter turnout was unfounded.\n       ``I believed all along those activities would not be harmed \n     or undermined,'' said Ford.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Federal election finance laws are \ntotally broken and a sizeable majority of the Members of Congress know \nthe time has come to fix them. Enough is enough. We have had enough of \nthe soft money loophole--with its contributions of unlimited dollars \nthat fuel campaigns despite laws which are intended to strictly limit \ncontributions to candidates. We have had enough of the candidate ads \ndisguised as issue ads and paid for with money outside the statutory \nlimits. And, we have had enough of the solicitations by our elected \nofficials and the officers of our national political parties, \nsoliciting huge sums of money by offering insider access to government \ndecisionmakers.\n  In the 1970s, we passed laws to limit the role of money in Federal \nelections. Our intent was to protect our democratic form of Government \nfrom the corrosive influence of unlimited political contributions and \nthe appearance of corruption which can be created when large sums of \nmoney are solicited by and for officeholders and candidates.\n  We wanted to ensure that our Federal elected officials are neither in \nreality not in perception beholden to special interests who are able to \ncontribute large sums of money to candidates and their campaigns. Our \nelection laws were designed to protect the public's confidence in our \ndemocratically elected officials.\n  For many years those laws worked fairly well. The limits they set \nseemed clear. Individuals weren't allowed to give more than $1,000 to a \ncandidate per election or $5,000 to a political action committee, or \nmore than $20,000 a year to a national party committee or $25,000 total \nin any one year. Corporations and unions were prohibited from \ncontributing to campaigns, except through regulated and limited \npolitical action committees.\n  That is the law on the books today.\n  Yet over the past few years, we have see almost geometric growth of \ncontributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of \ndollars, from individuals, corporations, and unions, and even \ncontributions from foreign sources. How is that possible, we ask.\n  Our pretty good law--setting limits on the size and source of \ncontributions--had gaping holes punched in it, the largest of which is \nthe soft money loophole. That is the loophole that allows parties to \nraise unlimited amounts of money from individuals as well as \ncorporations and unions so long as they use the money for activities \nthat don't expressly, explicitly advocate the election or defeat of a \ncandidate. That's why you have a $1.3 million contribution to the \nRepublican National Committee from just one company or a $450,000 \ncontribution from one couple to the Democratic National Committee.\n  Yet, the Supreme Court in Buckley was clearly aware of the likelihood \nof persons trying to evade the limits by giving huge sums to the \nparties to help candidates. This is apparent in the Court's discussion \nin upholding the $25,000 overall limit under current law. In describing \nthe legitimacy for the overall $25,000 limit, the Court called it ``a \nmodest restraint,'' serving to ``prevent evasion of the $1,000 \ncontribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute \nmassive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of \nunearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute \nto that candidate or huge contributions to the candidate's political \nparty.'' Those words precisely described a potential evasion of the \nintended limits on contributions to candidates by giving to parties. \nThe Court explicitly said it was constitutional to stop it. But that \nevasion of our intent is exactly what is happening today with the soft \nmoney loophole, and that is exactly what this bill will stop.\n  So the Supreme Court saw clearly the possibility of efforts to get \naround the $1,000 contribution limit per election, and it ruled in \nBuckley that Congress had properly sought to prevent that by imposing \nthe $25,000 overall cap on contributions from any individual in any \ncalendar year. What the Court did not see, and what we did not see at \nthe time, was the end run around contribution limits by using the soft \nmoney loophole.\n  The Federal Election Committee's recent figures show the tremendous \ngrowth in soft money fundraising. It reports that during the year \n2001--a nonelection year--Democratic national party committees reported \n$69 million in soft money contributions or 26 percent more than in \n1999; Republican national party committees reported $100 million in \nsoft money contributions or 68 percent more than in 1999. The FEC \nstates that soft money contributions have more than doubled for both \nnational parties since 1997. The loophole\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nhas destroyed the law. There are no effective limits.\n\n  How do the parties attract large soft money contributions? Often they \noffer access--access to decisionmakers in return for tens or hundreds \nof thousands of dollars. The parties advertise the sale of access for \nhuge sums. It's blatant. Both parties do it--openly.\n  Large contributors to the DNC got to attend one of dozens of coffees \nwith the President in the White House. Large contributors to the \nRepublican Party were entitled to have breakfast with the Republican \ncongressional leadership and lunch with the Republican Senate and House \ncommittee chairman of the contributor's choice. There are dozens and \ndozens of examples like this. The record is chock full of them, and \nshould anyone want specific examples, I refer them to the six volume \nreport in 1997 by the Governmental Affairs Committee on the state of \nour campaign finance system. That investigation collected ample \nevidence of soft money contribution of hundreds of thousands even \nmillions of dollars destroying the contribution limits in federal law \nand creating the appearance of corruption in the public's eye.\n  Look at one case that surfaced in our 1997 hearings--the case of \nRoger Tamraz, a large contributor to both parties, who became the \nbipartisan symbol for what is wrong with the current system. Roger \nTamraz served as a Republican Eagle in the 1980s during Republican \nadministration and a Democratic trustee in the 1990s during the \nDemocratic administration. Tamraz was unabashed in admitting his \npolitical contributions were made for the purpose of obtaining access \nto people in power. Tamraz showed us in stark terms the all too common \nproduct of the current campaign finance system--using unlimited soft \nmoney contributions to buy access. And despite the condemnation of \nTamraz's activities, when asked at the hearing to reflect on his \n$300,000 contribution to obtain access, Tamraz said, ``I think next \ntime. I'll give $600,000.''\n  Do these large money contributions create an appearance of improper \ninfluence by big contributors? In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court \nanswered for the American people--it found an appearance of corruption \ncreated from the size of the contribution alone without even looking at \nthe sale of access. The Court in that case upheld contribution limits \nas a reasonable and constitutional approach to deterring actual and \napparent corruption of federal elections in the Buckley case. Here is \nwhat the Court said:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary \n     purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \n     resulting from large individual financial contributions--in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private \n     financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal \n     or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from \n     others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a \n     successful campaign. To the extent that large contributions \n     are given to secure political quid pro guos from current and \n     potential office holders, the integrity of our system of \n     representative democracy is undermined. Of almost equal \n     concern is . . . the impact of the appearance of corruption \n     stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse \n     inherent in a regime of large individual financial \n     contributions. Congress could legitimately conclude that the \n     avoidance of the appearance of improper influence ``is also \n     critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative \n     government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.''\n\n  The Court went on to say:\n\n       And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary \n     purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was \n     surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a \n     partial measure and that contribution ceilings were a \n     necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality \n     or appearance of corruption inherent in a system \n     permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when \n     the identities of the contributors and the amounts of \n     their contributions are fully disclosed.\n\n  The Buckley Court repeatedly endorses the concept that contributions \nwithout limits, alone, are enough to create the appearance of \ncorruption and to justify the imposition of limits.\n  For instance, the Buckley Court said:\n\n       Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions \n     but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding \n     that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of \n     impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent \n     in the process of raising large monetary contributions be \n     eliminated.\n\n  Selling access in exchange for contributions would only take the \nCourt's concerns and justification for limits a step further.\n  What do these unlimited soft money contributions allow the parties to \ndo? They allow them to pay for ads which they claim are ads about \nissues, but in reality, they're ads clearly intended to help elect or \ndefeat candidates.\n  In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that we could put limits on \nelectioneering-type communications under specified circumstances. The \nCourt said that Congress could limit contributions for those \ncommunications that ``in express terms advocate for the election or \ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.'' In one \nof the most famous footnotes of a Supreme Court case, the Court tried \nto describe what it meant by its finding, citing what has come to be \nknown as the seven magic words and phrases: ``communications containing \n. . . words . . . such as: `vote for,' `elect,' `cast your ballot for,' \n`Smith for Congress,' `Vote against,' `defeat,' `reject.' '' So long as \nthese types of words are not used in a communication, a television ad \nfor instance, the Court held, the communication would not be subject to \ncontribution limits.\n  Over time, the parties have developed ads which avoid these types of \nwords but which by anyone's estimation are promoting the election or \ndefeat of a candidate.\n  Listen to this ad from the Republican National Committee on behalf of \nthen Presidential candidate Bob Dole.\n\n       Mr. Dole. We have a moral obligation to give our children \n     an America with the opportunity and values of the nation we \n     grew up in.\n       Voice Over. Bob Dole grew up in Russell, Kansas. From his \n     parents he learned the value of hard work, honesty and \n     responsibility. So when his country called, he answered. He \n     was seriously wounded in combat. Paralyzed, he underwent nine \n     operations.\n       Mr. Dole. I went around looking for a miracle that would \n     make me whole again.\n       Voice Over. The doctors said he'd never walk again. But \n     after 39 months, he proved them wrong.\n       A Man Named Ed. He persevered, he never gave up. He fought \n     his way back from total paralysis.\n       Voice Over. Like many Americans, his life experience and \n     values serve as a strong moral compass. The principle of work \n     to replace welfare. The principle of accountability to \n     strengthen our criminal justice system. The principle of \n     discipline to end wasteful Washington spending.\n       Mr. Dole. It all comes down to values. What you believe in. \n     What you sacrifice for. And what you stand for.\n\n  That ad was called an ``issue ad'' and paid for with the unlimited \ncontributions of soft money to the Republican National Committee. That \nis viewed as permissible under current law because that ad does not \nexplicitly ask the viewer to vote for or support Bob Dole. It just \nspends its whole time extolling him before election day. If it added \nwords at the end that say what the ad is all about, ``Vote for Bob \nDole,'' it would be treated as a candidate ad, not an issue ad, and \nwould be subject to the hard money limits; that is, it could only be \npaid for with contributions subject to limits. Any reasonable person \nwho hears that ad knows it is an ad supporting the candidacy of Bob \nDole. It is not an ad about welfare or wasteful government spending. It \nshould have to be paid for with regulated or hard money contributions. \nBut that is not the case today. It will be the case when we pass \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  The Democrats avail themselves of the same loophole. In the 1996 \nPresidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee ran ads on \nwelfare and crime and the budget which were basically designed to \nsupport President Clinton's reelection. At our hearings on the campaign \nfinance system, Harold Ickes was asked about these DNC ads and the \nextent to which the people looking at the ads would walk away with the \nmessage to vote for President Clinton. ``I would certainly hope so,'' \nhe said. ``If not, we ought to fire the ad agencies.''\n  To get around the reasonable limits of the 1974 law, parties and \ncandidates seized on the Buckley Court's seven magic words by arguing \nif any election activity was not expressly for the election or defeat \nof a candidate--that is it did not include those seven magic words--\nthen it was outside the scope of the law's limits. In a terrible irony \nthen, the Buckley case unwittingly contained the seed--the seven magic \nwords test--for undermining the law.\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\n  The McCain-Feingold bill will address the subterfuge of sham issue \nads, and does so in a clear, direct manner that will not subject it to \nconcerns of vagueness, which need to be foremost in our minds when \naddressing matters of free speech. The bill would require any radio or \ntelevision ad that refers to a clearly identified candidate that is \nbroadcast within 60 days of a general election or within 30 days of a \nprimary election to be treated as an ad seeking to influence the \noutcome of an election and therefore paid for with funds subject to \ncontribution and disclosure limits. The bill would require any national \nparty running such an ad to pay for that ad with hard money. Any \nnonparty group running such an ad that costs $10,000 or more a year \nwould have to identify itself as the sponsor of the ad, disclose the \ncost of the communication and disclose the names and addresses of its \ndonors of $1,000 or more.\n  The bill does not prohibit such ads from being aired by nonparty \ngroups with unregulated money; it only requires disclosure of the \nsponsoring group's major contributions if the group spends over $10,000 \non such ads. This is a very reasonable and modest limitation on \npolitical advocacy. It is very clear in order to withstand charges of \nambiguity. And it addresses the reality. Any reasonable person knows \nwhen seeing these sham issue ads that they are really about electing or \ndefeating the candidates named in them.\n  The research by the Brennan Center confirms that for us.\n  First, the Brennan Center found that of the 57,863 ads aired by non-\nparty groups in the final 60 days of the 2000 election where a \ncandidate was mentioned, only 331--or less than 1 percent--were genuine \nissue ads ``primarily aimed at providing information on a policy \nmatter.'' That means that 99 percent of the group-sponsored ads were in \nfact ads to promote or defeat the election of a candidate.\n  Second, the Brennan Center study found that of the ads actually run \nby candidates and paid for with hard money specifically on behalf of \ntheir election or defeat, only 9 percent used the seven magic words and \nphrases identified by the Supreme Court. That is compelling evidence \nthat the magic words identified by the Supreme Court are not a complete \ntest of what constitutes electioneering ads. More is at work here than \njust the seven magic words identified by the Supreme Court.\n  Some argue that if we only close the soft money loophole to political \nparties, the money we cut off to the parties will be redirected to \nspecial interest groups. I believe it will not happen that way because \ncandidates and public officials running for reelection and their agents \nwill not be allowed to solicit it, the parties will not be allowed to \nraise it, and the contributors will not be able to buy access to us \nwith it. This bill would prohibit a candidate or office holder from \nsoliciting soft money for private organizations running issue ads. Will \ncontributors of these large sums want to buy access to the Sierra Club \nor the National Rifle Association? Dubious. Will they be able to buy \naccess to us through these unlimited contributions to third parties? \nNo. If that were to occur, then it would be in direct violation of the \nlaw. Under this soft money ban, public officials and candidates will be \nout of the soft money fundraising business, and that's a very important \nstep we will be taking with this legislation. The official with power, \nand the candidate seeking to be in a position of power, won't be able \nto solicit huge sums of money and sell access to themselves for their \ncampaign or for outside groups.\n\n  We have been here before--trying to pass campaign finance reform, \ntrying to stop the explosion of soft money. Three years ago I asked \nthis body the question: ``Will it be different this time?'' It was not. \nBut this time the answer is it will. We are going to pass this \nlegislation, send it to the President, and respond to the vast majority \nof the American people who want it.\n  In doing so, we are hopefully going to change politics in America. No \none really knows which party in the end is going to be advantaged or \ndisadvantaged by the changes we are making to the law today. But we \nknow for certain that the body politic itself will be dramatically \nbenefitted. That is because we will be taking the solicitation of big \nmoney by people in power and people seeking power out of American \npolitics and with it will go the appearances of favoritism and \ncorruption.\n  The political landscape will change when this bill takes effect. It \nwill be filled with more people and less influence; more contributors \nand smaller contributions; more democracy and less elitism. This is a \ngood decision by Congress for the country, and we have those persistent \nand hardy souls like Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, Congressman \nMeehan, and Congressman Shays to thank, as well as inspiring citizens \nlike Granny D who walked across the country to make her case, and the \nmembers of the coalitions in each of our States, like the Michigan \nCampaign Finance Network.\n  It is not often that we get the opportunity to legislate in a way \nthat will so dramatically affect the core of how we operate. This is \nthat time, and I am privileged to have worked for this bill's passage \nand to vote to send it to the President of the United States for \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for just a \nbrief time? I do not want to encroach on Senator McConnell's right to \nspeak at this time, but will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sure Senator Feingold would be happy \nto yield a couple of minutes if he were present. So on his behalf, I \nyield 3 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased Congress is making this \neffort to reform the campaign finance laws. When the last election \nresulted in a Senate that was evenly divided between Republicans and \nDemocrats, it occurred to me there could not be a better time for the \nSenate to take up this legislation and try to write a bill that \nimproved our Federal election finance laws. It is a subject with which \nwe are all very familiar. It makes it very difficult, therefore, for \nthe Senate to work on an issue such as this.\n  We are all biased in one way or the other because of experiences we \nhave had, but my experience was, as a candidate for Congress in the \nearly 1970s, at a time when we had passed the first major reform of \nFederal election laws, that the 1972 elections were the first real test \nof the reforms. Some of the law had been ruled unconstitutional, but \nvirtually every candidate had to report, for the first time, where he \nwas getting the money he was spending in his election and how he was \nspending it. These reports had to be made to the Federal Election \nCommission. A copy had to be filed with the secretary of state in the \nState where one was a candidate.\n  As to disclosure, people had a right to know where the money was \ncoming from to support candidates, and how they were spending it, who \nthey were giving the money to, if they were giving money to people, or \nif they were buying ads. Whatever was being done with the money, it had \nto be reported.\n  What has happened over time is others have become so involved in the \nprocess--organizations, parties, other individuals, buying ads, getting \ninvolved, spending money, raising money, to influence the outcome of \nelections--the people have lost their right to know. It has been taken \naway from them by the way the law has worked in practice.\n  So this is an effort to address that in a meaningful way, to require \ndisclosure by groups that are buying ads to influence the outcome of \nelections, how they are raising their money, who is behind this.\n  When one watches a TV ad, they do not know who bought it. If a \ncandidate buys it, the people know. If a candidate for office buys an \nad in the paper, there has to be a disclaimer showing who bought it. \nEverybody in the country now is involved, but nobody knows who these \nfolks are because they use names such as the Good Government Committee.\n  The whole point is, there is a lot that needs to be changed. This \nbill is an important first step in making some changes that are long \noverdue. I am glad I was able to support the cloture motion to bring \nthe debate to a halt.\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\n We have had an opportunity to fully discuss it in the Senate. The \nHouse has taken its time for discussion. It has been a tough battle, \nbut we have produced a bill now and it is time to pass it and send it \nto the President.\n  The Court is going to have an opportunity to review it. If there are \nunconstitutional provisions, those will be struck down, and there may \nbe some in this bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it is time to pass \nthe bill because it accomplishes some actions that are long overdue and \nthat will help the election process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nremaining between now and 2 p.m. be divided between Senators Cantwell \nand Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I campaigned on the issue of \ntransforming our election process and said repeatedly I would make it a \ntop priority in the Senate. It was a tremendous experience last year to \nparticipate in the debate on this legislation and assist Senators \nMcCain and Feingold with the passage of this legislation from the \nSenate the first time. It took an extra year to get this bill through \nthe House and send it to the President, but my wait has been nothing \nlike that of the wait of the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin who \nhave endured repeated efforts through the years. I want to give them my \nheartiest congratulations for an extraordinary accomplishment that is \ntruly in the public's interest.\n  Campaign finance is at the heart of every issue we deal with in \nCongress. From energy, to health care, to gun control, to bankruptcy, \npolitical interest groups that use money to make their agenda heard all \ntoo often are larger than the public's interest in framing the debate. \nThis legislation will move the debate closer to the public.\n  This bill is about slowing the ad war. It is about calling sham issue \nads what they really are. It is about slowing political advertising and \nmaking sure the flow of negative ads by outside interest groups does \nnot continue to permeate the airwaves. Ninety-eight million dollars \nworth of these ads ran in the 2000 election by narrowly focused special \ninterest groups based out of Washington, DC. This legislation will \nchange that and again focus these debates more on the public agenda. \nThis bill also stops the unlimited flow of corporate contributions, or \nsoft money, that contributed to the volume of ad wars in the 2000 \nelection.\n  This bill forces all of us--candidates, parties, and groups that seek \nto influence the outcome of elections--to play by the same rules and \nraise and spend money in lower amounts.\n  This is a banner day for Congress. This bill is a huge step forward \nin the right direction. There is much more work that needs to be done \nin reforming our political system. I am glad this day has finally come, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this very important legislation \nthat has endured because of the hard work of two Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with a sense of pride that \nthe Congress will soon pass comprehensive campaign finance reform. It \nhas been a long time in coming, and the perseverance of Senators McCain \nand Feingold should be recognized as the reason we are here today. I \nwould especially like to thank my colleague, Senator Snowe, for all her \nhard work and leadership in developing the language in this bill, the \nso-called Snowe-Jeffords provisions, which is a full and fair solution \nto the proliferation of electioneering communications.\n  The last time Congress passed comprehensive campaign finance reform I \nwas running for the House of Representatives for the first time. That \ncampaign was waged between me and my opponent door-to-door, meeting the \nvoters, standing on the street corner talking to the voters, or \ndebating the issues at public forums. Our constituents knew who we \nwere, what we stood for, and who was saying what about whom.\n  Fast forward 28 years and today a campaign is waged on television and \nradio, many times by people and groups who the voters do not know. The \nAmericana people deserve better from their candidates and campaigns. \nThis bill, soon to be law, will make many needed changes to our \ncampaign finance system and reconnect the electorate with their \ncandidates for federal office.\n  I am especially proud of the provisions in this legislation that \nreform the law concerning broadcast advertisements near an election \nthat escape even minimal disclosure by not using the ``magic words.'' \nThese electioneering communications are cleverly and clearly seen by \nthe electorate to be trying to influence their vote, but the true \nnature of the sponsors and funding for these advertisements remain \ncloaked in the veil of secrecy. The American public deserves to know \nwho is trying to influence their vote, and the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions will provide them this necessary information.\n  We will hear from some speakers during this debate that they are \nabsolutely certain these provisions are unconstitutional and will be \nstruck down by the court. I wish I could guarantee to my colleagues \nthat these provisions will be found to be constitutional by the Supreme \nCourt, but I am not so foolhardy as to predict the outcome of any case \nbefore the Supreme Court. I can, however, assure my colleagues that we \nhave examined the important court decisions, talked to legal scholars, \nand reviewed the research on the topic to craft a provision that we \nbelieve will withstand constitutional scrutiny by the Supreme Court.\n  A recently released study on the 2000 elections by the Brennan Center \nFor Justice clearly demonstrates the need for the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions, and the care we took in crafting these clear and narrow \nrequirements. In the 2000 elections approximately $629 million was \nspent on television advertising for federal elections. This represents \nan all-time high. Even looking at the amount spent just on \nCongressional races, the $422 million spent in 2000 overwhelms the $177 \nmillion spent just 2 years earlier. That gives you an idea of what is \noccurring.\n\n  The ``magic words'' standard created by the Supreme Court in 1976 has \nbeen made useless by the political realities of modern political \nadvertising. Even in candidate advertisements, what many would say are \nclearly advertisements made to convince a voter to support a particular \ncandidate, only 10 percent of the advertisements used the ``magic \nwords.'' Parties' and groups' use of the magic words is even smaller, \nwith as few as 2 percent of their ads using the magic words. By not \nusing these ``magic words,'' these advertisements escape even the most \nbasic disclosure and keep the public in the dark about who is trying to \ninfluence their vote.\n  One of the most important findings of this comprehensive study of \ntelevision advertising during the 2000 elections is that the Snowe-\nJeffords provisions are exceptionally well crafted and not too broad. \nOf the 50,950 group issue advertisements featuring federal candidates \naired during the relevant time period, only 331 were about a genuine \nissue or bill pending before Congress. States another way, the Snowe-\nJeffords provision correctly identify 99.4 percent of the \nadvertisements as electioneering in nature and subject to the \nrestrictions of the provision. I do not know how the opponents of this \nprovision can say, faced with this empirical data, that our provision \nis too broad in nature.\n  It is important that the public know the background and facts behind \nthe Snowe-Jeffords provisions. Material on this provision can be found \nat www.senate.gov/jeffords/03202002cfr.hjml.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some additional material concerning the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Campaign Finance Reform--Fact & Fiction\n\n(Based on findings from Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the \n                        2000 Federal Elections)\n\n       1. Fiction: Shays-Meehan would cut out genuine issue \n     speech.\n       Facts:\n       Of all the group ads that would have been captured had the \n     Shays-Meehan 60-day test\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\n     been in effect in the 2000 general election, exactly three \n     unique ads, accounting for a tiny 0.6% of all spots, were \n     perceived as genuine issue advocacy.\n       In 1998, the comparable statistic was two unique ads.\n       Only 3% of all group ads perceived to be genuine issue ads \n     mention a candidate.\n       Beyond that, the Shays-Meehan test closely tracks the \n     actual prevalence of electioneering ads: 79% of \n     electioneering ads by groups are captured by the 60-day test.\n       2. Fiction: The ``magic words'' test adequately \n     distinguishes election-related speech from issue advocacy.\n       Facts:\n       Candidates, themselves, who are indisputably engaged in \n     electioneering, used magic words only 10% of the tie in 2000 \n     (4% in 1998).\n       97% of ads perceived to be electioneering did not use magic \n     words, in both 1998 and 2000.\n       All political party ads were perceived to be \n     electioneering, even though political parties use magic words \n     only 2.3% of the time. (In 1998, 95% were electioneering, but \n     only 1.2% used magic words.)\n       The magic words test is not nearly the bright line \n     adherents believe it to be: Numerous ads in 2000 were hard to \n     classify as express advocacy or not.\n       3. Fiction: Genuine issue advocacy peaks closer to an \n     election, becasue that is when voters are most attuned to the \n     issues.\n       Facts:\n       The number of genuine issue ads actually declines close to \n     the election, but electioneering spikes: about half (51%) all \n     genuine issue ads occur in the four-month period between \n     April and July, while only 19% occur in the two months before \n     an election.\n       The percentage of group-sponsored political ads that \n     mention candidates increases from 12% during the first half \n     of the calendar year, to 50% in July and August, to 61% in \n     September, to 69% during the rest of the election cycle. (The \n     comparable statistics in 1998 were 34% in the first half of \n     the year, 62% in July and August, 82% in September, and 95% \n     during the rest of the cycle.)\n       4. Fiction: Soft money is needed for party-building and \n     voter-mobilization activities.\n       Facts:\n       Only 8.5 cents of every soft money dollar is spent on \n     activities that might even remotely be considered voter \n     mobilization, while 38 cents on the dollar is spent on media \n     and issue advocacy.\n       100% of all political party ads are perceived as \n     electioneering (93% in 1998).\n       92% of all political party ads never so much as mention the \n     name of the political party (85% in 1998).\n       The political parties are spending so much money on TV ads, \n     all depicting candidates, that they actually outspent the \n     candidates themselves in the 2000 presidential election--$81 \n     million to $71 million.\n       Party spending on House races ($43 million) was targeted \n     only to competitive races--a mere 48 races in all. A third of \n     all that spending ($14 million) was reserved for six House \n     races.\n       5. Fiction: Soft money is used to enhance the prospects of \n     candidates of color.\n       Facts:\n       Less than 7% of spending by parties on advertising in \n     connection with House races went to races involving \n     candidates of color.\n       Of the 42 races in which the Democratic Party aired \n     television ads, just three involved candidates of color. None \n     of those three were among the top recipients of party \n     advertising.\n       6. Fiction: Shays-Meehan will unfairly trap unwary bit \n     players, like unsophisticated individuals and small \n     grassroots groups.\n       Facts:\n       At least 98.5% of the political advertising in 2000 was \n     sponsored by political parties, corporations, unions, and \n     major national organizations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Executive Summary of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the \n                         2000 Federal Elections\n\n\n                        summary of key findings\n\n       1. Approximately $629 million was spent on television \n     advertising by all candidates, parties, and groups in the \n     2000 federal elections. This figure represents an all-time \n     record spent on political advertising. Even when looking at \n     just congressional races, the $422 million spent in 2000 far \n     exceeds the $177 million spent on political television ads in \n     the 1998 congressional elections.\n       2. The magic words standard that some use to distinguish \n     express advocacy from issue advocacy has no relation to the \n     reality of political advertising. None of the players in \n     political advertising--candidates, parties, or groups--employ \n     magic words such as ``vote for,'' ``vote against,'' \n     ``elect,'' or anything comparable with much frequency in \n     their ads. Only 10% of candidates ads ever used magic words, \n     and as few as 2% of party and groups ads used magic words.\n       3. Special interest groups increased their expenditures of \n     political advertisements nine-fold since 1998, breaking all \n     previous records. Conservatively estimated, special interest \n     groups spent about $98 million on political television ads in \n     2000--more than 58% of that spending went for electioneering \n     issue ads.\n       4. Parties made record-breaking use of issue advocacy in \n     the 2000 elections. In addition to spending more on \n     television advertising relative to the presidential general \n     election than the candidates themselves, political parties \n     primarily aired issue ads rather than ads using magic words \n     in order to sidestep federal campaign finance laws limiting \n     the amounts and sources of contributions.\n       5. All of the so-called party issue ads, bar none, were \n     electioneering in nature. None of these party ads qualified \n     as genuine issue ads. The proportion of party ads that were \n     positive in tone dropped since 1998, from 28% to 24%.\n       6. Genuine issue advocacy by groups is overwhelmed in the \n     final 60 days of an election and is replaced by \n     electioneering issue ads. Approximately 86% of group-\n     sponsored issue ads aired within 60 days of the 2000 general \n     election were electioneering issue ads rather than genuine \n     issue ads.\n       7. A legislative proposal (the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment) to \n     establish a test for express advocacy based on whether an ad \n     identifies a candidate within 60 days of the general election \n     would be a substantial improvement over the magic words test. \n     If the Snowe-Jeffords 60-day bright-line test had been in \n     place in 2000, only a fraction (less than 1%) of ads subject \n     to financial disclosure would have been genuine issue ads.\n       Preserving the integrity of the American campaign finance \n     system requires constant vigilance. Each election cycle \n     brings new innovations in campaign finance evasion as \n     parties, candidates and groups strive to bend the system to \n     their benefit. At times the existing rules and regulations \n     seem more like fiction than fact, and new reforms at the \n     federal level seem doomed before they are even proposed. \n     However, public opinion has started to catch up with those \n     who have for years taken advantage of the system in the \n     pursuit of electoral success. Regardless of refined legal or \n     policy distinctions in types of advertisements, the public is \n     keenly aware that most political ads are indeed \n     electioneering ads and that the political players are side-\n     stepping federal campaign finance laws. The legal community \n     has begun to catch up, recognizing the futility of the magic \n     words test and taking steps to draft a more sophisticated \n     standard for regulating electioneering. Political scientists, \n     too, have drafted new laws and have responded to the dearth \n     of information about the nature and scope of electioneering \n     issue ads by conducting studies to shed light on this once-\n     secretive tool.\n       Combining the insights from these three communities adds to \n     the likelihood that public policy will emerge that is \n     grounded in common sense, legal expertise, and scholarship. \n     The shared effort of citizens, lawyers, and political \n     scientists working hand-in-hand with legislators creates room \n     for optimism about a system few deny is in dire need of \n     repair.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventy-nine and a half minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield myself whatever time I may \nconsume within that time period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I begin by citing the ultimate \ncampaign reform: The first amendment to our Constitution. It says \nCongress shall make no law--no law--abridging freedom of speech or of \nthe press. I refer to freedom of the press because it is the robust \nexercise of that freedom which has brought us today to assault the \nfreedom of speech. Over the past 5 years, the New York Times and the \nWashington Post have joined forces to publish an editorial an average \nof every 5\\1/2\\ days on campaign finance reform.\n  To buy that editorial space in the New York Times or the Washington \nPost, it would cost $36,000 and $8,000, respectively, for each \neditorial. Multiply that amount by the number of editorials of each \npaper, and it equals a total value of $8 million in unregulated soft \nmoney advertising that frequently mentions Federal candidates. Of \ncourse, that type of corporate, big media, soft money expenditure will \nnot be regulated in this new law.\n  Why is the press, the institution that has unlimited free speech, so \ninterested in restricting the speech of everyone else? Let's take a \ncloser look. The unconstitutional issue ad restrictions in this bill \npurport to limit advertising within proximity to an election. However, \nit does not, interestingly enough, apply to newspaper ads. So the \nalready powerful corporations that control the news--and, in many \ninstances, the public policy--in America will get more power and more \nmoney under this new law. One has to wonder why that blatant conflict \nof interest has not been more thoroughly discussed in a debate about \nthe appearance of such conflicts.\n\n  Outside groups such as Common Cause have devoted many years and \nmillions of dollars to lobbying this\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\nissue in the House and in the Senate. Why not? Their fundraising will \nexplode if this bill passes. They no longer have to compete with party \ncommittees for soft dollars. Shays-Meehan permits every Member of the \nHouse and the Senate to raise soft money for these outside groups.\n  The bill we are about to pass allows Members of the House and Senate \nto raise soft money for these outside groups. I am told this unlimited, \nundisclosed, unregulated soft dollar fundraising has, in fact, already \nbegun.\n  Although the facts about the provisions of this bill are almost \nalways misrepresented, the driving mantra behind the entire movement is \nthat we are all corrupt or that we appear to be corrupt.\n  We have explored corruption and the appearance of corporation before \nin this Chamber. You cannot have corruption unless someone is corrupt. \nAt no time has any Member of either body offered evidence of even the \nslightest hint of corruption by any Member of either body. As for the \nappearance of corruption, our friends in the media who are part and \nparcel of the reform industry continue to make broad and baseless \naccusations.\n  It has been reported that the reform industry spent $73 million from \n1997 to 1999 on this issue. Of course, that was all soft money. These \nare all soft dollar expenditures used to fuel negative perceptions of \nFederal officeholders and candidates. Scandal, or perceived scandal, \nsells papers and gets viewers. In the nonstop competition to be the \nnext Woodward and Bernstein, the reform industry relentlessly works to \nraise questions in our minds.\n  In short, I believe the appearance of corruption is whatever the New \nYork Times says it is. Add to that, cash-strapped, scandal-hungry \nnewspapers and unlimited foundation donations to the reform industry, \nand you are in full-scale corruption mode. The actual facts are rarely \nrelevant.\n  I request that these two articles documenting the hypocritical \nactions of the reform industry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the National Review, Feb. 12, 2000]\n\n                       The Campaign-Finance Smear\n\n                            (By Rich Lowry)\n\n       No one has done more to create an ``appearance'' of \n     corruption in politics than campaign-finance reformers.\n       A typical complaint of campaign-finance reformers is that \n     politics is too negative and dishonest.\n       One might expect therefore that advocates of reform would \n     feel some obligation not to be so negative in the way they \n     depict politicians, or at the very least to be truthful when \n     they do decide to ``go negative'' against political \n     opponents.\n       Alas, no one has done more to create an ``appearance'' of \n     corruption in politics than campaign-finance reformers who \n     ignore or distort facts to make reckless charges of \n     corruption.\n       Consider The American Prospect, which has a heavy-breathing \n     editorial in its most recent issue decrying how corporations \n     have supposedly stolen away our democracy.\n       ``By buying politicians,'' The American Prospect writes of \n     Enron, ``a favored corporation promoting a new kind of scam \n     simply purchased immunity from regulatory oversight.''\n       Note that there is no ``seems,'' or ``appears,'' in this \n     sentence. It is an outright assertion of bribery, in the \n     cause of promoting corporate fraud.\n       Given the gravity of this charge, it would be nice if there \n     were some evidence for it.\n       What the Prospect offers is Wendy Gramm, who ``as chief \n     commodities regulator under Bush I, slipped in a midnight \n     rule-change after the 1992 election to exempt Enron's trades \n     from oversight.''\n       ``She was rewarded,'' according to the Prospect, ``with a \n     seat on the Enron board and hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     in income.''\n       Sounds pretty sinister. Except the Prospect conveniently \n     neglects to spell out what exactly was involved in this \n     ``Enron exemption.''\n       Actually, it wasn't an Enron-specific matter but a ruling \n     that affected a whole new class of trades--nine other \n     companies lobbied for it--that was coming to the fore in the \n     early 1990s.\n       Here's USA Today (apparently a more nuanced and \n     sophisticated source than the Prospect) on the rule: \n     ``Despite the appearance of a trade-off, even Gramm's critics \n     concede that the commission's ruling was a smart move. The \n     energy derivatives market was growing rapidly, and there were \n     worries that without an exemption, the Chicago Board of Trade \n     might sue anyone selling an energy derivative outside of its \n     centralized market.''\n       I frankly don't know enough about derivatives to say with \n     any assurance whether the Gramm ruling was a mistake or not, \n     but it's obviously a subject of dispute. So, before \n     condemning Wendy Gramm for her venal motives, it would be \n     nice to hear some arguments about why she was wrong.\n       The Prospect offers none.\n       Maybe the Prospect thinks that the Chicago Board of Trade, \n     which opposed this move, was right. But wouldn't Gramm then \n     have simply been doing the bidding of another moneybags \n     interest out to protect its business, the Chicago Board of \n     Trade?\n       This is why the campaign-finance reformers, on their own \n     terms, can always win the argument--there are well-heeled \n     interests on all sides of most disputes in Washington, so \n     someone can always be portrayed as selling out to some \n     interest or other.\n       But the Prospect's treatment of Wendy Gramm is almost \n     responsible compared to the way it smears her husband: ``When \n     Enron needed another favor in 2000, her husband, Sen. Phil \n     Gramm of Texas, got yet another regulation waived.''\n       As far as I can tell, this is a regurgitated charge that \n     Ramesh Ponnuru has already dissected on NRO: ``Public Citizen \n     had Gramm `muscling through' the offending provision. In \n     fact, Gramm had almost nothing to do with it.\n       ``He didn't write it: It came to the Senate from the House, \n     where it was part of a bill that passed by a large margin. He \n     didn't usher it through the Senate: It was considered by the \n     Agriculture Committee, of which he was not a member, rather \n     than the Banking Committee, which he chaired. Indeed, Gramm \n     blocked the bill that included the provision for several \n     months because he objected to other provisions. He did, \n     however, eventually vote for the bill, like most congressmen. \n     It included the offending provision, which had hardly been \n     altered during the legislative process.''\n       So, what's so amazing about the Prospect smear is that it's \n     a discredited one. The Washington Post, the Philadelphia \n     Inquirer, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution have already \n     run corrections for repeating this charge.\n       I called American Prospect editor Robert Kuttner to try to \n     ask him if he's going to do the same. He didn't return my \n     call. But it will be interesting to see if the Prospect, \n     which makes such a fuss in its editorial about ``corporate \n     accountability,'' cares as much about journalistic \n     accountability. [Ed. note--someone from the Prospect has e-\n     mailed saying that they will correct this.]\n       All this really amounts to what campaign-finance reformers \n     call ``mud slinging.'' That's why I can't understand why \n     McCainiacs and other campaign-finance reformers say they want \n     to raise the level of public discourse, when they so \n     relentlessly run it down by imputing corrupt motives to \n     everyone in Washington.\n       In the case the Prospect, however, this isn't quite \n     accurate--it wants to impute nasty motives not to everyone, \n     but to conservatives in particular.\n       ``The ideology of deregulation,'' it writes, ``provided \n     cover for the cronyism.''\n       This is rather extraordinary, to say in effect that a whole \n     way of looking at the world--a viewpoint based on philosophy \n     and ideas--is really only a cover for corruption. Not only is \n     this a stilted, cynical, and false charge, it is \n     ideologically loaded.\n       Nowhere in its editorial does the Prospect excoriate the \n     Clinton administration for signing the Kyoto treaty, \n     something that meant a lot to Enron. That's because \n     regulation is presumed to be public spirited, even if an evil \n     corporation is pushing for it.\n       Part of the liberal motive for campaign-finance reform is \n     clearly to try to systematically prevent American companies \n     from protecting themselves from government regulation. It \n     will be a corruption-free world, in short, only when liberals \n     get everything they want.\n       Until then, smear away.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Review, Mar. 11, 2002]\n\n                       The Gaggers and Gag-Making\n\n\n            hyprocrisy among the campaign-finance reformers\n\n                         (By Bradley A. Smith)\n\n       It's a common scene in Washington. Lobbyists representing \n     powerful, well-financed special interests sit behind closed \n     doors with members of Congress drafting legislation. Outside \n     Washington, their dollars finance TV ad campaigns in the \n     districts of wavering House members, hoping to pressure them \n     into supporting the bill. Highly technical and complex \n     legislation is then unveiled in the middle of the night, and \n     most members of Congress have no time to read it before \n     debate begins the next morning. Efforts by grassroots groups \n     to amend the bill to protect their members are rebuffed, and \n     though the bill contains provisions that even its sponsors \n     admit are probably unconstitutional, such objections are \n     shunted aside.\n       You may think this is a description of a special interest \n     trying to benefit from some arcane budget bill, but in fact \n     it is a description of the Shays-Meehan campaign-finance-\n     regulation bill that passed the House in the wee hours of \n     February 14. The passage of Shays-Meehan shows that those who \n     think campaign-finance reform will reduce the influence of \n     money in politics are mistaken.\n       Supporters of campaign-finance regulation like to portray \n     themselves as an underfunded, scrappy grassroots coalition. \n     However, a study conducted last year for the\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\n     American Conservative Union by election-law attorney Cleta \n     Mitchell found that groups dedicated to promoting campaign-\n     finance reform spent over $73 million over the three-year \n     period from 1997 through 1999. By comparison, the Center for \n     Responsive Politics (CRP), one of the most prominent \n     campaign-finance-reform organizations, lists total political \n     spending by the ``mortgage banking'' industry at under $12 \n     million, and by ``Health Services and HMOs'' at under $14 \n     million, for the four-year period from 1997 through 2000. \n     Even the dreaded drug manufacturers contributed just $28 \n     million over that four-year period, or 40 percent of that \n     spent in just three years by groups promoting campaign-\n     finance regulation. Yet the campaign-finance regulators \n     always portray these industries as colossally and harmfully \n     big spenders.\n       Actually, Cleta Mitchell's study understates the spending \n     by campaign-finance-reform groups. It does not include \n     spending by many of the groups' affiliated 501(c)(4) \n     committees, and misses some significant groups completely. To \n     give just one example, it does not include spending by the \n     National Voting Rights Institute (NVRI), which describes \n     itself as ``a prominent legal and public education center in \n     the campaign finance reform field.'' NVRI, which argues that \n     private campaign contributions violate the Constitution, is \n     frequently quoted in the New York Times and other major \n     papers. Meanwhile, the CRP overstates industry giving, as it \n     includes in its figures individual contributions by any \n     person employed by a company in the industry, and in certain \n     cases even contributions by the employee's spouse. Thus, if \n     the non-working spouse of an Enron employee earning $45,000 a \n     year gave $200 to the campaign of George W. Bush, the CRP \n     reports that as both an ``Enron'' contribution and a \n     contribution from the ``energy/natural resources'' industry.\n       Arguably, money is the only thing that has kept the issue \n     of campaign-finance regulation alive. With public-opinion \n     polls consistently showing that campaign-finance reform is of \n     little interest to the public, most of the groups advocating \n     reform rely on six- and even seven-figure grants from giant \n     foundations such as Ford, Carnegie, and Joyce for funds. With \n     the notable exception of Common Cause (which has a budget of \n     about $10 million a year), these groups usually have a few \n     individual supporters. Such individual support as they do \n     have comes almost entirely in the form of large gifts from a \n     handful of politically liberal multi-millionaires, such as \n     George Soros and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steven Kirsch.\n       These groups respond that their money does not represent \n     ``special interests.'' But their scorekeeping belies this \n     claim. Surely if a $200 contribution by the wife of a mid-\n     level Enron employee is ``special interest'' money, so are \n     the six-figure expenditures made to promote campaign-finance \n     reform by investment banker Jerome Kohlberg. Similarly, the \n     Pew Charitable Trusts, to take just one example, have given \n     considerably more in grants to advocate campaign-finance \n     regulation than Enron gave in soft money to advocate energy \n     deregulation. And these foundations and groups have other \n     interests that are advanced by silencing their opposition. \n     Pew, for example, also advocates environmental regulation and \n     funds Planned Parenthood. If it can quiet political \n     opposition from business and National Right to Life, it \n     benefits. While one might describe foundations such as Pew, \n     or organizations such as CRP, as disinterested entities \n     concerned with the public welfare, one might just as \n     accurately describe them as unaccountable organizations with \n     lots of money and no members. Even Common Cause, the one \n     reform group with a membership base, is small fry compared \n     with other groups. With some 200,000 members, it describes \n     itself as a ``citizen's lobbying organization.'' But it \n     describes the National Rifle Association, which has over 4.2 \n     million members, as a ``special interest.'' Indeed, many \n     corporations represent hundreds of thousands or even millions \n     of individual shareholders and employees. Why aren't they \n     ``citizen lobbies''?\n\n\n                     cynical campaign, cynical town\n\n       Pro-reform organizations have used their massive war chests \n     to run one of the most cynical campaigns in the history of \n     cynical Washington. Even though corporations and unions are \n     prohibited from making contributions directly to candidates, \n     a casual observer looking at CRP's website without reading \n     the fine print would conclude that the largest direct \n     contributors to every member of Congress are corporations and \n     unions. This is because of the center's practice of \n     attributing contributions by individuals to their employers. \n     Another trick, in an apparent effort to inflate the \n     perception of corporate influence, is to lump together \n     contributions made over many years. Thus, organizations such \n     as Common Cause and the CRP routinely issue press releases \n     and studies showing huge corporate contributions, significant \n     portions of which occurred as much as a decade ago. In some \n     cases, more than half the Congress has turned over in the \n     intervening years. Yet another misleading tactic is to lump \n     together all contributions by ``industries.'' So a 1997 \n     Common Cause report on the influence of the ``broadcast \n     industry'' listed total contributions from the ``industry'' \n     over a ten-year period. No allowance was made for the fact \n     that many of the contributions went to individuals no \n     longer--or perhaps never--in Congress or for the fact that \n     the ``broadcast industry'' is hardly monolithic: Affiliates \n     often quarrel with networks, networks with one another, radio \n     with television, and so on. The reform organizations also \n     frustrate any sense of perspective. In the current frenzy \n     over Enron, for example, it is not mentioned that Enron's \n     total soft-money contributions constitute a minuscule \n     fraction of 1 percent of total soft money raised over the \n     period cited.\n       Meanwhile, virtually every legislative action can be and is \n     portrayed as a sellout or payback to some ``special \n     interest.'' So if Enron got a favorable regulatory ruling \n     over opposition from the Chicago Board of Trade, it was a \n     payback to Enron. But since the Board of Trade is also a \n     powerful interest, any ruling the other way would not have \n     been portrayed as a victory for principle or a defeat for \n     Enron, but as a payback to the Board of Trade. All roads lead \n     to corruption. That politicians might actually be acting on \n     convictions or keeping campaign promises is given no \n     credence. Few have worked harder to convince the American \n     people that their representatives are corrupt, and their \n     votes and participation meaningless, than the campaign-\n     finance reformers. That they have done so on the flimsiest of \n     evidence only adds to the shame.\n       The Enron scandal, which pushed Shays-Meehan over the top, \n     is a perfect example. Reformers gleefully argued that the \n     Enron bankruptcy proved that Shays-Meehan was necessary, with \n     no evidence that Shays-Meehan could have prevented it. Even \n     Rep. Shays admitted that Enron is going to have access ``by \n     the fact of who it is and what it does'' (its money aside). \n     Reform advocates misleadingly claim that over 250 members of \n     Congress have received ``Enron'' contributions, when in fact \n     they mean that those members have received contributions from \n     people who worked for or owned stock in Enron. They do not \n     mention that Shays-Meehan does not limit these contributions, \n     and in fact raises the ceiling on them.\n       Then too, Shays-Meehan was supported down the homestretch \n     by a television ``issue advertising'' campaign funded by the \n     Campaign for America (CFA), a creation of Jerome Kohlberg. \n     These ads ran in the congressional districts of wavering \n     congressmen. In addition, CFA operated phone banks in 30 \n     congressional districts. This campaign was paid for with \n     unregulated soft money. In a classic example of ``free speech \n     for me but not for thee,'' most of that spending would remain \n     legal under Shays-Meehan.\n       However, the heart of the operation to pass Shays-Meehan \n     was not grassroots lobbying, but old-fashioned Washington \n     lobbying. Though supporters had been pushing the bill since \n     the 107th Congress first met in January 2001, and though the \n     sponsors had been gathering signatures on a discharge \n     petition to force the bill to the floor since July, they \n     still spent the evening before the opening of the House \n     debate, and part of the day on which the bill was being \n     debated, redrafting the legislation. According to press \n     reports, pro-reform lobbyists, including former McCain 2000 \n     counsel Trevor Porter, Democracy 21's Fred Wertheimer, and \n     Don Simon of Common Cause, drafted key portions of the bill, \n     at times working out of offices in the Capitol. The final \n     version of the complex, 86-page bill was unveiled a few \n     minutes before midnight.\n       The bill, as it emerged from this redraft, included a \n     highly technical provision allowing parties to pay off hard-\n     money debts incurred before the 2002 elections (hard money \n     being limited contributions from individuals and PACs, which \n     may be used for any purpose) with soft money (unlimited \n     contributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy \n     individuals, which normally cannot be used to expressly \n     advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates). The \n     provision favored Democrats, who have plenty of soft money \n     but are short on hard money. Republican operatives cried foul \n     and charged that the provision was an intentional effort to \n     benefit the Democrats. The more likely explanation is that it \n     was simply an error caused by the haste of last-minute \n     drafting. But imagine the outcry these same ``reform'' groups \n     would have raised had lobbyists for any other interest helped \n     draft a bill, and accidentally included a technical error \n     beneficial to the bill's primary supporters in Congress. \n     Would the reformers have given the drafters the benefit of a \n     doubt? Never. The error briefly jeopardized the bill and drew \n     a veto threat from the White House, before supporters used a \n     parliamentary maneuver to change the language before the \n     final vote.\n\n\n                         WHERE THE FAT CATS SIT\n\n       Assuming it becomes law, the bill will not end the \n     influence of money in politics, but instead will drive such \n     influence further underground. A glimpse of the future may \n     have occurred at a dinner last October that raised $800,000 \n     for the Brennan Center, a pro-reform group. Co-chaired by \n     pro-reform senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer, and \n     featuring Sen. John McCain, the dinner was underwritten by \n     corporate donors, who were solicited to attend. Sponsors \n     included over two dozen large law firms with Washington \n     lobbying practices, plus such corporations as Coca-Cola, \n     Philip Morris, and, naturally, Enron. If money is truly \n     corrupting, corporations hoping to curry favor with \n     officeholders might decide that support for such groups is a \n     wise idea, or officeholders might ``suggest'' that \n     corporations with business before their committees make \n     donations to such groups. Shays-Meehan limits the right of \n     federal officeholders to solicit money for\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\n     political parties and other groups, but specifically allows \n     lawmakers to continue to solicit funds for entities such as \n     the Brennan Center.\n       Beyond that, the bill will probably strengthen special \n     interests, benefit incumbents, and harm grassroots politics. \n     The limits on soft-money contributions mean that corporations \n     and unions may be pressured to do more independent spending \n     to help their legislative allies. This will give these \n     interests more control over the process, and will reduce the \n     historical role of parties in brokering diverse and often \n     competing interests. The limits on issue ads in the 60 days \n     before an election will mean that such ads will run earlier, \n     making campaigns longer and putting a greater premium on \n     early fundraising. This will benefit incumbents, even as it \n     requires them to spend more time raising funds. True \n     grassroots politics--spontaneous political activity by \n     individuals and groups--suffers from regulation and has been \n     on the decline ever since the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     was first passed in 1971. The added complexity of this bill \n     will probably kill off such activity altogether. Indeed, \n     Federal Election Commission chairman Davis Mason says that \n     the incredible complexity of the bill is likely to lead to \n     ``invidious enforcement, singling out disfavored groups or \n     causes'' and ``subjecting regulated groups to harassment by \n     political opponents.''\n       However, the giant foundations that have financed the drive \n     for reform will remain untouched. So will the recipients of \n     their largesse, such as Democracy 21 and the Center for \n     Responsive Politics, and the lobbyists of Common Cause. Big-\n     business lobbyists also emerge unscathed--indeed, \n     corporations may devote more resources to lobbying. But \n     groups that rely less on lobbying and more on campaign \n     support to candidates, grassroots organizing, and issue ads \n     to rally public support will suffer.\n       But that, too, is a common Washington story.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With no basis in fact or reality, the media \nconsistently and repeatedly alleges that our every decision can be \ntraced back to money given to support a political party. I trust that \nevery Member in the Chamber recognizes how completely absurd, false, \nand insulting these charges are. We have been derelict in refuting \nthese baseless allegations. I doubt we will ever see a headline that \nsays 99 percent of Congress has never been under an ethics cloud. That \nis a headline we simply will not see.\n  Each Member is elected to represent our constituents. We act in what \nwe believe is the best interest of the country and, obviously, of our \nhome States. Does representing the interests of our State and our \nconstituents lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption? These \nallegations are not an attack on us, they are an attack on \nrepresentative democracy.\n  What we are talking about today is speech: the Government telling \npeople how, when, and how much speech they are allowed. This wholesale \nregulation of every action of every American anytime there is a Federal \nelection is truly unprecedented.\n  The courts have consistently upheld the free speech rights of \nindividuals and of parties. Even in the most recent case of Colorado \nII, the Court made clear that parties are not to be treated any worse \nthan any other organization in the protection of constitutional rights. \nThis legislation falls far short of that charge. The Shays-Meehan bill \nweaves a bizarre web of restrictions and prohibitions around parties \nand candidates while simultaneously strengthening the power of outside \ngroups and the corporations that own newspapers.\n  This legislation is remarkable in its scope. Indeed, this legislation \nseeks no less than a fundamental reworking of the American political \nsystem. Our Nation's two-party system has for centuries brought \nstructure and order to our electoral process. This legislation seeks, \nquite literally, to eliminate any prominence for the role of political \nparties in American elections. This legislation favors special \ninterests over parties and favors some special interests over other \nspecial interests. It treads on the associational rights of groups by \ncompelling them to disclose their membership lists to a greater extent \nthan ever before contemplated. It hampers the ability of national and \nState parties to support State and local candidates. It places new \nlimits on the political parties' ability to make independent and \ncoordinated expenditures supporting their candidates.\n\n  Many of these provisions are directly contrary to existing Supreme \nCourt precedent.\n  Let me repeat that. Many of the provisions in this bill that is about \nto pass the Senate are directly contrary to existing Supreme Court \ndecisions.\n  Equally remarkable is the patchwork manner in which this legislation \nachieves its virtual elimination of political parties from the \nelectoral process. It seeks to achieve a pernicious goal via a \nhaphazard means, and the real loser under this legislation is the \nAmerican voter, who no longer can rely on the support of a major \npolitical party as an indicia of what that candidate stands for.\n  So let me walk you through how this legislation will affect all of \nus. First, let's look at the national parties. Shays-Meehan will \neliminate nearly 50 percent of the fundraising receipts of the national \nparties. National parties will be forced to conduct their wide array of \nFederal and State party activities with only half the revenue. Shays-\nMeehan will eliminate 90 percent of the cash on hand of the national \nparties. If Shays-Meehan were law in 2001, the total cash on hand for \nall six national party committees would have dropped from $66 million \nto $6 million.\n  Let's go over that one more time. If Shays-Meehan had been in effect \nlast year, the total cash on hand for the six national party committees \nwould have dropped from $66 million down to $6 million: For the three \nnational Republican committees it would drop from $56 million down to \n$19 million; and for the three national Democratic Party committees, \nfrom $10 million down to a debt of $13 million.\n  So, on this chart behind me, you can see on the reality of what \nShays-Meehan does. You can see that for the national party committees \nlast year, the year 2001, their actual cash, both hard and soft. You \ncan also see what kind of cash on hand they would have under Shays-\nMeehan with the soft money eliminated.\n  You see the Republican National Committee would have gone from $34 \nmillion down to $16 million; the Democratic National Committee from $2 \nmillion down to a $10 million debt; the National Republican Senatorial \nCommittee from $12 million down to $7.5 million, the Democratic \nSenatorial Committee from $4.1 million down to a debt of $50,000, the \nRepublican Congressional Committee from $9.6 million to a debt of $4.3 \nmillion, and the Democratic Congressional Committee from $3.5 million \ndown to a debt of $3 million.\n  What does that all mean? That means this bill eviscerates the \nnational party committees. It singles out six national committees out \nof all the committees that may exist in America and takes away a huge \npercentage of their receipts. By eliminating so-called soft money, or \nnon-Federal money, national party support for State parties and local \ncandidates will be dramatically reduced if not entirely eliminated in \nthe next cycle.\n  The national Republican Party committees gave $130 million to State \nparties and $13 million to State and local candidates in soft money in \nthe last cycle, the 2000 cycle. The national Democratic Party \ncommittees gave $150 million to State parties--more than the national \nRepublican Party committees did--$150 million to State parties and $6 \nmillion to State and local candidates in non-Federal money. Where will \nall the soft money go? Where will it all go?\n  It is going to go to outside groups. We, the Members of the Congress, \nwill be able to raise it for them. The soft money will also go to the \nnewspapers because they can sell advertising in proximity to the \nelection when no one else can.\n  Let's go over that one more time. We are taking this money away from \nthe parties, shifting it to outside groups, and restricting their \nability to spend it on advertising in any media, except newspapers. No \nwonder the newspapers are for this bill. This is a great deal for them. \nNot only are they unregulated in their speech--and they should be, I \ndefend their right to have unregulated speech--but their business \nmanagers are going to be pretty excited about this bill as well. It is \ngoing to be a windfall for them.\n  Let's take a look at coordinated versus independent expenditures \nunder this bill. Shays-Meehan significantly limits party support of \nFederal candidates as well. We just talked about the impact on the \nState and local level, but Shays-Meehan also significantly limits party \nsupport of Federal candidates, people such as us. Under this\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\nbill, parties are prohibited from engaging in both independent and \ncoordinated party expenditures after a candidate has been nominated. \nThe bill treats all party committees, from State and local to the \nnational party, as a single committee. So let's take a look at how this \nworks.\n  If the Atlantic City Republican Party makes a $500 independent \nexpenditure on behalf of a Senate candidate in New Jersey, the party is \nthen prohibited from making a permissible $900,000 coordinated party \nexpenditure in New Jersey. If you are scratching your head wondering \nabout this, let's go over it one more time.\n  The Atlantic City Republican Party in New Jersey makes a $500 \nindependent expenditure on behalf of a U.S. Senate candidate in New \nJersey. Then the national party committee is prohibited from spending \nthe permissible $900,000 coordinated that we have been allowed to do \nfor a quarter of a century.\n  The impact is even more severe for Presidential candidates. If a \nlocal party anywhere in America makes a $300 independent expenditure on \nbehalf of a Presidential candidate, the nominee of that party will lose \nthe entire party coordinated expenditure--roughly $13.7 million in \n2000. Remember, even though the Presidential race is usually publicly \nfunded after the convention, there is an amount of money that both \nnational parties are able to spend on behalf of the Presidential \ncandidate after the convention.\n  In 2004, the Democratic and Republican Presidential nominees are \ngoing to have to police every local committee in America. It is a big \ncountry, 50 States, incredible number of municipalities and party \ncommittees up and down the system. If any one of them makes a $300 \nindependent expenditure on behalf of the Presidential candidate, then \nthe candidate loses $13.7 million.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent time in New \nHampshire lately. There are a number of aspiring Presidential \ncandidates over there on the Democratic side. They ought to read this \nprovision very carefully because, if they get the nomination, some \nerrant Democratic local chairman somewhere in America who decides to go \nout and be helpful--or maybe to be mischievous if he is not in favor of \nthe nominee--and makes an independent expenditure of $300, he could \ncost the nominee close to $14 million in coordinated expenditures in \nthe general election.\n  This is fraught with the potential for mischief. One thing we know \nabout politics, if mischief is possible, mischief will occur. I think \nwe can stipulate that.\n  Now let us look at what Shays-Meehan does to party conventions.\n  Shays-Meehan will end national party conventions as we have known \nthem. The soft money ban covers the committees that are created to host \nthese grand events. In 2000, the Federal convention grant from the \nTreasury of the United States was $14 million for each major party. \nThat is also about the same amount that was spent on security alone at \neach of the conventions. The rest of the money needed to put on the two \nconventions came in soft dollars. All of that will be gone.\n  Looking at the conventions in 2004, if you are chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, or the Republican National Committee, \nyou will be confronted with a very difficult decision: Do you want to \nput on a 4 day convention with 80 percent less funding? Or do you want \nto spend hard dollars that would otherwise be used to help elect the \nPresident to pay for the convention? All the soft money that you used \nto put on the convention the last time is now gone.\n  Come to think of it, maybe a middle-size town like my hometown, \nLouisville, might qualify to hold a convention. That would probably be \na short convention with very few people at it. Louisville could make a \npitch for both the Democratic and Republican Conventions in 2004. The \nparties will be able to spend only $15 million. It will probably only \nlast for a day or two. There might be fewer people there. We could \nprobably handle that in our hotels. It is always a bit of a stretch to \nput all the people up in hotels during Kentucky Derby time of the year. \nBut we might be able to work that out. This could be a windfall for \ncities of roughly a million across America.\n  But do we really want to skinny down the conventions, or eliminate \nthe conventions? I know a lot of our colleagues don't particularly like \ngoing to them. It is a nonstop event from morning until night. But if \nyou are a precinct worker out in Oregon and have worked in the party \ntrenches over the years and you get to be a delegate, it is a big deal. \nIt is something you will remember the rest of your life. It is the only \nopportunity you will ever have to meet the county chairmen from some \ncounty in South Carolina on the other side of the country. It is the \none time every 4 years that we have truly national parties where \nRepublicans and Democrats from all over the country come together to \nnominate their candidate for President. Even though there has not been \nany suspense at the conventions for a long time, I can tell you the \ndelegates who come to the Republican Convention--and I believe the \ndelegates that go to the Democratic Convention--think it is a wonderful \nopportunity to participate in something that is important for America. \nUnfortunately, we may have seen the end of the conventions as we know \nthem because this bill takes away about 80 percent of the funding of \nthe national conventions.\n  In case you think that national conventions might be run through \nState parties, Shays-Meehan also closes that option by allowing the use \nof soft money only for State, district, or local political conventions. \nPerhaps the outside groups will step in and fill the gap. We will be \nable to raise money for them, or maybe even the unrestricted media will \nsomehow find a way to fill the gap.\n  Now, what will be the effect of this new legislation on Federal \nofficeholders and candidates? Shays-Meehan federalizes our every action \nand our every conversation. The big losers under this bill are State \nand local candidates and our State parties. Under Shays-Meehan, we can \nonly raise money for State and local candidates within the hard money \nlimits and restrictions, which is $2,000 per election.\n\n  Let me explain to my colleagues how that will work. In 39 States, \nstatewide candidates are currently allowed to receive more than $2,000 \nper election, and some of them allow corporate contributions to \ncandidates.\n  For example, the individual contribution limit in Wisconsin for a \nGovernor's race is $10,000 per election. But Federal officeholders and \ncandidates will only be able to raise $2,000 per election for the \nGovernor's race. This bill federalizes our involvement in State and \nlocal races as well.\n  In Virginia, under state law, there are no contribution limits or \nrestrictions for State and local candidates. But under this bill, \nFederal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $2,000 \nper election for statewide candidates.\n  Again, in Virginia--which allows unlimited individual corporate and \nunion contributions directly to candidates with full disclosure--if \nSenator Warner or Senator Allen wanted to be involved in the Governor's \nrace over there, they would be in a difficult position going to a \nfundraiser that they didn't sponsor, because it would have to be \nlimited to $2,000 contributions for the candidate.\n  This bill federalizes the involvement of Senators and Congressmen in \nState and local races by making our rules apply to them no matter what \nthe State law is. Under Shays-Meehan, we can only raise soft dollars \nfor State parties within the hard dollar limits and restrictions, and \n$10,000 from individuals. But 40 States allow State parties to receive \nmore than $10,000 per year. Some of them even allow corporate \ncontributions to State parties.\n  For example, in Arizona, there is no limit on the amount an \nindividual can contribute to a State party's State account. Federal \nofficeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $10,000 per \nyear for that State account, even though that is not Arizona State law.\n  In Illinois, there are no contribution limits or restrictions on \ncontributions to a State party's State account.\n  But Federal officeholders and candidates who are involved in raising \nmoney for the State party State account in Illinois will only be able \nto raise $10,000 per year no matter what the Illinois law is.\n  But have no fear, my colleagues. The House has provided us with an \nalternative. We may not be able to do it for\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nState parties except within the Federal regulations, but we can raise \nunlimited soft money from any source for outside groups so long as \ntheir primary purpose is not voter registration, voter identification, \nget out the vote, and generic campaign activity. Make sure the group's \nprimary purpose is issue advocacy, and then raise as much as you can \nfrom anyone you can. Don't worry. It will never be disclosed.\n  The perverse effect of this is that we can do a lot more for an \noutside group than we can do for our own State party in our home State. \nUnder this bill, if you fancy voter registration, voter identification, \nget out the vote, and generic campaign activity, you can raise $20,000 \nper year from individuals from any outside group specifically for those \nactivities. All that money is soft money.\n  Let us go over it one more time.\n  If a Federal officeholder wants to raise money for a State party, \nFederal rules apply. But if a Federal officeholder wants to raise money \nfor an outside group, its wide open. So there won't be any less soft \nmoney raised around here. My prediction is there will be more soft \nmoney around. It will just be raised for outside groups rather than for \nthe party.\n  Let us take a look at the effect on State and local parties. State \nand local party operations are impacted dramatically by Shays-Meehan. \nThis bill eliminates the national parties as a source of non-Federal \nsupport for their State activities. But it also heavily restricts how \nthey operate.\n  Last year, we addressed in a limited way the problem of this bill \nfederalizing generic voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. \nThe so-called Levin amendment was adopted by a voice vote in the Senate \nto incorporate that change.\n  However, the House has placed such extensive restrictions on the \nfundraising and spending by State parties for voter activities that the \nso-called Levin provision is now virtually meaningless. State parties \nwill be forced to use only hard-dollar, Federal dollars, to benefit \nState and local candidates.\n\n  Shays-Meehan prohibits party transfers, joint fundraising, \nfundraising by us for the State account, and also prohibits State \nparties from broadcasting generic, ``Vote Republican,'' or ``Register \nDemocrat'' messages.\n  Not only are we the big losers under the House scheme, but State and \nlocal candidates who run in Federal election years suffer as well. \nState and local candidates who are running in Federal election years--\nthat happens all the time, all the time, all across America. The big \nwinners, yet again, are the outside groups and, of course, the news \nmedia.\n  As for hard-dollar contributions to State parties, Shays-Meehan \nactually lowers the total amount of hard money that an individual can \ncontribute during a 2-year election cycle to State parties. Shays-\nMeehan creates a $37,500 per-cycle annual aggregate sub-limit that \nindividuals can contribute to State parties. Under current law, if an \nindividual were so inclined, he could give $50,000 per cycle in hard \ndollars to State parties. So we are actually going backward, and this \nis at a time when State parties are forced to do much more with much \nless.\n  Let's look at the effect on State and local candidates. National \nparties will be extremely limited in their ability to not only make \ncontributions to State and local candidates, but also to promote issues \nof State and local importance in conducting voter drives. Members of \nCongress are similarly restricted in what assistance we can provide the \nState and local candidates.\n  Shays-Meehan even regulates the conduct of State and local \ncandidates--from fundraising to advertising. State and local candidates \nwill be forced to burn campaign funds to retain lawyers to guide them \nthrough the myriad State, and now Federal, regulations on their State \nand local campaigns.\n  Now, let's take a look at the outside groups and compare the outside \ngroups to the national party committees.\n  Make no mistake about it, soft money will exist, and it will thrive \nunder Shays-Meehan everywhere, except at the party committees.\n  Here are a few short examples: Corporations, labor unions, and \noutside groups will continue to use 100-percent soft money to run issue \nads. We have no idea how much they spend because corporations and labor \nunions do not disclose these details about their soft money. But, \nnational parties will be forced to use 100-percent hard dollars. \nCorporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use \nsoft money to raise the hard money for their PACs.\n  Let me repeat that. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups \nwill continue to use soft money to raise the hard money for their \npolitical action committees. But national parties will be forced to use \n100-percent hard money because there will no longer be any soft money \nfor the parties to raise hard money.\n  As we all know, direct mail has high overhead, very high overhead. \nThe national party committees will not only have to build their \nbuildings with hard dollars, and put on their conventions with hard \ndollars, they will also have to do their direct mail fundraising with \n100-percent hard dollars. But corporations, labor unions, and outside \ngroups will use 100-percent soft dollars, even to raise hard money for \ntheir political action committees. Corporations, labor unions, and \noutside groups will even continue to use soft money for activities such \nas voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\n  According to news reports, the AFL-CIO plans to raise dues 60 percent \nto fund their $35 million effort this year. Again, we have no idea how \nmuch soft money the unions spend because they do not disclose it. \nNational parties will have to use all hard dollars to do the very same \nthing that corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will be able \nto spend 100-percent soft dollars doing.\n  Stand-alone PACs, such as EMILY's List, for example, will continue to \nraise and spend a mix of hard and soft money, but not national parties. \nThey will only be able to raise and spend hard dollars.\n  What about us Members? Members will still be allowed to maintain \nleadership PACs--that is good--and even have a soft dollar account for \nthose PACs. So Members of Congress will be able to have leadership PACs \nthat raise both hard and soft dollars. But national parties will only \nbe able to raise and spend hard dollars.\n  The bottom line is this bill does not take money out of politics, it \njust takes the parties out of politics.\n  Now let's look at issue ad restrictions. The Shays-Meehan issue ad \nprovision muzzles political speech based solely upon the timing of the \nspeech. A person or a group must report to the Government whenever they \nmention the name of a candidate in any broadcast, cable, or satellite \ncommunication within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general \nelection. Corporations and labor unions are totally censored during \nthat period. The censorship extends to nonprofit corporations such as \nthe Sierra Club and the NAACP on the left, and the National Right to \nLife Committee and the NRA on the right.\n  Let me use a recent example of how this provision will work. Just \nthis past week, within 30 days of the primary, the American Civil \nLiberties Union ran two issue advertisements in Illinois. One was a \nbroadcast radio ad, the other was a newspaper ad.\n  If this legislation is passed today, the radio ad falls within the \nissue ad prohibitions and restrictions, so it could not be run, \nhowever, the newspaper ad is not affected. So in the following ad--run \njust this past week by the ACLU in Illinois--on the radio, the female \nannouncer said:\n\n       [We're] waiting for our Congressman, Dennis Hastert, to \n     protect everyone from discrimination on the job.\n       As Speaker of the House, Representative Hastert has the \n     power to stop the delays and bring the Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act--ENDA--up for a vote in Congress. It's \n     about fairness. It's time to ensure equal rights for all who \n     work, including lesbians and gay men, and make sure that it's \n     the quality of our work that counts, and nothing else.\n\n  And later in the ad, the male announcer says:\n\n       Protecting workers from discrimination, or more delays?\n\n  And the female announcer says:\n\n       Take action now. Send Speaker Hastert a letter urging him \n     to support fairness and bring ENDA to the floor. . . .\n\n  That is the radio ad. Under Shays-Meehan, it cannot be run.\n  But alas, a newspaper ad, under this bill, could be run.\n  The newspaper ad says:\n\n       Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Hastert \n     has the power to stop the\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\n     delays and bring the Employment Non-Discrimination Act--\n     ENDA--up. . . .\n\n  And on and on.\n  It is exactly the same as the radio ad. So under Shays-Meehan, if \nyour ad is on the radio, you cannot run it; if your ad is in the \nnewspaper, you are OK.\n  This kind of arbitrary and capricious stifling of political speech is \nthe essence of the issue ad restrictions in this bill. Both \nadvertisements are issue speech. Both advertisements ran at the same \ntime. However, only one advertisement invokes the jurisdiction of a \nnewly created speech police.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an ACLU press release be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nACLU Double Play: New Ad Blasts Workplace Discrimination Against Gays, \n              Shows Flaws in Campaign Finance Legislation\n\n       Washington.--In a move that both showcases the problem of \n     workplace discrimination in America and the constitutional \n     flaws of campaign finance legislation, the American Civil \n     Liberties Union today began running a series of radio and \n     newspapers issue ads that would be outlawed under a campaign \n     finance bill likely to soon become law.\n       The advertisements are running in the Chicago media market \n     and urge Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who represents \n     a suburban Chicago district, to use his position to bring the \n     Employment Non-Discrimination Act to a full vote in the \n     House.\n       ``This is a dramatic double play,'' said Laura W. Murphy, \n     Director of the ACLU's Washington National Office. ``Not only \n     have we highlighted the urgency of making employment non-\n     discrimination a top priority in Congress, but the ads also \n     demonstrate in practice how campaign finance legislation will \n     effectively gag political speech.''\n       The ACLU has long advocated a system of public financing as \n     a means of increasing access to the political process without \n     impinging on protected political speech. The ACLU's ad, which \n     Murphy argued is both completely non-partisan and politically \n     essential, is a perfect example of the beneficial political \n     speech that would be silenced by the Shays-Meehan bill that \n     the Senate is expected to take up on Monday.\n       The ads, because they are being broadcast during a 30-day \n     window before a primary election, would be forbidden if the \n     Senate passes and President Bush signs the Shays-Meehan bill. \n     The ACLU has long been a vigorous opponent of the measure and \n     its Senate counterpart, the McCain-Feingold bill, because \n     they would curb political speech.\n       ``Ironically, our radio ads would be outlawed by the \n     bill,'' Murphy said, ``but our virtually identical newspaper \n     ads that are running on Monday would continue to be \n     acceptable.''\n       The ACLU said that passage of ENDA would guarantee that \n     individuals could not be discriminated against in the \n     workplace based on their real or perceived sexual \n     orientation. The ads urge listeners and readers to visit the \n     ACLU's website--http://www.aclu.org/ENDA_where they can \n     learn more about the provisions of ENDA and send a free fax \n     to Speaker Hastert urging action in the House on the proposed \n     legislation.\n       ``It's important to remember that the ACLU would not be the \n     only group impacted by the new law,'' Murphy said. ``This ad \n     could just as easily be something from the NRA, Common Cause \n     or the Right to Life Committee. The censorship in Shays-\n     Meehan wouldn't be discriminating.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reformers apparently are not concerned by the fact \nthat this provision flies in the face of more than a quarter of a \ncentury of court decisions striking down such attempts to restrict \nissue speech. The FEC will be the speech police to track these ads, \nsomething that will prove nearly impossible to enforce in a \nPresidential election year when there will be only a couple of months \nwithout censorship somewhere.\n  Remember, in a Presidential election year, the primaries are going on \nat different times beginning in Iowa and going through the season. \nSince this bill cracks down on issue speech within 30 days of a \nprimary, somewhere in America you will be within 30 days of a primary \nwhen you are running for President. So the blackout period will be in \neffect somewhere virtually throughout the entire year.\n  For those who dare to speak within the 30- to 60-day window--30 days \nbefore the primary or 60 days before the general election--they will \nhave to report to the FEC. However, unlike every political committee \nregistered with the FEC, the regulated speakers will only have to \nreport receipts of $1,000 or more, not $200 or more as is required of \nother committees. Therefore, very few donations will end up being \ndisclosed.\n  Conveniently for the Washington Post and the New York Times, the \nrestriction and disclosure provisions apply only to broadcast ads and \nnot to print ads. So, once again, we have sort of a capricious \nselection of preferred media--restrictions on the broadcast media but \nno restrictions on the print media. No wonder the newspapers are so \nenthusiastic about this legislation, not just on the editorial page but \nover in the business department. The newspaper business managers all \nacross America are cheering for this bill.\n  By focusing only on broadcast media, this restriction allows unions \nto continue their efforts with unregulated and undisclosed soft money. \nThe breadth of this provision may also restrict communications via the \nInternet and other high-tech modes of communication which are satellite \nbased.\n  There are loopholes, of course, for outside groups. Reformers claim \nthis bill will increase disclosure and shine the light on big money in \npolitics. This is, of course, not true. Unions will continue to funnel \nhundreds of millions of dollars of hard-working union member dues into \nthe political process without ever disclosing one red cent.\n  Last spring during the Senate debate, in a moment of rank hypocrisy, \nthe Senate voted to reject a provision that simply required \ncorporations and unions to disclose all of their political activities, \njust their political activities. It was voted down in the Senate.\n  Interestingly, the AFL-CIO just voted to increase, by 60 percent, the \nmandatory contributions collected by the unions from their members. \nThese are mandatory contributions--these are not voluntary. In fact, in \nincreasing the mandatory contributions, the unions eliminated all \nvoluntary contributions.\n  In the 2000 cycle alone, unions contributed $83 million to political \ncampaigns--that we know about. We will never know how many hundreds of \nmillions of dollars the unions spent on many of their political \nactivities because it is never reported. This bill does nothing to \naddress that problem.\n  I submit two articles for printing in the Record. One is entitled \n``The Organized Labor Loophole,'' and the other is entitled ``AFL-CIO \nTo Boost Mandatory Donations.'' I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 16, 2002]\n\n                      The Organized Labor Loophole\n\n       For several years, there has been much hysteria about how \n     soft money has corrupted the political process. Democrats, \n     self-serving media organizations and Sen. John McCain (the \n     Keating Five-tainted presidential aspirant whose campaign was \n     trounced by George W. Bush) have been shedding crocodile \n     tears over soft money. As it happens, during the 1999-2000 \n     electoral cycle, each of the two major political parties \n     raised about $250 million in soft money from corporations, \n     unions and individuals. Every dime of those evenly divided \n     soft-money donations was publicly disclosed. Any interested \n     voter was free to make his own informed judgment about the \n     source and the size of the soft-money contributions the \n     parties received.\n       The real scandal involving soft money, however, relates to \n     the fact that labor unions have been laundering the dues of \n     their members through their union treasuries and into the \n     coffers of the Democratic Party. This, despite the fact that \n     voter-exit polls have revealed that nearly 40 percent of \n     union workers and members of their households have voted for \n     the Republican presidential candidate since 1980. Yet, even \n     this scandal pales in comparison to the hundreds of millions \n     of dollars in indirect and in-kind contributions that labor \n     unions routinely make on behalf of the Democratic Party. \n     These sorts of contributions are, of course, never disclosed. \n     Indeed, labor economist Leo Troy of Rutgers University has \n     testified before Congress that unions regularly spend and \n     estimated $500 million during each two-year cycle to elect \n     Democrats. Yet, only a relatively small portion of these \n     funds--specifically, the soft-money donations and the \n     contributions from political action committees (PACs)--are \n     disclosed.\n       The audacious operations of the National Education \n     Association (NEA) demonstrate precisely how scandalous \n     labor's gambit has been. As the Landmark Legal Foundation has \n     meticulously documented in several complaints filed with the \n     IRS and the Federal Election Commission, the nonprofit, tax-\n     exempt NEA has literally spent tens of millions of dollars \n     since 1994 on political operations. Each year, however, \n     according to Form 990 that is required by the IRS, the \n     Washington-based NEA claims that not a dime of its resources \n     is expended on political matters. Since at least 1994, Form \n     990's line 81a, where the NEA is required to ``[e]nter the \n     amount of political expenditures, direct or indirect,'' has \n     been blank. Anyone who reviews Landmark's complaints, which \n     are\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n     available on its web site (landmarklegal.org), can appreciate \n     how staggering the NEA's annual violations truly are.\n       While Landmark has concentrated on the NEA's national \n     affiliate, the Heritage Foundation has attempted to review \n     Form 990s filed with the IRS by teachers unions representing \n     the 100 largest, public-school districts and the 50 \n     representing them at the state level. These included \n     affiliates of both the NEA and the American Federation of \n     Teachers (AFT), the other major teachers union.\n       By law, these NEA and AFT affiliates are required to \n     provide copies of their most recently filed Form 990s to \n     anyone requesting them. In fact, many affiliates refused \n     Heritage's request. Nevertheless, apart from the \n     contributions by their PACs, only two of the 63 Form 990s \n     examined by Heritage reported any ``political expenditures, \n     direct or indirect'' on line 81a. (National Education of New \n     York and the Hawaii State Teachers Association reported \n     ``direct or indirect'' political expenditures of $69,272 and \n     $136,285, respectively--political spending, if Landmark's \n     review of the NEA's national affiliate is any guide, that is \n     probably drastically understated.) Equally revealing was the \n     fact that those forms showed average-annual-dues income \n     exceeding $4.1 million, while expenditures for collective \n     bargaining--a union's principal purpose--averaged a mere \n     $103,000.\n       Once Senate Republicans cast the deciding, filibuster-proof \n     votes to ban soft money, which, in practice, Republicans have \n     used to balance the ``under-the-radar'' political spending by \n     labor unions on behalf of Democrats, those GOP senators will \n     have nakedly exposed themselves to the loophole-smashing \n     tactics of a labor-Democratic cabal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 27, 2002]\n\n AFL-CIO to Boost Mandatory Donations, Hopes to Spend $35M on November \n                               Elections\n\n                           (By Sue Kirchhoff)\n\n       New Orleans.--John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president, said \n     yesterday labor leaders plan about a 60 percent increase in \n     mandatory contributions for political activities in order to \n     help the organization meet its goal of pouring $35 million \n     into get-out-the-vote and advertising efforts before the \n     November elections.\n       The proposal, which faces a final vote in May, was one in a \n     series of efforts by the AFL-CIO executive council, meeting \n     in New Orleans, to regroup in the face of a recession that \n     has hit workers hard. There are splits among unions over \n     specific issues, such as an energy bill now moving through \n     the Senate, and unease that labor has won few victories \n     despite its enormous financial support of Democrats.\n       New figures released yesterday showed an increase in union \n     membership in 2001, but the gains were nowhere near the goal \n     of recruiting a million workers a year. The AFL-CIO \n     membership rose by about 326,000 to 13.25 million. Most of \n     the increase, however, was due to affiliation with existing \n     unions. The AFL-CIO, which has consolidated some offices, \n     said it would shift dozens of workers to political activities \n     and union organizing. Union leaders approved an economic \n     agenda that focuses on health care, retirement security, and \n     jobs, and made it clear that a candidate's willingness to \n     actively support union organizing efforts would be a key \n     factor in endorsements and financial support.\n       ``We will advance an economic agenda for working families. \n     If we don't do it, no one will,'' said Sweeney, attacking the \n     Bush administration for what he called ``shameful'' \n     insensitivity toward workers.\n       But labor's antagonism toward the White House does not \n     extend to all Republicans. Asked at a news conference whether \n     his goal was to elect a Democratic Congress, Sweeney said \n     carefully, ``It's fair to say that we want a House that's \n     controlled by supporters of the working-family agenda.'' He \n     said moderate Republicans had been willing to work with \n     unions.\n       Other union leaders emphasized their desire to focus on \n     issues, not party orientation. Union efforts are expected to \n     overwhelmingly favor Democrats, but more Republicans may get \n     support than in the past. With 36 governors races this year, \n     unions plan to focus more of their effort on state \n     activities.\n       ``They're [Democrats] getting nervous as we talk about \n     being issue-driven because no one likes to compete,'' said \n     Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees \n     International Union, the nation's largest. His group has \n     weathered criticism for supporting, among other issues, a \n     health proposal by New York's Republican governor, George \n     Pataki.\n       Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, who was received ``politely'' \n     during private meetings, underscored White House efforts to \n     make inroads with select unions, such as the Teamsters, which \n     has split with Democrats to support a Republican plan to \n     drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. As the Senate \n     opens debate on the energy bill, autoworkers say they are \n     also worried about proposals to increase fuel-efficiency \n     standards.\n       ``I'm very much committed to fostering a good working \n     relationship with labor, but that has to be a two-way \n     street,'' Chao said. She promised the unions she would \n     carefully review a new lawsuit against the poultry industry \n     over ergonomics. The suit was announced yesterday.\n       Currently, the AFL-CIO funds political activities through a \n     6.5-cents-per-month assessment on workers and voluntary \n     contributions from member unions. Under the proposal, the \n     mandatory assessment would increase to 10.5 cents, but the \n     voluntary fund-raising would stop. The change, which would \n     take effect in July, would contribute $3.5 million of the \n     forecast $35 million for this election cycle. That total \n     includes $12 million, however, that has already been spent on \n     political activities. Union officials said there was fund-\n     raising fatigue and the desire to have more stable funding.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's take a look at the media. One of the largest \nloopholes in this bill is reserved for the media. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of George Will's February 25 column from \nNewsweek and his March 10 column from the Washington Post be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Feb. 25, 2002]\n\n                     Virtue at Last! (In November)\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Presidential Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, pioneering new \n     frontiers of fatuity, says some parts of the Shays-Meehan \n     campaign-finance bill please his boss and others do not. \n     ``But ultimately the process is moving forward, and the \n     president is pleased.'' Ultimately, in Washington, the \n     celebration of ``process'' signals the abandonment of \n     principle.\n       President Bush's abandonment of his has earned him at least \n     $61 million (see below) and the approval of The New York \n     Times. It praises his ``positive role'' and gives him \n     ``considerable credit'' for the passage of the bill, which \n     has received so much supportive editorializing from the \n     Times, in news stories and editorials, that it should be \n     called Shays-Meehan-Times.\n       What pleased the Times is that Bush did next to nothing to \n     discourage--in fact Fleischer issued a statement that \n     encouraged--passage of a bill chock-full of provisions that \n     Bush, who swore an oath to defend the Constitution, has said \n     violate the First Amendment. Two years ago he affirmed this \n     principle expressed by Supreme Court Justice Clearance \n     Thomas: ``There is no constitutionally significant \n     distinction between campaign contributions and expenditures. \n     Both forms of speech are central to the First Amendment.'' \n     When asked about the principle that it is hostile to First \n     Amendment values to limit individuals' participation in \n     politics by limiting their right to contribute, he said, ``I \n     agree.'' Asked if he thinks a president has a duty to judge \n     the constitutionality of bills and veto those he considers \n     unconstitutional, he replied: ``I do.''\n       Now he seems ready to sign Shays-Meehan-Times. Why? Could \n     it have something to do with the fact that the bill raises \n     from $1,000 to $2,000 the limit on individuals's \n     contributions to House, Senate and presidential candidates? \n     Candidate Bush got $1,000 contributions from 61,000 people. \n     If he can get just that many to give $2,000--for a sitting \n     president, that should be a piece of cake--the bill that he \n     says ``makes the system better'' will be worth an extra $61 \n     million to him in 2004.\n       The ardent-for-reform Washington Post--the bill should have \n     been called Shays-Meehan-Times-Post--baldly asserts (talk \n     about the triumph of hope over experience) that the bill \n     ``will slow the spiral of big-money fundraising.'' Actually, \n     the 2003-04 election cycle probably will see the normal \n     increase in political spending. The difference will be that \n     in the next cycle much more of the political giving will be \n     more difficult to trace. The soft money that Shays-Meehan-\n     Times-Post bans--contributions to parties--must be reported. \n     Henceforth much of that money will go to independent groups \n     that will not have to report the source of the money that \n     finances their issue advertising.\n       One of the bill's incumbent-protection measures says that a \n     candidate whose opponent is very wealthy can receive \n     contributions larger than $2,000. But the Supreme Court has \n     held that the only constitutional justification for limiting \n     political contributions is to prevent corruption or the \n     appearance thereof. So this bill claims, in effect, that the \n     appearance of corruption from a large contribution varies \n     with the size of one's opponent's wallet.\n       Another incumbent-convenience provision makes it much more \n     difficult for independent groups--labor unions, corporations, \n     nonprofit entities (individuals are another matter; see next \n     paragraph)--to run ads that so much as mention a House, \n     Senate or presidential candidate within 30 days of a primary \n     or 60 days of a general election--if effect, after Labor Day.\n       In the name of protecting regular people from rich people, \n     the bill has this effect: A millionaire can write a check for \n     $1 million and run a political ad that the National Rifle \n     Association or the Sierra Club could not run using $1 \n     contributions from 1 million individuals.\n       Most representatives who voted for the bill probably do not \n     know half of what is in it. They cannot know. No one will \n     know until there have been years of litigation about Federal \n     Election Commission regulations issued to ``clarify'' things. \n     What, for example, if meant by ``coordination''? Consider.\n       There are dollar limits on contributions to candidates, but \n     not on spending for political\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\n     advocacy by independent individuals or groups--unless they \n     are coordinated with the candidate. In that case they are \n     counted as contributions to the candidate, and thus limited. \n     The bill says coordination includes ``any general or \n     particular understanding'' between such an individual or \n     group and a candidate. If proper law gives due notice of what \n     is and is not permitted, this is not the rule of law.\n       Opinion polls invariably show negligible public interest in \n     campaign-finance reform, but almost every congressional \n     district has at least one newspaper hot for reform. Media \n     cheerleading for the bill has been relentless. For example, \n     NBC's Katie Couric, advocating passage of what should be \n     called the Shays-Meehan-Times-Post-Couric bill, wondered \n     whether Enron's collapse would make ``people say, `Enough is \n     enough! This has got to happen!' '' The media know that their \n     power increases as more and more restrictions are imposed on \n     everyone else's ability to participate in political advocacy.\n       The bill repeals the politicians' entitlement to buy \n     advertising at the lowest rate stations charge any buyer. \n     This will mean hundreds of millions of dollars of extra \n     revenue for broadcasters. Is this a reward for the media's \n     support? Is there an appearance of corruption here? Never \n     mind. But note this. Repeal of the entitlement is another \n     gift from incumbents to themselves. Challengers usually have \n     less money, so they will be most hurt by higher ad rates.\n       The bill's authors say soft money is (a) scandalous and (b) \n     not to be tampered with until after they have re-elected \n     themselves. That is, they refused to ban soft money until \n     they have spent all that their parties have raised and will \n     frenetically raise until November. It is going to be that \n     kind of year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2002]\n\n                        A Matter of Appearances\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       The New York Times and The Washington Post are guilty of \n     corruption. To be precise, they probably are guilty only of \n     the appearance of corruption, as they define it. But as they \n     so frequently tell us, the appearance of corruption is the \n     equal of actual corruption as a justification for campaign \n     finance reform, for which they have tirelessly campaigned.\n       The Supreme Court has said that preventing corruption or \n     the appearance of it is the only constitutional justification \n     for limits on political contributions, most of which finance \n     the dissemination of political speech. So advocates of the \n     House-passed Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill and of \n     its close cousin, the Senate-passed McCain-Feingold bill, \n     pretend (we shall come in a moment to what they are really \n     doing) that their aim is merely to prevent corruption and--\n     this is more important because it is more ubiquitous--the \n     appearance of it.\n       Well. Shays-Meehan, which the Senate will accept as a \n     replacement for McCain-Feingold, no longer contains a \n     provision that is in McCain-Feingold that would have \n     strengthened the requirement that television stations sell \n     time to candidates at the low rates the stations charge their \n     best customers. The House dropped this provision from the \n     bill.\n       Broadcasters lobbied hard for this action, which will be \n     worth many millions of dollars to television stations. But \n     that probably was not the primary reason the House did it. \n     Nor was the reason just gratitude for the media's \n     cheerleading for Shays-Meehan. Rather, the House probably did \n     it primarily to help incumbents: Challengers usually have \n     less money and hence are hurt more by high broadcasting \n     rates.\n       However, our concern is not with the motives of the House \n     in removing the provision, but with the appearance the \n     removal creates regarding two passionate advocates of Shays-\n     Meehan. The New York Times Co. owns eight network-affiliated \n     television stations, and The Washington Post Co. owns six \n     such stations. Shays-Meehan is potentially a windfall for \n     both companies. Gracious.\n       The Times and The Post incessantly instruct their readers \n     that the appearance of corruption exists when someone who has \n     benefited an elected official with a campaign contribution \n     then benefits from something the official does. But \n     contributions are not the only, or even the most important, \n     benefits that can be conferred upon elected officials. The \n     support by powerful newspapers for a political official's \n     legislation can be much more valuable to the politician than \n     the maximum permissible monetary contribution ($2,000 under \n     current law, $4,000 after Shays-Meehan becomes law) to his \n     campaign.\n       It probably would be unfair to ascribe the Times' and The \n     Post's support for Shays-Meehan to corruption. But it would \n     be no more unfair than are the Times, The Post and other \n     reform advocates in routinely impugning the motives of \n     politicians who are conservative (or liberal) and hence \n     support particular conservative (or liberal) policies \n     after, but not because, they have received contributions \n     from people who support those policies.\n       Stil, the appearance of corruption on the part of the Times \n     and Post, which are exquisitely sensitive about (other \n     people's) appearances, is compounded by this fact: The media, \n     which comprise the only intense constituency for campaign \n     finance reform, advocate expanded government regulation of \n     all political advocacy except that done by the media.\n       Many reformers' ostensible concern about the appearance of \n     corruption is just for appearances. The politicians' real \n     concern is to silence their critics. Recently John McCain \n     gave the game away.\n       He was discussing the bill's provision that puts severe--\n     for many groups, insuperable--impediments on any group \n     wanting to run a broadcast ad that so much as refers to a \n     candidate within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general \n     election. He said: ``What we're trying to do is stop''--note \n     that word--``organizations like the so-called Club for Growth \n     that came into Arizona in a primary, spent hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars in attack ads. We had no idea who they \n     were, where their money came from.''\n       McCain's attack was recklessly untruthful. He knows \n     perfectly well what the club is--a mostly Republican group \n     formed to support fiscal conservatives. The only ad the club \n     ran--a radio ad--contained not a word of attack: It was an \n     entirely positive endorsement of a candidate's views, and it \n     did not mention or even refer to anyone else. All \n     contributions to the club over $200 are disclosed.\n       But on one matter McCain, who wishes he could criminalize \n     negative ads, was candid. He--like the Times and Post--is \n     trying to stop others from enjoying rights they now enjoy.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Shays-Meehan restricts the free speech rights of \nindividuals, parties and groups, but not the media. The issue ad \nrestrictions are so onerous that many individuals and groups will \nchoose not to speak. But, of course, the media will still be free to \nspeak their mind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Pete du Pont, former \nGovernor of Delaware, entitled ``Just A Gag? Congress Prepares To \nRepeal Freedom Of Speech,'' be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 13, 2002]\n\n                              Just a Gag?\n\n                           (By Pete Du Pont)\n\n       The anti-First Amendment crowd is at work in Washington \n     this week, attempting to limit political speech during \n     election campaigns. Their vehicle is the Shays-Meehan \n     campaign-finance bill, and their goal is to drive the money \n     out of politics--even if it requires driving free speech out \n     of political campaigns.\n       Rep. Harold Ford (D., Tenn.) wondered on television last \n     summer why ``any organization regardless [of whether] they \n     are Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, [should] \n     be allowed to come in and influence the outcome of elections \n     solely to advance some narrow interest of theirs.''\n       Why should they be allowed? Because the First Amendment \n     says it's their right. Because the framers of the \n     Constitution believed, as James Madison and Alexander \n     Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 51, that the civil rights \n     of citizens in the new republic depended on the voices of \n     many interests being heard. And because if only candidates \n     and the establishment media are allowed to speak in the 60 \n     days before an election--which is the intent and effect of \n     the Shays-Meehan bill--ordinary people will be all but \n     voiceless and powerless in the crucial period during an \n     election.\n       No doubt members of Congress think that is a good idea, \n     because it is much easier to get re-elected if your opponent \n     lacks the resources to mount an effective campaign. What \n     elected official wants groups interested in some issue \n     mucking about in his voting record and being able to air what \n     they find in prime time?\n       But the question under debate is whether people of similar \n     beliefs--be they anti-death-penalty liberals or pro-life \n     conservatives, unions or corporations or nonprofits--may pool \n     their resources to increase their political impact by talking \n     on television about issues and candidates in the 60 days (the \n     only days that really count) before an election.\n       Shays-Meehan says no; journalists can talk on television or \n     radio, but others interested in an issue cannot. But the \n     First Amendment is very clear that our opinions as citizens \n     and the opinions of the press are equally protected. \n     (``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech, or of the press.'') And so was the U.S. Supreme Court \n     in Buckley v. Valeo, the definitive and unanimous 1976 \n     campaign-regulation decision: ``The concept that the \n     government may restrict the speech of some elements in our \n     society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is \n     wholly foreign to the First Amendment.''\n       What Shays-Meehan (and its Senate counterpart, McCain-\n     Feingold) does is restrict the speech of challengers and \n     enhance the speech of incumbents; it restricts the speech of \n     citizens and thus enhances the speech of the media on issues \n     they care about.\n       In an earlier column, I discussed some of the difficulties \n     of political speech bans. But consider the actual effect of \n     McCain-Feingold: Planned Parenthood and People for the \n     American Way, the National Rifle Association and Americans \n     for Tax Reform, your local Stop the Highway or Cut Property \n     Taxes Committee--all of them among Rep. Ford's ``narrow \n     interest'' organizations--would be forbidden to use their \n     resources to\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n     run ``electioneering communications'' after Labor Day in an \n     election year. But every newspaper and television station in \n     your town and state could still support or denigrate every \n     candidate every day. Why would any sensible person vote to \n     limit the speech of individuals and organizations but not \n     that of the media, which have as many opinions and biases as \n     each of us does?\n       When McCain-Feingold was before the Senate last March, 40 \n     senators voted for Sen. Fritz Hollings's proposed \n     constitutional amendment that would exclude campaign speech \n     from the protection of the First Amendment. As wrongheaded as \n     it is, it is at least honest. Shays-Meehan's supporters \n     propose to achieve the same result by stealth, for they know \n     full well that a constitutional amendment has no chance of \n     passing.\n       It is hard to imagine anything worse for the republic than \n     to have campaign speech regulated, supervised, watched, \n     controlled and authorized or prohibited by an agency of the \n     national government. Our Founding Fathers carefully wrote the \n     right to express our views on the issues of the day into the \n     Constitution, and we should make sure it is not written out.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Many of Shays-Meehan's restrictions on political \ndiscussion by outside groups only apply to discussions in the broadcast \nmedia--not in the print media. If you happen to own a newspaper, or \nhappen to be a newspaper, then these restrictions do not apply.\n  It is no mystery why the New York Times and the Washington Post have \njoined forces to run an editorial in favor of campaign finance reform \nonce every 5\\1/2\\ days for the last 5 years. More than once a week, \nevery week, for the last 5 years. The newspapers are huge winners under \nthis bill--they have a blatant conflict of interest--which I don't \nrecall reading about on any of their editorial pages. Nor do I recall \nseeing any news stories in their papers about their blatant conflict of \ninterest and what big winners they are financially as a result of the \npassage of this bill.\n  Let's take a look at fundraising for outside groups. The largest \nloophole for outside groups is that we in Congress can raise soft money \nfor them. This huge loophole was literally added at the 11th hour over \nin the House in order to secure enough support for this bill so that it \nwould pass in the House of Representatives. This bill shuts off money \nto political parties but turns the spigot wide open on contributions to \noutside interests.\n  What the reformers don't tell you is that the soft money contributed \nto the national parties was already fully disclosed. Our friends up in \nthe press gallery and the American public knows how much soft money the \nparties received. It has been disclosed for years. But for some reason, \nthe reformers believe a system of raising undisclosed soft money for \noutside groups is better; it is better to allow Members of Congress to \nraise undisclosed soft money for outside groups than to allow Members \nof Congress to raise disclosed soft money for political parties. If you \ncan make any sense of that, give me a ring sometime.\n  The parties will be replaced by an underground network of outside \ngroups for whom we can raise unlimited, undisclosed sums of soft money. \nLet me be clear: There are numerous groups for whom Members can raise \nunlimited, undisclosed corporate and union soft money. Let me give you \nsome names: Common Cause, the Sierra Club, the NAACP, NARAL, and NOW. \nThis is a great day for them, a banner day for them.\n  Now there are other loopholes in Shays-Meehan for specific outside \ngroups. Let's take a look at Indian tribes. In the 2000 cycle, Indian \ntribes contributed almost $3 million to Federal political campaigns. \nThey used their general treasury for contributions, independent \nexpenditures, and to run issue ads. This bill does not cover any of \ntheir activities.\n  A recent article from Fox News concluded that Indian tribes could \nsoon contribute more money than any other interest group in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Natives Slip Through Big Loophole in Campaign Finance\n\n                            (By Katie Cobb)\n\n       Los Angeles.--Native American groups, or sovereign tribes \n     that live alongside other U.S. citizens but are subject to \n     several exemptions from U.S. tax and other laws, are getting \n     another break in the campaign finance reform law meant to \n     reduce the impact of special interests on political \n     campaigns.\n       ``They are basically just reaching into the till that is \n     full of business and gambling money and writing checks to \n     politicians and political parties,'' said Jan Baran, an \n     elections law attorney.\n       While most special interest groups will lose their ability \n     to donate soft money and are limited to low caps on direct \n     contributions if and when the campaign finance bill is \n     enacted, tribes which participate in the $5 billion a year \n     Indian gaming industry will not be subject to the same rules.\n       An existing rule by the Federal Elections Commission \n     already exempted tribes from the same contribution limits \n     that apply to other Americans. But lawmakers, who had an \n     opportunity to close the loophole during recent debate on the \n     measure, decided to leave the exemption in place.\n       ``Under the current law, individuals have an overall cap of \n     $25,000 a year that they can give to candidates and federal \n     political committees. Indian tribes don't have that overall \n     aggregate cap,'' said Ken Gross, a former council for the \n     FEC.\n       The exemption allows Indian tribes to donate the maximum \n     amount to every single candidate running for federal office, \n     easily totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash each \n     election cycle.\n       ``They have a big pot of money to use and make political \n     contributions and as long as they distribute it on a per \n     candidate or per committee basis within the limits, there is \n     no cap on how much they can spend so they are in a good \n     position,'' Gross said.\n       And give they do. During the 1994 election cycle, Indian \n     gaming groups gave more than $600,000 to federal candidates \n     and political parties. In 1996, they gave close to $2 million \n     and during the 2000 cycle, nearly $3 million. Millions more \n     went to state candidates.\n       ``We have taken a long time. We suffered a lot because we \n     didn't understand this political process and now that we have \n     learned the process and we have a level playing field, we \n     have got to be treated fair,'' said Erine Stevens, chairman \n     of the National Indian Gaming Association.\n       The exemption could put Indian tribes in a position to \n     donate more than any other single interest group in America.\n       Politicians don't seem to mind. Lawmakers don't appear in a \n     hurry to close the loophole during a House and Senate \n     reconciliation conference. And if the bill is signed into law \n     by the President, Indian groups can start cashing in their \n     chips.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's take a look at the trial lawyers. Shays-Meehan \ndoes not cover trial lawyers who organize as partnerships--which most \nlawyers do these days--rather than corporations. Lawyers gave more than \n$112 million in the 2000 election cycle alone. They are free to run \nissue ads at any time without restriction. This bill does nothing to \nchange that.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an editorial \nby James Wooton on this matter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 27, 2002]\n\n                    Campaign Finance Lawyer Loophole\n\n                           (By James Wooton)\n\n       A great irony could emerge from the 107th Congress: The \n     purportedly populist campaign finance reform bill being \n     considered by Congress would stifle debate on legal reform--a \n     vital consumer and shareholder issue--while creating a \n     loophole for the most powerful special interest in \n     Washington: plaintiffs' class action lawyers.\n       As it relates to independent expenditures and issue \n     advertisements, these bills don't cover trial lawyers because \n     lawyers commonly take their compensation as individuals and, \n     therefore, are not treated as ``corporations'' subject to the \n     restrictions in the legislation. Whether or not they intend \n     it, the bill's authors would grant a license to these trial \n     lawyers, who ante up tens of millions of dollars in campaign \n     contributions a year and, in doing so, would further empower \n     a new class of wealthy individuals with an aggressive \n     political agenda. The Shays-Meehan/McCain-Feingold bills \n     unwittingly step into a major public-policy battle between \n     plaintiffs' trial lawyers and the U.S. business community in \n     a way that's certain to produce a clear loser: The American \n     public. Legal reform is a concept abhorred by these lawyers \n     because it would rein in the filing of frivolous lawsuits and \n     put a lid on the lottery-like legal fees that have made some \n     trial lawyers fabulosuly rish. They remember well the bullet \n     they dodged when President Clinton vetoed the 1996 Federal \n     Products Liability bill. Since that bill's demise, the trial \n     bar has been rewarded handsomely: The total of the top 10 \n     jury verdicts increased twelvefold from 1997 to 1999.\n       Because legal reform could help curb the ``lawyer tax'' \n     that increases the cost of consumer goods and services by \n     $4,800 annually for a family of four and degrades the value \n     of investments, the public has a lot at stake in this battle.\n       Today, personal injury lawyers already are on top of the \n     world. Freshly infused with the expectation of billions in \n     fees from tobacco\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\n     litigation, they are investing heavily in Senate elections to \n     build a barrier against any future legal reforms. If lawyers \n     were ranked among industries, they would be No. 1 on the list \n     of donors to political campaigns. According to the Center for \n     Responsive Politics, lawyers contributed more than $110 \n     million in the 2000 election cycle, $77 million of which went \n     to Democrats. Members of the Association of Trial Lawyers of \n     America alone gave $3.6 million to federal campaigns over the \n     same period.\n       The battle over legal reform takes place on many fronts, \n     from electing or selecting reform-minded officials, to \n     educating the public about the need for reform, to engaging \n     in grass-roots and legislative lobbying and, ultimately, to \n     enacting reform legislation. To be sure, personal injury \n     lawyers and American businesses both engage in these \n     activities. Unfortunately for the public, Shays-Meehan/\n     McCain-Feingold would hobble American businesses involved in \n     this debate while leaving trial lawyers armed to the teeth.\n       For instance, the legislation would impose a gag rule, \n     prohibiting corporations from running broadcast issue ads \n     that even mention the name of a candidate for a 60-day \n     blackout period before a general election and 30 days before \n     a primary. Personal injury lawyers would face no such \n     obstacle.\n       Shays-Meehan/McCain-Feingold contains other booby traps \n     that could confound business efforts to inspire needed \n     reforms to our legal system. A gag rule, for example, would \n     bar corporations from running ads that simply ask viewers to \n     ``Call Senator Jones and urge him to support legal reform \n     bill X.'' During the blackout period, corporations would even \n     be prohibited from running ads that name the principal \n     sponsors of this bill.\n       Undoubtedly these are unintended consequences of Shays-\n     Meehan/McCain-Feingold. The fact is that the courts are more \n     solicitous of the free speech rights of individuals than \n     corporations. Although some campaign reform advocates have \n     expressed disdain for the greedy plaintiffs' bar and \n     supported legal reform, the campaign finance bills would give \n     more power to personal injury lawyers while crippling the \n     business community's efforts to restore sanity to our civil \n     justice system. Any congressional supporters of common-sense \n     legal reform should be wary of a bill that could \n     significantly empower the plaintiffs' trial bar to block \n     these needed reforms.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's take a look at a specific provision of this \nbill. The provision on ``coordination.''\n  In addition to protecting the American people's right to free speech \nand association, the first amendment protects the rights of Americans \nto petition their Government for redress of grievances. This right is \nessential to our representative democracy.\n  We meet with constituents and with citizens groups--who in this \ndebate are simply referred to as ``special interests''--to help \ndetermine how best to effectuate the wishes of the American people. We \nmeet with these folks every day. Our meetings with fellow Americans is \nthus one of the most important things that occurs in the democratic \nprocess.\n  The Shays-Meehan ``coordination'' provision affects our ability to \nmeet with constituents and citizen groups. There is a danger posed by \nan overbroad coordination standard in this bill. By subjecting \ncandidates, officeholders, and citizens groups to civil and criminal \nliability for innocuous--and, indeed, necessary--contacts, the \n``coordination'' provisions in Shays-Meehan do great damage to the \nconstitutionally protected right of Americans to petition their \nGovernment for the redress of grievances.\n  The Shays-Meehan coordination provisions repeal existing FEC \nregulations on coordination, and they direct the agency--they order the \nagency--to promulgate new ones. In doing so, the bill ties the FEC's \nhands by specifically prohibiting the FEC from issuing regulations that \nrequire ``agreement'' or ``formal collaboration'' before subjecting a \ncandidate, officeholder, or citizens group to civil or criminal \nliability for a ``coordinated communication.''\n  Let's sum it up. In other words, Congress is prohibiting the FEC from \ndrafting coordination regulations that meet the constitutional \nrequirement of being neither vague nor overly broad. We have, by this \nact, given instructions to the Federal Election Commission that they \ncannot draft regulations that meet a constitutional requirement of \nbeing neither vague nor overly broad. This bill seeks to shut down the \nprocess of interacting with constituents.\n  Citizens groups and candidates will be subject to prosecution if the \nGovernment deems an otherwise lawful ``issue communication'' to be a \nprohibited corporate contribution simply because groups have met with \ncandidates or officeholders about public policy issues and then run ads \non those issues.\n  For example, if a Member meets with a group about legislation that \nboth the Member and the group support, and the group then runs ads \npromoting that legislation or those policies, someone--anyone--could \nthen file a complaint charging that the Member and the group \n``coordinated'' the communication.\n  Because Shays-Meehan bars the FEC from requiring that there be an \nagreement or formal collaboration to establish that the ad was \ncoordinated, a group and a candidate can be liable for receiving and \nmaking, respectively, prohibited contributions. It will not matter that \nthe Member disagrees with the ad or even that he did not know anything \nabout it. It won't make a bit of difference.\n  Instead of requiring an actual agreement or formal collaboration \nbefore liability can be established, Shays-Meehan allows the Government \nto use simple presumptions to show ``coordination'' when, in fact, it \nmay not exist.\n  Citizens groups, both on the left and on the right, oppose Shays-\nMeehan's coordination provisions. These groups recognize they will face \nintrusive and costly investigations, prosecution, civil fines, and \npenalties, and even criminal liability--even criminal liability--simply \nbecause they meet with Members and candidates about issues and then \npromote a policy agenda that happens to overlap with the Member's \npolicy agenda.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Right to Life, \nthe NRA, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the NAACP opposing the \ncoordination provisions in Shays-Meehan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Right to Life Committee\n\n\n                               and National Rifle Association,\n\n                                                   March 19, 2002.\n     Re Coordination Minefield in Section 214 of H.R. 2356.\n\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Rules and \n         Administration, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Under current law, no relationship \n     of ``coordination'' exists unless there is an actual prior \n     communication about a specific expenditure for a specific \n     project which results in the expenditure being under the \n     direction or control of a candidate, or which causes the \n     expenditure to be made based upon information provided by the \n     candidate about the candidate's needs or plans.\n       However, Section 214 of the Shays-Meehan bill (H.R. 2356), \n     in the form passed by the House on February 14, 2002, would \n     obliterate that clear rule, and replace it with a new \n     standard for ``coordination'' that would place incumbent \n     lawmakers, advocacy groups, and unions at great legal risk \n     for engaging in cooperative or parallel activities in support \n     of common legislative goals--or even merely for transmitting \n     information about an incumbent lawmaker's position on public \n     polity issues.\n       Section 214 of the bill explicitly nullifies the current \n     Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations governing \n     ``coordination.'' The bill commands the FEC to develop new \n     regulations that ``shall not require agreement or formal \n     collaboration to establish coordination.'' [emphasis added] \n     The bill goes on to dictate a number of issues that must be \n     addressed in new regulations.\n\n\n                    ``substantial discussion'' trap\n\n       Section 214 requires new ``coordination'' regulations that \n     must, among other things, address ``payments for \n     communications made by a person after substantial discussion \n     about the communication with a candidate. . .'' [emphasis \n     added]\n       Many groups submit questionnaires to members of Congress \n     and other ``candidates,'' some of them covering many \n     different specific issues. Other groups use standardized \n     forms by which a candidate can ``pledge'' to endorse a \n     certain legislative initiative--for example, the balanced \n     budget amendment, or the Equal Rights Amendment, or ``a ban \n     on soft money.'' These written inquiries are often \n     accompanied by written or verbal communications intended to \n     convey why the position(s) advocated by the group are good \n     public policy, worthy of the support of a lawmaker or would-\n     be lawmaker. But even completing the questionnaire or pledge \n     alone could be sufficient to constitute ``substantial \n     communication,'' since the lawmaker presumably returns the \n     document to the group with the clear understanding that the \n     group intends to convey his or her position to members of the \n     public.\n       If the group does so by means that cost money, the group \n     may soon be the target of a complaint that it made an illegal \n     campaign ``contribution,'' due to the ``coordination'' that \n     occurred between the lawmaker and the group. Moreover, as \n     explained below,\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\n     if the group's spending constituted an illegal corporate \n     ``contribution,'' then the member of Congress has also \n     ``received'' an illegal corporate contribution (and, no \n     doubt, committed another violation by failing to report this \n     ``contribution''). Such a complaint may well do the incumbent \n     lawmaker both legal harm and political harm, even though he \n     did no more than convey his position(s) to a group of \n     interested citizens.\n       Here is another example of ``substantial discussion'' that \n     could lead to legal difficulties for a group (and for an \n     incumbent lawmaker). Early in a congressional session, \n     representatives of six groups met with Senator Doe to discuss \n     what language they, and he, will use to collectively promote \n     Doe's landmark bill to ban widgets. The six groups then spend \n     money to communicate with the public, including Senator Doe's \n     constituents, regarding the urgent need to enact the ``Doe-\n     Jones Widget Ban Act.'' The campaign manager for the \n     senator's challenger then files a complaint, alleging that \n     the groups have a ``coordinated'' relationship with Doe, and \n     therefore the expenditures promoting Doe's bill are actually \n     ``contributions'' to Doe's campaign. The legal \n     consequences for the groups could be grave, because \n     ``contributions'' by incorporated groups and unions have \n     long been illegal.\n       But the consequences for the incumbent lawmaker could be \n     equally grave, because if the groups' expenditures to promote \n     his bill are deemed to be ``contributions,'' then he also has \n     violated three provisions of law: (1) he has received illegal \n     ``contributions'' from corporations or unions; (2) he has \n     received ``contributions'' in excess of the $2,000 limit; and \n     (3) he has failed to report the `'contributions'' that he \n     received from the groups.\n\n\n                        ``Common Vendors'' Trap\n\n       The bill also commands that the FEC's new regulations must \n     address ``payments for the use of a common vendor.'' This \n     provision is a license for regulations under which both \n     members of Congress and groups would be at constant risk of \n     entering into a ``coordination'' relationship merely because \n     they both purchase services from the same pollster, ad \n     agency, or other ``common vendor.'' Under such a regulation, \n     a group can establish ``coordination'' with a member of \n     Congress without the lawmaker being able to prevent it, or \n     even knowing about it until after the fact. On the other \n     hand, a member of Congress could unilaterally make it more \n     difficult for numerous groups of their right to express \n     themselves about his record, merely by making purchases from \n     the leading vendor or vendors of certain services (e.g., \n     mailing houses, pollsters) in a given area.\n       The bill also requires the new regulations to address \n     communications made by ``persons who previously served as an \n     employee of a candidate or a political party.'' The bill \n     contains no time limit on the ``disability'' that would \n     result from such prior employment. The bill's language would \n     permit, for example, the FEC to write regulations under which \n     involvement in a group's public communications by someone who \n     had worked for a political party years earlier would \n     automatically ``coordinate'' all federal candidates of the \n     same political party who is discussed in that group's \n     communications to the public.\n\n\n                      Political Action Committees\n\n       Above, we have described ways in which a member of Congress \n     could unwittingly and unknowingly become `'coordinated'' with \n     an incorporated group or union, and thereby be charged with \n     receiving illegal ``contributions.'' There is an additional \n     consequence once this has occurred: If the political action \n     committee (PAC) connected to the ``coordinated'' corporation \n     or union expends more than $5,000 on any activities in \n     support of the lawmaker (or in opposition to his opponent)--\n     even without any prior knowledge or involvement by the \n     candidate--then those contributions also would also be \n     regarded as illegal ``contributions.'' This is because once \n     the parent corporation or union is deemed to have become \n     ``coordinated'' in any of the ways outlined above, its \n     connected PAC also becomes ``coordinated'' and thus loses \n     its legal right to make independent expenditures in excess \n     of $5,000 to support or oppose any candidate--and the \n     candidate is guilty of ``receiving'' an illegal \n     contribution if the PAC makes such expenditures.\n       Consequently, a Member of Congress could easily become \n     guilty of violating federal election law if he unknowingly \n     becomes ``coordinated'' with a group, and the group's PAC \n     subsequently makes expenditures over $5,000 without the \n     Member's prior knowledge, much less consent.\n       In closing, we believe that the coordination provision \n     (Section 214) in the Shays-Meehan bill infringe upon our \n     First Amendment right to free speech and right to petition \n     the government for redress of grievances. Therefore, we \n     strongly oppose this provision.\n           Respectfully,\n     David N. O'Steen,\n       Executive Director, National Right to Life Committee.\n     Charles H. Cunningham,\n       Director, Federal Affairs, National Rifle Association.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Civil Liberties Union and National Association \n           for the Advancement of Colored People,\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2002.\n     Senator Russ Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: At your earliest convenience we \n     would like to meet with you and your staff to discuss the \n     coordination provisions of the House-passed version of the \n     Shays-Meehan bill (H.R. 2356) that the Senate may soon take \n     up.\n       We believe that Section 214 (provisions on coordination) \n     will have a chilling effect on our ability to communicate \n     with Members of Congress and our constituencies about \n     important issues that arise in the legislative context. \n     Because the provisions are so vaguely worded, we also think \n     that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) will have the \n     ability to subject groups to unwarranted investigations to \n     determine if our motivation is really to affect the outcome \n     of legislation or to affect the outcome of a campaign.\n       Shays-Meehan substantially changes current law by \n     explicitly nullifying the current (and clear) FEC regulations \n     governing ``coordination.'' Under current law, no \n     relationship of ``coordination'' exists unless there is an \n     actual prior communication about a specific expenditure for a \n     specific project, which results in the expenditure being \n     under the direction or control of a candidate. In addition, \n     under current law coordination exists if the expenditure is \n     made based upon information provided by the candidate about \n     the candidate's needs or plans.\n       Under Section 214 of the Shays-Meehan bill the FEC is \n     directed to issue regulations that cover communications we \n     have with federal candidates. These new regulations ``shall \n     not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish \n     coordination.'' Another part of Section 214 states that the \n     new FEC regulations should address ``payments for \n     communications made by a person after substantial discussion \n     about the communication with a candidate . . .'' We think \n     that these vaguely worded directives concerning our \n     activities could cause legal nightmares for our groups and \n     the candidates with whom they work.\n       The ACLU and the NAACP often meet with members of Congress \n     to learn about their positions on issues. After those \n     meetings we sometimes decide to assist them (or lobby against \n     them) on their legislative initiatives. After these \n     conversations our groups may decide to convey the substance \n     of these meetings through mass communications such as full \n     page advertisements in newspapers, mass mailings, radio \n     ads and the like. If we spend money to engage in these \n     communications, we could be the target of a complaint \n     accusing us that we made an illegal campaign \n     ``contribution'' due to the ``coordination'' that occurred \n     between the lawmaker and our groups. Indeed we have often \n     been asked by a lawmaker to mobilize our grass roots on an \n     amendment or bill that they may be offering. This has \n     happened numerous times on issues ranging from civil \n     rights laws to welfare reform. Just because we work \n     closely with a Senator or Representative on a policy issue \n     does not mean that we are secretly trying to endorse a \n     particular candidate for re-election. But the new Section \n     214 provisions of Shays-Meehan will make our activities \n     suspect and prone to investigation and perhaps sanctions \n     by the FEC.\n       Candidates are also very much at risk as a result of the \n     new coordination language. If the FEC deems that our groups' \n     issue communications really amount to an illegal contribution \n     to a candidate, then the candidate can be fined by the FEC \n     for accepting an ``illegal'' contribution.\n       Without completely eliminating this provision, we hope that \n     you will make adjustments in the language of this statute \n     before the Senate takes up the bill later this week. The \n     coordination provisions should not be so vague that they lead \n     to the regulation of communications that are constitutionally \n     protected and are not designed to support or oppose a \n     candidate for federal elective office.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this urgent request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, ACLU.\n     Hillary Shelton,\n       Director, NAACP.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I urge these groups and others who are concerned about \ntheir ability to continue to promote issues to join me in challenging \nthe overbroad ``coordination'' provisions in this bill.\n  The proponents of this legislation urge that the result I have \ndescribed to you is not what they have intended. They have inserted \ninto the Record a clarification of how they envision their coordination \nprovisions to operate.\n  However, neither a colloquy nor legislative history can change clear \nstatutory language. If the drafters did not intend the troubling result \nI have described, then they should have used different language, or \naccepted my offer to modify the provision, which is one of the items I \ndiscussed with the Senator from Arizona early on in our discussions \nabout the technical corrections to this bill. Instead, they insisted on \ndirecting the FEC to find ``coordination,'' when there is no agreement \nto coordinate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that additional documents\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\nfrom individuals and groups across the political spectrum, which \nhighlight the fundamental problems with this legislation, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 2002]\n\n                    It's Not Reform, It's Deception\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       ``Washington think'' is less about logic than political \n     hustle. If you favor something, you attach it to a popular \n     cause--say, homeland security. If you oppose something, you \n     attach it to an unpopular cause--say, Enron. Bear this in \n     mind as the House debates the Shays-Meehan ``campaign finance \n     reform'' bill, named after sponsors Christopher Shays (R-\n     Conn.) and Martin Meehan (D-Mass.). The Enron scandal (it's \n     said) demonstrates the corruptness of big political \n     contributions and the need for an overhaul. The argument, \n     though highly seductive, is complete make-believe.\n       Only by the lax standards of ``Washington think'' would \n     anyone treat it seriously. It's all innuendo: Enron collapsed \n     because some executives behaved unethically; Enron executives \n     also made political contributions; therefore, the \n     contributions are tainted and the system is rotten. In \n     reality, Enron would have collapsed even if its executives \n     hadn't contributed a penny. The connection between the \n     bankruptcy and political giving is fictitious. Perhaps \n     contributions bought Enron some influence in shaping the \n     White House's energy plan. But given Bush administration's \n     pro-market views, does anyone truly believe the energy plan \n     would have been much different without Enron?\n       The real lesson is that when Enron desperately needed help, \n     its contributions bought no influence at all. In the 1999-\n     2000 election cycle, Enron, its executives and employees made \n     about $2.4 million in contributions, says the Center for \n     Responsive Politics. Republicans got 72 percent, Democrats 28 \n     percent. That's a lot of money--but not compared with total \n     contributions. In the 2000 election, all House and Senate \n     candidates raised more than $1 billion. Bush and Gore raised \n     $193.1 million and $132.8 million. Political parties and \n     committees raised hundreds of millions more.\n       Even if Enron deserve help (it didn't), few politicians \n     would have risked public wrath by rushing to its aid. What \n     this episode actually shows is that the breadth of \n     contributions insulates politicians against ``undue'' \n     influence by large donors. Since the early 1980s, the details \n     of campaign fundraising and spending have changed enormously. \n     But the debate's basic issues have stayed the same and can be \n     distilled into a few questions:\n       Is campaign spending too high? No. In 2000, all campaigns--\n     including state and local elections and ballot referendums--\n     cost about $3.9 billion, according to the forthcoming book \n     ``Financing the 2000 Election'' from the Brookings \n     Institution. This is less than four one-hundredths of 1 \n     percent of our national income. It's less than Americans \n     spend annually on flowers ($6.6 billion in 1997).\n       Do contributions systematically favor one party over \n     another? No. Since the early 1980s, politics has become \n     more--not less--competitive. The closeness of the Bush-Gore \n     election and the present congressional split (Republican \n     House, Democratic Senate) attest to that. Candidates need to \n     raise a threshold of contributions to campaign effectively. \n     But more money doesn't guarantee victory. The Brookings book \n     cites many cases where poorer candidates won. In Michigan, \n     incumbent Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham spent $13 million \n     but lost to Debbie Stabenow, who spent $8 million.\n       Do rich contributors control Washington? No. Sure, the \n     wealth sometimes get underserved tax and regulatory breaks. \n     But generally they're fighting a rear-guard defense against \n     higher taxes and more regulations. Even after Bush's tax cut, \n     the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans pay roughly half of \n     all federal taxes. Most government benefits (for Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) go to large \n     middle-class or poor constituencies.\n       Are big campaign contributions a large source of \n     discontent? No. In a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll, \n     respondents rated the government's top 10 priorities. \n     ``Campaign finance'' finished last, with 14 percent. Last \n     April--before terrorism and the declaration of a \n     recession--it was also last, with 15 percent.\n       Do restrictions on campaign contributions curb free speech? \n     Yes. Because modern communication--TV, mailings, phone banks, \n     Internet sites--requires money, limits on contributions \n     restrict communication. If communication isn't speech, what \n     is it? The Supreme Court mistakenly blessed some contribution \n     limits in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) but also equated free \n     speech with free spending. As long as the court maintains \n     that free speech involves free spending, putting more \n     restrictions on contributions to political candidates and \n     parties is self-defeating. It simply encourages outside \n     groups (unions, industry associations, environmental groups) \n     with their own agendas to increase campaign spending to \n     influence elections.\n       The true parallel between Enron and campaign finance is one \n     that ``reformers'' avoid. Enron's cardinal sin was deception. \n     The company evaded clear financial reporting. Similarly, \n     ``campaign finance reform'' fosters continuous deceptions. \n     Because politics requires money and is fiercely competitive, \n     every new restriction on contributions inspires ways around \n     the limits--evasions that, though legal, are denounced as \n     ``abuses.'' Why should writing laws that predictably invite \n     evasion be considered a good or moral act?\n       If Shays-Meehan becomes law, the cycle will continue. It \n     bars most ``soft money'' political contributions and \n     restricts some ``issue ads'' before elections. The Supreme \n     Court might toss out some or all of the new limits as \n     unconstitutional. If it doesn't, political operatives will \n     skirt the restrictions. Opinions are divided on which party \n     might benefit. Perhaps neither. Whatever happens, Shays-\n     Meehan will hardly take big money out of politics. The only \n     way to have true ``reform'' without this legislated hypocrisy \n     is to amend the Constitution and place limits on the First \n     Amendment. Somehow a distinction would have to be created \n     between ``spending to communicate'' and ``communicating.''\n       To make this case would be difficult. In this reporter's \n     opinion, it would also be undesirable. It would stifle \n     political competition and sow resentment. But perhaps \n     reformers can convince the American public otherwise. If they \n     think campaign money is fundamentally corrupting democracy, \n     honesty compels them to take the amendment route. Until they \n     acknowledge that, they will be guilty of the same sins as \n     Enron's executives. They will be describing the world as they \n     wish it to be seen, not as it actually is. Here lies the \n     geninue Enron analogy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2002.\n       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned organizations and \n     individuals, represent a diverse array of non-profit public \n     policy advocacy groups. We have a shared belief that your \n     upcoming vote on Shays-Meehan today will create an important \n     record of your stand on the First Amendment rights of issue \n     advocacy groups in the United States. We urge you to oppose \n     this legislation because it contains unwarranted and \n     unconstitutional restrictions on our free speech rights.\n       We have heard a great deal about so-called ``sham issue \n     ads'' and the need to regulate such advertising. Until now in \n     the United States, under our First Amendment, we have had the \n     right to express our views through advertising about national \n     issues and about federal elected officials before, during and \n     after elections. Clearly most of Congress realizes that it \n     would be unconstitutional to silence an individual who wants \n     to take out broadcast advertising during this same period; \n     consequently, Shays-Meehan does not silence wealthy \n     individuals. But Shays-Meehan does silence groups like ours \n     that are collectively supported by millions of small \n     contributors who band together to make their views known.\n       Proponents of Shays-Meehan argue that their bill does not \n     silence our groups. They are wrong. Sections 201, 203, and \n     204 of H.R. 2356 (like its Senate counterpart) contain \n     unconstitutional restrictions on broadcast, cable and \n     satellite issue ads. The net effect of these provisions is to \n     ban many of our national groups and their affiliates, and all \n     other 501(c)(4) advocacy corporations (but not PACs) from \n     funding TV or radio ads that even mention the name of a local \n     member of Congress for 30 days before a state's congressional \n     primary or runoff, and for another 60 days before the general \n     election. This restriction applies to any ad that ``can be \n     received'' by 50,000 or more ``persons,'' including minors, \n     within a district--which covers nearly any TV or radio ad, \n     since few persons do not possess TVs and radios.\n       These restrictions would have widespread impact on issue \n     advocacy throughout the even number years in particular. For \n     example, even today (February 13, 2002) if the bill were law, \n     groups such as Common Cause and Campaign for America would be \n     banned from running a TV or radio ad today in California \n     (March 5th primary) or Texas (March 12th primary) saying \n     simply ``Call Congressman Jones to urge him to vote for the \n     Shays-Meehan bill.'' In effect, groups are being cut out of \n     the dialogue on major national issues.\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that only express \n     advocacy, narrowly defined, can be subject to campaign \n     finance controls. Shays-Meehan redefines express advocacy in \n     a way that covers our legitimate speech, which is not telling \n     voters to vote for or against a particular candidate. If we \n     dare applaud, criticize or even mention a candidate's name \n     during this 30 day/60 day ``blackout'' period, we would have \n     to create a PAC where donor names would have to be \n     disclosed to the FEC in a way never before upheld by the \n     courts.\n       We believe that no group that wants to express its views \n     through broadcast ads should be forced to bear the \n     significant and costly burden of establishing a PAC just to \n     comment during this period. Separate accounting procedures, \n     new legal compliance costs and separate administrative \n     processes would be imposed on these groups--a high price to \n     exercise their First Amendment rights to merely mention a \n     candidate's name or comment on candidate records. Moreover, \n     having a PAC would by definition make the organization a \n     participant in partisan politics. Rather than risk violating \n     this new requirement, absorbing the cost of compliance or \n     being forced to take partisan stands during elections, it is \n     very likely that some groups will remain silent.\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\n       It is clear that the intent and net effect of Shays-Meehan \n     is to shut down legitimate, constitutionally protected issue \n     advocacy. Are you voting to do this to groups who represent \n     millions of Americans? We urge you to reject this approach. \n     Please vote against Shays-Meehan.\n           Sincerely,\n       Laura W.

These bills \n     protect incumbents, wealthy individuals, PACs and the press. \n     We have enclosed a fact sheet that presents our objections to \n     Shays-Meehan in more detail.\n       We urge all members of Congress to vote against this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura W.

Shays/Meehan is patently unconstitutional.\n       The American Civil Liberties Union believes that key \n     elements of Shays-Meehan violate the First Amendment right to \n     free speech because the legislation contains provisions that \n     would:\n       Violate the constitutionally protected right of the people \n     to express their opinions about issues through broadcast \n     advertising if they mention the name of a candidate.\n       Restrict soft money contributions and uses of soft money \n     for no constitutionally justifiable reason.\n       Chill free expression by redefining it as ``coordination'' \n     through burdensome reporting requirements and greatly \n     expanded FEC investigative and enforcement authority.\n       H.R. 2356 would burden and abridge the very speech that the \n     First Amendment was designed to protect: political speech.\n       2. Shays-Meehan would have a chilling effect on issue \n     advocacy speech that is essential in a democracy. H.R. 2356 \n     contains the harshest and most unconstitutional controls on \n     issue advocacy groups. The bill contains:\n       A virtual ban on issue advocacy achieved through redefining \n     express advocacy in an unconstitutionally value and over-\n     broad manner. The Supreme Court has held that only express \n     advocacy, narrowly defined, can be subject to campaign \n     finance controls. The key to the existing definition of \n     express advocacy is the inclusion of an explicit directive to \n     vote for or vote against a candidate. Minus the explicit \n     directive or so-called ``bright-line'' test, the Federal \n     Election Commission (FEC) will decide what constitutes \n     express advocacy. Few non-profit issue groups will want to \n     risk their tax status or incur legal expenses to engage in \n     speech that could be interpreted by the FEC to have an \n     influence on the outcome of an election.\n       A black-out on broadcast, cable and satellite issue \n     advertising before primary and general elections. The bill's \n     statutory limitations on issue advocacy would force groups \n     that now engage in issue advocacy--including non-profit \n     corporations known as 501(c)(4)s--to create new institutional \n     entities in order to ``legally'' speak within 30 days before \n     a congressional primary or runoff and 60 days before a \n     general election. This restriction applies to any ad that \n     ``can be received'' by 50,000 or more ``persons,'' including \n     minors, within a district--which covers almost all TV or \n     radio ads, since few persons do not possess TVs and radios. \n     If a group wanted to take out a broadcast, cable or satellite \n     ad during this period they would have to create a PAC where \n     donors would have to be disclosed to the FEC in a way never \n     before sustained by the courts. The opportunities that donors \n     now have to contribute anonymously (a real concern when a \n     cause is unpopular or divisive--see NAACP v. Alabama) would \n     be eliminated.\n       Being forced to establish a PAC as a condition of \n     commenting on campaign issues could entail a significant and \n     costly burden for many non-profit organizations. Separate \n     accounting procedures, new legal compliance costs and \n     separate administrative processes would be imposed on these \n     groups--a high price to exercise their First Amendment rights \n     to comment on candidate records. Moreover, forcing an \n     organization to take a partisan position is antithetical to \n     the mission of groups like the ACLU that are fiercely non-\n     partisan. It is very likely that some groups will remain \n     silent rather than risk violating this new requirement or \n     absorbing the cost of compliance. The only individuals and \n     groups that will be able to characterize a candidate's record \n     on radio and TV during this 60 day period will be the \n     candidates, wealthy individuals, PACs and the media. Further, \n     members of congress need only wait until days before a \n     primary or general election (as they often do now) to vote \n     for legislation or engage in controversial behavior so that \n     their actions are beyond the reach of public comment and, \n     therefore, effectively immune from citizen criticism.\n       3. Shays-Meehan redefines ``coordination with a candidate'' \n     so that heretofore legal and constitutionally protected \n     activities of issue advocacy groups would become illegal.\n       If the ACLU decided to place an ad lauding--by name--\n     Representatives or Senators for their effective advocacy of \n     constitutional campaign finance reform, that ad would be \n     counted as express advocacy on behalf of the named \n     Congresspersons and, therefore, would be prohibited if the \n     ACLU had prior discussions with that member about those \n     issues. An expanded definition of coordination is disruptive \n     of proper issue group-candidate discussion.\n       4. Shays-Meehan would impermissibly limit soft money.\n       Unprecedented restrictions on soft money would make \n     national parties less able to support grassroots activity, \n     candidate recruitment and get-out-the-vote efforts. \n     Restrictions on corporate and union contributions to parties \n     not only trample the First Amendment rights of parties and \n     their supporters in a manner well beyond any compelling \n     governmental interest but they also dry up funds that expand \n     political participation. Further, Shays-Meehan would ban all \n     contributions from parties to non-profit organizations. \n     Political parties frequently give money to non-profit \n     groups to facilitate voter registration and issue-based \n     voter mobilization efforts. These restrictions threaten \n     the very survival of non-profit organizations that exist \n     for these purposes, and will likely further suppress voter \n     turnout by student and minority groups. Political parties \n     are the mainstay of our democracy and they require funds \n     for their electoral and issue advocacy activity. Any \n     concern with large contributions to political parties may \n     be addressed through the less drastic alternative of \n     disclosure.\n       5. Shays-Meehan does not do anything to ``Big Money'' in \n     politics except push money into other forms of speech that \n     are beyond the reach of the campaign finance laws.\n       The Shays-Meehan bill contains misguided and \n     unconstitutional restrictions on issue group speech and, as a \n     consequence, further empowers the media to influence the \n     outcome of elections. None of the proposals seek to regulate \n     the ability of the media--print, electronic, broadcast or \n     cable--to exercise its enormous power to direct news coverage \n     and editorialize in favor or against candidates. This would \n     be clearly unconstitutional. However, if the sponsors of \n     Shays-Meehan have their way, the only entities that would be \n     free to comment in any significant way on candidates' records \n     would be the media, wealthy individuals, PACs and the \n     candidates themselves. Corporations and unions need only to \n     purchase media outlet if they want to have influence over \n     candidates--their wealth and influence will not be abated by \n     these so-called ``reforms.'' Why, then, does Shays-Meehan \n     attack, burden and seek to effectively eliminate only citizen \n     group advocacy?\n       6. Shays-Meehan makes it harder for ethnic and racial \n     minority, women and non-mainstream voices to be heard prior \n     to an election.\n       What would happen, for example, if a candidate runs racist, \n     sexist or homophobic ads during the last days of an election \n     and interest groups like the NAACP, NOW or the National Gay \n     and Lesbian Task Force wanted to criticize that candidate by \n     name? Unless they undertook the complicated process of \n     forming a PAC, they would risk violating the issue ad \n     restriction in HR 2356 (the Shays-Meehan bill). Any broadcast \n     ads decrying the candidates behavior that uses the name or \n     likeness of a candidates 30 days before a primary or 60 days \n     prior to a general election--even ads that do not endorse or \n     oppose the candidates--would have to be funded through new \n     disclosed dollars only, not existing non-profit funds. \n     Further, the Shays-Meehan restrictions on soft money would \n     dry up dollars that parties need to conduct voter \n     registration and education, issue and platform development \n     and the like.\n       7. It creates a ``Big Brother'' governmental regime for \n     political speech.\n       This bill would permit the creation of a huge Federal \n     Elections Commission apparatus that would be in the full-time \n     business of determining which communications are considered \n     unlawful ``electioneering'' by citizens and non-profit \n     groups. None of the major proposals have funds to train or \n     defend citizens or interest groups under the proposed new \n     regulatory regime. Yet the Shays-Meehan legislation contains \n     harsh penalties for failure to comply with the new laws.\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\n       8. How does the Shays-Meehan bill compare to the Ney/Wynn \n     bill, H.R. 2360?\n       The Ney/Wynn bill is far less constitutionally flawed than \n     Shays/Meehan in that it regulates issue advocacy and soft \n     money less restrictively. But Ney/Wynn is still problematic \n     legislation in that it imposes unwarranted regulation of \n     issue advocacy thought registration, reporting and \n     disclosure. It creates a kind of ``Free Speech Registry'' for \n     any organized criticism of incumbent politicians. A group \n     would still have to register with the FEC if it sends \n     written, Internet and broadcast communications. These very \n     same kinds of regulations have been struck down by the \n     federal courts (See United States v. National Committee for \n     Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1972) and American \n     Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F. Supp. 1041 (D.D.C. \n     1973)). The Ney/Wynn bill would adversely affect issue group \n     publications such as an ACLU Civil Liberties Voting Index \n     unless it was communicated only internally to members). Such \n     a communication would be subject to onerous and burdensome \n     regulations. Although both bills embody the flawed limit-\n     driven approach to political speech, the Shays/Meehan bill is \n     far more constitutionally onerous.\n       Shays-Meehan is unconstitutional, unwise and ineffective \n     legislation. The ACLU urges Representatives to vote against \n     H.R. 2356.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Although this legislation will pass today, I am \nconfident the Supreme Court will step in to defend the Constitution.\n  I commend the proponents of this bill for acknowledging the serious \nconstitutional questions that are wrapped up in this legislation and \nfor providing an expedited route to the Supreme Court for an answer to \nthese questions. I am consoled by the obvious fact that the courts do \nnot defer to the Congress on matters of the Constitution, and they \nshould not.\n  Today is a sad day for our Constitution, a sad day for our democracy, \nand for our political parties. We are all now complicit in a dramatic \ntransfer of power from challenger-friendly, citizen-action groups known \nas political parties to outside special interest groups, wealthy \nindividuals, and corporations that own newspapers.\n  After a decade of making my constitutional arguments to this body, I \nam eager to become the lead plaintiff in this case and take my argument \nto the branch of Government charged with the critical task of \ninterpreting our Constitution.\n  Today is not a moment of great courage for the legislative branch. We \nhave allowed a few powerful editorial pages to prod us into infringing \nthe First Amendment rights of everybody but them. Fortunately, this is \nthe very moment for which the Bill of Rights was enacted. The \nConstitution is most powerful when our courage is most lacking.\n  Madam President, I congratulate Senator McCain and Senator Feingold \nfor their long quest on behalf of this legislation and also Congressmen \nShays and Meehan.\n  I particularly thank my devoted staff, who have been deeply involved \nin this issue--some of them going back to the late 1980s. The Minority \nStaff Director of the Rules Committee, Tam Somerville, was with me in \n1994 when we had the last all-night filibuster in the Senate. It was on \nthis issue. That was a time when we really did get out the cots because \nwe really meant to use them, not just to have a photo op. Hunter Bates, \nmy former Chief of Staff and the former Chief Counsel of the Rules \nCommittee, has been a tower of strength on this issue and will still \nbe, hopefully, involved in our effort as we go forward in the courts. \nBrian Lewis, my Chief Counsel at the Rules Committee, has been an \ninvaluable member of this team. He is a very skillful lawyer, with a \ngood political sense as well. He also has been deeply involved in the \nelection reform issue, which Senator Dodd and I hope to move in the \ncoming weeks. Leon Sequeira, my Counsel at the Rules Committee who \nworks with Brian, is sitting to my right. He is also a valuable member \nof our team and a terrific lawyer who has made important contributions \nto this debate.\n\n  John Abegg, my Counsel in my personal office, is another bright \nlawyer, well steeped in the first amendment, who has made an important \ncontribution.\n  Chris Moore and Hugh Farrish of the Rules Committee staff have also \nbeen helpful to me in this effort.\n  I say to all my staff who have worked on this issue, you make me look \na lot better than I deserve, and I thank you so much for your \noutstanding work, not just for me but for the principles involved in \nthis important debate.\n  In conclusion, this may be the end of the legislative chapter of this \nbill, but a new and exciting phase lies ahead as we go to court to seek \nto uphold the Constitution and protect the rights of individuals, \nparties and outside groups to comment and engage in political discourse \nin our country.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator has 18\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask that the time be charged to \nboth sides during the quorum call, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes \nto address this issue. I yield him 10 minutes if he needs it. If he \ndoes not, we will reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, first and foremost I congratulate the Senator from \nKentucky. He is truly a lawyer for the first amendment and for the \nConstitution of the United States. I listened to most of his remarks. \nThey are about as thorough a discourse on this issue as I have heard. \nThere is not much for me to add, but I will make a couple of comments \nabout what I think we are doing today and the impact it is going to \nhave on the political system.\n  Assuming this is all held to be constitutional--and I agree with my \ncolleague from Kentucky, I have grave doubts whether that will be the \ncase, but assuming it will all be held constitutional, this will do \nseveral things.\n  No. 1, I got to the Senate and the House of Representatives as a \nchallenger. I came out of nowhere in almost both those situations. I \ndid it the hard way. I had support basically from only one special \ninterest group: the Republican Party. That was it.\n  In my first race for Congress, I was outspent 3\\1/2\\ to 1. I think I \ngot $10,000 in PAC contributions. I was a nobody. I was a guy who was \nknocking on doors. The Republican Party said: We will help him a little \nbit; we will get the folks organized to help out. And they gave me a \nlittle money. Guys like me are going to have a lot harder time getting \nto the Senate or the House of Representatives. None of the special \ninterest groups was fighting for me because they did not think I had a \nchance. They are going to be the ones to hold the power now.\n  Political parties are not going to have the resources to support \nchallengers. I heard this comment among my colleagues over and over--it \nis this frustration level, and I do not mean to point fingers and I \nwill not, but I hear this frustrating comment from my colleagues who \nsupport this bill: I am sick and tired of all these people playing \naround in my election. I am tired of all these outside groups running \nads in my election.\n  Well, excuse me. Excuse me. Gee, I did not realize when I ran for \noffice that this was my election. You see, I thought this was an \nelection for the Senate or, before that, for the Congress. I certainly \ndid not believe I had ownership of this election. But I will tell you, \nin private meetings, over and over I hear this comment: I am sick and \ntired of all these people, all these speeches--speeches meaning ads--\nall these folks attacking me in my election; I want control back over \nmy election.\n  ``My election.'' If you do not think this is an incumbent protection \nplan, I guarantee you have not been listening. This is all about \nprotecting incumbents. Do my colleagues think we are going to pass \nsomething which helps folks who run against us? How many folks are \ngoing to say: I like being here, but I want to give the guy who takes \nme on a better shot at me? I can guarantee if my colleagues read this \nbill, there is no way they can see that.\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\n  All you bothersome people out there in America who believe you have \nsome right to participate in my election, it keeps you at home. You \njust stay home. Leave me alone 60 days before my election so I can do \nwhat I want to do and tell the people what I want to tell them.\n  That is the first thing this does--it shuts you up because--you know \nwhat?--you are an annoyance. You guys go out there and say things I do \nnot like, I do not agree with, and it may not be true, so we are just \ngoing to shut you up. That is the first thing this bill does.\n\n  The second thing this bill does is it destroys political parties. One \nof the great things about this country is that we have had a stable \ntwo-party system. Travel around the world and look at other democracies \nand see fragmented governments, all these very narrow parties. We do \nnot have that in America. We have two very broad mainstream parties. \nPeople say that does not leave room for dramatic advances in \nideological thought at one end of the spectrum or the other end. That \nmay be true, but it has served this country pretty well.\n  What we are doing with this bill is shifting power from those broad, \nmainstream parties that support people not because of any litmus test \non the issues, but support them because they run under the broad banner \nof center or right of center if you are Republican, or center or left \nof center if you are a Democrat. We are now going to replace that with \nvery highly specialized interests that I believe in the end will begin \nto develop parties, although not in a formal sense, but begin running \ncandidates because of their ability to funnel undisclosed money to \nthose candidates. We will begin to see more fringe players on the \nhorizon. We may even see many elected.\n  If we look again at Europe and other places, other democracies, in \nmany cases these fringe or extreme parties tend to hold the balance of \npower. It is not a very constructive thing at all for this country.\n  I do not know what possesses someone to think that political parties, \nfor all their good or all their bad, are somehow negative for this \ncountry; that having political parties supporting their candidates is \nsomehow bad, is somehow destructive to our political process when, in \nfact, it is just the opposite. Political parties protect us from \nextremism by their support of more mainstream ideas.\n  So this bill destroys, in most respects, political parties and their \nability to have influence on elections. It shuts up you. It shuts up \nyou, the average voter in America. It says you need not participate in \nwhat we are doing.\n  Who is the greatest beneficiary? Well, obviously, I mentioned before \nthe greatest beneficiary is the incumbent or the person with incredible \ndeep pockets who can spend their money. Those are the great \nbeneficiaries. If you have a lot of money or you happen to be in here--\nI got mine, too bad about you--you are going to be OK in this \nlegislation.\n  I do not know that I would necessarily wave the banner of reform and \nsay that is the end result of this process.\n  Who else is going to benefit? Senator McConnell mentioned this, too. \nThe greatest beneficiaries are the folks who do not have to shut up 60 \ndays before the election. The greatest beneficiaries are candidates and \nthe media. The media is a huge winner.\n  All of you, Americans, unless you have a newspaper or a radio station \nor a television station, have to sit on the sidelines when people begin \nto focus on elections 60 days before. Not the media. If all of you are \nquieter, their voice naturally becomes louder because it is the only \nvoice out there other than the candidate. Of course, those supporting \nthis measure want to shut you up anyway.\n  So we now have a system where candidates and the media become the \ndominant voices in our political structure, and the average American is \nshut out. And this is reform.\n  I argue that what we are doing is a direct assault on the first \namendment. If one has any doubts about that, in the Senate, at least \nthe last two times that I recall that we debated this issue, there was \nan amendment offered to McCain-Feingold to amend the Constitution to \nallow these provisions to be constitutional. Think about this. In the \nSenate, there was an amendment offered to, in essence, amend the first \namendment of the Constitution so this bill would be seen \nconstitutionally.\n  Over a third of the Senate voted to limit political speech in the \nConstitution, which brings me to the point I have made many times. I \nguarantee if we had a vote right now on the first 10 amendments to the \nConstitution, the Bill of Rights, in the Senate they would not pass, \nbecause we know better. We want to keep this power with us, not the \npeople.\n  Those first 10 amendments were there to protect you, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica; not us, Mr. and Mrs. Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty-one minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. Now I am delighted to yield 5 \nminutes to one of the earliest supporters of this legislation from the \nState, more than any other State at this time in our history, that \nrepresents campaign finance reform and somebody who worked every day \nfor 5 or 6 years to make this happen, the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Today we stand on the threshold of an accomplishment that for many \nyears had seemed unachievable. We are here because of the tenacious \nleadership, advocacy, and courage of Senators John McCain and Russ \nFeingold. How well I remember, after being elected in 1996 and sworn in \nin early 1997, Senator Feingold coming and meeting with me. He had with \nhim a pile of papers, everything I had ever said on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. So he knew well I had pledged to the people of \nMaine my determination to reform our campaign finance laws.\n  We talked, and I said to him: This sounds very good. How many other \nRepublicans do you have on this bill?\n  He paused and he said: You mean other than John McCain?\n  I said: Yes.\n  He said: Well, there is Fred Thompson.\n  I was delighted to sign on as the third Republican to support the \nMcCain-Feingold bill. I wish to pay tribute to my friend Russ Feingold \nfor his persistence, for his attention to detail, and for never giving \nup the fight. He and Senator McCain are true heroes.\n  It is wonderful to be here today. The growth and support for campaign \nfinance reform among members of my party underscores the importance of \nthe legislation and the increasing realization that our campaign system \nwas out of control. My home State of Maine has a deep commitment to \npreserving the integrity of the electoral process, to opening the doors \nto public office to many more citizens, and to ensuring that all \nMainers, indeed all Americans, have an equal political voice.\n  In many communities in Maine, this is the season for town meetings, \ntown meetings in which all citizens are invited to debate the issues \nwith their neighbors and to make decisions. This is unvarnished, direct \ndemocracy. It is a tradition where those who have more money do not \nspeak any louder or have any more clout than those who have less money. \nIt is a tradition that has made Maine a State that values political \nparticipation from all of its citizens.\n\n  Maine's tradition of town meetings and equal participation rejects \nthe notion that wealth dictates political discourse. Maine's citizens \nfeel strongly about reforming the campaign finance system, as do I.\n  Soft money has become the conduit through which wealthy individuals, \nlabor unions, and corporations have been able to evade the campaign \ncontribution limits, as well as the ban on direct corporate and union \ncontributions. The problem with soft money was painfully evident during \nthe 1997 hearings held by my friend and colleague, Senator Fred \nThompson, before the Committee on Governmental Affairs. We heard from \nindividual after individual who testified about giving\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in order to buy access. One gave \n$325,000 to the Democratic National Committee in order to secure a \npicture with the President of the United States. Another was the \ninfamous Roger Tamraz, who testified the $300,000 he donated to gain \naccess to the White House was not enough and that next time he was \nprepared to double the amount he would give.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, soft money donations \nnearly doubled in the 2000 election cycle, from $262 million in 1996 to \n$488 million in the year 2000. Other estimates set the explosion in \nsoft money donations at even higher levels.\n  Just two Presidential elections ago, soft money contributions totaled \n$86 million. At the same time, during this period, regulated hard money \ndonations, which all of us wish to encourage to get individuals more \ninvolved in the political process, grew by only about 10 percent.\n  The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 has served our country well \nin many aspects, but the loopholes in the law have swallowed the rules \nthemselves. If left unchecked, soft money threatens to swamp our \ncampaign finance system, and that is why this legislation we are on the \nthreshold of clearing today is so important.\n  I am also pleased the bill includes an amendment that Senator Wyden \nand I offered to raise the level of discourse in campaign ads. Our \namendment requires that candidates be clearly identified when they or \ntheir authorized committees air negative advertising. When a candidate \nlaunches an ad that refers directly to an opponent, whether it is a \nhigh-minded discussion of policy differences or a vicious attack on an \nopponent's character, the candidate should be required to stand by his \nad and not hide behind a committee that may not include the name of the \ncandidate.\n  Our amendment requires the candidate to clearly identify himself or \nherself as the sponsor of the ad, thus putting an end to disingenuous \nstealth attack ads.\n  Finally, I pay tribute to a principled opponent of this legislation, \nSenator McConnell. We could not disagree more on the substance of this \nissue, but I respect his tenacity and the strength of his convictions.\n  The problems in our country campaign finance system are well known. \nToday, finally, at long last, due to Senator Russ Feingold and Senator \nJohn McCain, we are going to make tremendous progress. I am delighted \nto have been part of this fight. I am so pleased we are on the verge of \nsending this landmark legislation to the President of the United States \nfor his signature.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nkind words and her courageous leadership on this issue. It is so \nfitting that the next speaker is the other Senator from Maine. Without \nMaine, without these Senators, we would not be winning this battle \ntoday. That is all there is to it. My hat is off to the State of Maine.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the senior Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank Senator Feingold.\n  Madam President, I am delighted to be here this afternoon to join my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Collins, in support of this campaign \nfinance legislation that clearly will be landmark law for campaign \nfinance in the beginning of this new century.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this landmark \ncampaign finance reform bill that has passed the House of \nRepresentatives and is before us today. That bill, the so-called \n``Shays-Meehan'' bill, of course is very close to the McCain-Feingold \ncampaign finance reform legislation that we passed in this body last \nApril.\n  As I have said before, this bill reminds me of that old Beatles song, \n``The Long and Winding Road.'' Because, for certain, the road to this \nday has been marked by long stretches of nothingness, interrupted \nperiodically along the way by dangerous curves, rock-slides, pot holes, \njersey barriers, you name it.\n  And while there were times it looked as though we might fly off the \ncliff, never to be seen again--or that we might run head-long into one \nof the myriad procedural roadblocks placed before us here we are, \nfinally at the doorstep of real and meaningful campaign finance reform \nfor the first time in a quarter century.\n  Without question, we never would have arrived here safely if not for \nthe extraordinary skills of the two men at the wheel--Senators John \nMcCain and Russ Feingold. Their names have become synonymous with \ncampaign reform, and with good reason. No one has devoted more of \nthemselves to this cause. No one has poured more effort, energy and \ninnovation into bringing about necessary changes in the way in which we \nfinance campaigns in this country.\n  We say it all the time in this body, but these two truly have worked \ntirelessly for the success of this legislation. And I can tell you I've \nbeen privileged to work with them in trying to forge a bill that will \nnot only address a huge portion of the problem we face, but also a bill \nthat can pass the Congress and be signed into law.\n  In that light, I also want to recognize and commend Representatives \nShays and Meehan, whose fight in the House reminds me of the story of \nHercules' battle with the Hydra--a serpent with nine-heads, one of \nwhich was immortal. But Hercules won out by burying that last, immortal \nhead just as Congressmen Shays and Meehan won out over the multi-\nfaceted offensive of procedural hurdles and killer amendments that was \nthrown at them. I congratulate them both.\n  And before I go any further, I also thank my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, who has been steadfast and instrumental in \nhelping to forge the compromise language in this bill that has now come \nto be known as ``Snowe-Jeffords.'' I can't tell you the countless hours \nand incredible effort he and his staff have put in to develop and hone \nthis language in consultation with leading reformers and constitutional \nscholars, and I deeply appreciate his commitment to advancing the cause \nof campaign finance reform.\n  Indeed, I have never been more optimistic that reform will become \nreality. The fact of the matter is, the House and Senate are now both \non record in support of reform, having passed two bills that achieve \nthe same objectives and goals. And so now the time is upon us. The time \nhas arrived for us to lay aside procedural gymnastics and put away the \narcane legislative amendment trees and pass this bill and send it to \nthe President of the United States.\n  Today, I want to speak to the pressing need for reform . . . the \nreasons why this bill fits the bill . . . and why I believe in both the \neffectiveness and constitutionality of what we are about to do.\n  First, I do not think there can be any doubt that we have a system of \nfinancing campaigns in this country that is out of control. And it is \nout of control in a very literal sense because some critical loopholes \nhave been exploited that takes an entire and ever-growing universe of \nmoney out from under the umbrella and enforcement mechanisms of federal \nelection laws and into the realm of ``anything goes.''\n  Well, the ``if it feels good, do it'' approach to financing campaigns \nin America must come to an end, because it is making a mockery of our \nelection laws. We've all heard by now the story of soft money, and what \nit represents money that is raised and spent outside the purview of \nfederal election law, even though it unquestionably effects the outcome \nof Federal elections.\n  That's the fundamental reason why it's time for soft money to go. \nBecause it's no longer about building up the parties something I have \nabsolutely no problem with whatsoever. It's about money that's being \nraised in unlimited amounts from unlimited sources to elect candidates \nfor Federal office--something for which we already have well-\nestablished rules--rules that are being flouted on a grand and \ndisturbing scale.\n  This soft money must be incredibly effective in what it does, because \nevery year the parties come more and more under its spell. Just ten \nyears ago, during the Presidential election cycle of 1992, soft money \naccounted for just 17 percent of total receipts by the two major \npolitical parties. But in the last election cycle, that number \nskyrocketed to 40 percent. To put it another way, the $86.1 million in \nsoft money raised by the two parties in 1992\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\nincreased by well over 500 percent in the 2000 elections.\n  And just think about this--the total amount of soft money raised by \nboth parties in the first half of this current election cycle--$160.1 \nmillion--is more than twice the $67.4 million raised in 1997, the first \nyear of the most recent non-presidential cycle. Even more telling is \nthe fact that the current numbers are almost 50 percent more than the \n$107.2 million raised in 1999--and that was during a Presidential \nelection cycle, when fundraising is typically higher. Where will we be \nin 10 years, Mr. President? In 20 years?\n  The amount of money is staggering. But just as bad is the complete \nlack of accountability assigned to it--even though it is being used to \naffect the outcome of Federal elections.\n  No wonder there is a strong sense that campaigns in this country have \nspiraled out of control. There is a strong sense that elections are no \nlonger in the hands of individual Americans. As the old saying goes, \nperception becomes nine tenths of reality. And the reality is, we have \na system in need of an overhaul.\n  That's why one of the most critical components of this bill bans soft \nmoney for the national parties. But to do that alone is simply not \nenough. We can't just shut off the flow of soft money to parties and \ncall it a day. We also must close off the use of corporate and union \ntreasury money used to fund ads influencing Federal elections. That's \nthe only way we can claim to have enacted truly balanced and fair \nreform.\n  As far back as 1997, I worked to address this thorny issue--how do we \nensure freedom of speech while also ensuring the integrity of our \nelection laws? And what I eventually developed in partnership with \nSenator Jeffords and noted constitutional scholars is an easily \nunderstandable, narrowly drawn, constitutional method of applying \ndisclosure and restrictions on the sources of funding for \nelectioneering ads masquerading as so-called ``issue ads.''\n  What we are talking about are broadcast advertisements that are \ninfluencing our Federal elections and, in virtually every instance, are \ndesigned to influence our Federal elections. Every focus group and \nevery study group that has been conducted over the last few years \nproves this, and I'll detail those studies later. And yet, no \ndisclosure is required and there are none of the funding source \nprohibitions that for decades have been placed on other forms of \ncampaigning.\n  Why is this so? Because they don't contain the so-called ``magic \nwords'' like ``vote for candidate x'' or ``vote against candidate x'' \nthat make a communication what is called ``express advocacy,'' and \ntherefore, subject to Federal law requiring disclosure and requiring \nthat the ad be paid for with hard money.\n  These ads must be extraordinarily effective, because their use has \nexploded within the last decade. According to a 2001 report from the \nAnnenberg Public Policy Center, which has been studying this trend \nalmost since its inception in the 1996 election cycle, in the past \nthree cycles we have seen spending on issue ads go from about $150 \nmillion in 1996, to about $340 million in 1998, to over $500 million in \n2000. One hundred million of that was spent in the last 2 months alone. \nAnd there is not one dime of disclosure required on any of it.\n  It's time we closed this loophole. It's time to remove the cloak of \nanonymity. Otherwise, we are saying that it really doesn't matter to \nthe election process. That we should not know who is behind these types \nof commercials that are run 60 days before the election, 30 days before \na primary, whose donors contribute more than $1,000. We ought to have \ndisclosure on these ads where there currently is no disclosure. And \nthat's what the Snowe-Jeffords provision in this bill does, in simple, \nstraightforward and unambiguous terms.\n  Here's how it works. First, it requires disclosure on individuals and \ngroups running broadcast ads within 30 days of a primary and 60 days of \na general election that mention the name of a Federal candidate and are \ndistributed from a broadcaster or cable or satellite service and is \nreceived by 50,000 or more persons in State or district where Senate/\nHouse election occurs. And the disclosure threshold is high $1,000 \nwhich incidentally is five times the contribution amounts candidates \nare required to disclose.\n\n  And second, it prohibits the use of union or corporate treasury money \nto pay for these ads, in keeping with longstanding provisions of law. \nCorporations have been banned from direct involvement in campaigns \nsince the Tillman Act of 1907. Unions were first addressed in the \nSmith-Connally Act of 1943 and the prohibition was finally made \npermanent in 1947 with the Taft-Hartley Act.\n  And these laws have stood because the Court has recognized--as \nrecently as 1990 as this quote from Justice Marshall in the Austin \nversus Michigan Chamber of Commerce decision shows--``the corrosive and \ndistorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are \naccumulated with the help of the corporate form, and that have little \nor no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's \npolitical ideas.''\n  Now, the Snowe-Jeffords provision has been around for a while, and \nduring that time I have heard some pretty outrageous and flat-out false \nstatements made about it, and I would like to take this opportunity to \nset the record straight on what it does and doesn't do. Indeed, it was \nsaid on the floor last March, in defense of an amendment to remove the \nSnowe-Jeffords language from the bill an attempt that failed by a vote \nof 28-72 I might add that:\n\n       American citizens would be prohibited from discussing on \n     television or radio a candidate's voting records and \n     positions within 60 days before a general election or 30 days \n     before a primary . . . the 'political speech police' would be \n     saying that you cannot mention a candidate's name; you cannot \n     criticize that candidate by name . . . if you are part of a \n     citizens group wanting to enter the political debate and \n     engage in meaningful discourse, using the most wide-sweeping \n     medium for reaching the people which is TV, under this \n     provision you cannot do that. You simply cannot enter the \n     debate using television or radio as a mode of communication.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a gross mis-characterization of Snowe-\nJeffords.\n  Individuals are free to run ads saying whatever they want whenever \nthey want and unions, corporations and non-profit 501(c)4 groups can \nsimply form political action committees to which individuals \nvoluntarily contribute up to the amount allowed by law to run ads \nmentioning a candidate near an election. So it absolutely can be done.\n  I have also heard it said that the result of this provision would be \nessentially be little or no political speech during the 60 day period \nbefore an election. But that simply isn't true. Again, so-called issue \nads run on television and radio only, 30 days before a primary and 60 \ndays before a Federal election, that mention a Federal candidate's \nname, and are seen by the candidate's electorate, would be subject to \ndisclosure--and could not be funded by corporate or union general \ntreasury funds or union dues. And this only applies if you run more \nthan $10,000 of these kind of ads during a calendar year. So we will \nnever effect small groups.\n  The most important, bottom line components to this legislation are \ndisclosure, and a requirement that these so-called issue ads that are \nreally campaign ads be funded from voluntary, individual contributions \njust like any other campaign ad.\n  Let me now give you a quick example of exactly what kinds of ads we \nwould cover, and what ads wouldn't be touched at all. First, the \nelectioneering ad--it doesn't specifically say ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst'' so-and-so--something that would automatically bring it under \ncurrent law.\n  ``We try to teach our children that honesty matters. Unfortunately, \nthough, Candidate X just doesn't get it. Candidate X urged her employer \nto buy politicians and judges with money and jobs for their relatives. \nCandidate X advocates corruption . . . call Candidate X. Tell her \ngovernment shouldn't be for sale. Tell her we're better than that. Tell \nher honesty does matter.''\n  Under current law, because this ad doesn't use the so-called magic \nwords, there is no disclosure required on these ads and there are no \nsource prohibitions whatsoever. And we're told by our opponents that \nwe're just supposed to throw up our hands and say, ``Oh well, we all \nknow what these ads are doing, but there's not a thing we can do about \nit.''\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\n  Now, here is a real issue ad that wouldn't be covered at all by \nSnowe-Jeffords in any way, shape or form. It says:\n  (Woman): ``We can't pay these bills, John.''\n  (Man): ``Prices are as low as when my dad started farming.''\n  (Woman): ``It's bad, alright.''\n  (Man): ``Farmers are suffering because foreign markets have been \nclosed to us and our own government won't even help.''\n  (Woman): ``I hear the Thompsons are going to have to quit farming \nafter four generations.''\n  (Man): ``I can't even bear to think about it.''\n  (Announcer): Tell Congress we need a sound, strong trade policy. Call \n202-225-3121.\n  And there are graphics on the screen that show the phone number, that \ndirect viewers to tell Congress that we need to pass initiatives like \n``IMF Funding'' and ``Sanctions Reform'', and they give the number for \nthe Capitol switchboard. Again, this is a pure issue ad that we \nwouldn't touch.\n  Now, some of our opponents have said that we are simply opening the \nfloodgates in allowing soft money to now be channeled through these \nindependent groups for electioneering purposes. To that, I would say \nthat this bill would prohibit members from directing money to these \ngroups to affect elections, so that would cut out an entire avenue of \nsolicitation for funds, not to mention any real or perceived ``quid pro \nquo''.\n  Furthermore, I find it both interesting and remarkable that in many \ncases our opponents who are making this claim on the one hand are at \nthe same time claiming that we're choking off free speech. That the \nprovision ``restricts citizen speech'' by ``severely limiting the \nsources of money that can be used for such speech'', as FEC \nCommissioner Bradley Smith wrote in a Wall Street Journal piece on \nMarch 20, 2001. So my question is, which is it? Is it opening the \nfloodgates, or is it choking off speech? Because you can't have it both \nways.\n  Opponents have also referred to the NAACP versus Alabama Supreme \nCourt case to say that our disclosure provisions are unconstitutional. \nAnd I want to take this opportunity to refute what is yet another \nmisrepresentation.\n  The fact of the matter is, NAACP was about the disclosure of an \nentire membership list of a black civil rights organization in Alabama \nin the 1950's. The law struck down in that case forced the NAACP in \nAlabama, an issue advocacy organization, to disclose all of its members \nor to leave the State. I hope no one would suggest that's equitable to \ntoday. The bottom line is, we only require disclosure of major donors. \nAnd there is no guaranteed right to anonymity when it comes to \ncampaigning. In fact, the court has said time and again that disclosure \nis in the public interest because it gives the public details as to the \nnature and source of the information they are getting.\n  The fact is, any group may be entitled to an exemption from \nelectioneering disclosure laws if it can demonstrate a reasonable \nprobability that compelled disclosure will subject it members to \nthreats or reprisals. But the need for these kinds of limited \nexceptions don't make the general disclosure rules contained in Snowe-\nJeffords unconstitutional.\n  I want to reiterate to my colleagues that the language in this bill \nwas carefully and narrowly crafted in consultation with noted \nconstitutional scholars and reformers. In doing so, the provision was \nbased on the precept that the Supreme Court has made clear that, for \nconstitutional purposes, campaigning which make no mistake, these ads \ndo--is different from other speech. It builds upon bedrock legal and \nconstitutional principles, extending current regulation cautiously and \nonly in the areas in which the first amendment is at its lowest \nthreshold, such as disclosure and prohibitions on union and corporation \nspending.\n  It also was crafted to keep with the spirit of the Supreme Court's \nrequirements that any laws we pass that might have an impact on speech \nnot be overly vague or substantially overly-broad. In fact, let me \nquote from a scholar's letter from the Brennan Center dated March 12, \n2001, which was signed by 70 law professors and scholars from all over \nthe country in support of the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold in \ngeneral and of this provision specifically.\n  In the letter, they say, ``the Court did not declare that all \nlegislatures were stuck with these magic words--in other words, the \nterms like ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' that denote whether or not \nan ad contains express advocacy, and therefore is currently subject to \nregulation--or words like them, for all time. To the contrary, Congress \nhas the power to enact a statute that defines electioneering in a more \nnuanced manner, as long as its definition adequately addresses the \nvagueness and overbreadth concerns expressed by the Court.''\n  And the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, we do address those two \nconcerns, and we do so very well. No wonder then that every living \nperson to have served as ACLU President, ACLU Executive Director, ACLU \nLegal Director, or ACLU Legislative Director--with the exception of \ncurrent leadership--has signed onto a letter supporting our approach. \nEvery single one of them.\n  Already I have established how our provision is not even remotely \nvague. As that Brennan Center scholars' letter says that was signed by \n70 scholars, ``Because the test for prohibited electioneering is \ndefined with great clarity, it satisfies the Supreme Court's vagueness \nconcerns. Any sponsor will know, with absolute certainty, whether the \nad depicts or names a candidate and how many days before an election it \nis being broadcast. There is little danger that a sponsor would \nmistakenly censor its own protected speech out of fear of prosecution \nunder such a clear standard.''\n  As for the issue of overbreadth--that we'd be capturing all kinds of \nads that aren't electioneering--well, the evidence belies those claims. \nJust consider how well this test works when compared to what's going on \nin real life. In the final 2 months of an election, 95 percent of the \nissue ads Annenberg studied in the top 75 media markets mentioned the \nnames of candidates.\n  They do it because they know what's effective. These people don't \nspend umpteen amounts of dollars on ads hoping that maybe they work. \nThey know their message is clear. And they know that using the name of \nFederal candidates in their ads near the election is an effective way \nof influencing the election. That's why Snowe-Jeffords keys in on the \nnaming of candidates as one of the triggers of our disclosure \nregulations.\n  And the numbers bear out how effective the ads really are. In the \nfinal two months before the 2000 election, 94 percent of all the \ntelevised issue ad spots were seen as making a case for or against a \ncandidate by the Annenberg study. Ninety-four percent. Now, what was \nthe content of these ads? Well, in the final 2 months of the election, \nfully 84 percent of those ads seen as electioneering ads were also seen \nas having an attack component. Over 8 out of every 10 ads were \nattacking--not comparing or offering information but attacking.\n  But perhaps most compelling is a recent joint study between the \nBrennan Center and Kenneth Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin and \nJonathan Krasno, visiting fellow at Yale. The report specifically \nstudied issue ads within the context of the Snowe-Jeffords test, during \nthe 2000 elections and in the top 75 media markets.\n  And you know what they found? They found that just one percent of all \nthose ads run during the year that were viewed as actual genuine issue \nads and mentioned Federal candidates were captured by our provision. In \nother words, of all the so-called issue ads that ran last year and \nmentioned Federal candidates, 99 percent of those that ran in the last \n60 days were seen as electioneering ads. If you had any test that was \naccurate 99 percent of the time, I believe you'd say that was a pretty \ngood test.\n  I must emphasize once again that the Supreme Court has never said \nthere is one single, permissible route to determine if a communication \nis influencing a Federal election. And to explain why that is the case, \nlet me refer to a column written by Norman Ornstein, who was \ninstrumental in developing the Snowe-Jeffords provision along with \nnumerous other constitutional experts.\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\n  He said, in 1974, ``the Supreme Court rejected as overly broad the \n1974 Congressional decision to include in its regulatory net any \ncommunication `for the purpose of influencing' a Federal election. \nInstead, the court drew a line between direct campaign activities, or \n`express advocacy', and other political speech. The former could be \nregulated, at least in terms of limits on contributions; the latter had \ngreater first amendment protection.\n  ``How to define express advocacy? The High Court in a footnote gave \nsome suggestions to fill the resulting vacuum and to define the \ndifference between the two kinds of advocacy. Express advocacy, the \njustices said, would cover communications that included words such as \n`vote for,' `vote against,' `elect,' or `defeat.' The Court did not say \nthat the only forms of express advocacy are those using the specific \nwords above. Those were examples.''\n  The bottom line is, Buckley versus Valeo is in effect the law of the \nland because Congress has not superseded it by filling the vacuum in \nthe quarter century that followed. In other words, since 1976, Congress \nhas not passed a law concerning campaign financing, and so hasn't sent \nany new law to the Court because we haven't done anything in the last \nquarter century. So the Court has no guidepost. If Congress acts, the \nSupreme Court will give its due deference to what we do on behalf of \nprotecting our system of elections.\n  We well know what has happened in the quarter century since. We have \nseen the kind of development and evolution of these ads--we have a \nrecord of how they are seen to be influencing Federal elections. This \nis a monstrosity that has evolved in terms of the so-called sham ads \nthat are having a true impact on our election process in a way that I \ndo not think the Supreme Court could foresee back in 1976 and we, as \ncandidates, could not possibly envision. Well, now we will.\n  This is a narrowly crafted, well-vetted provision that is vital if we \nare to say with a straight face that we have done something to enact \nreal campaign finance reform. Again, I'm pleased to have been able to \nwork so closely with Senators McCain and Feingold and others in helping \nmake campaign finance reform both comprehensive and meaningful. This \nwill be a victory for the United States Senate, but most of all a \nvictory for the voters of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine for the \ncritical role she has played in this effort and the victory we are \nabout to have.\n  Now I have the pleasure of yielding to the Senator from Connecticut, \nwho I must say is the person most responsible for what was actually the \nfirst piece of campaign finance reform legislation in decades, the bill \nthat addressed the 527 problem. He then was a magnificent candidate on \nour party for Vice President. Despite his national prominence on that \nissue, and the wonderful job he did on that, and the heartbreaking \nloss, he didn't waste any time. He came right back in his own modest \nway, as a team player, and worked with us to help us pass this bill. I \nam grateful for that and just think he is a class act.\n  I am happy to yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWisconsin for his extraordinary leadership and for his very gracious \nwords, which I appreciate personally.\n  With the vote on final passage of the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan \nbill about to occur, we are fast approaching the end of an incredible \nodyssey, one that, while perhaps not as long as that of the mythical \nOdysseus, has certainly been every bit as challenging, suspenseful, and \nepic.\n  Time and again, the efforts to reform our campaign finance system \nhave faced ruin as its proponents have been forced to sail between \ntheir own versions of Scylla and Charybdis, required to resist their \nown special calls of the Sirens.\n  But, due to the incredible tenacity and profound principle of our \nleaders in this struggle, Senators McCain and Feingold, Congress has \nfound the strength to reach our own Ithaca here today, and to finally \ntry to clear our house of suitors seeking special favors at the expense \nof the greater good. For that extraordinary leadership, I thank Senator \nFeingold and I thank Senator McCain. They have made an enormous \ndifference.\n  I must say, in some senses I joined this odyssey--though I had been \ninterested in it before--but I joined it with a new sense of commitment \nin 1997, when the Governmental Affairs Committee conducted its year-\nlong investigation into campaign finance abuses in the 1996 Federal \nelections. With the passage of time, the shock of that investigation's \nrevelations have started to fade. But it is critical that we remember \nthem because they represent precisely what is most wrong with the \nsystem we plan to change and precisely what helped to begin in full \nforce the effort that is about to reach a successful conclusion.\n  We should not forget the cast of characters that we all became \nfamiliar within those investigations, hustlers such as Johnny Chung--\nremember the name--who compared the White House to a subway saying:\n\n       You have to put coins in to open the gates.\n\n  Or Roger Tamraz, who told us that he didn't even bother to register \nto vote because he knew that his huge donations would get him so much \nmore than the vote would.\n  These men were on the margins. Though they never got what they wanted \nfor their money, their stories and the many more like them contributed \nto the cynicism too many Americans have about their elected leaders and \nthe skepticism they have about their own ability to influence their \nGovernment.\n  Johnny Chung, Roger Tamraz, and all the rest may have been unusual in \nthe unsophisticated bull-in-a-China-shop way in which they tried to \nplay the system. But their essential insight, if I can call it that, \nthat big dollar donations buy the access that enables you to get what \nyou want, is one that does pervade our political culture. That insight \nis shared and acted upon daily by the mainstream special interests \nwhose soft money donations have exponentially dwarfed those of the 1996 \ninvestigation's and 1997 election's most colorful characters, who use \nthe access they buy to try to mold the Nation's policies and agenda in \ntheir own image.\n  The result has been a system that often leaves the average person \ndisempowered, disinterested, and disengaged from our political process \nwhere the average person's annual income, in many cases--mostly doesn't \neven approach the cost of the ticket to our political parties' most \nelite fundraising events. This causes the average people, the majority, \nto continually question why their leaders are taking the actions they \ntake. It causes those of us in public life to work, too often, under a \ncloud of suspicion, with our citizenry wondering whose interests are \nbeing served.\n  The demise of the Enron Corporation in the last several months is but \nthe most recent example of this phenomenon. It is, I know, regularly \nstated that Enron is a corporate scandal but not necessarily a \npolitical one. That at this moment is quite literally true. It is too \nearly to conclude whether anyone in Government did anything \ninappropriate or illegal for Enron. But I do know that a company with \nan ultimately insecure and unethical business model run by individuals \nof shakier business ethics yet, repeatedly found an open door to the \noffices of the politically powerful--in no small part, I presume, \nbecause of the millions of dollars of political donations the company \nmade.\n  So this is not Enron's political scandal alone. It is all of ours. \nThat is probably why the Enron scandal may have given this noble effort \nthe final boost it needed to make it to Ithaca.\n  All of us have been hurt by it. Politicians are under suspicion, \nlegitimate legislative causes have been tarnished only because Enron \nonce supported them, and the American people whose confidence in the \nintegrity of our system has been shaken.\n  Fortunately, the Senate is about to act to make the system better. \nNone of us is under any illusion that the enactment of this bill will \nmake our system pristine, or eliminate totally the impact of money on \npolitics. As has often been said, money, like water, always seems to \nfind a new place to flow\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nthrough our political system. But this bill will have an impact. It \nwill be a very good one. That impact will result from the closing of \nthe large soft money loophole that has been allowed to open up in the \npost-Watergate campaign finance reform laws.\n\n  Before yielding the floor, I would like to point with pride to one \nother part of this bill. This bill includes an amendment that Senator \nThompson and I have been working on since shortly after the conclusion \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee's 1997 investigation. That \namendment resulted from our frustration that some of the worst actors \nin the 1996 scandals, individuals who clearly broke the law and were \nconvicted for breaking it, escaped without significant punishment. The \nreason? The criminal provisions of our campaign finance laws just are \nnot strong enough.\n  Our amendment remedies that by authorizing felony charges for \nviolations of the Federal Election Campaign Act, expending FECA's \nstatute of limitations, and directing the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \npromulgate a specific guideline for sentencing for those who violate \nour campaign finance laws.\n  The combination of these changes will put teeth into our campaign \nfinance laws and ensure that those who willfully violate them will not \nagain escape without serious consequences.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Feingold for his reference to the so-called \n527 legislation that we worked on together and passed in the Senate. It \nis a sad irony that on this very day, when we are about to pass the \nMcCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan bill, the House Ways and Means Committee \nhas adopted a version of 527 which really guts it. I hope my colleagues \nin the Senate will not accept that undermining of that important \ncampaign finance law.\n  In sum, for too long we have watched our Nation's greatest treasure, \nour commitment to democracy, be pillaged by the ever escalating money \nchase. It is time to say enough is enough. It is time to restore \npolitical influence to where our Nation's founding principles say it \nshould be: with the people, with the voters. That is what this proposal \nwill do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Ithaca--I mean the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, for his very fine remarks. I would be remiss if I did \nnot say the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Louisiana, pledged \nher support at a very critical time, and stood with us all the way \nthrough this debate. I thank her for her help on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield 7 minutes of my 8 minutes to \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                   Soft Money Ban and Sham Issue Ads\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise as the sponsor of the campaign \nfinance reform bill that was passed last year by the Senate and a few \nweeks ago by the House, and is currently before the Senate one final \ntime. We have worked for a number of years now for what is before us \ntoday: The opportunity to pass significant campaign finance reform \nlegislation and send it to the President for his signature.\n  Over these years, many have explained why it is imperative that we \nfix our campaign finance laws, close loopholes that have been exploited \nto the point of making a mockery of our laws, and put an end to the \ncorrupting influence of big money on our democracy.\n  I would like to address the two central provisions of our bill--the \nsoft money ban and the provisions dealing with sham issue ads. Working \nwith our friends in the House, we have drafted a bill that promotes \nimportant first amendment values, promotes enhanced citizen \nparticipation in our democracy, is workable, and is carefully crafted \nto steer clear of asserted constitutional pitfalls.\n  Anyone who reads this bill and the debates should come away with the \nclear understanding that Congress approached this task with a fealty \nand dedication to the Constitution, and with a desire to get it right. \nWe are acting today to fix a real problem and have made our best effort \nto do so in a way that will be upheld by the courts.\n  This bill represents a balanced approach which addresses the very \nreal danger that Federal contribution limits could be evaded by \ndiverting funds to State and local parties, which then use those funds \nfor Federal election activity. At the same time, the bill does not \nattempt to regulate State and local party spending where this danger is \nnot present, and where State and local parties engage in purely non-\nFederal activities. We will not succeed in closing the soft-money \nloophole unless we address the problem at the State and local level. We \ndo this, however, while preserving the rights and abilities of our \nState and local parties to engage in truly local activity.\n  In order to close the existing soft money loophole and prevent \nmassive evasion of Federal campaign finance laws, the soft money ban \nmust operate not just at the national party level but at the State and \nlocal level as well. We have authority to extend the soft money reforms \nto the State and local level where it is necessary, as it is here, to \nprotect the integrity of Federal elections. Closing the loophole is \ncrucial to prevent evasion of the new Federal rules.\n  As we all know, state party spending may not always clearly divide \nbetween Federal and non-Federal purposes. For example, when a State \nparty conducts a ``get-out-the-vote drive,'' it benefits both its \nFederal and non-Federal candidates. Consequently, if the State party \ncommittee pays for the drive with soft dollars, the committee is using \nfederally prohibited contributions in connection with a Federal \nelection to benefit federal candidates.\n  Currently 14 States, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, \nIllinois, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Virginia \nand Wyoming, allow unlimited contributions--that would be barred at the \nFederal level--from individuals, unions, PACs, and corporations. In \naddition, 36 States do not restrict soft money transfers from national \nparties to State and local parties. To illustrate the size of these \ntransfers, in the 2000 election, the national Democratic Party funneled \napproximately $145 million and the Republican Party transferred $129 \nmillion to their affiliated State parties to take advantage of the \nState parties' ability to spend a larger percentage of soft money on \nadvertisements featuring Federal candidates.\n  The reports issued by the majority and minority of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee charged with investigating campaign \nfinance abuses in the 1996 elections illustrate the extent to which the \ncoffers of Federal and State political parties are intertwined. In \n1996, the State parties spent money they received from the national \nparties on advertisements considered key to their Presidential \ncandidate's election. The Minority Report makes clear that State \nparties often act as mere conduits, exercising no independent judgment \nover the ads. For example, in an internal memo discussing how to run \nso-called issue ads using soft money that would benefit Senator Dole's \ncampaign, an RNC official wrote: ``Some have voiced concern that buying \nthrough the State parties could result in a loss of control on our \npart. There is absolutely no reason to be concerned about this.'' The \nbottom line is, whatever the technical niceties, soft money is being \nspent by State parties to support Federal campaigns. In fact, much of \nthe soft money spent in the 2000 elections to support Federal campaigns \nwas spent by State parties.\n  Congress has a compelling interest in ensuring that State parties do \nnot use backdoor tactics to finance Federal election campaigns in this \nway. It has an interest in ensuring that Federal elections activities \nare paid for with funds raised in a non-corrupting manner and in \naccordance with the Federal guidelines.\n  State parties receive soft money to influence Federal elections in \nthe form of direct contributions to State parties and transfers from \nnational parties for this purpose. Much of this money is then spent on \ntelevision advertisements attacking or promoting Federal candidates and \nother activities that we all know are designed to, and do, influence \nFederal elections. State parties\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nalso use soft money to fund ``party building activities,'' such as get-\nout-the-vote and voter registration drives. But, again, all of us know \nthat these activities, while vitally important to our democracy, are \ndesigned to, and do have an unmistakable impact on both Federal and \nnon-Federal elections. Currently, State parties pay for these \nactivities using a mixture of hard and soft money pursuant to \nallocation formulae set by the Federal Election Commission. But current \nallocation rules have proven wholly inadequate to guard against the use \nof soft money to influence Federal campaigns.\n\n  While national parties will no longer be able to transfer soft money \nto State parties, some State parties will still be able to receive \nlarge contributions from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy \nindividuals, subject to state laws. So unless we close the loophole at \nthe State and local level, we will be right back to the unacceptable \nsituation of having non-Federal money--large contributions from \ncorporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals--used to affect \nFederal elections. That is because, one, many States allow unlimited \ncontributions from individuals, unions, PACs, corporations and national \nparties to State and local parties; and two, we know from experience \nthat State parties are spending massive sums of soft money to influence \nFederal elections.\n  Thus, if left unregulated, or merely subject to existing FEC \nallocation rules, State and local party activity presents the \nopportunity for massive evasion. Restrictions on the raising of soft \nmoney by Federal candidates and officeholders do not, on their own, \nprevent evasion of the soft money ban. There will always be persons \nclearly associated with Presidential or other Federal candidates, but \nnot covered by these provisions, who can raise soft money for state \nparties to funnel into Federal elections. In addition, those who seek \nto avoid Federal contribution limits can make huge contributions to \nState and local parties in order to assist particular Federal \ncandidates.\n  Current law, of course, requires that State and local parties spend \nexclusively hard money when they engage in certain activities that \naffect Federal elections. For example, if a State party were to run an \nad expressly advocating the election of a Federal candidate, the party \nwould have to pay for the ad with hard money. The bill simply applies \nthis same principle to an additional category of activities, defined as \n``Federal election activity,'' that, in the judgment of Congress, also \nclearly affect Federal elections. By contrast, as the bill makes clear, \nactivities that affect purely non-Federal elections are left \nunregulated by the bill, and remain subject to the applicable State \nlaw.\n  Some argue that the soft money given to State parties is used only \nfor ``party building'' that is wholly unrelated to any activity that in \ndesign or practice influences Federal elections. This is demonstrably \nfalse. The fact is, much of the soft money that goes to State parties \nis spent on activities that influence Federal elections. In the 1996 \nPresidential election, for example, State parties spent many millions \nof dollars on television ads that promoted their Presidential \ncandidates. The money for these ads, moreover, in many cases was either \ntransferred from the national parties or contributed by donors directly \nto the State parties.\n  Some have also argued that the Federal Government lacks the \nconstitutional authority to regulate the collection and use of funds by \nState and local parties. There can be no serious doubt, however, that \nthe Federal Government has the constitutional authority to regulate \nactivity that affects Federal elections, and that soft money is used at \nthe State and local level for this purpose. In fact, existing law \nalready prohibits State and local parties from using soft money to \nexplicitly support a Federal candidate. All that the bill does is \nextend this existing law to close existing loopholes, thereby ensuring \nthat activities that actually influence Federal elections are subject \nto Federal limitations and rules, while leaving purely State and local \ncampaign activities by State parties subject to applicable State law.\n  Finally, the argument that the bill would somehow undermine the \nstatus of State and local parties and prevent them from conducting \ngrassroots campaign activities is similarly incorrect. If anything, the \nmassive influx of soft money from the national parties has turned State \nand local parties into mere pass-through accounts for the national \nparties and for large, direct contributions from corporations, unions \nand wealthy individuals. If anything, the bill will return the State \nand local parties to the grassroots and encourage them to broaden their \nbases and reach out to average voters.\n  It is a key purpose of the bill to stop the use of soft money as a \nmeans of buying influence and access with Federal officeholders and \ncandidates. Thus, we have established a system of prohibitions and \nlimitations on the ability of Federal officeholders and candidates to \nraise, spend, and control soft money.\n  The bill prohibits Federal officeholders, Federal candidates, their \nagents, and entities they directly or indirectly establish, finance, \nmaintain or control, from soliciting, receiving, directing, \ntransferring or spending funds in connection with an election for \nFederal office, including funds for any Federal election activity, \nunless such funds are ``hard money.''\n  Furthermore, it prohibits Federal officeholders, Federal candidates, \ntheir agents, or entities they directly or indirectly establish, \nfinance, maintain or control from soliciting, receiving, directing, \ntransferring or spending funds in connection with a non-Federal \nelection from sources prohibited from making ``hard money'' \ncontributions. It likewise prohibits such individuals and entities from \nsoliciting, receiving, directing, transferring or spending funds--in \nconnection with a non-Federal election--from individuals or \nFederal PACs that are in excess of the ``hard money'' amounts permitted \nto be contributed to candidates and political committees by individuals \nand Federal PACs.\n\n  These provisions break no new conceptual grounds in either public \npolicy or constitutional law. This prohibition on solicitation is no \ndifferent from the Federal laws and ethical rules that prohibit Federal \nofficeholders from using their offices or positions of power to solicit \nmoney or other benefits. Indeed, statutes like these have been on the \nbooks for over 100 years for the same reason that we're prohibiting \ncertain solicitations to deter the opportunity for corruption to grow \nand flourish, to maintain the integrity of our political system, and to \nprevent any appearance that our Federal laws, policies, or activities \ncan be inappropriately compromised or sold.\n  For example, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 generally prohibits \nMembers of Congress or Federal officers and employees from soliciting \nanything of value from anyone who seeks official action from them, does \nbusiness with them, or has interests that may be substantially affected \nby the performance of official duties. No one could seriously argue \nthat this prohibition is without a compelling purpose. The same holds \ntrue here. We are prohibiting Federal officeholders, candidates, and \ntheir agents from soliciting funds in connection with an election, \nunless such funds are from sources and in amounts permitted under \nFederal law. The reason for this is to deter any possibility that \nsolicitations of large sums from corporations, unions, and wealthy \nprivate interests will corrupt or appear to corrupt our Federal \nGovernment or undermine our political system with the taint of \nimpropriety.\n  The solicitation rules in the bill are also consistent with Federal \ncriminal laws that prohibit Congressional candidates and incumbents, \namong others, from knowingly soliciting political contributions from \nany Federal officer or employee or from any contractor who renders \npersonal services. It is also directly akin in purpose to the Federal \ncriminal law that prohibits any person from soliciting or receiving any \npolitical contribution in any Federal room or building occupied in the \ndischarge of a Federal officer's or employer's duties.\n  The rule here is simple: Federal candidates and officeholders cannot \nsolicit soft money funds, funds that do not comply with Federal \ncontribution limits and source prohibitions, for any party committee--\nnational, State or local.\n  This, of course, means that a Federal candidate or officeholder may \ncontinue to solicit hard money for party committees. A Federal \ncandidate or officeholder may solicit up to $25,000 per\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\nyear for a national party committee from an individual.\n  Similarly, the Federal candidate or officeholder may solicit up to \n$15,000 per year for a national party committee from a PAC.\n  Under the bill, a Federal candidate or officeholder may solicit hard \nmoney donations for State party committees to spend in connection with \na Federal election, including for voter registration and GOTV \nactivities, of up to $10,000 per year from an individual and up to \n$5,000 per year from a PAC.\n  In addition, a Federal candidate or officeholder may solicit money \nfor a State party to spend on non-Federal elections. The amount, \nhowever, would be subject to the Federal limits and source \nprohibitions. Therefore, a Federal candidate or officeholder may \nsolicit up to $10,000 a year from an individual and $5,000 a year from \na PAC for a State party's non-Federal account, even if that same \nindividual or PAC has already given a similar amount to the State \nparty's Federal, or hard money, account.\n  State parties must fund ``Federal election activities,'' including \nvoter registration or get-out-the-vote drives, with hard money, except \nfor certain non-Federal funds that may be used pursuant to the ``Levin \namendment'' to fund such activities. The Levin amendment, however, \nexpressly provides that Federal candidates and officeholders may not \nsolicit the non-Federal funds to be spent under the Levin amendment.\n  One important restriction in the bill applies to fundraising for so-\ncalled Leadership PACs, which are political committees, other than a \nprincipal campaign committee, affiliated with a Member of Congress. A \nFederal officeholder or candidate is prohibited from soliciting \ncontributions for a Leadership PAC that do not comply with the Federal \nhard money source and amount limitations. Thus, the Federal \nofficeholder or candidate could solicit up to $5,000 per year from an \nindividual or PAC for the Federal account of the Leadership PAC and an \nadditional $5,000 from an individual or a PAC for the non-Federal \naccount of the leadership PAC. The Federal officeholder or candidate \ncould not solicit any corporate or labor union treasury contributions \nfor either the Federal or non-Federal accounts of the PAC. Moreover, \nunder the bill, a Federal candidate or officeholder could not directly \nor indirectly establish, finance, maintain or control a PAC that raises \nor spends contributions that do not comply with these limits. Nor could \na Leadership PAC controlled by a Federal candidate or officeholder \nspend funds from its non-Federal account on Federal election activities \nor in connection with a Federal election.\n  The bill also restricts fundraising for state candidates. A Federal \nofficeholder or candidate may solicit no more than $2,000 per election \nfrom an individual for a State candidate and no more than $5,000 per \nelection from a PAC for a state candidate. These limits correspond to \nthe Federal hard money source and amount limitations for contributions \nto Federal candidates. Moreover, a Federal officeholder or candidate \nmay not ask a single individual to donate amounts to all state \ncandidates in a 2-year election cycle that in the aggregate exceed \n$37,500, which corresponds to the aggregate amount of ``hard money'' \nthat individuals may donate to all Federal candidates over a 2-year \ncycle.\n  The bill also restricts fundraising for certain other 527 \norganizations. A Federal officeholder or candidate may not solicit more \nthan a $5,000 donation in a calendar year from an individual or a PAC \nfor a non-party 527 that is not a Federal committee or State \ncandidate's campaign committee. Furthermore, a Federal officeholder or \ncandidate may not ask a single individual to donate amounts in a 2-year \nelection cycle to multiple 527's of this nature that in the aggregate \nexceed $37,500--which corresponds to the aggregate amount of ``hard \nmoney'' an individual may donate to PACs over a 2-year cycle.\n  Proposed new section 323(e)(4)(B) of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct authorizes the only permissible solicitations by Federal candidates \nor officeholders for donations to a 501(c) organization whose principal \npurpose is to engage in get-out-the-vote and voter registration \nactivities described in new section 301(20)(A)(i)&(ii) of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act. The new section also authorizes the only \npermissible solicitations for a 501(c) organization that can be made by \nFederal candidates or officeholders explicitly for funds to carry out \nsuch activities.\n  In these instances, a Federal candidate or officeholder may solicit \nonly individuals for donations and may not request donations in an \namount larger than $20,000 per year. Section 323(e)(4)(B) applies only \nto 501(c) organizations. The section does not authorize any such \nsolicitations for other entities, and it does not authorize \nsolicitations for funds to be spent on so-called ``issue ads.''\n  Thus, a Federal officeholder or candidate may not solicit corporate \nor union treasury donations, or donations from an individual of more \nthan $20,000 per year, for a 501(c) tax-exempt organization where the \nprincipal purpose of the organization is to engage in get-out-the vote \nor voter registration activities as defined in new 2 U.S.C. section \n431(20)(A)(i)&(ii). Likewise, a Federal officeholder or candidate may \nnot solicit corporate or union treasury donations or donations from an \nindividual of more than $20,000 per year for any 501(c) tax-exempt \norganization where the solicitation is explicitly to obtain funds for \nthe organization to engage in such activities.\n  Conversely, the bill permits a Federal officeholder or candidate to \nsolicit funds without source or amount limitation for a 501(c) tax-\nexempt organization that is not an organization whose principal purpose \nis to engage in get-out-the-vote or voter registration activities as \ndefined in new 2 U.S.C. section 431(20)(A)(i)&(ii), provided that such \nsolicitation is not specifically to obtain funds for the organization \nto engage in Federal election activities or activities in connection \nwith elections.\n  For example, the bill's solicitation restrictions would not apply to \na Federal candidate soliciting funds for the Red Cross explicitly to be \nused for a blood drive--as this is not an organization whose principal \npurpose is to engage in get-out-the-vote or voter registration \nactivities and the solicitation is not expressly to obtain funds for \nsuch activities.\n  Finally, the purpose of section 323(e)(4) is to permit only \nindividual candidates or officeholders to assist, in limited ways, \nsection 501(c) organizations. This permission does not extend to an \nofficeholder or candidate acting on behalf of an entity--including a \npolitical party.\n  In addition, I would like to address the growing sham issue advocacy \nloophole.\n  What are these so-called ``issue ads\"? The Supreme Court in its \nBuckley decision made a distinction in the context of speech by \nindividuals and entities other than candidates and political parties, \nbetween speech that promoted a candidate, which the Court called \n``express advocacy,'' and speech that addressed public issues, which it \ncalled ``issue advocacy.'' The Court held that expenditures for public \ncommunications by both candidates and political parties ``are, by \ndefinition, campaign related,'' and so are always covered by the \ncampaign finance laws, regardless of the language these ads use. With \nrespect to ads run by non-candidates and outside groups, however, the \nCourt indicated that to avoid vagueness, federal election law \ncontribution limits and disclosure requirements should apply only if \nthe ads contain ``express advocacy.'' In a footnote, the Court gave \nexamples of express advocacy, such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' \n``support,'' and ``defeat.'' The Supreme Court did not foreclose the \npossibility that ads with strong electioneering content that omitted \nthe ``magic words'' could also be limited.\n  Despite the Buckley holding regarding political parties, the FEC has \nallowed political parties to get away with using soft money for so \ncalled ``issue ads.'' Outside groups, meanwhile, have exploited the \n``magic words'' test, using it to justify advertisements that plainly \nsupport or attack Federal candidates without using the ``magic words.''\n\n  The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee investigation found \nflagrant abuses by both Presidential campaigns in the 1996 elections. \nBoth Presidential candidates raised soft money to spend on sham issue \nads. Both Presidential campaigns were directly involved with their \nparty committees in\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\ncreating and running soft-money funded TV ad campaigns designed to \nsupport their candidates.\n  One example, an RNC commercial entitled ``The Story,'' movingly \ndepicts Senator Bob Dole's recovery from wounds he sustained in World \nWar II. On ABC News, Senator Dole described how the RNC disguised this \nad campaign as issue advocacy: ``it never says that I'm running for \nPresident, though I hope it's fairly obvious, since I'm the only one in \nthe picture!''\n  Similar abuses have occurred in congressional races. In the 2000 \nelection, the Democratic party, DNC, DSCC and NY State Democratic \nParty, spent a combined $7.1 million in New York's highly contested \nSenate race. In one soft money-funded ad, aired in July 2000, the New \nYork State Democratic Committee criticized Republican Representative \nRick Lazio's record on prescription drugs for seniors. The ad showcased \nan elderly couple who were forced to return to work to pay for their \nmedicines. The ad then accused Lazio of voting against a Medicare Drug \nbenefit when he was a member of the House. Another New York Democratic \nParty soft money advertisement criticized Lazio's record on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The ad said, ``Rick Lazio voted against the \nreal enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. The one endorsed by nurses, \ndoctors, the heart, lung, and cancer societies.''\n  In the November 1997 Special Election to fill Representative \nMolinari's seat, the RNC poured $800,000 into candidate-specific attack \nadvertisements. For example, the RNC bought this so-called ``issue \nad'':\n\n       The tax bite. Today New Yorkers pay the highest taxes in \n     the country because politicians like Eric Vitaliano keep \n     raising our taxes. Vitaliano raised taxes on families over $7 \n     billion. More taxes for more welfare. Welfare spending went \n     up 46 percent. Then Eric Vitaliano took a big bite for \n     himself, raising his own pay 74 percent. Call Eric Vitaliano. \n     Tell him to cut taxes, not take another bite out of our \n     futures.\n\n  Even though this was a special election with only one Republican \nfederal candidate on the ballot, the RNC contended that these ads were \nissue advertisements intended to educate the voters on the Republican \nParty's positions.\n  Likewise, the California Democratic Party ran sham issue \nadvertisements attacking Republican Steve Kuykendall, who was being \nchallenged by former Representative Jane Harman for the 36th District \nin California during the 2000 Elections. One of the Democratic ads \nattacked Kuykendall for taking ``secret'' contributions from Philip \nMorris Tobacco. The ad went on to say that Kuykendall ``voted for \nweaker penalties for selling tobacco to minors.'' The ad ends with, \n``Tell Steve Kuykendall to give the tobacco money back.''\n  The problem of political party soft money ads is addressed in this \nlegislation by banning national parties from raising and spending soft \nmoney, and by requiring state parties to spend only hard money on ads \nthat promote or attack Federal candidates, regardless of whether they \ncontain express advocacy.\n  But the sham ``issue ad'' problem is not limited to political \nparties. In 1996, the AFL-CIO spent $35 million on a so-called ``issue \nad'' campaign designed to restore a Democratic majority in the House. \nIt ran ads in 44 Republican districts, spending an average of $250,000 \nto $300,000 on media in the districts of the 32 House Republicans it \ntargeted. To counter the AFL-CIO campaign, the Chamber of Commerce \norganized 32 business groups to spend $5 million on a sham ``issue ad'' \ncampaign of their own. The purpose of this spending was overtly to \naffect Federal campaigns, as a guide for corporate spending published \nthe same year by the Business-Industry PAC illustrates. The guide \nlisted ``issue advocacy'' as one of five tools ``to be used to help \nreelect imperiled pro-business Senators and Representatives, defeat \nvulnerable anti-business incumbents, and elect free-enterprise \nadvocates.''\n  Federal election law has long barred unions and corporations from \nmaking expenditures in connection with Federal elections. However, by \nsponsoring their own putative ``issue ads,'' they circumvent this law. \nThe Snowe-Jeffords electioneering communications provision will help \nrestore the original intent of the law: to keep a tidal wave of union \nand corporate money out of Federal elections.\n  A comprehensive study of political ads by the Brennan Center for \nJustice shows just how parties and outside groups are financing \ncampaign ads with soft money. They evade campaign finance laws \nprohibiting the use of soft money on campaign ads by studiously \navoiding the use of the so-called ``magic words'' of ``vote for'' or \n``vote against'' in such ads. But these soft money-funded ads are \nnonetheless patently campaign ads. Indeed, 97 percent of the \nelectioneering ads reviewed as part of the Brennan Center's ``Buying \nTime 2000'' study did not use ``magic words''. The increasing \nirrelevance of ``magic words'' as a criteria for distinguishing between \ncampaign ads and issue discussion is also illustrated by close \nexamination of campaign ads run by candidates, financed with hard \nmoney. Even these hard money-funded ads used magic words only 10 \npercent of the time in 2000--and 4 percent of the time in 1998.\n\n  The sham issue ad subterfuge--permitting outside groups to spend \nsupposedly prohibited soft money on campaign ads without disclosing \neven a dime of that spending--will continue unless Congress draws a \nmore accurate line between campaign ads and issue ads. Clearly, even a \ncasual observer would concede that ``magic words'' is a dramatically \nunderinclusive test for determining what constitutes a campaign ad.\n  This bill would simply subject soft money-funded campaign ads that \nmasquerade as issue discussion to the same laws that have long governed \ncampaign ads. Under the bill, corporations and labor unions could no \nlonger spend soft money on broadcast, cable or satellite communications \nthat refer to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office during \nthe 60 days before a general election and the 30 days before a primary, \nand that are targeted to that candidate's electorate. These entities \ncould, however, use their PACs to finance such ads. This will ensure \nthat corporate and labor campaign ads proximate to Federal elections, \nlike other campaign ads, are paid for with limited contributions from \nindividuals and that such spending is fully disclosed.\n  This attempt to put teeth back into our campaign finance laws is \ncarefully crafted to pass constitutional muster. According to the \nBrennan Center's ``Buying Time 2000'' study, less than one percent of \nthe group-sponsored soft-money ads covered by this provision of the \nbill were genuine issue discussion, more than 99 percent of these ads \nwere campaign ads. This degree of accuracy is more than sufficient to \novercome any claim of substantial overbreadth. Of course, the bill's \nbright line test also gives clear guidance to corporations and unions \nregarding which advertisements would be subject to campaign law and \nwhich advertisements would remain unregulated.\n  Furthermore, the bill does not explicitly or implicitly purport to \ndepart from the Supreme Court's holding in FEC versus Massachusetts \nCitizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238 (1986) (``MCFL''), or any other \nSupreme Court precedent. In MCFL, the Supreme Court found that a \nnonprofit, nonstock corporation, MCFL, had violated the Federal \nElection Campaign Act's prohibition on the use of general corporate \ntreasury funds by making an expenditure in connection with a Federal \nelection, but that the act's prohibition as applied to MCFL was \nunconstitutional, given its unique non-business purpose and character.\n  MCFL was expressly formed to promote political ideas and could not \nengage in business activities; MCFL had no shareholders or anyone else \nwho could make a claim for its assets or earnings; and MCFL was not \nestablished by a business corporation or labor union, and it did not \naccept contributions from such entities.\n  This legislation does not purport in any way, shape, or form to \noverrule or change the Supreme Court's construction of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act in MCFL. Just as an MCFL-type corporation, under \nthe Supreme Court's ruling, is exempt from the current prohibition on \nthe use of corporate funds for expenditures containing ``express \nadvocacy,'' so too is an MCFL-type corporation exempt from the \nprohibition in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment on the use of its treasury \nfunds to pay for ``electioneering communications.'' Nothing in the bill \npurports to change MCFL. The\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\ndefinitions and provisions of this bill, like every other law, are \nsubject to the Supreme Court's decisions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis excellent presentation on the central provisions of our bill. I \nwholeheartedly agree with the points he has made.\n\n\n                           WEALTHY CANDIDATES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues a \nquestion concerning the various new limits with respect to individual \ncontributions to candidates in the bill. There is a general increase of \nthe individual contribution limits, but there are also provisions that \nraise the possibility of additional increases if a candidate faces an \nopponent who spends a great deal of his or her personal fortune in a \nrace. Can the sponsors discuss their analysis of how those provisions \nmight affect Congress's authority to limit individual contributions?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his question. The \nbill increases the individual contribution limit to a candidate from \n$1,000 to $2,000 per election. It provides, in addition, higher limits \nfor contributions made to candidates running against opponents who \nspend large amounts of personal wealth. Those higher contribution \nlimits are set forth in section 304 of the bill.\n  The Supreme Court in Buckley upheld the $1,000 contribution limit \nestablished by the 1974 law as a permissible measure that serves the \ncompelling governmental interests of deterring corruption and the \nappearance of corruption. This ruling was in substance reaffirmed by \nthe Court's decision in 2000 in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri PAC. It is now \nvery well settled law that Congress has the power to set reasonable \nlimits on individual contributions to candidates. The Court has never \nsaid that the number picked by Congress is the upper or lower limit on \na reasonable determination. Indeed, it rejected the argument in Shrink, \nthat the diminished purchasing power of the Missouri contribution limit \nbecause of inflation caused it to be an unreasonably low amount.\n  It is possible that someone would attempt to challenge the $2,000 \ncontribution limit in light of the higher limits provided for some \nraces in section 304, and to argue that both limits cannot serve the \nsame interests of preventing corruption. Congress has concluded that \ncontributions in excess of $2,000 present a risk of actual and apparent \ncorruption. Section 304 does not take issue with this conclusion. In \nthis limited context, however, Congress has concluded that the \ncontribution limits--despite their fundamental importance in fighting \nactual and apparent corruption--should be relaxed to mitigate the \ncountervailing risk that they will unfairly favor those who are \nwilling, and able, to spend a small fortune of their own money to win \nelection.\n  We believe that Congress can reasonably determine that in the case of \na candidate running against a wealthy opponent and having to raise \nextraordinary amounts of money to keep pace with that opponent's \npersonal spending, that the risk of actual or apparent corruption from \nhigher, yet still limited, contribution limits is small enough to \npermit candidates to raise those greater contributions in those \nparticular circumstances.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree with the comments of the Senator from Arizona. \nI believe the Court's decisions indicate that a range of contribution \nlimits would be constitutional depending on the circumstances. \nCertainly, the determination through difficult negotiations in this \nbill that the limit should be raised to $2,000 per election, but not \nhigher, is an indication that Congress believes that in most races \ncontributions of greater than that amount present the appearance of \ncorruption.\n\n\n                             EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, when the McCain-Feingold bill passed \nthe Senate, it was to be effective 30 days after enactment. Would the \nsponsors please explain the decision to change the effective date of \nthe bill to November 6, 2002, and discuss the transition rules that \napply after that date? In addition, can they please clarify their \nintent concerning the campaign finance rules that will govern runoff \nelections should there be any in 2002?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for her question. Because of the \ndelay in getting the bill through the House, it became clear that there \nwould be a number of very complicated transition rule issues and \nimplementation problems if we were to try to put the bill into effect \nfor the 2002 elections. We reluctantly determined that it would simply \nnot be practical to apply new rules in the middle of the election \ncycle. To change the rules in the middle of the campaign would have \ncreated uncertainty and potential unfairness, particularly since \nprimaries are imminent in some States.\n  It is our intent, however, that the provisions of this bill will be \nfully in effect for the 2004 election cycle. In order to provide a \ncertain end to the soft money system, and completely insulate the 2004 \nelections from that system, the bill provides for an effective date of \nWednesday, November 6, 2002, the day after the 2002 elections. After \nthat date, no further soft money will be raised. The November 6, 2002, \neffective date will permit an orderly transition to the new soft money \nfree world.\n  Now as to the transition rules, we do allow soft money that the \nparties raise before November 6, 2002, to be used on expenses incurred \nin connection with the 2002 elections, and we intend that permission to \napply to runoff elections, recounts, or election contests arising out \nof this year's elections as well. We also do not intend the bill \nsubstantive provisions concerning advertising, such as Title II and the \n``stand by your ad provisions'', wealthy candidates, sections 304, 316, \nand 319, and contributions by minors, section 318, to apply to 2002 \nrunoff elections. In addition, in the event that a runoff election \noccurs after November 5, 2002, the national party would--until January \n1, 2003, be able to spend soft money received before November 6, 2002 \nto pay for the costs of non-Federal activities incurred in connection \nwith, and before the date of, that runoff election, and the state \nparties could spend soft money on Federal election activities in \nconnection with the runoff, as under current law.\n  On the other hand, the increased contribution limits in the bill take \neffect on January 1, 2003.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree with my friend from Arizona. Let me note, in \naddition, that the new effective date also helps to ensure that an \nexpedited court challenge to the law can be resolved well before the \n2004 election campaign gets underway. We recognize that a court \nchallenge to this bill is not only likely, but inevitable. We welcome \nthe challenge and firmly believe the courts will uphold what we have \ndone.\n  In section 403, the bill provides expedited judicial review rules and \nrules for an orderly process of intervention in the litigation that \ncould theoretically be filed shortly after the President signs the \nbill. That this will allow the litigation before a three-judge court \nhere in Washington, DC, to have progressed substantially even before \nthe operative provisions take effect in November. This expedited \njudicial review process will assist an orderly transition from the old \nsystem to the new system under this bill. Furthermore, the FEC is \ncharged with promulgating soft money regulations well before the date \nthat the soft money ban will take effect. In short, with enactment of \nthe bill, promulgations of key regulations, and a prompt and efficient \nresolution of the litigation, we will be in a position in which a new \ncampaign finance system can be implemented in a certain and sure \nfashion for the 2004 elections.\n\n\n                           section 323(f)(1)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I understand that questions have been \nraised about the provisions of the bill that prevent State candidates \nfrom spending non-Federal money on ads that mention Federal candidates. \nCan the sponsors clarify how these provisions might affect a State \ncandidate spending money on an ad that touts that candidate having \nreceived the endorsement of a Federal candidate or officeholder?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify this \nprovision, which is one of a number of provisions in the soft money ban \nintended to prevent new loopholes for spending soft money from \ndeveloping. New Sec. 323(f)(1) prohibits State candidates and \nofficeholders from spending non-Federal money on public communications \nthat refer to a clearly identified candidate\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nfor Federal office, regardless of whether a State candidate is also \nmentioned. This restriction, however, only applies to communications \nthat promote, support, attack or oppose the Federal candidate, \nregardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for \nor against a candidate.\n  Thus, it is not our intention to prohibit State candidates from \nspending non-Federal money to run advertisements that mention that they \nhave been endorsed by a Federal candidate or say that they identify \nwith a position of a named Federal candidate, so long as those \nadvertisements do not support, attack, promote or oppose the Federal \ncandidate, regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates \na vote for or against a candidate. The test for whether a communication \nis covered by Sec. 323(f)(1) will be whether the advertisement supports \nor opposes the Federal candidate rather than simply promoting the \ncandidacy of the State candidate who is paying for the communication. \nThat will be up to the FEC to determine in the first instance, but I \nbelieve that State candidate will be able to fairly easily comply with \nthis provision. All we are trying to prevent with this provision is the \nlaundering of soft money through State candidate campaigns for \nadvertisements promoting, attacking, supporting or opposing Federal \ncandidates.\n\n\n                              SECTION 212\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, section 212 of the bill modifies \nreporting requirements for independent expenditures. Can the sponsors \ndiscuss the changes to current law that they intend to make in this \nsection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be happy to explain this provision. Section 212 \nis intended to increase the disclosures of independent expenditures. \nCurrent law require such reports to be filed within 24 hours of the \nmaking of expenditure aggregating $1,000 or more, if the threshold \namount of expenditures is reached within the last 20 days before an \nelection. We add a provision requiring disclosure within 48 hours if \nindependent expenditures totaling $10,000 or more are made prior to the \n20th day before the election.\n  As part of the Department of Transportation appropriations bill for \n2001, Public Law No. 106-46, Congress required that these ``24 hour \nreports'' be received by the Commission within 24 hours, rather than \nsimply mailed within that time, which is the standard interpretation of \nthe term ``filing'' in the law. We do not intend in Sec. 212 to change \nthat requirement. Because these reports are very time sensitive, we \nbelieve they should be received by the Commission within the time \nperiod specified. Indeed, we believe that the Commission should have \nthe authority to require any other time sensitive report required by \nthis bill, such as the 24 hours reports required under Sec. Sec.  304 \nand 319 also to be received within 24 hours. The ready availability of \nfax machines and other forms of electronic communications should make \nit fairly easy to comply with this requirement.\n\n\n               HOUSE-PASSED CAMPAIGN FINANCE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, as my colleagues are aware, the House \npassed the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill in \nthe early morning hours of February 14, 2002. The bill that we are \ndebating today, and that we will pass and send to the President this \nweek, is the exact bill that the House passed. During the debate on the \nbill, Congressman Christopher Shays of Connecticut spoke on the floor \nat some length about the compelling need for the Congress to ban soft \nmoney. He related the enormous growth of soft money over the last \ndecade and the appearance of corruption that these unlimited \ncontributions from unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals cause. \nUsing examples such as the Enron debacle, the Hudson Casino \ncontroversy, the tobacco industry, and the infamous Roger Tamraz, \nCongressman Shays illustrated how soft money damages public confidence \nin the legislative process. He includes statements from former Members \nof Congress of the power of money in providing access to lawmakers and \nthe public cynicism that results when these stories become known.\n  Mr. Shays' remarks appear in the Congressional Record of February 13, \n2002 at pages H351-H353. I entirely agree with Mr. Shays' statement. In \nmy view, it explains very well the appearance problem that soft money \ncreates and provides an excellent justification for the action we are \nabout to take in this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my friend from Wisconsin, and I endorse Mr. \nShays' discussion on the reasons that Congress must act to ban soft \nmoney. Let me also call to my colleagues' attention a statement that \nMr. Shays made on February 13, 2002, concerning the functioning of the \nsoft money ban, and in particular, the Levin amendment. The Levin \namendment concerning state parties' use of nonfederal funds was added \nto the bill here on the floor last year. It was modified, and in my \nview improved, on the House side. My colleague from Wisconsin and I \nparticipated in the negotiations that yielded the final terms of the \nLevin amendment contained in the House bill. Mr. Shays explains quite \nwell the way that the Levin amendment in the final bill is supposed to \nfunction, and the restrictions, or what some have called ``fences,'' \nthat we hope and believe will prevent the Levin amendment from becoming \na new soft money loophole. Mr. Shays' discussion appears in the Record \non pages H408-H410 on February 13, 2002.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the senior Senator from Arizona for \nhighlighting that particular part of the legislative history. I also \nbelieve Mr. Shays does an excellent job of explaining how the Levin \namendment is supposed to work. In addition, Mr. Shays discussed how the \nprovisions of the bill dealing with electioneering communications \npermit the FEC to promulgate regulations to exempt certain \ncommunications that are clearly not related to an election and do not \npromote or attack candidates. I also endorse that discussion, which \nappears in the Record of February 13, 2002, at pages H410-411.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my friend from Wisconsin that these \nstatements express our intent in this bill quite well.\n\n\n                              SECTION 301\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, can the sponsors clarify section 301 \nof the bill concerning the conversion of campaign funds to personal \nuse, and in particular whether any change from current law was intended \nconcerning the ability of candidates to transfer excess campaign funds \nto their parties?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Section 301 of the bill amends 2 U.S.C. section 439a to \nspecify which candidate expenditures from campaign funds would be \nconsidered an unlawful conversion of a contribution or donation to \npersonal use. The language continues to allow candidates to use excess \ncampaign funds for transfers to a national, State or local committee of \na political party. It is the intent of the authors that--as is the case \nunder current law--such transfers be permitted without limitation. \nFurthermore, while the provision is intended to codify the FEC's \ncurrent regulations on the use of campaign funds for personal expenses, \nwe do not intend to codify any advisory opinion or other current \ninterpretation of those regulations.\n\n\n          SOFT MONEY FINANCING OF STATE PARTY OFFICE BUILDINGS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I note that the bill deletes a \nprovision of current law that permits national party committees to \nraise soft money to pay for their office buildings. Can the sponsors \ndiscuss the intent of the law concerning the raising of non-Federal \nmoney by State parties for their office buildings?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator is correct that as part of the soft money \nban, the legislation deletes language in current law expressly \nexcluding donations to a national or state party committee specifically \nto finance the purchase or construction of a party office building from \nthe definition of ``contribution.'' Accordingly, a national party \ncommittee may no longer receive non-Federal donations for the purpose \nof purchasing or constructing any party office building, or for any \nother purpose.\n  Likewise, Federal law will no longer allow a State or local party \ncommittee to receive non-Federal donations to purchase or construct a \nState or local party office building where such donations would violate \nthat State's laws relating to permissible sources and amounts of non-\nFederal donations to such a party committee.\n  The bill does not, however, regulate State or local party \nexpenditures of non-Federal donations received in accordance with State \nlaw on purchasing\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nor constructing a State or local party office building. It is the \nintent of the authors that State law exclusively govern the receipt and \nexpenditure of non-Federal donations by State or local parties to pay \nfor the construction or purchase of State or local party office \nbuildings. Thus, non-Federal donations received by a State or local \nparty committee in accordance with State law could be used to purchase \nor construct a State or local party office building without any \nrequired match consisting of Federal contributions.\n\n\n                      CLARIFYING TERMS IN THE BILL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I would like to ask the sponsors a \nquestion concerning the term ``refers to'' in certain provisions of the \nbill. I have heard the argument made that the definitions of ``Federal \nelection activity'' and ``electioneering communication'' are somehow \nvague because they are defined to include a communication that ``refers \nto a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.'' Can the \nsponsors address that argument?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would be happy to respond to my friend from Maine, \nand I appreciate her question. In the bill, the phrase ``refers to'' \nprecedes the phrase ``clearly identified'' candidate. That latter \nphrase is precisely defined in the Federal Campaign Election Act to \nmean a communication that includes the name of a federal candidate for \noffice, a photograph or drawing of the candidate, or some other words \nor images that identify the candidate by ``unambiguous reference.'' A \ncommunication that ``refers to a clearly identified candidate'' is one \nthat mentions, identifies, cites, or directs the public to the \ncandidate's name, photograph, drawing, or otherwise makes an \n``unambiguous reference'' to the candidate's identity.\n\n\n                              SECTION 213\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I would like to ask the sponsors to \nexplain section 213 of the bill concerning independent and coordinated \nexpenditures made by party committees. Can the sponsors also discuss \nhow this provision is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in \nthe Colorado cases?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be happy to respond to the Senator's question. \nSection 213 of the bill allows the political parties to choose to make \neither coordinated expenditures or independent expenditures on behalf \nof each of their candidates, but not both. This choice is to be made \nafter the party nominates its candidate, when the party makes its first \npost-nomination expenditure--either coordinated or independent--on \nbehalf of the candidate.\n  This provision is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's \nrulings in the two Colorado Republican cases. In the first of those \ncases, the Court held that a party had a constitutional right to make \nunlimited independent expenditures, using hard money funds, on behalf \nof its candidates. But of course, those party expenditures must be \nfully and completely independent of the candidate and his campaign. The \nsecond Colorado Republican case held that Congress may limit the size \nof coordinated expenditures made by parties on behalf of their \ncandidates, in order to deter corruption and the appearance of \ncorruption that could result from unlimited expenditures that are \ncoordinated.\n  This provision fully recognizes the right of the parties to make \nunlimited independent expenditures. But it helps to ensure that the \nexpenditure will be truly independent, as required by Colorado \nRepublican I, by prohibiting a party from making coordinated \nexpenditures for a candidate at the same time it is making independent \nexpenditures for the same candidate. We believe that once a candidate \nhas been nominated a party cannot coordinate with a candidate and be \nindependent in the same election campaign. After the date of \nnomination, the party is free to choose to coordinate with a candidate, \nor to operate independently of that candidate. If it chooses the \nformer, it is subject to the limits upheld in Colorado Republican II. \nIf it chooses the latter, it is free to exercise its right upheld in \nColorado Republican I to engage in unlimited hard money spending \nindependent of the candidate.\n  Section 213 provides, for this purpose only, that all the political \ncommittees of a party at both the state and national levels are \nconsidered to be one committee for the purpose of making this choice. \nThis will prevent one arm of the party from coordinating with a \ncandidate while another arm of the same party purports to operate \nindependently of such candidate. This provision is intended to ensure \nthat a party committee which chooses to engage in unlimited spending \nfor a candidate is in fact independent of the candidate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree with the Senator from Arizona's answer to the \nquestion from the Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                               SECTION 214\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I would like to ask the sponsors a \nquestion concerning section 214 of the bill, which deals with \ncoordination. Some concern has been expressed about this provision by \noutside groups that participate in the legislative process through \nlobbying and grassroots advertising and also participate in \nelectioneering through their PACs, or currently, through sham issue \nads. Can the sponsors explain what is intended by section 214, and \nanswer the concerns expressed by some of these organizations?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would be happy to address this question, and I thank \nthe Senator from Connecticut for raising it. It is important that our \nintent in this provision be clear.\n  The concept of ``coordination'' has been part of Federal campaign \nfinance law since Buckley versus Valeo. It is a common-sense concept \nrecognizing that when outside groups coordinate their spending on \nbehalf of a candidate with a candidate or a party, such spending is \nindistinguishable from a direct contribution to that candidate or \nparty. Accordingly, such coordinated spending by outside groups is, and \nshould be, treated as a contribution to the candidate or party that \nbenefits from such spending. As such, it is subject to the source and \namount limitations under federal law for contributions to federal \ncandidates and their parties. An effective restriction on outside \ngroups coordinating their campaign-related activities with federal \ncandidates and their political parties is needed to prevent \ncircumvention of the campaign finance laws.\n  The bill bans soft money contributions to the national political \nparties, which totaled $463 million during the 2000 election cycle. \nSpecifically, under the bill, corporations and unions can no longer \ndonate amounts from their treasuries to the national parties, and \nwealthy individuals can no longer write six-figure checks to the \nnational parties. The legislation shuts down the soft money loophole in \norder to prevent the corruption and unseemly appearances that arise \nwhen national parties and Federal officeholders solicit unlimited \ndonations from special interests and then spend those donations to \nsupport federal candidates.\n  Absent a meaningful standard for what constitutes coordination, the \nsoft money ban in the bill would be seriously undermined. In the place \nof outside special interests donating six-figure checks to the national \nparties to be spent on Federal elections, these entities could simply \nwork in tandem with the parties and Federal candidates to spend their \nown treasury funds--soft money--on federal electioneering activities. \nThis would fly in the face of one of the main purposes of the bill to \nget national parties and Federal candidates out of the business of \nraising and spending soft money donations.\n  Unfortunately, based on a single district court decision, the Federal \nElection Commission's current regulation defining when general public \npolitical communications funded by outside groups are considered \ncoordinated with candidates or parties fails to account for certain \ntypes of coordination that may well occur in real-world campaigns. The \nFEC regulation is premised on a very narrowly defined concept of \n``collaboration or agreement'' between outside groups and candidates or \nparties.\n  This current FEC regulation fails to cover a range of de facto and \ninformal coordination between outside groups and candidates or parties \nthat, if permitted, could frustrate the purposes of the bill. For \nexample, if an individual involved in key strategic decision-making for \na candidate's political advertising resigned from the candidate's \ncampaign committee, immediately thereafter joined an outside \norganization, and then used inside strategic information from the \ncampaign to develop the organization's imminent soft\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nmoney-funded advertising in support of the candidate, a finding of \ncoordination might very well be appropriate. The FEC regulation, \nhowever, would find coordination neither in this circumstance nor in \nvarious other situations where most reasonable people would recognize \nthat the outside entities' activities were coordinated with candidates. \nThis would leave a loophole that candidates and national parties could \nexploit to continue controlling and spending huge sums of soft money to \ninfluence federal elections.\n  The dangers of coordinated soft money spending were noted by Senator \nFred Thompson during his Committee's review of 1996 election activity. \nThe Minority Report of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \nstates:\n\n       The fact that coordination of soft money spending and \n     fundraising has become commonplace and expected should be \n     examined by Congress. By permitting such coordinated efforts \n     to raise soft money and spend it on political activities that \n     advance the interests of presidential campaigns, the federal \n     election laws create a tremendous loophole to both \n     contribution limits and spending limits. As the Chairman \n     [Senator Thompson] has acknowledged:\n       Acceptance of this activity would allow any candidate and \n     his campaign to direct and control the activities of a straw \n     man . . . . For such activity, these straw men could use \n     funds subject to no limit and derived from any source . . . . \n     If the interpretation is that this is legal and this is \n     proper, then we have no campaign finance system in this \n     country anymore.\n\n  To remedy this problem, the bill requires the FEC to reexamine the \ncoordination issue and promulgate new coordination rules. These rules \nneed to make more sense in light of real life campaign practices than \ndo the current regulations. The bill accordingly repeals this FEC \nregulation and requires that the Commission promulgate a \nreplacement regulation. The bill does not change the basic statutory \nstandard for coordination, which defines and sets parameters for the \nFEC's authority to develop rules describing the circumstances in which \ncoordination is deemed to exist.\n\n  Section 214 directs the FEC to promulgate new regulations on \ncoordinated communications and lists four specific subjects that the \nFEC must address in those new regulations. It does not dictate how the \nCommission is to resolve those four subjects.\n  On one issue, section 214 does direct the outcome of the Commission's \ndeliberations on new regulations. The current FEC regulations say that \na communication will be considered to be ``coordinated'' if it is \ncreated, produced or distributed ``after substantial discussion'' \nbetween the spender and the candidate about the communication, ``the \nresult of which is collaboration or agreement.'' This standard is now \ncontained in 11 C.F.R. Sec.  100.23(c)(2)(iii).\n  The FEC's narrowly defined standard of requiring collaboration or \nagreement sets too high a bar to the finding of ``coordination.'' This \nstandard would miss many cases of coordination that result from de \nfacto understandings. Accordingly, section 214 states that the \nCommission's new regulations ``shall not require agreement or formal \ncollaboration to establish coordination.'' This, of course, does not \nmean that there should not be a finding of ``coordination'' in those \ncases where there is ``agreement or formal collaboration.'' But it does \nmean that specific discussions between a candidate or party and an \noutside group about campaign-related activity can result in a finding \nof coordination, without an ``agreement or formal collaboration.''\n  Existing law provides that a campaign-related communication that is \ncoordinated with a candidate or party is a contribution to the \ncandidate or party, regardless of whether the communication contains \n``express advocacy.'' Accordingly, the bill provides that an \n``electioneering communication'' that is coordinated with a candidate \nor party is considered a contribution to the candidate or party.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Wisconsin would yield, let me \nelaborate a bit on his discussion, with which I completely agree, and \naddress the specific concern raised by some of these groups.\n  It is important for the Commission's new regulations to ensure that \nactual ``coordination'' is captured by the new regulations. Informal \nunderstandings and de facto arrangements can result in actual \ncoordination as effectively as explicit agreement or formal \ncollaboration. In drafting new regulations to implement the existing \nstatutory standard for coordination--an expenditure made ``in \ncooperation, consultation or concert, with, or at the request or \nsuggestion of'' a candidate--we expect the FEC to cover \n``coordination'' whenever it occurs, not simply when there has been an \nagreement or formal collaboration.\n  On the other hand, nothing in the section 214 should or can be read \nto suggest, as some have said, that lobbying meetings between a group \nand a candidate concerning legislative issues could alone lead to a \nconclusion that ads that the group runs subsequently concerning the \nlegislation that was the subject of the meeting are coordinated with \nthe candidate. Obviously, if the group and the candidate discuss \ncampaign related activity such as ads promoting the candidate or \nattacking his or her opponent, then coordination might legitimately be \nfound, depending on the nature of the discussions. We do not intend for \nthe FEC to promulgate rules, however, that would lead to a finding of \ncoordination solely because the organization that runs such ads has \npreviously had lobbying contacts with a candidate.\n  Section 214 represents a determination that the current FEC \nregulation is far too narrow to be effective in defining coordination \nin the real world of campaigns and elections and threatens to seriously \nundermine the soft money restrictions contained in the bill. The FEC is \nrequired to issue a new regulation, and everyone who has an interest in \nthe outcome of that rulemaking will be able to participate in it, and \nappeal the FEC's decision to the courts if they believe that is \nnecessary.\n\n\n                        CONTRIBUTIONS BY MINORS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I wanted to ask the sponsors about a \nprovision that was not included in the Senate bill--the prohibition on \ncontributions by minors. Can you explain the justification for this new \nprovision?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is correct that section 318 was added in the \nHouse. It is an important provision, and the Senator from Wisconsin and \nI supported it being included in the bill.\n  Under the FEC's current regulations at 11 C.F.R. Sec.  110.1(i)(2), \nchildren under the age of 18 may make contributions to political \ncandidates and committees as long as the child knowingly and voluntary \nmakes the decision to contribute. In addition, the child must make the \ncontribution out of his or her own funds, which the child is in control \nof, such as the proceeds of a trust or money in a savings account in \nthe child's own name.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding these regulations, we believe that \nwealthy individuals are easily circumventing contribution limits to \nboth political candidates and parties by directing their children's \ncontributions. Indeed, the FEC in 1998 notified Congress of its \ndifficulties in enforcing the current provision. Its legislative \nrecommendations to Congress that year cited ``substantial evidence that \nminors are being used by their parents, or others, to circumvent the \nlimits imposed on contributors.''\n  Accordingly, Section 318 of the bill prohibits individuals 17 years \nold or younger from making contributions or donations to and a \ncandidate or a committee of a political party.\n  We believe it is appropriate for Congress to prohibit minors from \ncontributing to campaigns because we agree with the Commission that \nthere is substantial evidence that individuals are evading contribution \nlimits by directing their children to make contributions. According to \na Los Angeles Times study, individuals who listed their occupation as \nstudent contributed $7.5 million to candidates and parties between 1991 \nand 1998. Upon further investigation, some of these contributions where \nmade by infants and toddlers. In another instance, the paper found that \ntwo high school sisters contributed $40,000 to the Democratic Party in \n1998. When asked about the contribution, the high school sophomore \nanswered that it was a ``family decision.''\n  We believe that this and other examples justify the prohibition on \nminor contributions that is included in the bill as a way to prevent \nevasion of the contribution limits in the law. In our view, this \nprovision simply restores the\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nintegrity of the individual contribution limits by preventing parents \nfrom funneling contributions through their children, many of whom are \nsimply too young to make such contributions knowingly.\n  We recognize that many individuals under the age of 18 support \ncandidates with great fervor and feel passionately about public issues. \nWe do not mean to suggest that children should not be able to \nparticipate in the political system. They are free to volunteer on \ncampaigns and express their views through speaking and writing. We \nsimply believe that allowing them to contribute to candidates presents \ntoo great a risk of abuse, especially since the existing, more limited, \nFEC regulation has failed to prevent such abuse.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his remarks on \nthis topic. I agree that this provision addresses a serious problem of \nabuse that has been amply demonstrated.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that several \nnews reports detailing numerous instances in which wealthy individuals \nhave circumvented contribution limits by directing their children's \ncampaign contributions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Members Cash In on Kid Contributions\n\n                            (By Alex Knott)\n\n       Nine-year-old John Baxter of Knoxville, Tenn., didn't even \n     know that he had donated $2,000 in 1994 to Republican Fred \n     Thompson's Senatorial campaign. Yet he's one of the 2,100 \n     students whose names appear at the Federal Election \n     Commission as having made campaign contributions in the 1993-\n     94 election cycle.\n       The third-grader at Shannon Dale Elementary School has \n     donated $3,000 to political campaigns since he was eight \n     years old, according to FEC records.\n       ``I don't know about that,'' said Baxter. ``My dad takes \n     the money out of our accounts.'' Baxter said he's never heard \n     of the ``Contract with America,'' and did not know whether \n     Thompson is a Republican or a Democrat. Though many parents \n     make donations on behalf of their children without their \n     participation, the FEC warns that these donations are illegal \n     unless made with the child's full knowledge.\n       According to Ian Stirton, an FEC public affairs spokesman, \n     students who are minors can legally contribute funds to \n     federal elections, ``but it says in the law that the \n     donations must be make `knowingly and willingly.' ''\n       ``Now for an 8-year-old to be able to make these \n     contributions, `knowingly and willingly,' they would be \n     pretty precocious, but it is legal for them to do so,'' \n     Stirton said.\n       ``I guess I'm into politics a little,'' Baxter said. He is \n     not alone. His older brother Joseph, 11, says that he also \n     has made donations to a couple of campaigns recently.\n       ``I've heard that I've given money to (GOP presidential \n     candidate and former Tennessee Gov.) Lamar Alexander and to \n     Fred Thompson, but I don't know how much I gave them,'' \n     Joseph Baxter said.\n       Their older sisters Jennifer, 12, and Elizabeth, 14, have \n     also made political donations. Together, the four children \n     have donated a total of $12,000 in the last three years.\n       Their father, William Baxter, is the president of Holston \n     Gases Inc. in Knoxville. He says the donations made by his \n     children are legal because they each have accounts in their \n     names from which the money is drawn, even though some of them \n     are not aware of the contributions.\n       ``We have custodial accounts set up for all our children,'' \n     William Baxter said.\n       The money in the children's accounts has accumulated \n     through inheritance and annual gifts from their parents, \n     according to their father. William Baxter said he has control \n     of the money in the accounts and has made some of the \n     withdrawals for the children's political contributions.\n       The FEC would not comment on the specific case, but Stirton \n     said that not only must all donations by minors be made \n     knowingly and willingly but that the money can't be given to \n     minors for the sole purpose of making political \n     contributions.\n       ``People can't just donate money in the names of others, \n     ``Stirton said. ``It would make the laws of disclosure \n     ineffective.''\n       In the past the FEC has investigated incidents in which \n     campaign donations have been made without the named \n     contributor's consent. No specific cases were mentioned by \n     Stirton, but he said that parents who are found to have \n     knowingly and willingly broken these FEC laws could face up \n     to $10,000 in civil penalties or an amount equal to 200 \n     percent of any contribution made.\n       All the donations made by the Baxter children were in \n     amounts of $1,000 and consisted of contributions to \n     Thompson's Sensational campaign and Alexander's presidential \n     bid.\n       ``It's very admirable,' William Baxter said about his \n     family's contributions. ``I think more people should make \n     contributions. A real change took place during the last \n     election, and I'm glad we were a part of that change.''\n       Thompson's spokesman, Paul Clark, said the Baxter children \n     may have forgotten about their donations because of their \n     age.\n       ``It was a year ago, and it appears that they were fully \n     aware of the contributions,'' Clark said. ``It's not some \n     laundering operation.''\n       Clark also said that Thompson's campaign officials tried to \n     be ``extremely careful to follow FEC regulations.''\n       Thompson was fourth among the top ten Members to receive \n     campaign funds from donors listed as students in the 1993-94 \n     election cycle, with the attorney/actor-turned-politician \n     raking in more than $25,000.\n       A Roll Call study of FEC records from that Sens. Ted \n     Kennedy (D-Mass), with $63,300 in contributions; Bill Frist \n     (R-Tenn), $43,500; and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), led the pack \n     in student donations last cycle.\n       Rounding out the top ten were Thompson, $25,800, and Sens. \n     Spencer Abraham (R-Mich), $25,750; Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-\n     Texas), $25,500; Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn), $24,250; Dianne \n     Feinstein (D-Calif), $23,900; John Kerry (D-Mass), $23,500; \n     and Chuck Robb (D-Va), $20,250.\n       For attorney Loren Hershey, of Falls Church, Va., campaign \n     giving is also a family affair. He and his three children \n     have made 22 contributions totaling $26,000, over the last \n     five years.\n       Hershey says that his children made their donations \n     knowingly and willingly and that they ``participated in the \n     decisions'' to make contributions to the campaigns.\n       Hersey's three children have donated $10,000 since 1992, \n     including his daughter Amelia, 11, who began her generosity \n     to politicians with a $1,000 donation to the Clinton for \n     President Committee at the age of eight.\n       Amelia, who is a fifth-grader at Bailey's School for the \n     Arts and Sciences, during the 1993-94 election cycle also \n     made $1,000 contributions to the campaigns of Sen. Chuck Robb \n     (D-Va) and former Rep. Leslie Byrne (D-Va).\n       Not all of the students listed by the FEC are minors. Some \n     are university undergraduates, law students, and even \n     politicians.\n       In the last election cycle, Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen \n     Kennedy Townsend (D) donated $250 to the Senatorial campaign \n     of her uncle, Ted Kennedy, while she was listed as a student, \n     according to FEC documents.\n       Jennifer Croopnick, 24, of Newton Mass., was surprised to \n     find out that she had donated $1,000 to Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-\n     Mass).\n       ``I don't know what you're talking about,'' said Croopnick, \n     who was then a graduate student at New York University. ``I \n     never donated money for any campaigns. I don't have much \n     money.''\n       Though Croopnick said she hasn't personally donated any \n     money for political campaigns in the past, she did offer a \n     solution as to where the funding may have come from.\n       ``I'm not exactly sure how those donations were made,'' she \n     said. ``My father probably made the donation in my name.''\n       Croopnick's father Steven, an employee of LTC Management in \n     Cambridge, didn't return numerous phone calls, and his wife \n     Bonnie had no comment regarding the contribution.\n       A statement released last week by Kennedy's office read: \n     ``We made a great deal of effort to make sure every \n     contribution is proper. We have never knowingly accepted any \n     improper contribution. We assume that when we receive a \n     contribution, the donor knows they have made it.\n       ``In this case, it was a donation from a 24-year-old \n     individual. We had no reason to believe she was unaware of \n     the contribution.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n Sunday Report; Minor Loophole; Young Donors Are Increasingly Padding \nPolitical Coffers. Officials Fear That Children Are Being Used To Evade \n                             Election Laws\n\n                (By Alan C. Miller, Times Staff Writer)\n\n       At age 10, Skye Stolnitz of Los Angeles contributed $1,000 \n     to the 1996 presidential campaign of Republican Lamar \n     Alexander. Her dad said the funds came from Skye's personal \n     checking account.\n       Asher Simon was 9 years old when he gave $1,000 each to \n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and two other Democrats in \n     1994. Asher's mother said the boy ``supports candidates he \n     agrees with.''\n       Lindsey Tabak, then 15, donated $20,000 to the Democratic \n     Party in 1996. Asked about the source of the money, Lindsey \n     said: ``I know it was in my name.'' These youngsters are part \n     of a developing trend in the world of political money: \n     contributors who donate generously even though they're not \n     old enough to drive a car or register to vote. On paper at \n     least, children and high school and college students gave a \n     total of $7.5 million in political donations from 1991 \n     through 1998, according to a Times study of federal election \n     records.\n       In many cases, as with Skye, Asher and Lindsey, the \n     children's donations came on the same day or about the same \n     time that their parents gave the maximum contribution allowed \n     under federal law.\n       Campaign finance experts say the practice of student giving \n     has become one of the most blatant ways that affluent donors \n     circumvent federal limits.\n       ``This is an area of great abuse where you have the absurd \n     situation of small children supposedly contributing their own \n     money to a candidate of their own choice,'' said Donald J. \n     Simon, executive vice president of the watchdog group Common \n     Cause. ``Obviously, in many cases, what's going on is simply \n     a way for the parents to beat the contribution limits.''\n       Parents interviewed for this story insisted that the \n     children contributed their own\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\n     funds and were not part of any scheme to skirt federal \n     limits. But the Federal Election Commission has regarded \n     student giving as such a potentially serious loophole that it \n     has urged Congress to ban donations by minors, based on the \n     ``presumption that contributors below age 16 are not making \n     contributions on their own behalf,'' according to the \n     commission's 1998 legislative recommendations.\n       Federal law places no minimum age on donors but requires \n     that the funds be ``owned or controlled exclusively'' by \n     contributors and that they give ``knowingly and \n     voluntarily.'' Also, parents are specifically prohibited from \n     giving money to their children to make political \n     donations.\n       In each election, the law allows individual donors of any \n     age to give $1,000 to a candidate and $20,000 to a political \n     party in so-called hard money, which can only be used to \n     advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates. There \n     are no contribution limits on ``soft money'' donated to the \n     parties for a broad range of political uses.\n       The analysis, conducted for The Times by the independent \n     Campaign Study Group of Springfield, Va., shows that young \n     contributors are giving increasingly large amounts to federal \n     candidates and campaign committees. Since 1991, donors \n     identified as ``students'' made 8,876 federal contributions \n     of $200 or more and in 163 instances gave $5,000 or more.\n       Student donors gave nearly $2.6 million for the 1996 \n     presidential election--a 45% increase over 1992. Complete \n     computerized data for the 1998 elections are not yet \n     available.\n       The study understates the full extent of donations by \n     minors because political committees often fail to report a \n     contributor's occupation as required by law and donors are \n     not asked to provide their ages. The Times identified the \n     ages of donors through public records and interviews.\n\n\n                    Only One Parent Fined Since 1975\n\n       Youthful donors attract little scrutiny from the FEC, which \n     is responsible for civil enforcement of U.S. election laws. \n     The agency rarely investigates allegations arising form \n     donations by minors: Since 1975, it has investigated and \n     closed only four such cases, levying one $4,000 fine against \n     a parent for donating money through a child.\n       Representatives for the Democratic and Republican parties \n     said they do not solicit contributions from the children of \n     donors.\n       Yet veteran campaign operatives, speaking on the condition \n     of anonymity, said that major donors are often reminded that \n     family members may also contribute. While professional fund-\n     raisers are instructed to inform such donors of the legal \n     requirements, other individuals soliciting contributions may \n     ``forget the niceties,'' one longtime Democratic campaign \n     advisor said. Campaign finance experts even have a name for \n     the practice: ``family bundles.''\n       The sponsors of the sweeping bipartisan campaign finance \n     bill that passed the House last year included a provision \n     that would have banned all donations to candidates and \n     political parties from individuals under 18. The bill stalled \n     in the Senate. The sponsors reintroduced the legislation last \n     month with the same proposed ban on child donors.\n       The Times study found at least four donors age 10 or under \n     who gave $1,000 or more. In two additional cases that were \n     previously reported, donors were so politically precocious \n     that they were still in diapers.\n\n\n                    `. . . On Behalf of My Daughter'\n\n       On Jan. 25, 1996--the same day her parents made identical \n     donations--Skye Stolnitz, then 10, gave $1,000 to the \n     Republican presidential primary campaign of former Tennessee \n     Gov. Alexander.\n       ``It was my decision based on what I thought was in her \n     best interest,'' said Skye's father, Scott A. Stolnitz, a \n     dentist in Marina del Rey. ``I felt that Lamar Alexander at \n     the time had the solutions for education in America, which I \n     was very concerned about on behalf of my daughter.''\n       He said that the $1,000 came from Skye's checking account, \n     which he funds. Stolnitz said that he discussed the donation \n     with his daughter, ``even at that tender age. I told her what \n     I was doing and why. She did not object.''\n       He said he was ``not aware'' of federal laws that require \n     donors to make such decisions on their own and had no \n     intention of exceeding contribution limits.\n       When young Asher Simon made $1,000 contributions to \n     Feinstein, then-House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and \n     then Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) in 1994, both his parents \n     also gave to the same candidates during the same election \n     cycle, including the maximum to Feinstein and Foley. This was \n     the only time that Asher, who is now 13, made a federal \n     contribution, records show.\n       Herbert Simon, Asher's father, is a leading developer of \n     shopping malls and, along with his brother, owns the Indiana \n     Pacers professional basketball team. Diane Meyer Simon, a \n     former Democratic National Committee member, said that her \n     son ``comes from a very political family that has a long \n     tradition of supporting candidates.''\n       The Simons, who own homes in Indianapolis and Santa \n     Barbara, have donated nearly $1 million to candidates and \n     party committees since 1991, records show.\n       Asher's four older siblings gave an additional $40,750. \n     Rachel and Sarah Simon contributed the same amounts to the \n     same candidates as Asher when they were about 14 and 12, \n     records show.\n       ``Whatever payments were made were in trust accounts and \n     accounted for properly,'' said Robert F. Wagner, an attorney \n     for Diane Meyer Simon. ``This is a very, very decent family. \n     . . . There was no intent to do anything improper.''\n       The FEC permits political donations from a trust fund but \n     requires that the beneficiary make the donation ``knowingly \n     and voluntarily.'' The key to the propriety of such a \n     donation is how much control the beneficiary exercises over \n     the trust fund, election law attorneys said.\n\n\n               High School Sisters Give $40,000 to Party\n\n       Lindsey Tabak was a high school sophomore and her sister, \n     Lauren, a senior in Livingston, N.J., when each contributed \n     $20,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on \n     Oct. 29, 1996. Twelve days earlier, their parents, Mark H. \n     Tabak and Judy Wais Tabak, each gave the maximum legal \n     donation to the committee.\n       Lindsey said her contribution ``was like a family decision \n     that we would donate the money to the Democratic Party.''\n       Asked whose money it was, she replied: ``It's like the \n     family's . . . I'm not sure where it came from. I know it was \n     in my name.''\n       Mark Tabak, who manages a firm that invests in \n     international health-care ventures, said that the money came \n     from his daughter's trust funds, a portion of which is \n     earmarked for political and charitable contributions. He \n     called it ``a collective decision'' to help the Democrats try \n     to retain control of Congress.\n       ``I assure you that this was not a scam to bypass hard-\n     money limits,'' Tabak said, noting that he and his wife could \n     have given unlimited sums of soft money to the Democratic \n     group. Political parties prefer hard-money donations because \n     of the restrictions imposed on how they spend soft money.\n       Both major political parties have benefited from student \n     donors. Since 1991, Democrats have raked in $4.3 million and \n     Republicans received $2.7 million.\n       Many of the student contributors were old enough to attend \n     college, according to public records and interviews. Some of \n     these donors contributed to the same campaigns, in similar \n     amounts and at the same times as their parents.\n\n\n                   contributions often match parents'\n\n       Take the case of Steven P. St. Martin. The son of a wealth \n     Louisiana attorney, he gave a total of $35,000 to various \n     Democratic campaigns between 1991 and 1998 when he was a \n     college and law school student. His contributions often \n     matched those of his father, Michael X. St. Martin, his \n     mother or his brothers, records show.\n       ``I make my contributions completely on my own,'' said \n     Steven St. Martin, now an attorney in Houma, La. He declined \n     to explain the correlation between his donations and those of \n     his family. ``It's kind of personal,'' he said.\n       Two estranged daughters of Dallas billionaire Harold C. \n     Simmons alleged that their father used trust funds to make \n     political contributions in their names without their \n     permission. This was part of a broader lawsuit claiming that \n     Simmons squandered the trusts on various expenses.\n       The trust for one daughter, Andrea Simmons Harris, gave \n     $36,500 to Republican candidates between 1991 and 1993 when \n     she was a student in her mid-20s, records show. Simmons and \n     other family members usually made the maximum legal donations \n     to the same recipient on the same day.\n       Simmons, who denied wrongdoing, agreed last year to pay his \n     adult daughters $50 million each to drop the suit seeking his \n     removal as trustee of the family fortune.\n       At the other end of the ``student'' spectrum are the diaper \n     donors.\n       Bradford Bainum was 18 months old when he made the first of \n     four contributions to Democratic candidates in 1992 and 1993, \n     records show. He gave $4,000 by the time he was 2.\n       His father, Stewart Bainum Jr., executive of a nursing home \n     chain and former Maryland state senator, acknowledged \n     donating in the name of his son as well as exceeding \n     contribution limits in a 1997 settlement with the FEC. He \n     paid a penalty of $4,000.\n       This is the only time since the current campaign finance \n     system was established in 1975 that the FEC fined a donor in \n     a case involving contributions by a minor.\n       The FEC may impose penalties up to the amount of a \n     contribution for giving in the name of another person or \n     twice the amount if the transgression is knowing and willful. \n     The agency may also find that a parent exceeded the \n     contribution limit by donating through a child.\n       ``It's not an easy area of the law to enforce,'' said Ian \n     Stirton, an FEC spokesman. ``Somebody has to know this is \n     going on.''\n       Still, the agency has acknowledged serious concerns over \n     the practice of student giving.\n       Lois G. Lerner, the FEC's associate general counsel, said \n     that, while commission members have not yet addressed this \n     issue, the agency ``has realized in recent years that \n     people are trying to get as much money into the process as \n     they can and this is an area where it's pretty easy to do \n     so.''\n       Parent donors may also trip over state election laws.\n       Al Checchi, the multimillionaire former Northwest Airlines \n     chairman who ran for governor of California last year, \n     acknowledged in 1997 that he arranged two contributions in \n     the names of his children without their knowledge.\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n       Checchi's business partner, who controlled the Checchi \n     children's trust accounts, sent $500 checks in the names of \n     Adam and Kristin Checchi to the 1990 gubernatorial primary \n     campaign of Democrat John K. Van de Kamp. That same day, \n     Checchi and his wife each gave Van de Kamp $1,000, the legal \n     limit under California law at the time.\n       Checchi said the children--ages 12 and 9 at the time--were \n     unaware of the donations. He said he did not know that such \n     donations would pose a problem; they were returned by the \n     campaign.\n       Campaign finance experts said that some parent donors, who \n     are unfamiliar with the intricacies of election laws, may \n     unwittingly use their children as conduits.\n       Kenneth A. Gross, an election law attorney and former FEC \n     enforcement chief, said that his advice for clients is \n     simple: ``I certainly discourage any giving by children.''\n\n\n                       the book on student giving\n\n       Contribution between 1991 and 1998:\n       Number of federal campaign contributions: 8,876 (Includes \n     only contributions of $200 or more.)\n       Total amount contributed by students: $7.5 million.\n       Number of students contributing a total of $5,000 or more: \n     163.\n       Source: Federal Election Commission records.\n\n\n                       deep pockets, short pants\n\n       Each of these students gave the same maximum donations to \n     federal candidates or political parties as their parents. \n     Their parents or representatives defended the contributions, \n     saying that the money was their children's that the youths \n     contributed voluntarily and that the parents were not trying \n     to evade federal limits by giving through their children.\n       Donor, Recipient and Parents: (Student) Skye Stolnitz (age \n     10*)\n       Amount: $1,000.\n       Date: Jan. 25, 1996\n       Donor, Recipient and Parents: (Recipient) Lamar Alexander \n     for President\n       Donor, Recipient and Parents: (Parents) Dr. Scott A. \n     Stolnitz (father)\n       Amount: $1,000\n       Date: Jan. 25, 1996\n       Donor, Recipient and Parents: (Parents) Cindy B.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on the campaign \nfinance reform bill that is before us. I have been involved in \nelections for the school board, for mayor of a major city, for the U.S. \nSenate, and for the Republican presidential nomination. My experiences \nsuggest that our present system is outdated and often distorted. Yet I \nhave never believed that we should pass a bill just because it has been \nlabeled ``reform.'' As dysfunctional as our current campaign finance \nsystem is, it can be made worse.\n  But in 2001, the U.S. Senate held a genuine debate on campaign \nfinance reform that embraced multiple points of view on the issue. \nAmendments were considered and debated on their merits. The underlying \nbill changed dramatically. The Senate reached a conclusion that could \nnot have been predicted before the debate began.\n  This conclusion did not correspond to the ideal system of even a \nsingle Senator. In reviewing the 28 votes that we cast on that bill, I \nfound that I had disagreed with the position of every other Senator at \nleast five times during the votes. I expect that most other Senators \nwould find that they also took a unique path through the bill. We all \nhave our own ideas about what a campaign finance system should look \nlike. Although, I do not support every provision of this bill, on \nbalance, I believe that it is a constructive attempt to improve a \ndeeply flawed campaign finance system.\n  Even as we move to pass this bill it is important to admit the \nlimitations of our work. The compromise bill before us will not bring \nan end to corruption or attempts to influence politicians improperly. \nWe should be skeptical of both extravagant claims of success and dire \npredictions of disaster.\n  This update was necessary, in part because the lines between soft and \nhard money were becoming indistinguishable. The development of so-\ncalled ``victory funds'' and other schemes for transferring party soft \nmoney to candidates was undermining the meaningfulness of hard money \ncontribution limits. In addition, soft money fundraising clearly had \nbeen linked to malfeasance in the 1996 presidential election and had \nassumed a role within the campaign finance structure that almost \nguaranteed future instances of campaign finance violations and improper \ninfluence.\n  The bill also takes the important step of raising contribution limits \nfor candidates facing an opponent who commits large amounts of personal \nwealth to a campaign. Our current campaign finance system ensures huge \nadvantages for independently wealthy candidates, because their personal \nfunds are not subject to contribution limits. Parties now spend a great \ndeal of energy recruiting millionaires to run for office, because it is \nthe simplest way to apply millions of dollars--sometimes tens of \nmillions--to a political race virtually free of regulation. As more \nrestraints on fundraising are added, the incentive to recruit \nmillionaire candidates increases. The risk is that personal wealth will \nbecome a qualification for candidacy--particularly with respect to the \nSenate. The millionaires amendment in this bill will not eliminate the \nadvantage of wealthy candidates, but it will substantially reduce the \ncurrent incentives that place personal wealth near the top of \nqualifications for candidacy.\n  Despite some excellent provisions, this bill will not be implemented \nwithout concern. The history of campaign\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nfinance law does not provide optimism that restrictions aimed at \npreventing the entry of money into politics will succeed. Our \nexperience has been that when one inlet for political money is closed \nor narrowed, that money flows into the system through other inlets. By \nincreasing hard money limits left untouched since the mid-1970s, the \nbill encourages some soft money contributions to flow toward hard \nmoney, the most accountable form of political contribution. But we also \nwill see increases in money flowing through interest groups and non-\ncandidates who seek to influence an election but who cannot be held \naccountable by voters at the polls.\n\n  In addition, any campaign finance reform proposal must come to grips \nwith the U.S. Constitution and its guarantee of freedom of speech. \nProtection of political speech was at the heart of the founding of our \nnation. We have little leeway in passing laws that regulate the amount \nor content of political expression. The fact that Congress is charged \nin the Constitution with the responsibility to hold elections does not \nrelieve it from the requirement that it do so in a manner that is \nconsistent with free speech.\n  I do not believe that it is possible for Congress to write a \ncomprehensive campaign finance bill in this era without stimulating a \nCourt challenge. With the passage of this bill, Congress has made a \ngood faith attempt to improve disclosure and protections against \ncorruption. However, even proponents should admit that this bill raises \nlegitimate First Amendment questions that will have to be reviewed by \nthe Supreme Court.\n  This bill will not be the end of the campaign finance debate. I am \nhopeful, however, that our experience with McCain-Feingold will improve \nthe conduct of future debate. Too often, despite good intentions by \nmany participants, the debate on campaign finance reform has not always \nbeen constructive. Too often the debate has centered on simplistic \nabsolutes and cynical implications that all money is corrupting.\n  We know that virtually every reform proposal involves complex trade-\noffs between preventing corruption and protecting Constitutionally-\nguaranteed freedoms of political expression. Americans don't like to \nthink in these terms because we want to believe that measures to \nprevent corruption and ensure freedom of speech are goals that should \nnot be subject to compromise. We don't like the idea of having to make \nhard choices that might result in less freedom or more corruption.\n  Those who support stricter campaign finance laws should admit that \nmany such proposals raise legitimate Constitutional questions, \nnegatively impact First Amendment freedoms of expression, and could \nproduce unintended consequences for political participation. Those who \nhave supported the status quo, must recognize that our current system \nis seriously flawed and that campaign contributions have been \ncorrupting in some very important cases.\n  Campaign finance is an issue that demands elevated debate on the \nnature of freedom of speech and fair elections--the most basic \ninstruments of our democracy. Reasonable people should be able to \ndiffer on prescriptions without questioning each other's motivations or \nintegrity. The U.S. Senate should strive to be a model of civility and \nreasoned deliberation on this issue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, today we take an important first step \ntoward reforming our campaign finance system. After an election in \nwhich $3 billion was spent in an effort to elect or defeat candidates, \nwe are finally taking action to attempt to make our campaign finance \nlaws meaningful. However, there are predictable consequences from this \nlegislation that will not be positive and will require further \nattention to the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  The money spent on the 2000 election should come as a surprise to no \none. Soft money, an important target of this bill, has increased at a \nremarkable pace. Year after year, there has been a steady and dramatic \nincrease in the amount of money raised and spent on elections. For \nexample, in 1992, Democrats raised $30 million in soft money. In 1996, \nthe Democrats more than tripled that amount and raised $107 million in \nsoft money. In the 2000 Democrats raised $243 million in soft money.\n  The Republican party has consistently proven itself to have even more \nfund-raising prowess than the Democrats, but the trends are exactly the \nsame, with substantial increases year after year. In 1992, the \nRepublican party raised $45 million in soft money. In 1996, they raised \n$120 million in soft money. And in 2000, the Republican party raised \n$244 million in soft money. The American people have become almost numb \nto these kinds of staggering figures, and they have come to expect \nfund-raising records to be broken with each election cycle. And, what \nis far worse for our Democracy is that the public also believes that \nthis money buys access and influence that average citizens don't have.\n  In addition to the overwhelming amounts of soft money that were \nraised and spent in 2000, hundreds of millions of dollars were also \nspent on so-called issue ads. Now, I'm not talking about television ads \nthat truly discuss the issues of the day. I'm talking about ads that \nair just before an election that show candidates, surrounded by their \nfamilies, American flags waving in the background, that tell of the \ncandidates' service to the Nation, or heroic actions during a war. \nAnyone who sees an ad like this believes it is a campaign ad. But, \nbecause of a quirk in the law, even these most blatant of campaign ads \nare called issue ads. As such, the contributions that pay for them are \nunlimited and relatively undisclosed. Yet, in many cases, these ads \nshape the debate in a race, and they most certainly are intended to \nshape the outcome.\n  Those ubiquitous television ads are purchased by all kinds of \norganized special interests to persuade the American people to vote for \nor against a candidate. These ads, usually negative, often inaccurate, \nare driving the political process today. Do they violate the spirit of \nthe campaign finance laws in this country? They certainly do. But, \ndon't take my word for it. Listen to the executive director of the \nNational Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, who \nsaid, ``It is foolish to believe there is a difference between issue \nadvocacy and advocacy of a political candidate. What separates issue \nadvocacy and political advocacy is a line in the sand drawn on a windy \nday.''\n  The bill that we are sending to the President takes a step toward \nreform. It is important to know that it is also firmly rooted in prior \nlaws. Federal law has prohibited corporations from contributing to \nFederal candidates since 1907. Labor unions likewise have been barred \nfrom contributing to candidates since 1943. In addition, the post-\nWatergate campaign finance law caps individual contributions at $25,000 \nper calendar year, and permits individuals to give no more than $20,000 \nto a national party, $5,000 to a political action committee, and $2,000 \nto a candidate. These limits were put in place after the country \nlearned a hard lessen about the corrupting influence of money in \npolitics.\n  Nowhere in these laws are there any provisions for soft money. That \naberration came into play in 1978 when the Federal Election Commission \ngave the Kansas Republican State Committee permission to use corporate \nand union funds to pay for a voter drive benefitting Federal as well as \nState candidates. The costs of the drive were to be split between hard \nmoney raised under Federal law and soft money raised under Kansas law. \nThe FEC's decision in the Kansas case gives parties the option to spend \nsoft money any time a Federal election coincides with a State or local \nrace. A creation not of Congress, but of a weak, politically motivated \nFederal agency, soft money is a loophole to our system that is long \noverdue for eradication.\n  Despite what the foes of this bill claim, banning soft money \ncontributions does not violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court in \nBuckley versus Valeo held that limits on individual campaign \ncontributions do not violate the first amendment. If a limit of $1000 \non contributions by individuals was upheld as constitutional, then a \nban on contributions of $10,000, $100,000 or $1 million is also going \nto be upheld. Buckley, too, said that the risk of corruption or the \nappearance of corruption warranted limits on individual campaign \ncontributions. Soft money contributions to political parties can be \nlimited for the same reason.\n  Like soft money, issue advocacy has a history that defies the intent \nof campaign finance laws. In what remains\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nthe seminal case on campaign finance, Buckley, the Supreme Court held \nthat campaign finance limitations applied only to ``communications that \nin express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \nidentified candidate for Federal office.'' A footnote to the opinion \nsays that the limits apply when communications include terms ``such as \n`vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for \nCongress,' `vote against,' `defeat,' `reject.' '' The phrases in the \nfootnote have become known as the ``magic words'' without which a \ncommunication, no matter what its purpose or impact, is often \nclassified as issue advocacy, thus falling outside the reach of the \ncampaign finance laws.\n  Until the 1992 election cycle, most for-profit, not-for-profit, and \nlabor organizations did not attempt to get into electoral politics via \nissue advocacy. That year, one advocacy group pushed the envelope and \naired what was, for all intents and purposes, a negative campaign ad \nattacking Bill Clinton. Because the ad never used Buckley's ``magic \nwords,'' the Court of Appeals decided that the ad was a discussion of \nissues related rather than an exhortation to vote against Clinton in \nthe upcoming Presidential election.\n  That ad and others like it opened the flood gates to more so-called \nissue advocacy in 1996, when countless special interests started \noverwhelming the airwaves with millions of dollars in ads that looked \nlike campaign ads, but, because they avoided those magic words, were \ndeemed issue-ads.\n  Opponents of this proposal will also argue that any effort to control \nor limit sham issue ads would violate the First Amendment. They argue \nthat as long as you don't use the so-called ``magic words'' in Buckley, \nsuch as ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' you can say just about \nanything you want in an advertisement. But that is simply not what the \nSupreme Court said in Buckley. It said that one way to identify \ncampaign speech that can be regulated is by looking at whether it uses \nwords of express advocacy. But the Court never said that Congress was \nprecluded from adopting another test so long as it was clear, precise \nand narrow.\n  A final argument opponents of reform like to make is that we spend \nless on campaigns than we do on potato chips or laundry detergent. But \nI would ask the proponents of this argument whether what we are seeking \nin our democracy is electioneering that has no more depth or substance \nthan a snack food commercial. Despite the ever-increasing sums spent on \ncampaigns, we have not seen an improvement in campaign discourse, issue \ndiscussion or voter education. More money does not mean more ideas, \nmore substance or more depth. Instead, it means more of what voters \ncomplain about most. More 30-second spots, more negativity and an \nincreasingly longer campaign period. Less money might actually improve \nthe quality of discourse, requiring candidates to more cautiously spend \ntheir resources. It might encourage more debates, as was the case in my \nown race against Bill Weld in 1996, and it would certainly focus the \ncandidates' voter education efforts during the period shortly before \nthe election, when most voters are tuned in, instead of starting the \ncampaign 18 months before election day.\n  Shays/Meehan takes an important step that begins to tackle the \nproblems of soft money and issue advocacy. I support this legislation \nthat has been championed by two very able colleagues, but I would note \none serious shortcoming of the bill. It won't curb the rampant spending \nthat drives the quest for money. Unfortunately, we all recognize that \ncreating spending limits is not a simple proposition. In the 1976 \nBuckley case, the Supreme Court struck spending limits as an \nunconstitutional restriction of political speech. An important caveat \nto its decision is that spending limits could be imposed in exchange \nfor a public benefit. I wish we had at our disposal a number of \nbargaining chips, public benefits that we could trade in exchange for \nspending limits. However, unless the Supreme Court reverses itself, \nsomething I am certainly not expecting in the near future, we must \naccept that if we want to limit the amounts spent on campaigns, we must \nprovide candidates with some sort of public grant.\n  I realize that a lot of my colleagues aren't ready to embrace public \nfunding as a way to finance our campaigns. But it is, in my opinion, \nthe best constitutional means to the important end of limiting campaign \nspending and the contributions that go with it. Ultimately, I would \nsupport a system that provides full public funding for political \ncandidates. I will continue to support clean money as the ultimate way \nto truly and completely purge our system of the negative influence of \ncorporate money. I would also support a partial public funding system \nas a way to wean candidates from their reliance on hard money and get \nthem used to campaigning under generous spending limits. I offered an \namendment to McCain/Fiengold that would have provided sweeping reform \nin the form of a partial public funding system, but I recognize that we \nare a long way away from enacting such a program. Nevertheless I will \ncontinue to support and work for that type of reform as a way to end \nthe cycle of unlimited money being raised and spent on our elections.\n  This bill is a way to break free from the status quo. However, as \nwith any reform measure, there are always going to be possibilities for \nabuse. The fact that some people will try to skirt the law is not a \nreason for us to fail to take this incremental movement towards \nrepairing the system. But, it does mean we must ensure that this the \nfirst, rather than the last, step for fundamental reform. I have \nsupported campaign finance reform for 18 years and I believe that even \nlegislation that takes only a small step forward is necessary to begin \nto restore the dwindling faith the average American has in our \npolitical system. We can't go on leaving our citizens with the \nimpression that the only kind of influence left in American politics is \nthe kind you wield with a checkbook. I believe this bill reduces the \npower of the checkbook and I will therefore support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today we are at the pivotal point where \nlong-sought meaningful campaign finance reform is finally within reach. \nIt's been a winding journey spanning seven years. I am pleased to have \nbeen part of the quest, and proud to have been an original cosponsor of \nthe McCain-Feingold bills since my arrival in the Senate in January \n1997.\n  It was a privilege to have been part of the two-week historic debate \nlast March. As I remarked last year, the open and freewheeling debate \non amendments in which we engaged was truly the United States Senate at \nits finest, and an experience I had hoped to enjoy when I sought this \noffice.\n  This bill isn't a magic elixir. It won't cure all ills. No one has \nsuggested it is a gleaming pot at the end of the rainbow.\n  Personally, I am disappointed that it doesn't include what I think is \nan essential ingredient of true reform: ensuring non-preemptible lowest \nunit broadcast rates for candidates, which this body approved \noverwhelmingly by a vote of 69-31 on March 21, 2001, one year ago \ntomorrow. Until we deal with both sides of the equation, the supply and \nthe demand, I do not believe we will have solved the whole problem of \nmoney in politics.\n  But this bill does go a long way to change the system set up over 27 \nyears ago, a system which over time has been severely exploited and \neroded so far beyond the intent of Congress that the levels of \nunregulated soft money are growing at a far faster rate than increases \nin hard, regulated dollar donations.\n  I stand in support of this bill and urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting to send this bill to President Bush.\n  I also salute and congratulate Senators Russ Feingold and John \nMcCain, valiant partners in a tireless, seven-year roller-coaster ride \nloaded with some spills and turns, filled with a few detours and \ndisappointments. These two leaders are true models of how bipartisan \ntenacity and determination can triumph over adversity. I trust that the \nhistory books will reflect how their persistence and stewardship on \nthis issue truly made a positive difference and profound impact.\n  To them, I say, thank you. The American people owe you a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as the Senate concludes debate on \ncampaign finance reform, I want to commend Senator Daschle for his \nleadership in bringing this important issue to a successful conclusion. \nI thank Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\ntheir commitment and hard work in crafting meaningful, bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform legislation.\n  The enormous amounts of special interest money that flood our \npolitical system have become a cancer in our democracy. The voices of \naverage citizens can barely be heard. Year after year, lobbyists and \nlarge corporations contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to \npolitical campaigns and dominate the airwaves with radio and TV ads \npromoting the causes of big business.\n  During the 2000 election cycle alone, according to Federal Election \nCommission records, businesses contributed a total of $1.2 billion to \npolitical campaigns. A Wall Street Journal article reported that $296 \nmillion, almost two-thirds of all ``soft money'' contributions given in \nthe last election, came from just over 800 people, each of whom gave an \naverage of $120,000. With sums of money like this pouring into our \npolitical system, it's no surprise that the average American family \nearning $50,000 a year feels alienated from the system and questions \nwho's fighting for their interests.\n  The first step in cleaning up our system is to close the gaping \nloophole that allows special interests to bypass existing contribution \nlimits and give huge sums of money directly to candidates and parties. \nThese so-called ``soft-money'' contributions have become increasingly \ninfluential in elections. From 1984 to 2000, soft money contributions \nhave sky-rocketed from $22 million to $463 million--an increase of over \n2000 percent. We cannot restore accountability to our political system, \nuntil we bring an end to soft money. McCain-Feingold does just that.\n  Another vital component of meaningful reform is ending special \ninterest gimmickry in campaign advertising. Today, corporations, \nwealthy individuals, and others can spend unlimited amounts of money \nrunning political ads as long as they do not ask people to vote for or \nagainst a candidate. These phony issue ads, which are often confusing \nand misleading, have become the weapon of choice in the escalating war \nof negative campaigning. The limits McCain-Feingold places on these ads \nwill help clean up the system and make it more accountable to the \nAmerican people.\n  Although the reforms in the McCain-Feingold bill are not a magic \nbullet that will solve all our problems, they do represent important \nand long over due changes to the system. Passage of campaign finance \nreform legislation is also a signal to the American people that their \nelected representatives can and will put the interests of the people \nabove those of wealthy special interests.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to elaborate on my vote on \nH.R. 2356, the latest effort at campaign finance ``reform.'' I voted \nagainst the McCain-Feingold bill earlier this Congress, and I see \nlittle improvement in the bill we are currently debating. For this \nreason, I will vote against the latest attempt at campaign finance \n``reform.''\n  I oppose this legislation on two grounds. First, the bill creates new \nloopholes for groups to exploit, and fails to create a level playing \nfield in the political process. Second, the bill continues to impose \nunconstitutional restrictions upon every American's right to free \nspeech and association. After 7 years of debate over this legislation, \nwe are still left with a fundamentally flawed bill that attempts to \nstrip away long-held protections cherished by Americans and restrict \naccess to the marketplace of ideas.\n  I am particularly dismayed that the proponents of this legislation \nhave decided to create loopholes and exceptions for 501(c)(4) \norganizations. Some would suggest that the bill bans ``issue ads'' from \ncorporate and nonprofit interest groups 30 days before a primary, and \n60 days before a general election. Yet, the crafters of the language \nhave allowed non-profit advocacy groups, 501(c)(4) organizations, a \nfree shot at candidates and limited restrictions on their poisonous \n``issue ads.'' As long as their advertisement is not targeted, by name, \nat a political candidate, they face no restriction 60 days, or even 1 \nday, before an election.\n  These independent groups will be allowed to accept special interest \ncontributions, and then fill the airwaves with issue ads--often \ndistorting facts in their attempt to attack a candidate's record. While \nthese ads will not name a specific candidate, so as to not be deemed \n``targeted'' communications, they will continue to influence elections \nin the favor of special interest groups.\n  Also, I continue to object to the proponents' efforts to extinguish \nconstitutionally protected free speech rights. The last time Congress \npassed through a ``reform'' bill, in 1974, the Supreme Court \neviscerated a majority of the provisions. They explicitly rejected as \nunconstitutional efforts to have the Government regulate ``issue \nadvocacy,'' limit independent expenditures, and mandate limits on \ncampaign spending.\n  The Buckley Court wrote that:\n\n       in a republic where the people [not their legislators] are \n     sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed \n     choices among candidates for office is essential, for those \n     elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a \n     nation.\n\n  Participating in government--getting your voice heard, so to speak--\nis one of the most valuable and treasured rights that each citizen \nenjoys. This is particularly true when an individual or group wants to \nexpress their views during the election of those who govern.\n  Citizens, candidates, groups, and national parties all should have a \nvoice in elections and government. It is at that moment, the moment \nwhen there is a true marketplace of ideas, that democracy lives up to \nits meaning. Any attempt to stifle comments, criticism, or expression \nis an attempt to limit speech. Political speech is speech, plain and \nsimple.\n  Efforts to regulate political speech are the real reason we're here \nin the first place. Today's abuses are the natural consequence of past \nattempts to suppress free speech. Current campaign finance laws are \ncomplex and antiquated.\n  We need to be enforcing the laws that are currently on the books. We \nneed to make sure that every political contribution is accounted for, \nand that disclosures are immediately posted for public scrutiny. \nClearly the American public has a right to know who is paying for ads, \nand who is attempting to influence elections. Sunshine is what the \npolitical system needs--not restrictions on basic rights.\n  The debate over campaign finance ``reform'' is not over, and I look \nforward to swift review of this measure by the Federal judiciary. I am \nconfident that the courts, again, will protect the rights of citizens \nand preserve the openness of our political system.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to talk about \ncampaign finance reform.\n  As a veteran of four statewide campaigns, I believe, as many of my \ncolleagues do, that the current campaign finance laws are--in a word--\ndefective. Our country was founded on the principles of freedom and \njustice. As I see it, the present system for financing federal \ncampaigns undermines those very principles.\n  I believe that in its current form, the campaign finance system tends \nto benefit politicians who are already in office---some folks call it \nincumbent insurance. I prefer to call it a problem.\n  Thus, I whole-heartedly believe that the time has come for meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. Before us today, we have a bill that purports \nto fix the system. Unfortunately, I do not believe the Shays-Meehan \nbill does the job. In fact, in some respects, I think this bill will \nmake the current system worse.\n  In the effort to find a culprit for the faults in the present \ncampaign finance system, soft money has become a scapegoat. While I \nagree that unlimited soft money contributions raise important \nquestions, banning soft money to the parties would be unproductive and, \nultimately, ineffective. Chances are, if we succeed at blocking the \nflow of soft money from one direction, it will eventually be funneled \ninto campaigns from another.\n  Furthermore, some soft money contributions are used for get-out-the-\nvote efforts--for the promotion of voter registration and party \nbuilding--valuable efforts that encourage voter participation. Though \nsome changes were made to ease the inevitable burden on GOTV and voter \nregistration efforts, as a practical matter, the effects will still be \ndevastating to the political parties and their activities.\n  A more realistic approach in lieu of banning soft money would be to \ncap\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nthe contributions at $60,000, as prescribed by the Hagel-Nelson bill \nthat we debated and voted upon last year. I would have offered that \nproposal as an amendment again this year, but I can count the votes as \neasily as everyone else. It failed last year, 60-40. The votes simply \naren't there. I dislike this bill, but I don't want to hold up the \ninevitable.\n  For that reason, I do support cloture on this bill. Although I \nbelieve it is fundamentally flawed, the bill before us should be \nallowed to stand or fall on its own merits--on a final vote that \ndecides the direction this issue will take once and for all. We've been \nat a stalemate on this issue for too long and it is time to move on.\n  As an individual who has spent a lot of time on the campaign trail, I \nhave put a great deal of thought into what I believe is the right \ndirection for campaign finance reform. My campaign experience with one \ngroup in particular has bolstered my support for efforts to limit so-\ncalled ``issue ads.'' This organization, funded by secret, undisclosed \ncontributors, ran issue ads throughout my campaign distorting my \nposition on one issue, which was unrelated and irrelevant to their \npurported purpose. This group was accountable to no one and did not \nhave to disclose its true agenda. Because it operated in virtual \nsecrecy, it was impossible to hold them accountable for distorting the \ntruth.\n  It only follows that I am pleased with the Snowe-Jeffords provision \nin the bill before us, which addresses some of the problems created by \nso-called issue ads funded by special interest groups and corporations. \nThis provision will hold these groups more accountable for their ads by \nimposing strict broadcasting regulations and increasing disclosure \nrequirements, effectively putting light where the sun doesn't shine in \nissue advocacy.\n  Unfortunately, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, this \nprovision is arguably the most susceptible to being struck down as \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. If the Shays-Meehan bill had a \nnon-severable clause that would protect it from selective dissection by \nthe Supreme Court--which we unsuccessfully tried to include in the \nMcCain-Feingold bill last year--I would be much more inclined to \nsupport this bill.\n  It now seems likely that parts of this bill will be struck down in \ncourt, creating, in effect an off-balance piece of legislation that \nwill penalize some groups--the political parties--while giving ``issue \nadvocacy'' groups more influence. This will alter the very basis of our \npolitical system and give disproportionate power to the least \naccountable groups around.\n  I cannot support any legislation that will not only not fix our \ncurrent problems but will create new ones by putting candidates of all \nparties at the mercy of these shadow groups, while at the same time \ntaking away much of their ability to respond.\n  Accordingly, I simply cannot vote for this bill.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, today the Senate approved historic \nlegislation that will change the way we manage our democracy in the new \ncentury. The changes called for in the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan \nlegislation are long overdue and vitally important to restoring the \nintegrity of our electoral process.\n  For the past several years, the amount of unregulated soft money in \nour campaign system has reached staggering proportions. Soft money has \nhad the insidious effect of holding too many political candidates \naccountable to large individual donors rather than the people they are \nelected to represent. In the 1999-2000 campaign season, $495.1 million \npoured into the coffers of both the Democrats and the Republicans. This \nwas a truly bipartisan problem, and now we have a truly bipartisan \nsolution. Soft money was a scourge on our political process that we are \nmuch better off without.\n  Before I go further, let me express my gratitude to two brave \nSenators: Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and John McCain of Arizona. We all \nknow that it was through their tireless work and their laser-like focus \nthat this piece of legislation has become law. By the time I arrived in \nthe Senate a little over a year ago, the groundwork had already been \nlaid. The traps had already been run. Year after year, the two Senators \nwho lent their names to McCain-Feingold came to the Senate floor to \ndeliver stirring oratory on the importance of this legislation. But no \nbill was passed. They visited with their colleagues in closed-door \nmeetings. But many Senators remained unconvinced. Now--finally--these \ntwo stalwarts can move on to other issues. McCain-Feingold has passed, \nand for that, they have my deepest gratitude and admiration.\n  As happy as I am about the passage of this legislation, I would be \nremiss if I did not voice my regret at the failure of the final \nlegislation to include a provision to address the skyrocketing cost of \ncampaign advertisements. In recent years, television networks have \nreaped tremendous profits by exploiting the importance of broadcast \nadvertising in the final weeks of a modern campaign. The price of \nairtime has become prohibitive to cash-strapped campaigns. And the \nsimple fact of the matter is that media costs drive campaign costs. Any \nsolution to the campaign finance problem is fundamentally incomplete if \nit fails to address what drives the demand for campaign money: \nexpensive media.\n  During Senate consideration of McCain-Feingold, I was proud to \ncosponsor an amendment introduced by the senior senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Torricelli. That amendment would have required television \nnetworks to offer candidates for federal office commercial time that \ncannot be preempted at the lowest price offered to any advertiser. It \nis only appropriate that, in exchange for the lucrative stewardship of \nthe public airwaves, broadcasters provide candidates access to the \nairwaves at a discounted rate. It is unfortunate that because Shays-\nMeehan does not include the Torricelli provision, the lowest unit \ncharge amendment will not become law at this time.\n  But, this should not and will not be the last time campaign finance \nreform is debated on the Senate floor. We have many more important \ncampaign finance issues to explore, from improving the access of \ncandidates to broadcast media to introducing aspects of public \nfinancing into the system. I look forward to continuing to work to \nimprove the system.\n  Having said that this legislation is an important step in the right \ndirection. I was proud to support it. And I again congratulate my \ncolleagues, Senators Feingold and McCain, for their outstanding \nleadership.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, last spring, after years of debate and \ndelay, a majority of the Senate agreed with the American public that \nour system of campaign financing needs repair and passed a significant \ncampaign finance reform bill. Last month, the House of Representative \npassed similar campaign finance reform legislation. Now the Senate has \ntaken up this House bill, and today this body will pass a comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform bill. This legislation is long overdue.\n  With every passing election cycle, money plays a greater and greater \nrole, and we run the risk of weakening the public's trust in our \ndemocratic system of government. In short, our constituents are losing \nfaith in our ability to serve their interests over the interests of \nthose who contribute to our campaigns. People are growing cynical about \npublic life. They are staying away from the polling place in \nincreasingly large numbers, in large part due to the perception that \nmoney, rather than the popular will, drives electoral outcomes. Under \nthese circumstances, meaningful campaign finance reform becomes \nnecessary to protect our system of government and our way of life.\n  While no legislation can completely solve the problems in our \ncampaign system, this campaign finance reform bill makes real progress \nin the fight against corruption. I wish to express my dismay that this \nissue requires a cloture vote. The Senate debated this legislation for \ntwo weeks last year, and voted 59-41 to pass it. Yet, some Republican \nSenators still seem bent on derailing this bill, a bill that is clearly \nthe will of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and most \nimportantly, the American people. After the cloture vote, the Senate \nwill be able to do what it should have done long ago, pass meaningful \ncampaign finance reform legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to speak about campaign \nfinance reform. I want to express my\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nconcerns about this legislation and explain why I decided to vote for \nit in spite of those concerns.\n  I believe there are problems with the way we finance campaigns in \nthis country. Many Americans feel there is too much money in politics. \nThey believe this money is a corrupting influence on the politicians \nthey send to represent them in Washington, D.C. Reports of politicians \ntaking money from foreign sources, while already illegal, has served to \nstrengthen the perception that money rules the political process.\n  The large number of extremely wealthy candidates who spend large \namounts of their own money to finance their campaigns reinforces this \nperception. Many people believe that candidates are attempting to buy \ntheir way into office. For that reason, I am very pleased that the \nversion we will be voting on contains my wealthy-candidate provision. \nBy enacting this common sense provision, the playing field will be \nleveled for candidates who are not able to spend unlimited amounts of \ntheir own money. Instead, this legislation will raise the limits on \ncontributions to their campaigns in proportion to the amount of \npersonal money that the wealthy candidate spends.\n  Reports of large donations by corporations and unions lead many to \nbelieve that access to politicians is for sale only to the highest \nbidders. Many will argue that a few corrupt politicians are the problem \nrather than the system. I believe this is true, but for many \ndisenchanted voters, perception is reality. Because people are \ndisgusted with the system, many choose not to participate. Our system \nis lesser for that lack of participation.\n  It is for these reasons that I have decided to vote for Campaign \nFinance Reform.\n  When I voted for McCain-Feingold in the Spring of last year, I did so \nwith reservations. I also expressed my hope that the House would \nimprove on it and, if it came back to the Senate, we would have an \nopportunity to clear up any remaining problems.\n  While this legislation did pass the House, and the House did improve \nit in some ways, the House did not address all of my concerns. In the \noriginal Senate-passed version, we added the Levin amendment so State \nparties could compete with other outside groups. Unfortunately, the \nHouse weakened this provision, and now the State parties will be at a \nsignificant disadvantage when it comes to promoting candidates and \nissues. I think it is only fair that these two groups should be able to \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  An additional concern I have with this legislation is the \n``Coordination'' provision. As this legislation currently defines it, \nthere will be a great deal of uncertainty about what is considered \n``coordination'' between a candidate and parties or outside groups. I \nbelieve we should keep the current rule which requires agreement or \nformal collaboration to establish ``coordination.''\n  Perhaps my greatest concern is about the constitutionality of the \nprovision that prohibits ``electioneering communication'' within the \nlast 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. There is \nvery little doubt that the constitutionality of this and other \nprovisions will be challenged shortly after this legislation is signed \ninto law. Fortunately, the expedited review clause requires anyone who \nchallenges the constitutionality of this legislation file suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A three-judge panel \nwill decide the case and any appeal will be directly to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. This expedited review process will ensure that all \nquestions about the constitutionality of this legislation will be \nresolved swiftly so that any unconstitutional provisions are quickly \nstricken.\n  Normally, the Senate would have the opportunity to make the small \nchanges that most agree would make this legislation much more \neffective. I am disappointed that the most adamant Senate proponents of \nthis legislation bunkered down to prevent any improvements. I \nunderstand that they are concerned about the success of this \nlegislation should it go to back to the House or to conference. \nUnfortunately, this concern will probably prevent us from doing as good \na job as we should have. This leaves us with two disappointing choices: \nsend an imperfect bill to the President or do nothing at all. I will \nvote for this legislation because I believe in this instance we must at \nleast take a step forward.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, the Senate is poised to pass H.R. \n2356, the bipartisan campaign finance reform bill. The momentum for the \nbill is building. The President has indicated that he is inclined to \nsign this bill. We could be on the brink of enacting the first \nsignificant campaign reforms in a generation.\n  I would like to make a couple of observations: First, I want to \nsalute the sponsors of S. 27, the Senate companion measure, Senators \nMcCain and Feingold. We are considering this bill only because of the \nsheer force of their collective will. They have suffered innumerable \nset-backs pushing for this legislation over the past several years. But \nthey never got discouraged; they never let up. Their dedication to this \ncause has been extraordinary.\n  Second, numerous public opinion polls have indicated that the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly support campaign reform, but do not rank \nthe issue as a priority. I think that's because they have grown \ndiscouraged about the likelihood of Congress passing such reform. \nMaybe, just maybe, we will show the American people that we are capable \nof beating the odds, of coming together and doing something difficult.\n  House Resolution 2356, the ``Shays-Meehan'' bill, is sufficiently \nsimilar to S. 27 that Senators who support campaign finance reform \nought to have no hesitation voting for final passage.\n  Most importantly, both bills get so-called ``soft money'' out of \nFederal elections. The bill we are about to pass prohibits all soft \nmoney contributions from corporations, labor unions, and individuals to \nthe national political parties or candidates for Federal office.\n  Furthermore, State political parties that are permitted under State \nlaw to collect these unregulated contributions would be prohibited from \nspending them on any activities relating to a Federal election.\n  The soft money ban is the most significant, and necessary, campaign \nfinance reform we can make. Soft money threatens to overwhelm our \nsystem and the public's confidence in its integrity.\n  In 1988, Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate for President, and \nVice President Bush, the Republican candidate, raised a total of $45 \nmillion in unregulated soft money donations.\n  Just 8 years later, President Clinton raised $124 million and the \nRepublican candidate for President, former Senator Dole, raised $138 \nmillion.\n  In the 1999-2000 election cycle, Democrats raised $245 million, and \nRepublicans raised just under $250 million.\n  One of the very biggest soft money donors during the 1999-2000 cycle \nwas Enron.\n  In its 1976 ruling in Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld \nlimits on so-called ``hard money'' campaign contributions. The Court \nargued that such contributions, unregulated, could lead to corruption \nthrough quid pro quo relationships, or at least the appearance of \ncorruption, which is also harmful to a democracy.\n  Well, if we are worried about corruption, or the appearance of \ncorruption, with regard to hard money contributions, which are limited \nand disclosed, we ought to be doubly worried about soft money \ncontributions, which can be unlimited, and are largely undisclosed.\n\n  Fortunately, we are about to put an end to soft money contributions.\n  The soft money ban will work because we came to a reasonable \ncompromise with regard to raising some of the existing hard money \ncontribution limits by modest amounts, and indexing those limits for \ninflation.\n  I am proud that I helped to negotiate that compromise, along with the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee and several other Members from both sides \nof the aisle.\n  The Senate voted 84-16 to approve the compromise we worked out.\n  Our compromise: doubles the limit on hard money contributions to \nindividual candidates from $1,000 per election to $2,000 per election; \nincreases the annual limit on hard money contributions to the national \nparty committees by $5,000, to $25,000; increases the annual aggregate \nlimit on all hard money contributions by $12,500, to $37,500; doubles \nthe amount that the national party committees can contribute to \ncandidates, from $17,500 to $35,000; and indexes these new limits for \ninflation.\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n  So under the Thompson-Feinstein amendment to S. 27, the individual \naggregate contribution limit, the amount that can be given to PACs, \nparties, and candidates combined, is increased from the current $25,000 \nper year to $37,500 per year.\n  That is a $75,000 per cycle limit, but only $37,500 of that can be \ngiven to candidates because all contributions to candidates are charged \nagainst the aggregate in the year of the election.\n  The House bill creates a $95,000 per cycle aggregate limit. Of that, \n$37,500 can be given to candidates and $57,500 can be given to parties \nand PACs. But to actually max out, an individual must contribute \n$20,000 of the aggregate to national party committees.\n  This all sounds very complicated, but the net change is that the \nHouse bill adds an additional $20,000 per cycle to the aggregate limit, \nbut that increase is reserved for contributions national parties. That \nis a reasonable change.\n  The hard money increases will reinvigorate individual giving. They \nwill reduce the incessant need for fund-raising. They will give \ncandidates and parties the resources they need to respond to \nindependent campaigns. They will reduce the relative influence of PACs.\n  The Thompson-Feinstein amendment, by increasing the limit on \nindividual and national party committee contributions to Federal \ncandidates, will reduce the need for raising campaign funds from \npolitical action committees, PACs.\n  Our amendment, therefore, will reduce the relative influence of PACs, \nmaking it easier to replace PAC monies with funds raised from \nindividual donors.\n  The concern about PACs seems unimportant now, compared with the \nproblems that soft money, independent expenditures, and issue advocacy \npresent. But we shouldn't dismiss the fact that PACs retain \nconsiderable influence in our system.\n  I know that some campaign reform advocates are uncomfortable raising \nany hard money contribution limits by any amount.\n  I would argue that modest increases are imperative for the simple \nreason that the current limits were established under the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, FECA, Amendments of 1974, Public Law 93-443, and \nhaven't been changed since. That was 27 years ago!\n  I have spoken previously about how the costs of campaigning have \nrisen much faster than ordinary inflation over the past 27 years these \nlimits have been frozen.\n  The advantage of modestly lifting some of the limits is that doing so \nwill reduce the time candidates have to spend fund-raising, time better \nspent with, prospective, constituents.\n  During the 2000 election, my campaign had over 100 fund-raisers. That \ntook time. Time to call. Time to attend. Time to say thanks. And that \nwas time I couldn't spend doing what my constituents want me to do.\n  The task of raising hard money in small contributions unadjusted for \ninflation is just too daunting, for incumbents and challengers alike.\n  Particularly in the larger States such as California, where extensive \ntelevision and radio advertising is imperative, it is not uncommon for \nSenators to begin fund-raising for the next election right after the \npresent one ends and they often find themselves ``dialing for dollars'' \ninstead of attending to other duties.\n  Let's be honest with each other and the American people: campaigning \nfor office will continue to get more and more expensive because \ntelevision spots are getting more and more expensive.\n  Regrettably, one action the House took during its consideration of \nH.R. 2356 was to strip the provision Senator Torricelli successfully \noffered to S. 27 that entitled candidates and political parties to \nreceive the ``lowest unit rate'' for non-preemptible broadcast \nadvertisements within 45 days of a primary election or 60 days of a \ngeneral election.\n  Under the House bill broadcast television, radio, cable, and \nsatellite providers will be able to continue charging candidates and \nnational committees of political parties higher advertising rates.\n  I am disappointed the House took this action but will support the \nbill nonetheless. A half of a loaf of bread is better than no bread.\n  Independent campaigns conducted by groups that are accountable to no \none threaten to drown out any attempt by candidates or the parties to \ncommunicate with voters.\n  Spending on issue advocacy by these groups, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, rose from $135 million in 1996 to as \nmuch as $340 million in 1998. Then it rose again, to $509 million in \n2000. Most of this money is used for attack ads that the American \npeople have come to loathe.\n  It is likely that spending on so-called issue advocacy, most of which \nis thinly disguised electioneering, probably will surpass hard money \nspending, and very soon. It has already surpassed soft money spending.\n  Clearly, the playing field is being skewed. More and more people are \nturning to the undisclosed, unregulated independent campaign.\n  The attacks come and no one knows who is actually paying for them. I \nbelieve this is unethical. I believe it is unjust. I believe it is \nunreasonable and it must end.\n  Fortunately, the House kept intact the ``Snowe-Jeffords'' provisions \nregarding these sham issue ads.\n  The House bill defines ``electioneering communications'' as any \nbroadcast, cable, or satellite communications which refer to a clearly \nidentified candidate for Federal office and are made within 60 days of \na general election or 30 days of a primary.\n  Anyone making electioneering communications costing $10,000 a year or \nmore must disclose to the Federal Election Commission, FEC, the sponsor \nof the communication within 24 hours, and the names of those who \ncontribute $1,000 or more to the sponsor within that election cycle.\n  The bill prohibits union or corporate treasury funds from being used \nfor electioneering communications.\n  The bill we are about to pass will staunch the millions of \nunregulated soft dollars that currently flow into the coffers of our \npolitical parties, and replace a modest portion of that money with \ncontributions that are fully regulated and disclosed under the existing \nprovisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  People aren't concerned about individual contributions of $1,000, and \nI don't think they will be concerned about donations of $2,000.\n  No, what concerns people the most about the current system are the \nchecks for $250,000, or $500,000, or even $1 million flowing into \npolitical parties.\n  These gigantic contributions are what warp our politics and cause \npeople to lose faith in our Government and they must be halted. They \ngive the appearance of corruption.\n  I represent California, which has more people, 34 million, than 21 \nother States combined. I just finished my 12th political campaign. For \nthe 4th time in 10 years, I ran statewide. Running for office in \nCalifornia is expensive: I have had to raise more than $55 million in \nthose four campaigns.\n  I can tell you from my experiences over the years that I am committed \nto campaign reform, and I am heartened that we are about to pass H.R. \n256.\n  Is it a perfect bill? No. Will it be subject to challenges in court? \nUndoubtedly. But I think it is a strong bill and I'm optimistic that it \nwill withstand the courts' scrutiny. And as I said earlier, it is our \nbest chance at reform in a generation.\n  Campaign reform goes to the heart of our democracy. The way we \ncurrently finance and conduct our campaigns is a cancer metastasizing \nthroughout the body politic.\n  It discourages people from running for office and it disgusts voters. \nSo they simply tune out, in larger and larger numbers.\n  Discouragement, disgust, frustration, apathy, these feelings don't \nbolster our democracy, they weaken it.\n  We have an opportunity here, a rare opportunity, to do the right \nthing and pass H.R. 2356.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, today is, in fact, an historic day. As the \nSenate prepares to go to final passage on the McCain-Feingold/Shays-\nMeehan legislation on campaign finance reform, we are taking necessary \naction that the American people have been seeking for years.\n  Today's Senate action will accomplish a fundamental rewrite of our \nNations Federal campaign finance laws. The Senate will approve \nlegislation addressing what the American people believe is the single \nmost egregious abuse\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nof our campaign financing system, the raising and spending of unlimited \nand unregulated ``soft money'' in our Federal elections.\n  The exploding use of soft money that permeates our campaign system is \nhaving a corrupting influence suggesting that large contributions by \ndonors to officeholders, candidates, and political parties provide \nthose donors with preferred access and influence over public policy.\n  The average voter of average means who cannot contribute thousands of \ndollars to campaigns has neither the access nor influence in \nWashington. Even the mere appearance of corruption erodes public \nconfidence in the integrity of our electoral process and the \nindependence of our democracy.\n  The use of ``soft money'' is not the only problem. This legislation \nis not the only answer. But it is the answer around which a majority of \nmembers could coalesce.\n  If the Shays-Meehan legislation does nothing else but eviscerate the \nsoft money loophole, it would still be effective and real reform.\n  But my colleagues in both Chambers have accomplished much more with \nthis legislation. I enumerate the provisions that are most important in \nthis Senator's opinion: First and foremost, the bill essentially bans \nthe raising, spending and transferring of unregulated and unlimited \n``soft money'' by national parties in Federal elections.\n  The bill prohibits the use of soft money to purchase any broadcast \nadvertisement that mentions a Federal candidate within 30 days of a \nprimary and 60 days of a general election.\n  The bill prohibits the use of treasury funds of corporations, labor \nunions, and nonprofit interest organizations to purchase broadcast, \ncable or satellite television advertisements that mention a Federal \ncandidate, target the ad to the candidate's voting population and air \nwithin 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.\n  The bill allows an exception for the use of soft money by State and \nlocal parties to conduct get out the vote and voter registration \nactivities that do not mention a Federal candidate so long as no single \ndonor contributes more than $10,000 per year.\n  The bill deems as a contribution any communication that is \ncoordinated with candidates or political parties. The bill also \nrequires the Federal Election Commission to promulgate new rules on \ncoordination.\n  The bill enhances full disclosure of the money flow. It requires \ndisclosure to the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours by any \none who makes an independent expenditure that is more than $10,000 for \nbroadcast, cable or satellite ads within 20 days of a general election.\n  The bill increases certain contribution limits. It doubles the \nindividual contribution limits, from $1,000 to $2,000 per election, to \nPresidential, Senate, and House candidates and indexes the limit to \ninflation;\n  The individual limit is increased from $20,000 to $25,000 to national \ncommittees of a political party; and\n  The aggregate individual contribution limit to parties, PACs, and \ncandidates per year is increased from $25,000 per year to $95,000 per \nelection cycle, including not more than $37,000 to candidates and \n$20,000 for the national party committees.\n  The bill triples hard-money limits for House candidates facing \nwealthy, self-financed candidates spending $350,000 of their own money \non a campaign. Senate candidates would qualify for up to six times the \nindividual limit depending on the amount spent by their wealthy \nopponents and the population of their State.\n\n  Finally, the effective date is this November 6, 2002, one day after \nthe congressional general elections. In addition, the effective date is \nJanuary 1, 2003 for any changes to the contribution limits. This means \nthat the 2002 Federal elections will be unaffected by this new law.\n  As I noted previously, while I may disagree with certain aspects of a \nfew provisions, I fully support this legislation as the best effort \nthat Congress can make to enact real campaign finance reform.\n  There are two provisions, in particular, that continue to cause me \nsome concern.\n  First is the so-called ``millionaire's provision'' which purports to \nlevel the playing field for candidates who face wealthy challengers. \nArguably a laudable goal, the provision ignores the fact that many \nincumbent who face wealthy challengers have healthy campaign \ntreasuries, sometimes amounting to several million dollars. In such \ncases, this provision serves mainly as an incumbent protection \nprovision. There continues to be no recognition of the considerable war \nchests that some incumbents have ready for use in Federal elections. \nThis kind of provision works against the public policy goals of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Second, although I reluctantly supported the Senate amendment to \nincrease the individual hard money contribution limits, I did so only \nin the context of achieving broader reform.\n  Quite simply, at that time, the increase in the hard money limits was \nthe price to be paid to gain sufficient support from our Republican \ncolleagues for banning soft money and placing proper restrictions on \nso-called sham issue ads.\n  Of particular concern to me is the indexing of these contribution \nincreases to inflation. That only ensures the continuing upward spiral \nof more money into our campaign finance system.\n  Notwithstanding these two concerns, I am convinced that this \nlegislation is narrowly tailored to strike the appropriate, and a \nconstitutionally sound, balance between the two competing values \nscrutinized by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo, protecting free \nspeech and limiting the ``actuality and the appearance of corruption.''\n  It has been decades since Congress took similar comprehensive action \nwith the enactment of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The \none thing we cannot afford to do is wait any longer, now is the time to \nenact the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan legislation. The American people \nhave waited long enough.\n  I am privileged and honored to be part of the majority in support of \ncampaign finance in general and this legislation in particular. In \nfact, there has never been a perfect campaign financing system because \nadjustments will always have to be made as legal and factual ingenuity \noutpaces the laws.\n  It is an issue I have supported over the years since arriving in the \nCongress, including my time in both the House as well as the Senate.\n  I stand ready to do what I can to make reform a reality in the 107th \nCongress.\n  This final debate may find its place in history, along with the \nSenate debate during the weeks of March 19, 2001-April 2, 2001, as one \nof the greatest Senate debates in the last decade, both in terms of \nsubstance and impact on our system of democracy.\n  I have been privileged and honored to serve as floor manager of this \nmeasure, along with the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Mitch McConnell. \nAs my colleague from Kentucky has alluded to, the stakes in this \nlegislation are considerable for many interested parties.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their patience and cooperation \nthroughout this winding-down process and compliment them all for a \ndifficult job well done in enacting comprehensive campaign finance \nreform.\n  First, I must acknowledge that the Senate would not be here today in \nthis historic posture if not for the determined leadership of Tom \nDaschle. No individual Member has been more consistent in support of \ncampaign finance reform than our leader. And, no Member has worked \nharder behind the scenes to hold the Democratic caucus together in \nsupport of this issue.\n\n  Majority Leader Daschle took several procedural actions to formally \nensure timely final passage of this measure before recess. The talk of \novernights and virtually ``around the clock'' sessions to accommodate a \nfilibuster, if necessary, were not a threat but a reality. Campaign \nfinance is serious business. It is a major priority on the majority \nleader's agenda.\n  It is only with his leadership that the Senate's work was completed \nby not only guaranteeing a timely vote on the legislation but also \nguaranteeing an opportunity for all Members to represent their views on \nthe matter. I further compliment the majority leader for his \nwillingness to provide the opportunity for a free debate even in the \nrush of final passage. This issue is of paramount importance to the \ncontinued health of this democracy.\n  The majority leader's handling of this winding-down process of \ncampaign\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nfinance debate exemplified the Senate at its best. The freeflow of \nideas, the unrestricted opportunity to offer and debate amendments, and \nthe ability of all Members to be heard are the hallmarks of this \nSenate, the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  At the same time, I must also acknowledge the powerful influence of \nmy colleague, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, for his \ndevotion to the principles of free speech and association. His \nunyielding belief that most, if not all, proposed campaign finance \nreforms are not only unwise, but unconstitutional.\n  I think all my colleagues would agree that Senator McConnell is a \nformidable advocate for his position. While we hear from the good \nSenator today, we are sure to hear from him in the future, even if in a \ndifferent capacity.\n  I congratulate my esteemed colleagues and good friends and the \nforemost leaders in campaign finance reform. Since 1995, the Senate \nleaders of campaign finance reform are Senator John McCain of Arizona \nand Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. In the house, the leaders are \nCongressman Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Congressman Martin \nMeehan of Massachusetts.\n  I acknowledge them for their vision in recognizing the powerfully \nnegative influence of the money chase in our financing system. Their \ndogged persistence and patience in striving to craft a consensus on \nreform legislation that addresses the worst aspects of the current \nsystem is now paying off.\n  I must express my great respect to my colleagues in the Democratic \ncaucus, under the very able leadership of Majority Leader Daschle, \nalong with a small group of courageous Senators across the aisle, who \nhave put aside their own short-term political interests and voted time \nand again in favor of comprehensive, commonsense, and badly needed \ncampaign finance reform.\n  I also thank the numerous staff who have assisted in facilitating \nconsideration of this measure, not the least of which are our \nDemocratic floor staff, including Marty Paone, Lula Davis, and Gary \nMyrick, along with the outstanding democratic cloakroom staff.\n  I also want to extend my special appreciation to Jennifer Duck and \nMichelle Ballantyne of Senator Daschle's staff, along with Mark \nChildress and Mark Patterson, who were invaluable in offering much \nneeded expertise and guidance on bringing this legislation to final \npassage.\n  Of equal assistance with both the substance and the procedures for \nthis legislation were the staff of Senators Feingold and McCain, \nincluding Bob Schiff, Ann Choiniere and Jeanne Bumpus.\n  I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator McConnell's \nstaff, including Hunter Davis of his personal staff, and Tam \nSomerville, Brian Lewis, and Leon Sequeira of the Rules Committee \nminority staff.\n  Finally, I want to thank Shawn Maher and Sheryl Cohen of my personal \noffice staff, and Kennie Gill, the Democratic staff director and chief \ncounsel of the rules committee as well as Veronica Gillespie, my \nelections counsel on the rules committee staff.\n  This has been one of the most remarkable legislative experiences I \nhave had the pleasure of working on during my time in the Senate. For \nall these reasons, I am privileged and honored to be associated with \nthis legislation. But I must emphasize, the primary winners are all \nAmerican citizens.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, like the Senator from Kentucky, I have \ndone everything I could throughout my time in the Senate to see that \nthis bill does not become law. As the Senator from Kentucky, I can \ncount and have thrown in the towel and become somewhat philosophical \nabout it.\n  I read in the newspapers about lawyers who are meeting down on K \nstreet even as we speak drawing up their alternative plan on the \nassumption that the President will sign this measure. It becomes very \nclear that the amount of money in politics will not diminish as a \nresult of this bill. It will simply stop flowing to political parties, \nwhere it is regulated and reported, and start flowing into dark corners \nwhere we will have no idea how it is gathered. We will have no idea who \nis behind it, and we will see it pop up in campaigns in ways that \npolitical parties would never use.\n  That, I believe, is a genuine and proper aspect of the future that we \nface.\n  It makes no difference to me personally because this is an incumbent \nprotection bill. It virtually guarantees that parties will be \nhandicapped in their effort to recruit challengers since the parties \ncan no longer promise the challengers the kind of support they have \nbeen giving in the past. Challengers will be thrown into the never-\nnever land of depending upon unknown special interest groups to come in \nwithout coordination and hopefully help the challenger. But as we have \nseen in my own State of Utah, many times the ads run by these special \ninterest groups actually damage the people they are supposed to help.\n  When the money was spent by parties, the challenger could call the \nparty and say: Knock it off. But when it is spent by a special interest \ngroup, the challenger loses control of his campaign and is at the mercy \nof unknown forces and unreported money.\n  That, I believe, is the future. But that is not why I have been so \nvigorous in opposing this bill. It is not why the Senator from Kentucky \nhas been so vigorous in opposing this bill.\n\n  We both took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States when we came to this body. I believe that oath is the \nmost serious statement I have ever made in this Chamber.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has led this fight fearlessly and \ncourageously. The driving force has been our conviction that this bill \nis an affront to James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and the others who \ncreated the Constitution and who gave us freedom of speech in the first \namendment in the first place.\n  If you read the 10th Federalist, which I have done in this Chamber, \nyou find that Madison lays out very specifically and very clearly how \nthe factions can control democracy if they are not handled in a proper \nway. The most significant proper way to deal with the scourge of \nfactions is to have full disclosure and full understanding of what is \ngoing on with this. With this bill, we drive political money into the \ndark corners.\n  While it is a sad day, in my view, it is nonetheless a good day. Like \nthe Senator from Kentucky, I believe I have fought the good fight. I \nhave lost, as has he, but I have been proud to be one of his \nlieutenants as he has been the captain of this fight. He is going to \ncarry the fight on through the courts, which is his constitutional \nright. I believe the courts will side with him, and the positions he \nhas taken in this debate more often than they will differ.\n  We will have a future. The Republic still lives. We will not see \nanything change for the better, in my view. And those of us who have \nstood on principle walk out with our heads held high.\n  I congratulate the other side. They have fought fair. They have \nfought vigorously. I have had a number of conversations with Senator \nFeingold in which we have both expressed our affection for each other \nbut our deep disagreement on this issue. I trust that affection will \ncontinue even as the disagreement does.\n  I close by paying tribute to Senator McConnell for the leadership he \nhas shown, for the valiance that he has demonstrated, and for, in my \nview, the constitutional loyalty and fidelity he has given the United \nStates in this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah, who \nhas been in every one of these debates over the last decade. He has \nbeen a stalwart, articulate supporter of the first amendment. I am \ngrateful for his friendship and for his kind words about our work on \nthis great cause. I assure him, as expressed, that it is not over yet. \nWe have another day in court. I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nkind words.\n  I understand I have a minute remaining. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to use those 2 minutes as the last speaker on this side of the \nissue. I don't intend to be the last speaker before the vote but the \nlast speaker on this side of the issue.\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin \nfor yielding time and offer my congratulations to Senator Feingold and \nSenator McCain for an extraordinary effort against all the odds over a \nlong period of time which brings the Senate to this moment.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I intend to join in only a matter of \nmoments in voting for the most fundamental campaign finance reform to \nreach this Congress in several decades. It is an important moment for \nthe Congress. It is an attempt to restore public confidence and also to \ngive ourselves a sense of confidence.\n  None of us feels good about the financial pressures under which this \ninstitution operates. None of us feels good knowing that the public \nbelieves that all Americans do not stand equally in the eyes of the \nSenate. It is a situation that cannot endure.\n  Today, we decide that it will not endure. I have supported every form \nof campaign finance reform for each of the 20 years in which I have \nserved in the Congress. This is the most important.\n  There are critical components of the legislation that I think make a \ngreat contribution: Elimination of soft money, raising the hard money \nlimits, and the controlling of independent expenditures in the final \nweeks of a campaign. But I also think it is important not to raise \nexpectations that all problems are being solved or that this is the \nlast time our generation will need to make adjustments in the manner in \nwhich campaigns operate in America.\n  First, the legislative fight over campaign finance reform is about to \nend. The judicial fight is about to begin. All of us recognize that the \nattempt to control independent expenditures may not be constitutional. \nIf the courts indeed find that this is an infringement on free speech, \nthe delicate balance of this legislation will be broken. Soft money \nwill have been eliminated and fundraising by the political parties will \nbe controlled. But independent groups would largely operate without \nrestriction. It would be regrettable. I believe the courts will be in \nerror. But it could happen. If it happens, and if the courts rule that \nthe control of independent expenditures is unconstitutional, there is a \nrisk that both the political parties and Federal candidates are to be \nnothing more than spectators in American elections with interest groups \ncontrolling the debate, raising the funds, and distorting the process.\n  The challenge for this Congress, if that is the ruling of the court, \nis that we must return and find a way to ensure that candidates and \npolitical parties are not dominated by these independent voices.\n  Second, this is an extraordinary victory for the controlling of \ncampaign fundraising in large amounts to restore some sense of equality \namong donors, and, more importantly, among citizens.\n  But the greatest unfinished aspect of the agenda in political reform \nis campaign spending. Campaign fundraising will never be brought into \npermissible limits with an acceptable demand on candidate time or \namounts of money raised until the fundamental problem of campaign \nexpenditures is addressed.\n  This Senate met that responsibility. By a vote of 69 to 31, the \nSenate voted to reduce the cost of television advertising to the lowest \nunit cost. It was a critical reform, because most Federal candidates \nwill tell you, it isn't just how much money is being raised, it is the \ntime spent raising it, the extraordinary amounts of money that need to \nbe accumulated. And 85 percent of that money is going to television \nnetworks.\n  In an extraordinary act of hypocrisy, the same television networks, \nwhich have championed the cause of campaign finance reform, spent \nmillions of dollars on lobbyists and exerted the very kind of financial \npressure this legislation is intended to eliminate in saving themselves \nfrom being part of campaign finance reform.\n  The provisions reducing the cost of television advertising were \neliminated in the House of Representatives. We must never give up on \nthat fight. Without these provisions reducing the costs of Federal \ncampaigns by some manner or some form, money will find its way into the \npolitical system.\n  In this legislation, we may vote to eliminate soft money to political \nparties, but if that demand remains on Federal candidates, some system \nwill be invented or found, some loophole developed, to get the money \ninto the system.\n  I am proud to vote for this legislation. But I challenge the Senate, \nas McCain-Feingold is passed: Make it the beginning of a reform, not \nthe end of reform. Let us return, next year, or even in the coming \nmonths, and challenge ourselves to do better: reduce the cost of \ncampaigns, continue to find the mechanisms to assure every American \nthat they have an equal chance and an equal voice to be heard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. I \ncertainly agree, there is much more to be done in our generation on \ncampaign finance reform. I look forward to participating in that.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n  Madam President, I thank the many Members of this body, past and \npresent, who have helped to bring us to this moment. Most important, as \nI mentioned in my other statement, the most important person I have to \nthank is, of course, my friend, John McCain.\n  I also thank our earliest supporters, who gave their support to the \nMcCain-Feingold bill when it was first introduced in the 104th \nCongress, Senators such as John Glenn, Paul Simon, Nancy Kassebaum-\nBaker and Alan Simpson, who gave us crucial bipartisan support when \nthis effort was just getting off the ground. This kind of bipartisan \nbill wasn't totally unprecedented. But it was pretty unusual, and the \nsupport of those distinguished Senators lent important credibility to \nour effort in its early days.\n  I particularly thank Senator Carl Levin for his leadership and \nsupport during every debate we have had on this bill since 1996. His \ninsight on the substance of the issue, and on the workings of this body \nhave been absolutely crucial to the advancement of this legislation. \nSenator Levin is as tenacious and committed as any Member of this body. \nWe truly would not be here today if he were not on our team.\n  I also thank our distinguished colleague, Senator Susan Collins, for \nher invaluable contributions to this effort. She came on board our bill \nas a freshman Senator in 1997, despite tremendous pressure from her \ncaucus. Over the years, we have met together with many of our \ncolleagues. She has been a tireless advocate for reform, a terrific \nally in this fight, and I am proud to call her a friend and a \ncolleague.\n  I, again, thank Senator Joe Lieberman, who has been a steadfast \nsupporter of reform, and who helped to build crucial momentum for this \nlegislation with his leadership on the 527 disclosure bill in the last \nCongress. The success of that legislation was a great breakthrough \nafter so many years when any reform effort was stonewalled by our \nopponents. The day that bill passed the Senate, I remember thinking \nthat enactment of the McCain-Feingold bill was not going to be far \nbehind.\n  And, of course, the great breakthrough at the beginning of this \nCongress was the day when Senator Thad Cochran joined us in introducing \nthis bill. I have great respect for Senator Cochran, and his support on \nthis bill has been invaluable. I cannot thank him enough for his \ncommitment to this legislation. Once he joined our effort, he was with \nus with every ounce of determination and grace that he brings to all of \nhis work here in the Senate.\n  One of our newest Members, Senator Maria Cantwell, also gave us \nimportant momentum when she made campaign finance reform a central \nissue in her campaign, and gave this bill her strong support. After her \nvictory, the oft repeated claim that no Senator has ever lost an \nelection over this issue could simply no longer be made.\n  Senator John Edwards and Senator Chuck Schumer have both been \nterrific\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nassets on this issue, especially right here on the Senate floor. Both \nof them have devoted a great deal of their time, and skill as debaters, \nto this bill, and I am very grateful for their efforts.\n\n  The efforts of Senator Olympia Snowe and Senator Jim Jeffords to \ncraft the provision on phony issue ads that came to be known as the \nSnowe-Jeffords legislation have been essential to this bill. They \nworked tirelessly to put together a balanced provision that gets at the \nroot of the issue ad problem, and I thank them for their tremendous \ncontribution. The Snowe-Jeffords provision is an integral part of our \nbill, and their mastery of this topic was invaluable to us.\n  I am deeply grateful to Senator Fred Thompson for his longstanding \nand steadfast support of this bill, and for his great skill and \nfairness in negotiating an agreement on hard money limits that the vast \nmajority of this body could support. Without that agreement, we simply \ncould not have moved this bill through the Senate. I also pay special \ntribute to Senator Thompson for the work he did investigating the 1996 \ncampaign finance scandals. Senator Thompson cut his political teeth \nwith his work on another great scandal in our Nation's history known as \nwatergate, but his work in 1997 showed the Nation that the campaign \nfinance issue is truly a bipartisan problem with a bipartisan solution. \nWe will miss Fred Thompson leadership in the Senate.\n  I also thank Senator Chris Dodd for his tremendous work as floor \nmanager on the Democratic side, especially during the extraordinary and \nsometimes unpredictable debate we had last year. He led us through \nthose 2 weeks with grace and humor and a fierce passion for reform that \nI deeply respect and for which I am deeply grateful.\n  I of course, thank the Democratic Leader, Senator Tom Daschle, and \nhis very able staff, for everything they have done to bring about the \nsuccess of this legislation. In the fall of 1997, the entire Democratic \nCaucus united behind this legislation, and that unity has been crucial \nto our success.\n  We are soon to have the vote on final passage because Tom Daschle was \ntrue to the principles of this party and led our caucus to follow \nthrough on our commitment we made to reform 4\\1/2\\ years ago. I am \nproud of the bipartisan effort we have made, but I am also proud to be \na Democrat, and I deeply appreciate the solid support of my caucus on \nthis issue.\n  This list of thank-yous would not be complete without thanking my own \nstaff. They have worked tirelessly to help me move this legislation \nforward, and they have done so with great skill and dedication. First I \nthank my chief counsel, Bob Schiff, for the outstanding contributions \nhe has made to this legislation and to the cause of reform, and for the \nvarious all- night efforts he had to put in to get this thing done. I \nalso thank my chief of staff, Mary Murphy, and other staffers, past and \npresent, who have worked to make this moment possible, including Kitty \nThomas, Andy Kutler, Sumner Slichter, Bill Dauster, Susanne Martinez, \nand Tom Walls. I also thank Jeanne Bumpus, Mark Salter, Mark Buse, and \nother members of Senator McCain's staff, past and present--in some ways \nit seemed as if we merged our staffs to accomplish this--and I thank \nthem for their outstanding contributions to this bill. They have been a \npleasure to work with. Many other current and former staffers from my \noffice, and from other Senate and House offices, have also made vital \ncontributions to the progress of this bill. Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent that a list of their names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       From Senator Feingold's staff and former staff: Mary \n     Bottari, Laura Grund, Ari Geller, Ben Hawkinson, Rebecca \n     Kratz, Anne McMahon, Brian O'Leary, Mary Frances Repko, \n     Thomas Reynolds, Mary Ann Richmond, Hillary Wenzler, Kirsten \n     White, Trevor Miller, Brad Jaffe, Tom McCormick, Rea Holmes, \n     Rebecca Kratz, and many others who have worked for Senator \n     Feingold and currently are on his staff.\n       Other Senate Staff: Linda Gustitus, Elise Bean, Andrea \n     LaRue, Laurie Rubenstein, Michael Bopp, Mary Mitshow, Steve \n     Diamond, Jane Calderwood, John Richter, Eric Buehlman, Hannah \n     Sistare, Bill Outhier, Brad Pruitt, Maureen Mahon, Martin \n     Siegel, Sharon Levin, Beth Stein, Nancy Ives, Glenn Ivey.\n       From the House staff: Amy Rosenbaum, Glen Shor, Dan Manatt, \n     Paul Pimental, Katie Levinson, Alison Rak, Kristin Miller, \n     Len Wolfsen, Kit Judge, Steve Elmendorf, George Candanis.\n       From the Congressional Research Service: Joe Cantor and \n     Paige Whitaker.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I deeply appreciate the hard work of \nso many Members of the other body who fought for years to pass this \nlegislation. Of course, especially, my thanks and those of Senator \nMcCain go to Representatives Chris Shays and Marty Meehan for their \ndetermination and outstanding leadership on this issue, as well as to \nthe House Minority Leader, Dick Gephardt.\n  I also recognize the contributions made by many other House Members, \nincluding Representatives Zach Wamp, Mike Castle, Lindsey Graham, Nancy \nPelosi, Jim Matheson, Harold Ford, Sander Levin, Jim Turner, Jim Leach, \nJim Greenwood, Sherwood Boehlert, Amo Houghton, Nancy Johnson, Mark \nKirk, Tom Petri, Todd Platts, Marge Roukema, Rob Simmons, John Lewis, \nCharlie Stenholm, Barney Frank, Steny Hoyer, John Conyers, and \nSilvestre Reyes, and former Representatives Tom Campbell and Linda \nSmith.\n  Our bill also benefitted immeasurably from the incredible effort put \nin by outside organizations in support of this legislation. I recognize \nthe outstanding contributions made by Fred Werthheimer and Democracy \n21. I also thank Don Simon, Scott Harshbarger, Meredith McGehee, Matt \nKeller and the staff of Common Cause for their tireless work to pass \nthis legislation. Joan Claybrook and the staff of Public Citizen, \nincluding Frank Clemente and Steve Weissman, made crucial contributions \nto the progress of this bill. I also very much appreciate the work of \nJerome Kohlberg, Cheryl Perrin, and Elaine Franklin of Campaign for \nAmerica and Charles Kolb and Ed Kangas of the Committee for Economic \nDevelopment to move this legislation forward.\n  I realize that is a long list of people and organizations to thank. \nBut it has been almost 7 years, and the praise I offer is well \ndeserved. Without the work of these people, not just during this \nCongress but over many years, we would not have reached this exciting \nmoment for reform and for our democracy.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). Twenty-one minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it gives me enormous pleasure to yield \n15 minutes for the last major comments on this bill on our side to the \nman who made it all happen and started the whole thing and carried it \nto the finish, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend for \nyielding this time to me. I am grateful to my colleagues and the many \npeople who have brought us to this point. This legislation will provide \nmuch-needed reform of our Federal election campaign laws.\n  With the stroke of the President's pen, we will eliminate hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of unregulated soft money that have caused \nAmericans to question the integrity of their elected representatives.\n  This is a good bill. It is a legally sound bill. It is a fair bill \nthat benefits neither party but that profits our political system and \nthat will, I hope, help to restore the public's faith in government.\n  So much has been said about the substance of this bill which has been \nhashed out literally for years and considered and reconsidered and \nperfected on the Senate floor in preparation for House passage. \nTherefore, I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to a \nfew people who have made this happen.\n  First, I extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my friend \nSenator Feingold for his unwavering commitment to this cause. He has \nbeen a\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\nwise counsel and a stalwart partner through these years, and I will \nforever be proud to have my name associated with him on this issue and \nother reform issues.\n  On occasion, politicians step up and match rhetoric with actions. \nRuss Feingold, at a time when there was about to be a flood of soft \nmoney advertising into his State in a very close and hard-fought \npolitical campaign, said no. Russ Feingold showed enormous courage \nbecause he was willing to put his political career on the line for what \nhe believed.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Daschle, for his steadfast \nsupport that enabled us to pass the McCain-Feingold bill last April and \nto bring it back this week for a final vote. I thank the Republican \nleader, Senator Lott, for his commitment to an open debate and for \nkeeping the process fair. The majority and minority whips, Senators \nReid and Nickles, have my sincere thanks as well.\n\n  Senator Dodd managed our side of the debate with his typical skill \nand good humor. I thank Senator Levin as well for his critical \ncontributions to the compromises that attracted majority support for \nthe bill in both Houses of Congress.\n  I am grateful to all my colleagues, supporters and opponents alike, \nfor their contributions to the bill and to the debate. I would like to \npersonally thank Senate Republican supporters, particularly Senator \nThompson whom I will miss more than I can say. His friendship and wise \ncounsel have been not only important to me as a Senator but were a \ncritical element in achieving the legislative result we achieved in the \nSenate.\n  To Senator Cochran, one of the senior Members and most well liked and \nrespected Members of the Senate, who came on board on this issue at a \ntime when we needed the credibility of a man of his stature, I will \nalways be grateful. Senators Snowe and Collins, I think the State of \nMaine can be proud of both of those Senators, including Senator Snowe's \ncontribution over one of the more difficult aspects of this \nlegislation, the so-called Snowe-Jeffords amendment, without which it \nwould not have been possible to pass this legislation.\n  I am grateful for the valued support of Senators Specter, Chafee, \nFitzgerald, Lugar, and Domenici, who gave legitimacy to our claims of \nbipartisan cooperation. I am grateful again, as I am so often, to \nSenator Chuck Hagel. It takes a brave and committed soul to take it \nupon himself, as he did a few weeks ago, to attempt to facilitate a \nresolution to this measure between myself and the other supporters of \nthis bill and Senator McConnell. It is in large part due to his efforts \nthat we have that resolution today.\n  Senate passage of a bill, of course, is only half--or less than half, \nreally--of the legislative battle. If it were not for the untiring work \nof Congressmen Chris Shays and Marty Meehan, the House sponsors of this \nlegislation, we would not be here today. I will always hold them in the \nhighest regard for their tenacious, unrelenting commitment to our \nshared goal. House minority leader Gephardt worked many long hours to \nhold the support of the vast majority of his caucus, and I am greatly \nindebted to him.\n  I salute also the Members who signed the discharge petition that \nforced House consideration of this bill, and the brave Republicans in \nparticular who voted for its passage.\n  As I told my colleague Senator McConnell a few weeks ago, I won't \nmiss our annual contests on this issue. No one in his right mind would \nwant to continue against so formidable a foe. I can only hope, however, \nthat should I ever find myself again in a pitched legislative battle--\nshy as I am of entering into them--that my opponent is as principled as \nSenator Mitch McConnell. It has been a worthy effort by all involved, \nand I will always appreciate the dedication shown by all of my \ncolleagues in their efforts to champion their beliefs.\n  I am compelled to mention a few indispensable supporters. In \nparticular, I thank Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21; all the good, \ndedicated folks at Common Cause: Scott Harshbarger, Meredith McGeehee, \nMatt Keller, and Don Simon, including Scott Harshbarger's talented and \nwonderful predecessor Ann McBride; Jerry Kolberg's Campaign for \nAmerica; and the Committee for Economic Development. I am thankful also \nto Trevor Potter, a former FEC Commissioner, for his insight and sound \npolitical advice, and to Rick Davis who kept us focused on the big \npicture and provided invaluable strategic advice.\n  I can't begin to name the many thousands of people not in this \nChamber who have fought so hard and long and who gathered under the \numbrella of a group called Americans for Reform. I want to mention the \nefforts by AARP, the League of Women Voters, Public Citizen, a broad \ncoalition of religious organizations, Carla Eudy and the staff and \nsupporters of Straight Talk America, for their tireless contributions \nin this effort and the honor of their friendship. Thanks also to my \nfriend John Weaver for his help and guidance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of the staffers \nof the Senators who contributed significantly to this legislative \neffort.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Senate Staffers:\n\n       Senator Cochran--Brad Prewitt and Clayton Heil.\n       Senator Collins--Michael Bopp and Lynn Dondis.\n       Senator Daschle--Andrea LaRue and Mark Childress.\n       Senator Dodd--Kennie Gill and Veronica Gillespie.\n       Senator Feingold--Mary Murphy, Bob Schiff, Bill Dauster.\n       Senator Feinstein--Gray Maxwell and Mark Kadesh.\n       Senator Hagel--Chad Woff.\n       Senator Jeffords--Eric Buchlmann.\n       Senator Levin--Linda Gustitus, and Ken Saccoccia.\n       Senator Lieberman--Laurie Rubenstein.\n       Senator Lott--Sharon Soderstrom.\n       Senator McCain--Mark Buse, Mark Salter, Brooke Sikora, Joe \n     Donahue, and Ann Begeman.\n       Senator McConnell--Tamara Somerville, Hunter Bates, Andrew \n     Siff, and Brian Lewis.\n       Senator Schumer--Martin Siegel.\n       Senator Snowe--Jane Calderwood and John Richter.\n       Senator Thompson--Bill Outhier, Hannah Sistare, and Fred \n     Ansell.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In particular, I thank Mary Murphy and Bob Schiff, of \nSenator Feingold's staff, for all their work on this issue over the \nyears. Let me also express my heartfelt gratitude to my former staffer \nMark Buse, who recently left the Hill after working by my side on this \nissue for many years. This would not have been possible without him. I \nthank as well Mark's successor as Republican staff director on the \nCommerce Committee, Jeanne Bumpus, who, in an incredibly short period \nof time, became expert on the many issues involved in this legislation \nand was an invaluable support to me.\n  I also want to thank my administrative assistant and alter ego, Mark \nSalter, for his continued efforts not only here but in a broad variety \nof ways. I am grateful for his friendship.\n  Mr. President, the proponents of this legislation have had, and \ncontinue to have, one purpose: to enact fair, bipartisan, campaign \nfinance reform that seeks no special advantage for one party or \nanother. Once we complete the Senate debate and vote on final passage, \nit will be up to the President to take the action that his spokesmen \nand advisors have led us to believe he will take--to sign the bill into \nlaw. It is my hope that he will deem it appropriate to do this.\n  The supporters of campaign finance reform have differences about what \nconstitutes ideal reform, but we have subordinated those differences to \nthe common good. We all recognized one very simple truth: that campaign \ncontributions from a single source that run to the hundreds of \nthousands or millions of dollars are not healthy to a democracy. Is \nthat not self-evident? It is to the American people Mr. President. It \nis to the people.\n  The reforms I believe we are about to pass will not cure public \ncynicism about politics. Nor will it completely free politics from \ninfluence peddling or the appearance of it. But I believe it might \ncause many Americans who are at present quite disaffected from the \npractices and institutions of our democracy to begin to see that their \nelected representatives value their reputations more than their \nincumbency. And maybe that recognition will cause them to exercise \ntheir franchise more faithfully, to identify more closely with \npolitical parties, to raise their expectations for the work we do. \nMaybe\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nit will even encourage more Americans to seek public office, not for \nthe privileges bestowed on election winners, but for the honor of \nserving a great nation. If by today's vote we make even small progress \nin this direction, I think we have rendered good service to our \ncountry, and I am proud of it.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues for their votes in support of final \npassage of this bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, regretfully, this bill is going to pass \nand, in all likelihood, be signed by the President. I say \n``regretfully'' because, for those who wanted to reduce the amount of \nmoney in politics, this certainly will not do that. Not even close. It \nwill dramatically take money away from the parties and then shift it to \noutside groups. The reason we know how much soft money the parties \nraise is because it is disclosed. But we will not know how much is \ngiven to the outside groups and who gives it because it is not \ndisclosed. After this bill passes, outside groups will continue to \nraise unlimited amounts of soft money from all sources. In fact, \nMembers of Congress will be able to raise unlimited amounts of soft \nmoney for those groups. It will be completely legal, and permitted by \nthis legislation.\n  We could have dealt with the issue of corruption, or the appearance \nof corruption--and I have to say ``appearance'' because there has been \nno evidence whatsoever of actual corruption--we could have dealt with \nan appearance problem by capping soft money, just as we capped hard \nmoney 25 years ago. That would have allowed the six national party \ncommittees to still be national committees, to still be able to support \nState and local candidates with non-Federal dollars. But, no, we \ndecided to completely eliminate nonfederal money to the parties only--\ncertainly a step not required to deal with the alleged appearance of \ncorruption.\n  So, first, this bill will greatly weaken the parties and shift those \nresources to outside groups that will continue to engage in issue \nadvocacy, as they have a constitutional right to do, with unlimited and \nundisclosed soft money.\n  Ironically, the bill allows Members of Congress to raise that \nunlimited soft money for outside groups but not political parties. We \nare now able to do more for outside groups than we are able to do for \nour own political parties.\n  Secondly, the bill seeks to impose a gag order on groups that have \nthe audacity to mention people like us within 60 days of an election, \nby saying they have to go to the Federal Government--to register with \nthe Federal Election Commission--and raise hard dollars just so they \ncan mention candidates like us within 60 days of an election.\n  For those two reasons, and for many more, I urge colleagues to vote \nno on final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thanks to the courtesy of Senator \nMcCain, it is my honor to bring the debate to a close. I will make a \nfew brief comments and perhaps we can proceed to final passage of the \nbill.\n  First of all, I wish to indicate my respect for the Senator from \nKentucky. This has been a tremendous battle. We have had in this \nChamber 3 weeks in the last 2 years debating this issue. I think it has \nbeen a very good process, and I certainly take seriously his arguments. \nAlthough we may have to pursue this matter in the courts, as we have \ndone in some other matters, it is always an honorable venture.\n  The main point I make, in conclusion, is that I believe in maybe 20 \nor 30 years people will say: You know, there was a time when Members of \nCongress could actually ask people for $100,000, $500,000, or a \nmillion-dollar contribution, and it was perfectly legal. I think it \nwill remind people of the stories we have heard about how there used to \nbe briefcases full of cash floating around this building.\n  It is almost unbelievable that there ever was a time in our recent \nhistory--in the last few years--when these kinds of almost inherently \ncorrupt contributions could be given from corporate treasuries, union \ntreasuries, or by individuals. It was a loophole that completely \nswallowed all the laws we had. They were imperfect laws. The hard money \nrules were the rules we had concerns about when we started this \ninitiative. We wanted to fix that.\n  This soft money system grew in such a way that we invited some of the \ngreatest corruption in the history of our country. So it is my hope \nthat 25 or 50 years from now people will say: How could you have \npossibly had a time when unlimited contributions were allowed? I look \nforward to people saying that.\n  The reason I mention that time in the future is that, more than \nanything else, I care about this issue because of the young people in \nthis country. I care about it because, believe it or not, I was once \n18. I am looking at the pages here who help us. When I was 16, 17, 18, \nI thought maybe I would have a chance to go into politics someday. Not \na single person ever said to me: Well, you have to be a millionaire or \nyou have to be able to access $500,000 or a million-dollar \ncontribution. I was a person of average means, so it looked to be an \narea that maybe I could go into, and it excited me.\n  Nothing has bothered me more in my public career than the thought \nthat young people, looking to the future, might think that it is \nnecessary to be multimillionaires or somehow have access to the soft \nmoney system, in order to participate--being able to participate as a \nvoter and, yes, even being able to participate as a candidate as part \nof the American dream.\n  Today, we hope to return a little bit of that dream to you. Yes, \nsomeday, as John McCain has said, you are going to have to clean it up \nagain because every 20 or 30 years the system needs some work.\n  In the name of the young people of this country, whom I know will \nprovide the enthusiasm to support future reforms, I want to bring the \ndebate to a close.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no amendments to be offered, the \nquestion is on third reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 2356) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 54 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n  The bill (H.R. 2356) was passed.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nconsider a resolution.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 227) to clarify the rules regarding \n     the acceptance of pro bono legal services by Senators.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this Senate resolution S. Res. 227 is \nvery similar to a Senate resolution passed by this body in 1996. That \n1996 resolution--S. Res. 321--was passed to ensure that Senators who \nwanted to challenge the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act \ncould do so using unlimited pro bono legal services, subject to \nregulations promulgated by the Ethics Committee.\n  It is clear that the campaign finance bill that passed today--H.R. \n2356--will be challenged in court if the President signs it into law. \nThe Senate resolution which passed today makes it clear that any Member \nof this body may receive pro bono legal services in connection with any \naction challenging the constitutionality of that law.\n  This body is in agreement on this issue. There is no need for debate \nor a vote. This new Senate resolution ensures that the Senate will \ncontinue its tradition of permitting Members to utilize unlimited pro \nbono legal services when challenging legislation that raises serious \nconstitutional questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the resolution is \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 227) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I begin by adding my compliments to \nSenators Feingold and McCain for their extraordinary efforts in passing \nand helping to usher through a far-reaching piece of legislation that \nwill hopefully close the loopholes and help Members conduct campaigns \nthat truly meet the spirit and intent of the reform laws we have passed \nover the course of the last couple of years. We need to have the kind \nof campaigns of which we can all be proud, ones that allow people in \nthis Nation to express their views, yet have campaigns and financing \nand funding that are fully and completely disclosed. I thank them and \nacknowledge their work.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, today I rise to address issues related \nto my vote on H.R. 2356, the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Bill.\n  For some time President Bush has clearly indicated his willingness to \nsign campaign reform legislation passed by the Congress. I have great \nrespect for his judgement and this was an important consideration in \nmaking my decision to support this legislation.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Bill is not perfect \nlegislation, but I believe it may be the best the Congress is able to \nproduce. I approached both McCain-Feingold and now the Bipartisan \nCampaign Finance Reform Bill with an open mind and feel it is in the \nbest interests of the nation to implement achievable reform legislation \nrather than hold out for perfect--and probably unattainable--reform \nlegislation.\n  During each of the last two Congresses I introduced my own campaign \nfinance reform bills--``The Constitutional and Effective Reform of \nCampaigns Act,'' or ``CERCA.'' My proposals have been good faith \nefforts to strike middle ground in this important debate and were \noffered as alternatives to the bills that have been debated before the \nfull Senate in the past. The principal points in my bills were enhanced \ndisclosure, increased hard dollar contribution limits, a cap on soft \nmoney and paycheck protection.\n  As chairman of the Rules Committee during the 105th Congress, I \nchaired twelve or more hearings on campaign reform including the \nfunding of campaigns. My bill was a result of these 2 years of \nhearings, discussions with numerous experts and colleagues, and the \nresult of over 2 decades of participating in campaigns and campaign \nfinance debates.\n  My bill capped soft money thereby addressing the public's legitimate \nconcern over the propriety of large soft money donations while allowing \nthe political parties sufficient funds to maintain their headquarters \nand conduct their grassroots effort.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Bill bans all soft money. And \nwhile I would have preferred merely to cap soft money as we already cap \nhard money, a total ban is the only option currently on the table.\n  In addition to the issue of soft money, there is the issue of raising \nthe hard money caps. Candidates for public office are forced to spend \ntoo much time fundraising at the expense of their legislative duties.\n  The current individual contribution limit of $1,000 has not been \nraised, or even indexed for inflation for over 20 years. This situation \nrequires candidates to spend more and more time seeking more and more \ndonors.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Bill increases the individual \ncontribution limits to $2000 and indexes that limit for inflation. My \ncampaign finance legislation contained a similar provision which \nensured that a greater percentage of political contributions would be \nfully reported and available for all to see.\n  It is my firm belief that the Congress has a responsibility, in \naccord with the constitution, to balance the rights of those who care \nto participate in the political process with the desire to improve \naccountability and responsibility within the campaign system.\n  Precisely because of my concern that previous campaign finance reform \nproposals did not adequately respect the First Amendment Freedom of \nSpeech, I was compelled to write my own campaign reform proposals that \nfocused on disclosure and accountability.\n  Clearly, today's legislation faces constitutional challenge, however, \nthose decisions will ultimately have to be resolved by the judicial \nbranch of Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2161-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2161-S2174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise, Mr. President, to speak about the pending \nbusiness, which is the energy bill that has been laid down by Senator \nBingaman and worked on very aggressively on both sides of the aisle.\n  We are trying to fashion an energy bill that works for our Nation and \naccomplishes a couple of very broad goals. One of those goals that I \nthink is most crucial and critical to meet in terms of the outcome of \nthis debate is the goal of energy independence for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The goal is self-reliance. It is a value, a tradition of America that \nhas served this Nation very well, that we produce what we consume. We \nrelied on our strengths and our resources to lift this country from a \ncluster of small colonies over 200 years ago, to a great nation, \nperhaps the greatest nation ever to be born and developed in this \nworld, using a political system that, while not perfect, is admired by \nmany countries and used as a model.\n  We have also proven that our free enterprise system, our economy, the \nrule of law, the transparency of our financing, the ability to gather \ncapital and invest in business, really produces great wealth, not just \nfor the few but for the many. That is the challenge of this world. It \nis not just to enrich a few, but it is to build a broad middle class, \nto lift those up off the bottom and to provide opportunity as far as \nthe sky for those at the top. We, again, are perfecting that in the \nUnited States. We are not there yet. I would like to see this continue.\n  I came to the Senate to try to work on a lot of different ideas, \nfrankly, about how we could continue this great progress. One of the \ngoals central to the continuation of this is--what does our economy \nneed besides good ideas and a infusion of capital? What else does our \neconomy need to grow? One of the things it needs is power. It needs \nelectric power. It needs power to run the various factories and \nenterprises and systems that undergird this economic growth.\n  We find ourselves debating how we can achieve greater efficiencies as \nwell as greater supplies of energy to generate this power. There is a \ndebate about what are the best ways to generate this power. That is \npart of what the Kyl amendment is about.\n  I think the renewable portfolio that we are debating is something \nworth fighting for. Before I get into that, let me make a few broad \ncomments.\n  I spent some time last week on this floor, arguing that we have \ndeclared one Declaration of Independence, but we need now, after over \n200 years of living under that declaration, to declare a new \nDeclaration of Independence, and that would be an independence from \nforeign sources of oil and gas.\n  In my book, the No. 1 reason for that is national security. That is \nvery clear to the American people now, post-September 11. The American \npeople are beginning to put together the compromises that unfortunately \nhave to be made in our foreign policy when we depend so heavily on \nsources of energy from some of the most unstable and unfriendly places \nin the world.\n  Americans are starting to ask the question: Why would we import \nmillions of barrels of oil from Iraq when we have sanctions against \nthat country, when we are flying sorties over that country and bombing \nthem at least once a week, trying to protect America's interests?\n  Our veterans are starting to ask this question: Why are we sending \nour young people to try to protect these oil and gas supplies when we \nhave such an ample supply here in the United States?\n  Last week I spoke about why it was important for us to develop the \nsupplies of oil and gas in our Nation. In Louisiana we have off our \nshores one of the great sources of energy for this country.\n  There are any number of leases, both active and those that have not \nbeen leased yet, tracts of land, that can produce ample supplies of gas \nand oil which can move our country forward. We have to ask ourselves: \nWhy would we be dependent on foreign sources when there are resources \nright here at home? There are resources not only off the shore of \nLouisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, but off Florida, some parts of \nthe east coast and the west coast, as well as in a small portion of \nAlaska which could provide a tremendous resource for this Nation.\n\n  Veterans are beginning to ask that question. Senior citizens are \nbeginning to ask that question, as are taxpayers, who pick up the tab \nfor this war on terrorism. Believe me, it is a heavy burden. It is a \nburden we are willing to bear.\n  This chart shows the riches of offshore Louisiana. We have been proud \nto help this Nation produce the oil and gas necessary to fuel the \ngreatest economy on Earth and we are doing it in a much more \nenvironmentally sensitive way. There is tremendous potential out here.\n  The reason I am in the Chamber today is not to go into more detail \nabout this exactly, but to also say that as strongly as I feel about \nincreasing the production of fossil fuels, I also am aware--which is \nwhy I am going to oppose the Kyl amendment--this Nation needs to do a \ngreat deal more to pursue and develop our renewable portfolio. We need \nnew sources of power that are not finite, sources such as solar and \nwind power.\n  While I do not like all the details of the mandates, I do think we \nwould be very remiss in the Senate if we did not attach to Chairman \nBingaman's bill a renewable mandate. Our ultimate goal is not only low \nemissions. Not only do renewables lower our emissions and improve our \nenvironment, but most importantly it helps relieve our dependence on \nforeign sources of oil and gas.\n  So I am opposing the Kyl amendment and joining with Senator Bingaman, \nasking both Democrats and Republicans to let us have a strong vote for \nrenewables. I do not agree exactly with the way this amendment has been \ncrafted. I am hoping in conference it will be perfected to make sure we \nare providing the right incentives for renewables in such a way that \nconsumers do not have to pick up too great a tab.\n  I think this amendment can be worked with. But to pass this energy \nbill off the floor of the Senate without a real commitment to \nrenewables would be a mistake. It will not get us any closer any faster \nto a point where Americans can say we don't need Iraq, we don't need \nSaddam Hussein, and we don't need places in the Mideast to send us oil.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  With renewables, with a focus that Senator Domenici is leading us on \nin a more robust, safe, environmentally friendly nuclear \ninfrastructure--which now produces 20 percent of the power in our \nNation--with Domenici and Landrieu and others' amendments that have \nbeen offered to this bill, we can increase nuclear production in a \nsmart and sophisticated way and provide even additional power.\n  The third leg is opening up domestic production in our Nation.\n  The Gulf of Mexico is divided into the western section, which is off \nTexas, and the middle section, which is off Louisiana and Mississippi. \nThen the eastern section, which is part of Alabama and Florida, has \nbeen closed to drilling. In the middle section, each one of these dots \nrepresents 3 miles. We are looking at about 200 miles off our shore. \nThe red dots and red squares are leases that are actually under \nproduction.\n  There is gas coming into our Nation through huge pipelines which \ndistribute gas and power to many States in this country. It is \nestimated by MNF that there is 100 trillion cubic feet of natural gas \nin just this one section of the gulf.\n  Natural gas meets the new environmental emission standards. Natural \ngas burns cleaner. Natural gas taken from the Gulf of Mexico is \ndistributed to people all over the southern part of the United States. \nSupplies are shipped to the southern parts of the United States, \nthereby generating wealth, creating jobs, and creating opportunities--\ngood jobs where men and women can feed their families, pay the mortgage \non their house, send their children to school, and put some money in \nthe bank for their families so they can be upwardly mobile and become a \nsolid part of the middle class--not jobs flipping hamburgers or \ncarrying luggage that are in some ways dead-end jobs. They are good for \nstarter jobs, but they are not good if you are trying to send kids to \nschool or college. These are good jobs that can be created right here \nin the United States.\n  We have 100 trillion cubic feet of gas. Technology allows us to get \nit. We could supply the Nation for 5 years from just this part of the \ngulf. We need about 22 trillion cubic feet a year.\n  Imagine if we could have a bill that could leave this floor. That \nwould be quite a miracle. I believe in miracles. I have seen quite a \nfew of them in my life. If we had a bill that could leave this floor \nand open domestic production in an environmentally safe and sound way--\nopen production around the country that is closed, including ANWR--and \nhave attached to this bill a real effort to create and generate \nrenewable energy, we could potentially within a few years wean \nourselves off the oil and gas coming from places in the world that we \ndon't want to have to be involved in unless absolutely necessary, \nbecause it requires the support of the Treasury and the life and health \nof Americans.\n  I know there will be Members who do not agree and want to support the \nKyl amendment. But I oppose it on the principle that we need a strong, \nrenewable portion.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, understanding there were some initial \nobjections, has modified his original amendment that was laid down. He \nhas tried to hone it down to an acceptable principle on renewables.\n\n  Again, we can fix it, enhance it, and massage it in conference. But \nwe can make a strong statement on this floor about renewables and about \nindependence and getting away from our dependence on foreign oil and \ngas sources.\n  I will be back in the next couple of days to talk about some specific \nthings that Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, and other \nproducing States are doing. The technology is advancing. We are making \nmany improvements to the environment. We are minimizing the footprint \nand maximizing the advantages for the American public so the necessary \npower can be provided for the growth and development in this Nation.\n  I wanted to speak about the Kyl amendment and to urge adoption of \nthis particular amendment which will make renewables and conservation a \nstrong part of our equation, and also to give us the independence we \ndeserve, for which our veterans have fought. We will continue to fight \nfor liberties, freedoms, and values. We will succeed in the long run.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from New \nMexico.\n  I have mentioned in two or three speeches my displeasure about how \nthis bill was brought to the floor. I will not repeat that speech \nagain. But this bill presented to us is the third iteration. It is a \n590-page bill with a renewables section. I was preparing to debate the \nrenewables section. Now I find the renewables section has been amended \ntwo or three times.\n  I am looking at the renewables section. I ask my colleague from New \nMexico to correct me if I am wrong. The mandate requiring utilities and \nretail electric suppliers to produce 10 percent of their electric power \nfrom renewable sources does not include public power. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it does not include either public power \nor co-ops. Of course, the pending amendment is the Kyl amendment, which \nis a substitute for the amendment I proposed, which is also a change \nfrom the underlying bill to which the Senator is referring.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield a little bit further, in the \noriginal bill, public power was included in the renewable mandate. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague for the clarification.\n  Mr. President, this is an important statement for my colleagues in \nthe Northwest. It is an important exemption. I have heard many people \non the floor of the Senate say: Well, renewables don't cost anything. \nIf renewables don't cost anything, why do we exempt Bonneville Power?\n  Why do we exempt the city of Los Angeles? Why do we exempt TVA, the \nTennessee Valley Authority? Why do we exempt public entities, period, \nif this is so good for the private sector?\n  People say it does not cost anything, and renewables are so \nbeneficial to the general well-being of a national energy policy. Why \nare we exempting such a large portion--rural co-ops, public powers, \nlarge municipalities? I fail to see the wisdom in it. It may well be \nthat if we did it, those public entities would be screaming because we \nwould be increasing their costs.\n  I hope everybody understands, I support the Kyl amendment because it \nwill not cost nearly as much as the underlying Bingaman proposal, not \nthe one that is in the bill but the one that has now been offered \nbefore the Senate.\n  I have tried to calculate how much it costs. Costs happen to be \nimportant. I hope everybody realizes, if we do not adopt the Kyl \namendment, or something close to it, we will be--by this act of \nCongress, by the Bingaman amendment, by the renewables mandate--\nincreasing utility costs, electricity bills all across the country. I \nsay that because we may well do it. I want people to know there is \ngoing to be a cost involved.\n  You don't put on a mandate on that says you have to have 10 percent \nof your power come out of what is classified as a renewable, an \nincremental renewable, with a new cost--and that power may cost two or \nthree times as much as the marketplace power costs--and then pretend it \ndoes not cost anything.\n  How much does it cost? I did some calculation of a utility in my \nState, Oklahoma Gas & Electric. We calculated how much energy they \nproduce. We calculated the cost of compliance assuming they did not \nhave wind power, and so on, so they would have to purchase it. In the \nbill, the replacement cost they could get from the Government would be \nfor these credits which would be 3 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  So if you calculate that, for Oklahoma Gas & Electric, the largest \nutility in my State, it would cost them $62\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\nmillion--not an insignificant cost. It is an increase in the cost to a \nutility in Oklahoma of about 5 percent; in fact, that would be for most \nof the utilities in the country.\n  Let's see if I have one from Minnesota. You are looking at a cost \nincrease of about 5 percent. You might say, how did you calculate that? \nI will give you a thumbnail sketch.\n  You mandate that 10 percent of the cost must be in renewables. The \nmost efficient of the incremental renewables is wind energy. For wind \nenergy, the cost will be at least 3 cents per kilowatt hour, plus there \nis a tax credit of 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour. So the total is 4.7 \ncents.\n  Guess what. The market wholesale cost of electricity right now is \n2.2, 2.3 cents. You are talking about an increase; you are talking \nabout a cost to both the taxpayers and the consumers of 4.7 cents, just \nto start. So you are talking about something twice as much as the cost \nof electricity in the country, and you are saying 10 percent of it has \nto be in the renewables. If you take just 10 percent of the power \ncosts--and it says the energy consumed or the energy produced must be \nmore expensive or twice as expensive--you have increased their cost by \nat least 5 percent.\n  I do not know if people around here are really cognizant, but the \nmore I learn about this renewable section, the more I am flabbergasted \nof how people are thinking they are going to vote for it and not \nincrease costs. It is an enormous cost increase--enormous, in the \nbillions of dollars. It is billions of dollars that transfer from \nbasically fossil fuel plants to certain areas or certain companies that \nproduce so-called credits or they can buy the credits from the \nGovernment. If they can buy the credits from the Government, the \nGovernment has a big new fundraiser in this, a big tax increase that \nutility payers are going to be paying.\n\n  I make mention of two or three issues. The original Bingaman \namendment that was in this section did not exclude public power. It did \nnot exclude the city of Los Angeles, which, incidentally, has a \npowerplant and consumption as big as Oklahoma Gas & Electric--pretty \ngood size--and they are exempt. Oklahoma Gas & Electric is not exempt, \nbut the city of Los Angeles is.\n  I heard the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, say, yes, these \nrenewables are great. If they are so great, why don't they apply to the \ncity of Los Angeles? Why doesn't it apply to Bonneville? Why doesn't it \napply to TVA? Why doesn't it apply to municipalities? Why doesn't it \napply to co-ops?\n  There is support from co-ops. They don't want to have their cost go \nup. Certainly, we don't want to mandate that the municipalities have \ntheir cost go up. We don't want the cost to go up for public power. We \nwill exempt them and maybe buy some votes. But who are we going to sock \nit to? Oh, we will sock it to anybody else that happens to be a \nprivately owned utility. We will sock it to them. There may be one or \ntwo that might benefit. Maybe they will produce enough of the credits \nso they can sell them, so they can sell the electricity. They can get \ntax credits of 1.7 percent. And they can get the credit from other \nutilities that do not have enough credits to meet their 10-percent \nmandate.\n  They get three times the value of electricity from the Government. \nThey will get almost a 200-percent rate of return from the Government, \nand they get to sell the electricity. That is a pretty good deal for a \ncouple utilities. But for consumers, they get a bill.\n  Some people say it does not make any difference because this is \nhidden. This is not going to come as a tax in the form of Congress \nissuing a tax increase. We are not doing that. We are telling the \nutilities: You go do it. We are mandating that you do it. And you bill \nyour customers, who happen to be our constituents.\n  We ought to rename this section, ``Renewable Section of Congress \nIncreasing Electricity Prices,'' because that is what it is. It is a \nBtu tax. It is a tax increase. It is a utility rate increase, pure and \nsimple. You cannot mandate that 10 percent of the marginal power has to \nbe increased from certain renewable sources.\n  It is very interesting to note, a renewable source is not hydro under \nthe definition in the bill. They left out hydro, which is as renewable \nas any. Oh, it is left out. Why? I don't know why, but it was left out. \nIt is renewable, but we are just not going to define it, so it is left \nout. The more you find out about this amendment, the proposal by my \ncolleague from New Mexico, the less sustainable it is.\n  I wish to mention a few companies--we have gotten this from the \nEnergy Information Administration, Department of Energy--and with how \nmuch energy they produce, and with the 10-percent renewable \nrequirement, and assuming they have to purchase the offset, the \ncredits, how much will it cost: the Public Service Utility of New \nHampshire, $21 million--a pretty good hit--Kansas City Power & Light, \n$16 million; Kansas Gas & Electric, $27 million; Nevada Power Company, \n$50 million; Sierra Pacific Power Company, $24 million; Arizona Public \nService Company, $67 million; Tucson Electric, $24 million; Pacific Gas \n& Electric, $216 million.\n\n  Guess what. Pacific Gas & Electric was having a hard time staying out \nof bankruptcy. They actually filed for bankruptcy. We are going to put \non a mandate that they have to spend $216 million. We are exempting \nBonneville but not exempting Pacific Gas & Electric. Maybe they have \noffsets to reduce that. Maybe they have enough wind energy to do it, \nbut I doubt it.\n  Georgia Power, $223 million. I could go on and on. My point being, I \ndo not think this amendment has been well thought out. I do not think \nwe have had a hearing on this proposal. The proposal deals with \nbillions and billions of dollars of increases in electricity costs.\n  Some people are saying, oh, let's just have a renewable standard of \n20 percent, 10 percent. Oh, it is all doable. We have to have \nrenewables.\n  I believe in renewables. I want to have renewables. And I want to \nencourage wind power and encourage other alternative sources of energy. \nBut I just don't know that we want to pass a law that says you must \nhave 10 percent of your power from this source defined as a renewable, \nand, oh, we forgot to include hydro, and we don't care how much it \ncosts. That is really the impact of this amendment. Consumers beware.\n  I compliment Senator Kyl because I think he has come up with an \naffordable substitute, one that encourages alternative sources but does \nnot mandate it, does not dictate that your electricity prices will be \nincreasing by 5 or 10 percent, which I believe is the case in the \nunderlying amendment. Senator Kyl's amendment treats all utilities \nfairly. The amendment proposed by my colleague from New Mexico socks it \nto some utilities but it exempts a bunch of other utilities.\n  Why should California be exempt and Texas and Oklahoma not be exempt?\n  That doesn't quite seem right to me. Why is the Northwest exempt? Why \nis Bonneville exempt and the privately owned utilities are not? They \nalready have lower utility rates in many cases because they have \nFederal hydropower, which is pretty cheap. It was built a long time \nago. So they already have low rates, and we are going to exempt them. \nBut the other rates, no, you are stuck. We are going to sock it to you. \nI just question the wisdom of that.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this long and seriously. Seldom do \nwe have an amendment that will have such a significant impact of \nbillions of dollars, and seldom do we have as many colleagues kind of \nabsentee as far as knowing what the impact of this amendment would be \non their constituents. I would like for people to pause and think.\n  I will be happy to share information that the Energy Department has \nprovided us on what this might cost your utilities and what your \nutilities will have to pass on to the constituents. It won't cost the \nutilities money. They will charge that added, mandated cost from this \nSenate to their customers. So the utilities won't pay it.\n  I have mentioned a few of these. MidAmerican Energy Company faces \n44.6 million dollars in increased utility prices. They will only \ntransfer these costs to their customers. The truth is, a lot of those \ncustomers are going to be companies that maybe are struggling to \nsurvive, that maybe are having a hard time creating jobs. And we are \ngoing to increase their utility prices by 5 or 10 percent. Some \ncompanies, some corporations, commissions, maybe the Texas Railroad \nCommission will say:\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\n We really don't want this to happen to the residential consumers, so \nwe will just have the increase and sock it to the big users.\n  There won't be as much political fallout. There might be a loss of \njobs in the process. Maybe they will make it apply equitably to \nresidential consumers as well. They will have a big increase. Then \npeople will go ballistic.\n  People will say: Wait a minute, where did this mandate come from? It \ncame from Congress in the year 2002. We didn't see it in our bill until \n2004, or maybe we didn't see it fully implemented until 2008. It passed \nin the year 2002 because somebody thought it was a good idea.\n  I think my colleague from Arizona has the right idea. I hope our \ncolleagues will support it. I hope they will start looking at the \nunderlying cost that is in this so-called Bingaman amendment. I hope \nthey will look at the cost of that amendment and say: Isn't there a \nbetter way, a more affordable way? Should we not include hydro in \nrenewables? Shouldn't we include public power? If we are going to \nmandate it on all private power, should we not include public power as \nwell? If we are going to have a universal energy policy, why would we \nexempt rural electric co-ops? Why would we exempt municipalities, \nenormously large public power such as Bonneville and TVA?\n  It is a mistake. I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl substitute \nto the Bingaman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 30 minutes, \nand the minority has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I know I have \na couple colleagues here who also want to speak. I know there are also, \nperhaps, Members on the other side.\n  First of all, the Kyl amendment is a stark contrast with what we are \notherwise trying to do with a renewable portfolio standard. The Kyl \namendment is very simple in that it says:\n\n       Each electric utility shall offer to retail customers \n     electricity produced from renewable sources to the extent \n     that it is available.\n\n  That is fine, but ``to the extent it is available.'' And they do that \ntoday. They offer electricity produced from renewable resources or \nsources to the extent that it is available.\n  What we are trying to do with the Bingaman amendment, with \nestablishing a renewable portfolio standard, is to provide some \nassurance that it will be available so that some portion of the power \nproduced by large utilities will, in fact, be produced from renewable \nsources.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma says usually the price of electricity is \n2.2 cents per kilowatt hour. I think that was the figure he mentioned. \nAccording to the figures we were given by the Energy Information \nAgency, the average cost in this country for electricity is 4.3 cents \nper kilowatt hour, not 2.2.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield? I am talking about wholesale \ncost which is the replacement cost where if you have incremental \nrenewables going into the system, they are paid the wholesale cost, not \nthe retail cost.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. This is a wholesale cost figure I just gave you, 4.3 \ncents. We are glad to share the information with you.\n  He says that we don't have hydro in here. We do have hydro as one of \nthe items that a utility gets credit for when determining the base \nagainst which the percentage applies. So that we give them full credit \nfor hydro in that.\n  Then we say, taking that base to the extent that they expand their \nenergy generation from increments of hydropower, that those will count.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield to make sure we are both on the \nsame wavelength?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Any incremental new hydro would count as renewable. I \nconcur.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Would the Senator agree with me, in your definition of \n10 percent renewables, existing hydro is not counted in that \ndefinition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, regaining the floor, I agree that it is \nnot. That is for a very simple reason. If you do count existing hydro \nin that 10 percent, certain States, particularly in the northwest part \nof the country--and also Maine--far exceed that. There would be a \ntremendous disparity between the extent of the renewables they have in \ntheir base or that they get credit for as compared to the rest of the \ncountry.\n  What we are trying to do with the Bingaman amendment is to provide an \nincentive for the addition of additional renewable power. To the extent \nthey can do that with hydro, we give them credit for it.\n  Let me talk about some of the figures. I would be anxious to see the \ncalculation to which the Senator from Oklahoma was referring. As I \nunderstood his explanation, he gave us figures for what each of these \nutilities would have to pay in order to comply with this provision, \nassuming they had to buy all their credits.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That was what I understood him to say. The truth is, \nmany of the utilities--I don't know about all of them--he named are not \ngoing to have to buy any credits. They are already producing power from \nrenewable sources, substantial amounts of power.\n  To suggest that PG in California is going to have to be going out \nand buying credits at the highest possible price is just not the real \nworld. PG already produces power from renewables. Arizona Public \nService is another example. He mentioned MidAmerican and how this would \ncost MidAmerican $40-some-odd million.\n  I have a letter here from David Sokol, chairman and chief executive \nofficer of MidAmerican, where he writes:\n\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman:\n       I am pleased to write in support of your efforts to include \n     provisions to promote the development of renewable energy \n     resources for electric generation in the Senate's \n     comprehensive energy bill.\n\n  Then he goes on to write that his company is ``one of the world's \nlargest developers of renewable energy, including geothermal, wind, \nbiomass and solar.''\n  Continuing from the letter:\n\n       Renewable electricity can play a critical role in \n     diversifying the nation's fuel mix and providing emissions-\n     free electricity for American consumers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. There will be other opportunities for me to speak. I \nknow I have some colleagues who wish to speak at this point. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Virginia has \nbeen patient. I rise to make a couple points. The wholesale power cost, \nwhich my colleague alluded to, was 4.-some cents. The spot market on \nwholesale power cost in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey and Maryland \nexchange was 2.1 cents to 3 cents from January to March. And Palo Verde \nis 2.2 cents to 4.3 cents between January and March. Those are current \nprices that I just wanted to mention.\n  If a utility, for whatever reason, doesn't have 10 percent \nrenewable--and most all utilities don't; there might be one or two, but \nmost of them don't---- they are either going to have to reduce it or \nbuy it. If they have to buy it, the cost is up to 3 cents. There is \nalso a 1.7-cent tax credit. That equals 4.7 cents. That is still 100 \npercent more than what the marketplace is providing in the examples my \ncolleague and friend from New Mexico mentioned.\n\n  But I am just saying the spot price in some big areas in the country \nis 2 cents to 3 cents. You are talking about a rate of return for this \nincremental power of over 100 percent more than market price today. \nThat is expensive. That will greatly increase costs, and somebody will \nhave to pay for it. Ultimately, electric consumers will pay for it. \nThey need to know that before we pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Virginia was here \nbefore me.\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are under a time agreement and we are \ngoing to be running out of time if things other than the pending \namendment are allowed to intercede into this debate. Our vote is set to \nbe cast first thing in the morning, as I understand it. So whatever \ndebate we have, we have to do tonight.\n  We have at least an hour of speakers on our side, starting with the \nSenator from Texas and myself, and the Senator from Oklahoma, I guess, \nis done, and then we have the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from \nWyoming, at least. As a result of that, I think we ought to proceed \nwith debate on the pending business so that we can fit within our \ntimeframe and be ready to vote tomorrow morning.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, may I inquire if, under the previous \norder, we are entitled to alternate from one side to the other on the \namendment, given the time allocated to us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no order to provide for that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that we simply alternate during \nthe time of the amendment, within the amount of time allocated.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to the extent that the time is available, we \ncan do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. There are just a \ncouple of points I want to make.\n\n  First of all, a big deal has been made out of the fact that Texas, in \nits electricity deregulation legislation, had a renewable energy \nprovision in it. In fact, the point has been made--erroneously--that \nthis is just what you have in Texas and it was George W. Bush who \nsigned that bill into law. I want to straighten that out because the \nBingaman amendment is nothing like what we have in Texas.\n  First of all, in Texas we have a provision that is related to \nrenewable generation capacity, not to how much renewable power you \nsell, because when you have a windmill--and I may be the only Member of \nthe Senate who owns a windmill, and I will talk about that later--but \nyou have a windmill, sometimes the wind doesn't blow. Sometimes the sun \ndoesn't shine. So the Texas provision is based on capacity, not \ngeneration.\n  Secondly, the Texas provision is that, by 2009, we have the capacity \nto generate 2,000 megawatts from alternative sources. We currently \ngenerate about 73,000 megawatts, which is roughly 3 percent renewable \nenergy, not the 10 percent provision in the Bingaman amendment.\n  Finally, renewable energy in Texas is renewable energy. In the state \nof Washington, hydropower is not renewable energy according to this \nbill, even though it rains there constantly. Certainly, you can argue \nthat hydropower is at least as renewable as chicken manure and pig \nmanure and cow manure, all of which will be subsidized under this \nenergy bill, in terms of electricity production. In Texas, we have a \nmuch broader definition of what a renewable is.\n  So, one, our standard is based on capacity, not generation, because \nyou have to have the flexibility with these alternative sources. Two, \nit is roughly 3 percent, not 10 percent. Three, it counts one of the \nmost common renewable sources, which is hydropower. I think that is a \nvery big difference. So to say that this is somehow what we did in \nTexas is simply not accurate.\n  Now, I want to touch on a couple of other things. First of all, I \nthink we are getting carried away here with these alternative sources. \nOn my place in Texas, I have a windmill. It is a really pretty windmill \nand it is called High Lonesome Windmill; it is high and lonesome, and \nit is sitting on a hill. It pumps water into a storage tank, and there \nis an overflow valve that runs down to the pond that keeps water there \nfor turkey, deer, hogs, and whatever happens by. I think it is fair to \nsay that this windmill is beautiful. I also think it is fair to say \nthat 100 windmills would be an eyesore.\n  So when you are talking about generating 10 percent of the energy of \nthe United States with things such as wind power, please consider that \none windmill is not bad. But if you put a hundred or a thousand of them \non my place, the place would be an eyesore. When we are talking about \nthis, I think it is fair to keep that in mind.\n  I join the Senator from Oklahoma in saying, look, you can have it one \nway, or you can have it another way, but you can't have it both ways. \nIf this renewable energy is a good deal, how come it is not a good deal \nfor everybody? It seems to me it is absolutely outrageous to say, Los \nAngeles, CA, doesn't have to abide by the law and sell renewable power \nthrough its municipal utility, but Dallas, TX, does. Bonneville Power \ndoesn't have to abide by the law, but their competitor has to, and \nrural cooperatives don't have to abide by the law.\n  Well, look, if renewable power and an inflexible federal mandate is a \ngood thing, how come it is not good for everybody? There is no way that \ncan be defended. That is plain old rotten, special interest vote-buying \nwhich basically says: We know this is a provision that will cost a lot \nof money. You have political interests that are for it, and in order to \nget it passed and impose it on the poor people who can't get out from \nunder it by cutting a political deal, we are going to exempt Los \nAngeles, CA and other municipal and public power providers. Give me a \nbreak. That is about as outrageous as it can be.\n\n  Finally, I believe there is a drafting error in this bill. In looking \nat this bill in a cursory way, I don't see any requirement that if I \nbuy these credits, I buy them from Americans. Can I buy these credits \nfrom people in China? I don't see in the bill a provision that says I \nhave to buy credits from Americans. Can I buy them from Mexicans, from \nthe Canadians, from China, from Russia, or from Uzbekistan? My question \nis: How well is this whole process thought out? When you let people buy \ncredits, you are not producing more energy, you are basically spreading \nthe misery.\n  I hope Senator Kyl's amendment passes. I am going to vote for it. But \nif it doesn't pass, maybe a fallback position ought to be that if any \nelectric company is going to have to raise their power rates by more \nthan 5 percent, maybe they ought be able to join Los Angeles, maybe \nthey ought to be able to join Bonneville Power, maybe they ought to be \nable to join the cooperatives and be exempt. This is clearly going to \ncost a lot of money because if it weren't costing a lot of money, why \ndoes everybody want to get out from under it?\n  I think the amendment of Senator Kyl is a good one. It sets a goal. \nBut something is very wrong economically in telling people, no matter \nwhether it is feasible or not, no matter whether it can be achieved or \nnot, no matter how much it costs, that unless you are one of these \nprivileged people who have an exemption, you have to generate 10 \npercent of your power by 2020 with these alternative sources; and, \nafter that, over the next 10 years, then the Secretary of Energy can \nset the rate at wherever they want to set it. God forbid we should have \nsome lunatic as the Secretary of Energy in 2021. They would have the \npower under this bill, unilaterally, to set this rate anywhere they \nwant to set it, other than below 10 percent.\n  Is that a wise delegation of power? Should we give anybody in America \nthat much unilateral power? I do not think so.\n  This provision is riddled with special interest loopholes. I think it \nis an unworkable mandate of the worst sense and violates the logic of \neconomics. It is nothing like the Texas provision. I hope we can adopt \nthe Kyl amendment.\n  I am afraid that all these people who have gotten exemptions are \ngoing to vote for it now. If I represented Los Angeles, maybe I could \nsay: Look, this could hurt, it could be expensive, but it will not \naffect you; I cut this deal. Or maybe if I got power from the TVA, I \ncould say: Yes, I am worried about this, but do not worry, I covered \nus.\n  I sometimes think I have some persuasive power, but I do not think I \nam good enough to defend this provision. I do not think I could defend \na provision, and standing with great righteousness, by saying: \nRenewable power is what we need, but we do not need it in Los Angeles, \nwe do not need it in TVA, we do not need it in municipals, we do not \nneed it for rural America. If it is so good, why do we not need it for \nthose things?\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is my question. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The information I have been given--and I am interested \nif this is accurate, as the Senator from Texas understands it--Texas \nalso excludes from their requirement municipals and co-ops, just as we \nare doing in this bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I wondered how they got such a bad provision passed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. They have a provision that requires 4.3 percent of all \nsales be from renewables in the year 2009, which is where their bill \nstops going forward. Our provision calls for 3.4 percent by the year \n2009 and has the same exclusions they have in Texas.\n  If the Senator has any contrary information, I want to----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me reclaim my time, and I will finish because there \nare other people who want to speak. First of all, I went through the \ndifferences with the Texas program. I do not see how you can defend \nexemptions if you support the policy. Had I been in the Texas \nLegislature, I would not have voted for this provision. Let me make \nthat clear. I would not have voted for it.\n  However, it is very different from the proposal here. It is much more \nmodest. It does count hydroelectric power as a renewable. It is based \non generation capacity, not actual sales. In other words, it is far \nmore reasonable if you are going to adopt an unreasonable policy.\n  Let me make one additional point. If this turns out to be nonsense \nand we get to 2007 or 2008 in Texas and we discover that our power \nrates are going through the ceiling because Texas did it, Texas can \nundo it. If they do not undo it, people can move. They can move to New \nMexico.\n  The problem is, when we mandate it from Washington, then the fact \nthat it is a disaster in Texas does not mean it is going to get changed \nin Washington.\n  Why not let the States do what Texas did: Set out a policy that makes \nsense for them, and then if it does not work, they can change it. Why \nshould we be dictating in Washington what is good for the States--what \nis good for Louisiana, what is good for Arizona, what is good for New \nMexico?\n  My legislature adopted a policy they thought was good for Texas. We \nare going to override it with this Federal bill. If anybody thought it \nwas good--I personally do not--but if anybody thinks it is so good, why \nnot leave it alone? But we are not going to leave it alone; we are \ngoing to override it.\n\n  I am afraid with all these exemptions, the fix is in, but this is \nreally bad policy. The Senator from Arizona has a good amendment. I \nhope it is adopted, and I commend it to people. I hope they will vote \nfor it. I hope people who received all these exemptions will simply \nsay: If I needed the exemption to vote for it, what about people who \nrepresent States that did not get exemptions? That is why we need the \nKyl amendment. That way, States can make up their own minds. They are \nno less responsible than we are. They care no less about the \nenvironment than we do. They are no less informed than we are. In fact, \nthey are probably much better informed about their own circumstances.\n  I am strongly in favor of the amendment, and I commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl \namendment. I wish to speak for a few minutes to add to my remarks of \njust a few moments ago.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 24 minutes 37 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time does the Senator from Louisiana intend to \nuse?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That will be fine. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has done an \nextraordinary job in leading us through this obviously quite \ncontentious energy debate. It is the result of so many different views \nof different regions, with each having its own set of natural resources \nand demands. It is very hard to come up with a national policy that \nworks for our Nation and also respects our regions and States.\n  If we do not change the direction in which this Nation is headed--\ndependent and unable to produce the energy necessary for our Nation to \ngrow and develop--our economy and our national security will be \njeopardized.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico for staying tough and holding \nthe line and trying to move a bill out of the Senate and into \nconference where it can be perfected.\n  I oppose the Kyl amendment and support Senator Bingaman's efforts on \nrenewables. There might be a better way, a better method than mandates. \nRecognizing that the House did not put in any substantive provisions \nfor renewables in its energy bill, I hope we can explore this issue \nbetween the time this bill leaves the floor and gets to conference \nwhere I hope it will be perfected and balanced in promoting renewables.\n  While the Senator from Texas does not evidently think windmills might \nwork and does not like the way they look, many people do like the way \nwindmills look. There are many regions that are having success with \nwind power.\n  In Spain, Germany, and Denmark, wind power supplies over 20 percent \nof their electricity. It really is a wonderful thought that we can use \nthe brains God has given us to create technology to generate power from \nwind. I am sure it is somewhat more expensive. I am sure there are \nkinks to be worked out, but do not lead people to believe that it is \nnot being done in an efficient way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a fact \nsheet from the Union of Concerned Scientists, an EIA study that says: \n``National Renewable Energy Standard of 20 Percent is Easily \nAffordable.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Union of Concerned Scientists]\n\n    EIA Study: National Renewable Energy Standard of 20% Is Easily \n                               Affordable\n\n       A national renewable portfolio standard (RPS) to provide \n     20% of US electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and \n     biomass energy by 2020 would cost energy consumers almost \n     nothing, according to a recent study by the U.S. Department \n     of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). A \n     national RPS increasing these resources from 2% today to 20% \n     by 2020 is included in the Renewable Energy and Energy \n     Efficiency Act of 2001 (S. 1333), proposed by Sen. Jeffords \n     (I-VT) and five other Senators.\n       The EIA report, using high estimates of renewable energy \n     costs (see discussion below), shows that under a 20% RPS, \n     total consumer energy bills (other than for transportation) \n     would be roughly the same as business as usual through 2006 \n     and only $2.8 billion or 0.7% higher in 2010. By 2020, total \n     bills would be $580 million (0.1%) lower with an RPS.\n       Other studies using more realistic assumptions and \n     incorporating the energy efficiency incentives in S. 1333 \n     show that consumers could receive 20% of their electricity \n     from renewable sources and save billions of dollars (see \n     below).\n       EIA found that a 20% RPS would increase average electricity \n     prices (the cost per unit of electricity) by only 3% over \n     business as usual levels in 2010 and 4% in 2020. With a 20% \n     RPS, electricity prices in 2020 are still projected to be \n     nearly 7% lower than they are today.\n       Even these small increases in electricity prices are \n     largely offset, however, by lower natural gas prices. Because \n     an RPS creates a more diverse and competitive market for \n     energy supply, EIA finds that these market forces would \n     reduce natural gas prices and bills.\n       Diversifying the electricity mix with renewable energy also \n     helps stabilize electricity prices by easing pressure on \n     natural gas prices and supplies. Under a 20% RPS, average \n     consumer natural gas prices are 3% lower than business as \n     usual in 2010 and 9% lower in 2020. These lower prices would \n     save gas consumers $10 billion per year by 2020.\n       The net present value cost of a 20% RPS would be only $14 \n     billion over the next 18 years. With ongoing natural gas \n     savings after 2020, an RPS would likely produce net savings \n     for consumers.\n       A 20% RPS would also help reduce emissions from power \n     plants. Under an RPS, carbon emissions from power plants \n     would be 55 million metric tons or 8% lower than business as \n     usual in 2010 and 137 million metric tons or 18% lower in \n     2020, according to EIA.\n\n\n    Correcting EIA Assumptions and Combining an RPS with Efficiency \n                      Produces Additional Savings\n\n       Several other studies have found that using more realistic \n     assumptions and combining an RPS with strong energy \n     efficiency policies would produce additional savings for \n     consumers.\n       The DOE Interlaboratory Working Group (IWG), consisting of \n     the five national energy\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\n     research labs, corrected a number of EIA's assumptions (see \n     below) and found that, when combined with energy efficiency \n     programs, an RPS of 7.5% by 2010 would save consumers over \n     $65 billion per year by 2020 (1997$).\n       At the request of Senator Jeffords, EIA used IWG \n     assumptions and found that the combination of an RPS of 7.5% \n     by 2010, advanced energy efficiency measures, and four-\n     pollutant emission reduction targets similar to those \n     proposed by Senator Jeffords in S. 556 would save consumers \n     $64 billion per year by 2020 on their energy bills.\n       UCS' Clean Energy Blueprint report, which used similar \n     assumptions to the IWG for renewable energy technologies, \n     shows that an RPS of 20% by 2020, with the energy efficiency \n     incentives in S. 1333, would save consumers $35 billion per \n     year by 2020 or a net present value of $70 billion over 18 \n     years.\n       The Clean Energy Blueprint found that additional efficiency \n     incentives, including for combined heat and power plants, \n     would increase annual savings to $105 million per year in \n     2020 and net present value savings to $440 billion over 18 \n     years.\n\n\n            EIA overestimates the Costs of Renewable Energy\n\n       The DOE Interlaboratory Working Group found that EIA \n     significantly overestimates the cost of adding renewables to \n     the system. The EIA:\n       Uses higher cost and worse performance assumptions for most \n     renewable technologies than recent experience and projections \n     by the utilities' Electric Power Research Institute and DOE;\n       Arbitarily increases the capital cost of wind, biomass, and \n     geothermal technologies by up to 200% in a given region after \n     a fairly small amount of the regional potential is met;\n       Limits the penetration of variable output resources like \n     wind and solar power to 15% of a region's electricity \n     generation; in parts of Germany, Denmark and Spain, wind \n     power is already providing more than 20% of total electricity \n     generation;\n       Assumes that renewable energy generation will cost 4 to 5 \n     cents more per kilowatt-hour than electricity from natural \n     gas plants between 2010 and 2020.\n       USC also found that both the EIA and the IWG limit the \n     amount of biomass that can be co-fired in existing coal power \n     plants to 5% of the plant's input. Recent experience from \n     around the world has shown coal plants can be co-fired with \n     up to 10-15% biomass.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman is rightly arguing that \nwhile this amendment may need to be perfected, we must develop a \nportfolio of renewable fuels in this Nation if we are to reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil and other sources of power.\n  Let me show a chart that will clearly illustrate that. This is \nelectricity generation by fuel. We, right now, have most of our \nelectricity generated from coal sources with a rising number of \ngenerators and powerplants fueled by natural gas. Since Louisiana is \nthe second largest producer of natural gas, I most certainly represent \nthe interests of people wanting to see more domestic production of \nnatural gas.\n  However, we have not been able to move very much this line \nrepresenting renewables.\n  We hope to increase renewables because by improving our domestic \nsources of energy, or increasing them, whether from coal, natural gas, \nnuclear, or renewables, we by virtue of that reduce our dependency on \nforeign oil sources.\n  By increasing renewables, we can improve our domestic fuel supply. \nThere are several reasons, I suggest, why this is a good thing to do.\n  First, as I said, we need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. \nEven as someone who comes from a State that produces a lot of oil and \ngas, I know that one of these days those wells are going to dry up. I \ncertainly hope this does not occur in the foreseeable future, but one \nday they will, because they are a finite source. Renewables are \ninfinite. They are, as their definition says, renewable. We can get \nrenewables, create renewable energy, and continue generating power for \nour industries.\n  Domestic energy production, whether it is through oil, gas, wind, \ncoal, biomass, or solar, increases jobs in our country. One of the \nthings we spend a great deal of time talking about is how we can create \ngood-paying jobs, jobs where people can make a living, have a living \nwage, save, send their children to college, purchase a home. Those \nthings are really very important. They are important to all of our \nStates.\n  Investing in renewables technology generates jobs. Domestic \nproduction creates jobs in America. We are all for helping the world \ncreate jobs. We would like to see a great middle class created in every \ncountry in the world, but our first objective is to create jobs for the \ncitizens of this Nation.\n  The third reason renewables are a good thing is that they give us \ndiversity. Why do we need diversity? We need diversity because in a \ncompetitive system no industry, no generator of electricity, or no \nregion should be held hostage in the event natural gas prices soar. \nThey potentially could switch to another source of fuel. If that source \nof fuel were too high, they could switch to another source of fuel, \nthereby keeping prices stable and low, and generating and increasing \ncompetition.\n\n  So by increasing renewables, we increase the options for businesses \nand electric generators so the consumers are ultimately benefitted. \nConsumers see their prices rise when there are monopolies, and when \npeople have no choice but to get power from either gas or oil.\n  So as we write a bill that helps this country to expand the choices \nof fuel, consumers will be helped and taxpayers will see their bills \nlowered.\n  The fourth reason I support renewables is that they are the cleanest \noption.\n  Now I have been in this Chamber talking about natural gas. I am very \nproud of the work we do in Louisiana, as well as Texas, and \nMississippi. We produce a lot of natural gas. It meets the standards \nset by the EPA and our own state laws and regulations. We hope to \ncontinue to produce natural gas for this country.\n  I will put up the other chart which shows how much the natural gas \ncomes off the shores of Louisiana and is literally piped through an \nextensive system of pipelines to other parts of the country. We are \nproud of this.\n  We would like to see more pipelines coming from different places so \nwe could provide clean natural gas for the Nation. People in Louisiana, \neven though we are proud of our natural gas and proud to be able to \ncontribute it to the Nation, believe in renewables because they also \ngive us additional sources that will come into the country from a \nvariety of different places.\n  Renewables are theoretically better dispersed around the country \nbecause they can be created through solar, wind, or biomass. So the \nadvantage of renewables is not only that they are clean and efficient, \nbut they also help us redistribute the sources of power, giving us a \ngreater balance, so there are not blackouts in California or brownouts \non the east coast. That is something in this debate I believe we have \nto keep foremost in our mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend. The Senator is under \nan existing order in which she had time in her own right which has now \nbeen expired. So does the Senator from New Mexico wish to yield 10 \nadditional minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, as he did before?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield an additional 1 minute?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The fifth reason is it is American technology that is \nat the base of these technological advances in renewable energy. \nHowever, we are not using them. They are being used by European \nnations. Our technology is developed at our universities, in our \nlaboratories, with our scientists, with our engineers, but we are not \ntaking advantage of these renewables. The Europeans have done it in a \nperiod of 5 years, from 1990 to 1995. As I said earlier, Spain \nincreased its renewable resources by 300 percent, Denmark by 150 \npercent, and the Netherlands over 50 percent.\n  In conclusion, I think a solution to our dependence on foreign oil is \nmore robust domestic production with a real commitment to renewables. \nIf we do those two things, we can reach independence, which I think our \ncountry and our citizens, whether they live in California, Louisiana, \nor New York, would cheer about. That is why I am opposing the Kyl \namendment and supporting Senator Bingaman. Again, I hope for perfection \nthrough the conference process, but I also hope this bill retains a \nrenewable portfolio and sends an important message to the American \npeople that we can stake our claim to an independent future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As a point of clarification, the Chair \nannounces the Senator from New Mexico has 22 minutes 29 seconds \nremaining; the Senator from Arizona has 29 minutes 54 seconds \nremaining.\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to respond to the \nSenator from Louisiana, and then the Senator from Alaska would like to \nspeak, unless there is an intervention on the other side.\n  The Senator from Louisiana had four basic reasons that she supports \nthe Bingaman approach and opposes mine. I will go through each of \nthose.\n  Her first reason was we have become too dependent upon foreign oil \nand that if we have renewables to generate electric power, that will \nsomehow solve the problem. Well, the Senator from Louisiana could not \nbe more wrong. I wish she would put the chart back up which showed the \ndispersal of the various energy sources. We saw at the very bottom of \nthat chart there was a red line. That is the oil that is used to \ngenerate electricity in this country--hardly anything. We do not \ngenerate electricity with oil in the United States, as the chart \nshowed. Transportation flows on oil--that is how we drive our cars--but \nwe do not generate electricity with it.\n  So if the argument is we have to reduce our dependence upon foreign \noil in the generation of electricity and therefore go to these \nrenewable resources, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Senator's chart was accurate that we produce electricity in this \ncountry with nuclear generation, with gas, and with coal. That is where \nwe get our energy production. So the argument that somehow this will \nhelp us reduce dependency on foreign oil is absolutely untrue.\n  I also will comment on the fact that the Senator from Louisiana said \nwe will run out of oil and gas someday. Well, someday we will, but, \nagain, we do not produce electricity with oil and we have a lot of \ncoal, virtually an inexhaustible supply of coal. We could generate all \nof the electricity that this country could use for centuries on the \ncoal we have in this country. We have been spending a lot on clean coal \ntechnology, so we can now do it in a very clean way. Nuclear power is \nessentially inexhaustible. So if one is talking about oil and gas \nrunning out as a reason we have to go to renewables, again, it is \nabsolutely false.\n  Finally, with regard to this first argument, the Senator from \nLouisiana said: After all, wind is free. She then went on to correct \nherself and say: Of course, there is some cost to producing it.\n  Indeed, we subsidize the cost of wind power at 40 percent of what it \ncosts, and it still cannot compete, which is why the proponents of wind \npower want to have the U.S. Government force people to buy their \nproduct, because it cannot compete on the open market. These renewables \nare, in fact, not free.\n\n  The final point of the first argument was that the Union of Concerned \nScientists, a reputable group, indeed, says that even a 20-percent \nmandate would be very affordable. Let's examine that for a minute, \nbecause the second reason was we needed to diversify our fuel for \nelectrical generation in order to keep prices lower. The assumption was \nthis would keep prices lower.\n  Again, she is wrong. We have today the figures from the Department of \nEnergy agency that puts these figures together, the Energy Information \nAdministration. I can read the figures for every single utility in \nevery single State as to what the increases will be. This is a pretty \nconservative estimate because they only take the power that is being \npurchased today--not 15 or 20 years from now--and they have not indexed \nfor inflation.\n  I suspect we all agree inflation will go up. All they took was the 3 \ncents per kilowatt hour, which is the basic cost that you would buy it \nfrom the Department of Energy, and projected that 3 cents per kilowatt \nhour--not 3 cents per kilowatt hour adjusted for inflation.\n  What would the costs be? I will take Louisiana, the State of the \nSenator who just spoke. I will leave out for part of this discussion \nthe municipals, but I will bring them in to show it is the same for the \nmunicipals. I begin with private utilities in Louisiana.\n  For the CLECO Power Company, the cost of this is $25.5 million, an \nincrease in retail of 4\\1/2\\ percent. Entergy, Gulf States Louisiana \nand New Orleans is $60 million, $89 million, and $17 million, \nrespectively, with an increase in prices to the retail customer of over \n5 percent, 4\\1/2\\ percent, and 3.86 percent.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask, why does my colleague, who sponsored this \namendment, mention how much it will cost Entergy to comply with the \nunderlying Bingaman amendment; why are they supportive of the Bingaman \namendment and strongly opposing the Kyl amendment if this is going to \nbe expensive for them?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to answer the question of my colleague. It will \nnot cost energy companies a penny but cost energy's customers. That is \nthe whole point. We are the ones who will pay, not the power company.\n  The reason this particular power company supports it--I understand \nthey will have to answer for themselves--they have invested in wind \npower. As I pointed out yesterday, according to the Energy Information \nAdministration of the Department of Energy, the only renewable that \nwill provide any significant increase in power is wind power. \nNaturally, those companies that invested in wind power love it. They \ncannot sell it today, even with a 40-percent subsidy, but if the \nFederal Government makes people buy the product, then they will be able \nto sell it. That is why they like it. Their customers will pay for it; \nthey won't be paying for it.\n  Let me turn to my State. I will pick some other States at random. In \nmy State of Arizona, the private utility Arizona Public Service is the \nbiggest at $67 million, a 3.72-percent increase. The Salt River \nProject, which would be temporarily exempted, is $66 million, up 4.63 \npercent. Another private utility, Tucson Electric, is $24.5 million, up \n3.69 percent.\n  The percentage increases are from 3 percent up to under 30 percent. \nHow would you like to be getting power from the Welton Mohawk \nIrrigation District, with a 29\\1/2\\-percent increase? Fortunately, it \nis one of the political subdivisions that is currently excluded from \nthe bill. Certainly they hope to remain excluded.\n\n  In California, Pacific Gas and Electric is $260 million, over a 3-\npercent increase. San Diego Gas and Electric is $45 million. Southern \nCalifornia Edison is $221 million. The total in that State--again, \nunder the conservative assumptions--is three-quarters of a billion \ndollars.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Would the sponsor of the amendment yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As I understand these figures, they are calculations of \nwhat it would cost these utilities to buy 10 percent of their power \nnow.\n  Mr. KYL. At the end of the time they are required.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. To buy this on the assumption they are producing \nnothing from renewable power, is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. They had to have a number representing cost and the cost \nnumber that it used was the one in your bill, in your amendment, the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico, which is that you can buy \nthis from the Department of Energy at 3 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. There is nothing in this analysis that acknowledges \nthat most, if not all, of the utilities that have been mentioned \nproduce renewable power from renewable sources now and have great \nability to add to that as the years progress, is that not right?\n  Mr. KYL. No, it is not right. In fact, many of the people or \ncompanies that sell to power retail do not produce with renewable \nsources today. They have to buy credits. The assumption is based upon \nthe value of the credits as set forth in the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Yes, some will build renewable energy electrical generation. The cost \nof that could well exceed that 3 cents per kilowatt hour. This could be \na conservative estimate, especially since it is not indexed for \ninflation.\n  We are talking about a number today that in 20 years is obviously \ngoing to be substantially higher. I am trying to indicate a relative \nfact; namely, that the cost to consumers is going to escalate \ndramatically. That is what this information demonstrates.\n  Now to the next point. The Senator from Louisiana said we have to \ndiversify to keep prices lower. I have indicated the Department of \nEnergy knows\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\nthe prices are not going to be lower. These are all of the estimates \nfrom the Department of Energy itself.\n  But there is another point about diversifying; that is, if you are \ngoing to diversify, you need a reliable source. Certainly if the wind \ndoes not blow, you did not generate power on a windmill. If the Sun \ndoes not shine, you don't generate power from a solar power. If the \nwater does not flow through a dam, you do not have hydropower. That is \nwhy the baseloads of the utilities is coal, nuclear, and gas. Those are \navailable, they are reliable, and that is why for these renewables you \nalways have to have backup, a storage battery, or a backup when it gets \ndark and the Sun does not shine or you have a drought and the water \ndoes not flow or the wind does not blow.\n  The third point is renewables would create jobs. I know my colleagues \nwould agree exploring in ANWR would create more jobs than windmills. \nThat is evident.\n  The fourth argument is renewables are better dispersed and are clean. \nNuclear is clean, too. Hydro is clean. But I don't see a big rush for \nhydro or nuclear power.\n  With respect to dispersal, it is interesting that the chart the \nSenator from North Dakota exhibited yesterday showed the renewable \nfuels dispersed all over the country, but each one is conglomerated in \na particular area.\n  For example, solar is obviously going to be produced best in the \nSouthwest. Hydro is best produced in the Northwest. Wind power, \ninterestingly, is produced best in North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nOklahoma, as I recall. The geothermal was in certain other areas. If \nyou are not in one of those areas, and since wind is the only \neconomical source of producing the power, you are out of luck; you will \nhave to import credits; you will have to buy credits from the place it \nis produced and your customers get nothing for that. They do not get \nelectricity; they just get credits. The electricity company gets \ncredits so the owners do not go to jail or pay a big fine.\n  The bottom line with respect to the arguments made, and they have \nbeen made by others as well, the renewables have some very limited \npotential, if they are highly subsidized, which is what we are doing, \nand we have extended the subsidy for them, and we are all for doing \nthat, but you cannot count on renewables in any significant percent \nunless you are willing to pay a very high price, and unless you are \nwilling to discriminate against some regions of the country, that is to \nsay, unless you are willing to force the electric consumers in one part \nof the country to pay a lot more than the electric consumers in another \npart of the country. That does not make sense to me as a national \nenergy policy.\n\n  Unless there is someone on the other side wishing to speak, I yield 7 \nminutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I can take 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, 7 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to follow up a little bit \non the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. He has mentioned an awful lot \nabout cost. I think we need to address this in specifics.\n  Let's assume a utility must purchase the credits. Let's assume we \nhave a utility that generates no new renewables. They make that \ndecision. Let's take the hypothetical utility. I am going to be \nspecific. I am going to take one that we can identify and we have the \ninformation relative to the cost.\n  Let's assume retail sales are a billion kilowatt hours. What we would \nhave to do is to take 10 percent of the renewable portfolio standard \nthat is in effect times 10 because we are looking for a 10-percent \nrenewability. That means roughly 100 million kilowatt hours of \nrenewable--that is 10 percent of a billion--times 3 cents per kilowatt \nhour. That is $3 million for renewable credits. That $3 million would \nbe passed on to the ratepayers.\n  Let's take an actual utility. I hope the delegation from Wisconsin is \nhere because the Wisconsin Electric retail sales for the year 2000 were \n3.173 billion kilowatt hours, times 10 percent renewable portfolio \nstandard; that is, 317 million kilowatt hours, times 3 cents per \nkilowatt hour, which is $9.5 million for renewable credits. That is \nwhat they are going to go out and buy if, indeed, they do not develop \nrenewables. Whether they make that decision or not, the point is it is \ngoing to cost their consumers. It is going to cost their consumers $9.5 \nmillion. What is that going to amount to, to the average consumer? What \nis the ratepayer going to pay in Wisconsin? He is going to have a 5-\npercent increase. I do not think it is fair to suggest, by any means, \nthat somehow these renewables are going to just come on.\n  I ask unanimous consent we have printed in the Record a letter from a \ngroup that happens to support specifically the Kyl amendment. They want \nto support the modified language in the Kyl amendment in order to \nmitigate and eliminate the harmful economic consequences for the \nrenewable fuels portfolio mandate.\n  I also ask unanimous consent a letter from the Florida Public Service \nCommission be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Senate Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: We are writing to express our deep \n     concern over the economic impact of the renewable electricity \n     portfolio mandates contained in the Substitute Amendment (the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2002) to S. 517. This renewable \n     portfolio standard would require that 10 percent of all \n     electricity generated in 2020 must be generated by renewable \n     facilities built after 2001. The renewable portfolio standard \n     would become effective next year, and the amount of renewable \n     generation required would increase every year between 2005 \n     and 2020. While we believe that renewable sources of \n     generation should have an important, and growing, role in \n     supplying our electricity needs, the provisions contained in \n     the Substitute Amendment was not reasonable and cannot be \n     achieved without causing dramatic electricity price \n     increases. This in turn would have the unintended consequence \n     of reducing the competitiveness of American businesses in the \n     global economy and, thereby, reducing economic growth and \n     employment.\n       Today, according to the Energy Information Administration, \n     non-hydro renewables placed in service over past decades make \n     up only about 2.16 percent of the total amount of electricity \n     generated in the United States. However, even this modest \n     existing renewable capacity will not count under the \n     Substitute Amendment toward satisfying the renewable \n     portfolio requirement. Generally, under that Amendment, \n     renewable facilities that can be used to meet the 10 percent \n     minimum must be placed in service in 2002 or thereafter. \n     Therefore, compliance with the Substitute Amendment's 2.5 \n     percent renewables mandate for 2005 would require doubling \n     the amount of non-hydro renewables that we now have in just \n     three years--even though it took us more than 20 years to get \n     to where we are today.\n       In addition, because the Substitute Amendment requires that \n     10 percent of all electricity generation, not capacity, must \n     come from renewables, vast numbers of renewable electricity-\n     generating facilities will have to be built. Wind energy, \n     perhaps the most promising non-hydro renewable technology, \n     operates effectively only between 20 percent to 40 percent of \n     the time. Solar is also intermittent. Therefore, the actual \n     amount of newly installed capacity needed to generate enough \n     electricity to meet the Daschle Amendment's requirements \n     could well exceed 20,000 megawatts by 2005. To put this into \n     context, according to the American Wind Energy Association, \n     we currently have less than 5,000 megawatts of installed wind \n     capacity in the United States.\n       Simply imposing an unreasonably large, federally mandated \n     requirement to generate electricity from renewables will not \n     guarantee that enough windmills and other renewable \n     facilities can be built on schedule; that the wind (or sun or \n     rain) will cooperate; or that the generating costs will be as \n     low as would be the case from a more diverse, market-dictated \n     portfolio of conventional, as well as renewable and \n     alternative fuels. If retail suppliers do not comply with the \n     mandate, they would face a 3 cent per kilowatt hour civil \n     penalty. Some way suggest that this penalty would operate as \n     a ``cap'' on the inevitable run up of electricity costs under \n     the Amendment. Even if this penalty were effective at \n     limiting skyrocketing electricity costs--and experience with \n     similar ``penalties'' indicates that it will not--the penalty \n     still would constitute an almost doubling of current \n     wholesale electricity prices\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\n     for renewable power. Clearly, electricity rates will \n     substantially increase if the Substitute Amendment becomes \n     law.\n       The Federal Government's past record in choosing fuel \n     ``winners and losers'' is dismal. The Powerplant and \n     Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, which prohibited the use of \n     natural gas in electric powerplants and discouraged its use \n     in many industrial facilities, was essentially repealed less \n     than a decade later when its underlying premises were \n     conceded to be wrong. While holding back the use of natural \n     gas, the Federal Government spent billions of dollars \n     attempting to commercialize ``synthetic fuels,'' including \n     oil shale and tar sands, with little to show for its efforts.\n       While we believe that the Federal Government has an \n     important role to play in encouraging the development of \n     renewable and other energy technologies, we are troubled when \n     that role turns to mandates and market set-asides for one \n     particular fuel or technology. Mandates and set-asides \n     usually don't work, and create unintended consequences far \n     more severe than the underlying problem being addressed.\n       For these reasons, we respectfully request that you support \n     efforts to modify the language in section 265 of the \n     Substitute Amendment to S. 517, in order to eliminate or \n     mitigate the harmful economic consequences of the renewable \n     fuels portfolio mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n         Adhesive and Sealant Council, Inc.,\n         Alliance for Competitive Electricity,\n         American Chemistry Council,\n         American Iron and Steel Institute,\n         American Lighting Association,\n         American Paper Machinery Association,\n         American Portland Cement Alliance,\n         American Textile Manufacturers Institute,\n         Association of American Railroads,\n         Carpet and Rug Institute,\n         Coalition for Affordable and Reliable Energy,\n         Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry,\n         Edison Electric Institute,\n         Electricity Consumers Resource Council,\n         Independent Petroleum Association of America,\n         Industrial Energy Consumers of America,\n         International Association of Drilling Contractors,\n         Interstate Natural Gas Association of America,\n         National Association of Manufacturers,\n         National Lime Association,\n         National Mining Association,\n         National Ocean Industries Association,\n         North American Association of Food Equipment \n           Manufacturers,\n         Nuclear Energy institute,\n         Ohio Manufacturers' Association,\n         Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce & Industry,\n         Pennsylvania Foundry Association,\n         Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association,\n         State of Florida Public Service Commission,\n         Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce,\n         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n         Utah Manufacturers Association,\n         Westbranch Manufacturers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Public Service Commission,\n\n\n     Capital Circle Office Center, 2540 Shumard Oak Boulevard,\n\n                                  Tallahassee, FL, March 18, 2002.\n     Re: Energy Legislation (Substitute Amendment 2917 to S. 517)\n     Hon. Bill Nelson\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: The purpose of this letter is to let \n     you know that the Florida Public Service Commission has major \n     concerns with the 400-page Substitute Amendment currently \n     being addressed by the Senate. It is extremely preemptive of \n     State Commission authority. If legislation moves forward, we \n     ask that it provide a continuing role for States in ensuring \n     reliability of all aspects of electrical service-including \n     generations, transmission, and power delivery services and \n     should not authorize the FERC to preempt State authority to \n     ensure safe and reliable service to retail customers. Also, \n     we support the Kyl amendment on the renewable portfolio \n     standard.\n       In particular, our concerns are:\n\n\n                   (1) Electric Reliability Standards\n\n       The substitute amendment would limit the States' authority \n     and discretion to set more rigorous reliability standards \n     than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) over \n     transmission and distribution. In fact, the Substitute \n     Amendment appears to provide no role for States at all on \n     transmission reliability. Yet, the Florida Legislature has \n     carefully set out statutory authority for the FPSC over \n     transmission.\n       If legislation moves forward, Congress should expressly \n     include in the bill a provision to project the existing State \n     authority to ensure reliable transmission service. We note \n     that the Thomas amendment passed. The amendment appears to \n     strengthen state authority. In that regard, the amendment is \n     better than the overall bill under consideration. Our \n     interpretation is that the amendment will not restrict state \n     commission authority to adopt more stringent standards, if \n     necessary.\n\n\n                     (2) Market Transparency Rules\n\n       This section is silent on State authority to protect \n     against market abuses, although it does require FERC to issue \n     rules to provide information to the States. State regulators \n     must be able to review the data necessary to ensure that \n     abuses are not occurring in the market.\n\n\n           (3) Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA)\n\n       The FPSC supports lifting PURPA's mandatory purchase \n     requirement, but States should be allowed to determine \n     appropriate measures to protect the public interest by \n     addressing mitigation and cost recovery issues. Thus, we do \n     not support preempting State jurisdiction by granting FERC \n     authority to order the recovery of costs in retail rates or \n     to otherwise limit State authority to require mitigation of \n     PURPA contract costs. States that have already approved these \n     contracts are better able to address this matter than the \n     FERC.\n\n\n               (4) Federal Renewable Portfolio Standards\n\n       This requires that beginning with 2003, each retail \n     electric supplier shall submit to the Secretary of Energy \n     renewable energy credits in an amount equal to the required \n     annual percentage to be determined by the Secretary. For the \n     year 2005, it will be less than 2.5 percent of the total \n     electric energy sold by the retail electric supplier to the \n     electric consumer in the calendar year. For each calendar \n     year from 2006 through 2020, it shall increase by \n     approximately .5 percent.\n       The Secretary will also determine the type of renewable \n     energy resource used to produce the electricity. A credit \n     trading system will be established. While a provision is \n     established to allow states to adopt additional renewable \n     programs, we continue to have concerns. Thus, we strongly \n     support the Kyl amendment which provides some flexibility \n     to the States.\n       The FPSC believes that States are in the best position to \n     determine the amount, the time lines, and the types of \n     renewable energy that would most benefit their retail \n     ratepayers. This particularly true in the case of States \n     without cost-effective renewable resources. A one-size-fits-\n     all standard will likely raise rates for most consumers.\n\n\n                        (5) consumer protection\n\n       The FPSC is concerned with language in Section 256 that \n     requires the State actions not be inconsistent with the \n     provisions found in the bill. While the FPSC favors a strong \n     consumer protection measures, preempting States by Federally \n     legislating retail consumer protections is not necessary. \n     States are better positioned to combat retail abuses. States \n     are partners with federal agencies in these efforts to ensure \n     consumer protection.\n       The critical role of State Commissions in the analogous \n     area of implementing the Federal Telecommunications Act \n     provision against slamming (the unauthorized switch of a \n     customer's primary telecommunications carrier) serves as a \n     good example. The Federal Communications Commission saw the \n     benefit of having State Commissions carry out the anti-\n     slamming program. State Commissions are simply better \n     situated and have a more in-depth understanding of the abuses \n     in the consumer protection arena. As a result, Florida's \n     slamming rules are actually more strict and provide better \n     remedies to the consumers than the FCC rules. We would like \n     to retain the ability to take similar steps in the energy \n     area if warranted.\n       It is our understanding that there are now 100-200 \n     amendments. We are in the process of reviewing all of them. \n     In the meantime, please call us with questions on them. We \n     appreciate that your staff has been in frequent contact with \n     FPSC staff.\n       In conclusion, we request that you take these points into \n     consideration as energy legislation progresses. Please do not \n     hesitate to call if we may be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lila A. Jaber,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I might observe, the State of Florida is in company \nhere with a lot of other corporations. Nevertheless, I think what we \nhave is people who are suggesting that, indeed, we have not examined \nsufficiently the ramifications of just what this mandate is.\n  It has worked, in my opinion, with the States. Fourteen States have \nmandated renewables. It is working. Now we are coming out and saying \none size fits all.\n  In my State, if I want to have biomass, I am left out in the cold \nbecause I do not have anything but timber on public land. But it says \nin here that unless it is slashing, I can't even use waste from mature \nlogs that happen to be harvested. I can't use the bark, can't use the \nsawdust, unless there is an amendment to this. Maybe we can get over \nthat.\n  There is not an awful lot of thought that has gone into this. In my \nopinion, it has been an effort to try to accommodate various concerns. \nYes, renewables are good. We ought to really have\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nrenewables. But we are forgetting how much it costs. We are also \nforgetting a very important feature associated with renewables, and \nthat is we continue to support fundamentally the funding that we have \nhad, which has been in the area of almost $7 billion in the last 5 to 6 \nyears in developing these renewables. But they do not come free.\n  When we do a mandate, I really question the wisdom of it. I know it \nis very convenient to walk out of here and say we have all voted for \nrenewables. That is comforting. It is good. But by the same token, the \npublic ought to know there is no free ride here.\n  As we look at biomass, a lot of people aren't knowledgeable. They \ndon't really know what happens. What you do is you burn wood products. \nYou get emissions. Emissions are a problem, and we are concerned about \nit. I do not see any great emphasis here for nuclear, which is clean \nand generates a tremendous amount of power.\n  We have inconsistencies relative to whether we include hydro as a \nrenewable. Certainly, in my opinion, it is. We are going to get into a \ndebate on this, I think, over an amendment by one of our Republican \nMembers from Maine who wants to exclude, if you will, Maine. I am going \nto have a hard time supporting an exemption for one State and not \nanother.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from New Mexico. I am going to sit down \nnow and let Senator Domenici be recognized, if it is the preference of \nthe junior Senator of New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has consumed the 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the remainder of my time, and I will give it \nto the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. The Senator has \n10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bingaman, I would not keep us here this \nevening, but I will be busy in the morning because of a markup, so I \nwill use some time tonight.\n  First, before we are finished with our debate and votes, I will \nreturn to the Chamber and give a rather detailed analysis of the \npositive things in this bill for nuclear power for the future of our \ncountry and the world. While I mention that, I thank Senator Bingaman \nagain for his leadership on Price-Anderson.\n  We have overcome one major hurdle. It is clear that you could not \nhave been considering significant additions to the utility electric \ngenerating powerplants that would be powered by nuclear if we had not \ndone that. But there are many things in this bill that will cause those \nwho think nuclear power can, indeed, be part of the American scene to \nsay that Congress is recognizing that and is paving the way for \ninnovation, new approaches to nuclear power, which may, indeed, help us \nenormously in terms of ambient air quality and achieving minimal \nemissions in the generation of electricity.\n  But I come to the Chamber tonight as one who looks at my record with \nreference to research on renewables. I think I have a pretty good \nrecord.\n  Perhaps it would be fair to say that with all the support we have \ngiven to these kinds of sources of energy, we have not done as well as \nwe should have. But during the 6 years I chaired the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee on Appropriations, we provided well over $2 \nbillion in support for research just in that one bill alone.\n  There has been real progress on renewables, especially in the cost of \nwind power over time. I hope a lot more progress will be made as time \nprogresses. But I have very great concerns with the imposition of this \nrenewable standard on the American public.\n  The current bill, as I understand it, requires that 10 percent of all \nelectricity be derived from new renewable sources by the year 2020 or \nbe subject to a 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour penalty. I don't believe this \nstandard can be met without causing significant increases in electric \nprices. If you were going to increase electric prices to get more \nelectricity, that would be one thing. But I think we are going to \nincrease all electric costs because of the mandate of 10 percent of \nthese renewable sources that are enumerated in this bill.\n  Remember that this mandate applies only to the privately owned \nutility companies. It does not apply to public ones, as I understand \nit. So it will just be a mandate on the privately owned companies in \nthis country.\n  At least in my office, there has been a bit of an outcry over this \nproposal, including a concern from the Public Service Company of New \nMexico, the principal utility company, and indications that to meet \nthis requirement they believe it is going to cost New Mexico users \nconsiderably more money. I met with them again today. They still \nbelieve that to meet this 10 percent mandate, the utility company costs \nin New Mexico will have to go up, and go up substantially. To put it \nsimply, utilities have to provide power, whether the sun shines and the \nwind blows or not.\n  The costs of Senator Bingaman's amendment are partly driven by the \nway the renewable portfolio is structured. We have discussed this with \nhim and with his staff.\n  One of my strongest concerns involves the wording in the amendment \nthat focuses on energy generated by solar and wind renewable sources.\n  To put it simply, utilities have to provide power, which I have just \nindicated, whether the Sun shines or the wind blows or not. Solar and \nwind, by their very nature, are intermittent sources of power. On \naverage, these sources deliver about one-third of their capacity as \nactual energy. Under this bill, they are required to produce 10 percent \nof the electricity. But as I am indicating now, it is not based upon \ncapacity but rather on energy produced and used. That means you will \nhave to pay three times as much to get to the 10 percent.\n  Now these renewables account for a small fraction of the portfolio. A \nutility can fairly easily find some other small source to cover those \ndays when you don't have Sun or wind. But as that renewable fraction \nclimbs, the utilities are placed in the position of having to build the \nrenewable source to meet this mandate, and then, on top of that, build \na stable baseload capacity from some other stable source to use when \nthe Sun and the wind don't cooperate.\n  This leads to what everyone should understand to be a double whammy \non the ratepayer. I could even argue that it is a triple whammy on the \nratepayer because they not only have to pay for the renewable \ncapacity--that is only useful about one-third of the time--and the \nbaseload capacity to cover the other two-thirds of the time, but they \nalso have to pay the cost differential for renewable power. Even with \nwind, which is the most economical of the renewables, the cost \ndifferential is at least 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, translating in \nterms of costs today to the American public of at least $11 billion \nannually. Somebody will pay for it.\n\n  By the year 2020, the annual cost will be what I have just described. \nIt will be parts of that $11 billion as we move up, because you won't \njust wait and go to 2020 and start producing, you will clearly have to \nstart using the solar, or wind, or whichever energy is allowed under \nthis amendment.\n  Another way of estimating it is the penalty of 3 cents per kilowatt-\nhour that is imposed for the failure to meet the standard and to figure \nthat as a cost. I have tried to do that. In New Mexico, this would lead \nto a figure as high as $40 million a year in additional electricity \ncosts. States such as ours are already reeling from unfunded mandates \nsuch as the arsenic standard. They don't need more help from the \nFederal Government to extract higher electricity rates to meet new \nstandards, unless there is no other way to get America's energy \ncrisis--to control it and to preserve and protect our ambient air.\n  I believe there are other ways. I believe we can change this \namendment so it won't be so onerous. I will be discussing that prospect \nwith the manager of the bill, but not this evening. I will not offer \nany amendment with reference to changing the structure, but I will talk \nabout it. Perhaps it can be considered before we leave the floor or in \nconference as something that will be looked at to make it more \nrealistic instead of this capacity and energy dichotomy which I have \njust explained.\n  We can greatly simplify the planning of utilities and minimize the \nsubstantial burden of this new standard by simply switching from an \n``energy-generated'' basis to a ``capacity'' basis. That would make it \neasy to measure. It would produce a modicum of reasonableness in this \nbill. It would be completely predictable.\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\n  When a company puts in a megawatt of wind capacity, the capacity is \nknown, even though the power derived from the resource is not known. It \nis probably only around 300 kilowatts.\n  Let me repeat that when a company puts in a megawatt of wind \ncapacity, that capacity is known, even though the power derived from \nthe resource is not known. And it is probably only 300 kilowatts, one-\nthird of the credit I have just described.\n  When I talk about the intermittent nature of renewables, I hope my \ncolleagues know this is no exaggeration. I have seen the actual data \nfrom a large wind farm in Minnesota. At times it does a great job, but \nthere are times when that same farm has to draw power from the grid to \npower its instruments because they are inoperative when the wind hasn't \nblown for a certain amount of time. Thus, they are a user of energy \nduring some period of time when the wind is down.\n  It is not as simple as people think. If this is going to be \nimplemented using the definitions in this bill, it will be extremely \ndifficult. Interpretations will have to be made. I believe before too \nlong we ought to straighten that out, make it far more intelligible, \nmore simple, and something that is more rational.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will not use the full 22 minutes, but \nI would like to summarize some key points in response to some of the \ndebate we have heard today.\n  A major criticism of the Bingaman amendment--which we have been \ntalking about, as well as Senator Kyl's amendment--has been that the \nproponents of Senator Kyl's amendment--Senator Kyl, and others--believe \nthat to require the generation of some portion of a utility's power \nfrom renewable sources is going to dramatically increase utility \nprices.\n  All I will do is once again refer, as I did yesterday, to the study \nwhich Senator Murkowski, my colleague, the ranking member on the Energy \nCommittee, requested of the Energy Information Administration. He asked \nthem to study this exact issue. And he was very specific. He said: \nPlease study this and do not consider any tax benefit we are providing \nfor any of these renewable energy sources.\n  They came back with their conclusion. They concluded--I am now \nquoting from an article in the Energy Daily dated March 12--``that a 10 \npercent renewable portfolio standard would have little impact on future \nelectricity prices.''\n  That was their conclusion. They spent some time on this. They have \ncapable people in the Energy Information Administration, and they were \nbeing asked to study this by Senator Murkowski, who was hoping, I am \nsure, they would conclude something else so he could use their study as \npart of his argument on the Senate floor.\n  Let me go on with what is said in this article. It says:\n\n       The study, released Friday, concludes that the retail price \n     impacts of a requirement that electricity generators provide \n     at least 10 percent of their output from renewable resources \n     by 2020 ``are projected to be small because the price impact \n     of [the program] is projected to be relatively small when \n     compared with total electricity costs and to be mostly offset \n     by lower gas prices.''\n\n  It is clear to me that we have some scare tactics going on here. We \nhave all these allegations: All these utilities are going to see this \ncost added, that cost added.\n  The reality is that many of the utilities that were cited here as \nhaving to anticipate great cost increases will not see any cost \nincrease because they will be sellers of renewable power, both to their \ncustomers and, perhaps, to other utilities because they have been \nforward thinking and they have been developing renewable power as one \nof the sources for energy.\n  The simple fact is, every utility in this country--virtually every \nutility in this country--is going to have to add capacity. They are \ngoing to have to add additional generation capacity over the next 18, \n20 years, over the period that this amendment covers. Most of them are \ndoing so now.\n  In my home State, very near my hometown--I live in the southwest part \nof New Mexico; that is where I grew up, Silver City, NM--the three \nnearest communities to my hometown all have brandnew electricity \ngenerating plants going in. They are being constructed as we speak. \nThere is one in Las Cruces, NM. There is one in Deming, NM. There is \nnow going to be one in Lordsburg, NM. In each case, it is very \ninteresting--and two of those are by one company; one is by another \ncompany--they are gas-fired generating plants. And that is typical. \nNinety-five percent of the new generation which is being constructed in \nthis country for meeting future demand is gas-fired generation. That is \ngreat. That is very good for my State because we produce a lot of gas \nin New Mexico. We can sell that gas, so we are very happy about it.\n\n  If you look at this chart, you get a little concerned because when \nyou go from 2000 out to 2020, you can see that our dependence upon \nnatural gas as a source for energy electricity generation grows and \ngrows and grows. Whereas today we are 69-percent dependent upon coal \nand natural gas to generate electricity in this country, and by 2020 we \nare going to be 80-percent dependent upon those two fuels, unless we \nadopt the Bingaman amendment to try to add some diversity to the \ndifferent sources of power upon which we can rely.\n  People might say: Why am I concerned about the fact that we are \ngetting more and more dependent on natural gas? As I say, my State \nbenefits from that. The reason I am concerned is, No. 1, we are not \nproducing as much natural gas as we are consuming, and we are not \nexpected to in coming years. Accordingly, there is going to be a \nshortfall, and we are going to start either finding more expensive \nnatural gas somewhere or we are going to start importing more and more \nof our natural gas in the form of LNG from the Middle East and other \nplaces. So that as we are now dependent upon foreign sources of oil, \nthen we will be dependent not only on foreign sources of oil but also \nforeign sources of natural gas in order to generate electricity in this \ncountry. So that concerns me.\n  The other reason is the price. The price of natural gas today is low. \nEverybody is happy because their electric bills are low. But I can \nremember 18 months ago when the price of natural gas was $8 and $10 \nrather than the $2.50 or so that it is today.\n  We have provisions in this comprehensive energy bill that encourage \nmore production of nuclear power. We have provisions that encourage the \ncoal industry in this country by funding substantial additional \nresearch as to how we can use coal in an environmentally acceptable \nway. We have natural gas provisions that encourage more natural gas \nproduction. All of that I support. All of that is important for our \nfuture.\n  But as well as that, we need to also have provisions that encourage \nmore use of renewables. That is what we have. We have this provision in \nhere that tries to say to these utilities: Fine, do all these other \nthings, but, at the same time, start giving some serious attention to \nthe need to develop renewable energy sources.\n  This is not a heavy lift. We are saying, in the year 2005, we think \neach utility in the country ought to produce 1 percent--1 percent--of \nthe power they generate from renewable sources of one kind or another. \nAnd then we say, in the year 2006, it ought to be maybe 1.6 percent. So \nit goes up in a very modest way. And we have all sorts of flexibility \nso they can trade with others if they are having difficulty in meeting \ntheir requirement.\n  The truth is, a great many utilities will meet the requirements of \nthis bill very soon. They will have no problem at all. The truth is, a \nlot of States have not gotten their act together to do anything. They \nshould have. This will prompt them to do something.\n  My State is one of those. We are listed as one of the top States in \nthe country for wind energy as a resource because we have a lot of wind \nin New Mexico, particularly this time of year, in the spring. The \nreality is, though, we have no wind farms in New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\n If this becomes law, we will have wind farms in New Mexico. Frankly, \nthe power produced from those wind farms, in my view, will likely be \ncheaper than the power produced from some of these gas generating \nplants if the price of gas goes up where I think it is likely to go \nover the next 10 to 15 years.\n\n  All of these estimates about how much this is going to cost, and that \nit is going to cost these enormous amounts, all assume a very low price \nfor gas. If you think the price of gas is going to stay below $3 per \nMCF, then you have no problem with using natural gas from now on.\n  I am concerned, though, when the price of natural gas goes to $5, \ngoes to $6, goes to $8, where it was before. In those circumstances, \npeople are going to be very glad they have some alternative sources for \nenergy so they can moderate the increase they will see in their utility \nbills. That is what we are trying to do.\n  There are great environmental benefits from using renewable energy \nsources. We all know that. Also, I think it is just smart. We are \nhaving a lot of debates about Enron and pensions. We had a hearing this \nmorning in the Health and Education Committee. Everybody said: Everyone \nknows you ought to diversify your investments, you ought to diversify \nyour portfolio, that you should not put all your eggs in one basket. \nThat is common sense when you are making investments. It is also common \nsense when you are looking for a portfolio of energy sources. It is \ncommon sense to say: Let us diversify so we are not too dependent upon \nany one source of power.\n  That is exactly what we are trying to do with this amendment. I think \nmy underlying amendment is a good one. The Kyl amendment just takes the \nguts out of it. The Kyl amendment is very simple. I cited this earlier \nin my comments. This is classic. It says:\n\n       Each electric utility shall offer to retail consumers \n     electricity produced from renewable sources, to the extent it \n     is available.\n\n  I favor that. That is what they are doing today. They are offering it \nto the extent it is available. The Kyl amendment is just a prescription \nfor the status quo. What we are saying is, let's make it available, and \nlet's make it available in large quantities. There are a lot of \nAmericans who would like to buy more power from renewable sources. \nLet's make it available. That is what our renewable portfolio standard \ntries to do. The Kyl amendment would undo that.\n  For that reason, I oppose it strongly and urge my colleagues to \noppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, until we can get a better read from the \nleadership as to whether they have additional business to transact, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I know the hour is late, but I want to take \njust a couple of additional minutes to talk about the campaign finance \nlegislation that passed today. I very much appreciate the indulgence of \nthe Presiding Officer. I just have a few minutes I want to use to \ndiscuss the landmark bill that passed today.\n  First, as so many colleagues, I salute Senators McCain and Feingold. \nThey are a model of what it takes to get a tough proposal through the \nCongress. They simply would not take no, literally. From the time I \ncame to the Senate, both of them double-teamed me and made it clear \nthey were going to stay at it until I had come around to the value of \nsupporting their legislation. In fact, I went on record in support of \nthe legislation as soon as I came to the Senate, and I wanted to talk \nto them about some additional ways to strengthen the bill.\n  One of those additional proposals has become a part of the \nlegislation that passed the Senate today. I want to touch on it \nbriefly.\n  I offered this proposal with our friend and colleague, Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine. It is called the stand-by-your-ad requirement. It is \na significant step forward in promoting accountability in the political \nprocess. It will provide a meaningful step to slow the corrosion of the \npolitical process and essentially the corrosion that springs from a \nlack of Federal responsibility when Federal candidates take to the \nairwaves to win elections but do not want to be held accountable.\n  The stand-by-your-ad proposal that was included in the legislation we \nvoted on today is straightforward. It says simply that to qualify for \nthe special advertising discount given to candidates now for Federal \noffice, those candidates have to personally stand by any mention of an \nopponent in a radio or television ad by placing a photo on the screen \nand stating he or she personally approved the broadcast or personally \nidentify themselves in a radio ad and reading a statement saying they \nhave approved the ad.\n  First amendment rights are protected under this proposal. Candidates \ncan say anything they please. They just have to personally stand by \ntheir remarks to get the discount. They can say anything they want, \nhowever farfetched and however extreme. As long as it is allowed under \nFederal law, they can still say it. To get the discount, if they are \ngoing to attack their opponent--of course, that is almost invariably \nwhat happens when you mention an opponent in an ad--they have to stand \nby that ad and personally be held accountable.\n  If a candidate chooses not to stand by a reference to an opponent, \nthey will buy their ad time at a rate comparable to that charged a \ncommercial user at the station.\n  Take Nebraska, Oregon, or any part of the country. What happens now, \nin effect, is the local car dealer or restaurant or other private \nsector firm has to pay more for various ads because there are subsidies \nthat are given for political campaigns. We are saying that to get those \nsubsidies, to get those discounts, you have to stand by your ad. A \ncandidate who is going to say something positive or negative about an \nopponent has to own up to it, not just edit together a bunch of shadowy \npictures to cover up the fact he or she is the one making the \nstatement.\n  What this means is that if you want to get the discount with respect \nto your campaign, you are not going to be able to hide anymore behind \nthose grainy pictures and bloodcurdling music. You are not going to be \nable to paint your opponent as somebody who looks like they just came \nout of prison and has not had a chance to get cleaned up and has had \nevery possible dastardly act impugned to them. You are not going to be \nable to do that any longer. You are going to have to own up to what you \nsay and not just run these grainy pictures and frighten kids and \nfamilies with bloodcurdling music in an effort to score points at your \nopponent's expense.\n\n  As the Chair knows, we are all campaign veterans in this body and \nknow a little bit about how in a campaign the sucker punches happen. \nThey are not made on the stump while the candidate stands there with \nthe band and bunting all around. They are made on TV; they are made on \nradio when the announcer's voice comes on in the most sinister way and \nshadowy pictures appear saying a vote for your opponent is pretty much \na vote to end Western civilization. That is what happens in a campaign. \nYou have again and again portrayed your opponent not as somebody with \nwhom you disagree on the issues but someone who is going to be a threat \nto the American way of life, and\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nthe accusing candidate's face and voice are nowhere to be found, and it \nis easy for folks to forget--conveniently to forget--who is doing the \nattacking.\n  I bring a special awareness to this issue because in the Senate \nspecial election with Senator Smith, with whom I work on a great many \nissues and publish a bipartisan agenda at the start of each Congress, \nmeeting me more than halfway as a colleague and friend in the Senate, \nhe and I were in a campaign that was completely and totally out of \nhand, and many Oregonians simply did not want to vote. They got to the \npoint where they said: The stench in this debate on both sides is so \ngreat, we are turned off the political process altogether.\n  I made the judgment in that race that I was going to take all the ads \noff the air about Senator Smith. I said: This is not what I went into \npublic service for--to attack somebody else. The reason I got involved \nwith the Gray Panthers--and I was codirector of the senior citizens \ngroup for 7 years before I was elected to the House--is because I was \ninterested in ideas, the best ideas. I did not care if they were \nDemocratic or Republican ideas. Oregon on a bipartisan basis came up \nwith breakthroughs in home health care and a variety of other ways to \nserve senior citizens.\n  I looked at what was happening in the Senate special election and \nsaid: This is completely contrary to everything I have stood for since \nmy days with the Gray Panthers and contrary to all the reasons for \nwhich I went into public service. I went into public service to offer \nideas and creative suggestions for making my State and my country a \nbetter place, and all of a sudden in that Senate special election, I \nwas not recognizing what was being said in my name because all of it \nwas just the opposite of positive. It was just attack, attack, attack.\n  My colleague, Senator Smith, to his credit, shares my view that our \ncampaigns got completely out of hand.\n  For about 3 weeks, the people of Oregon had balance in their hand. I \nmade no reference to Senator Smith at all. I took all of the ads off \nthe air that mentioned his name and talked only about the kinds of \ninitiatives I wanted to pursue, issues we talked about in the Senate \ntoday such as the bipartisan proposal Senator Snowe and I have on \nprescription drugs.\n  I admit I come to this question of attack ads colored by a truly \nsearing experience I had in 1996 and it is why Senator Collins and I \nfelt so strongly about trying to make this change.\n  I think owning up to statements about what a candidate says about \ntheir opponent is going to make a difference. I think it is going to \ncause a candidate to think twice before they go forward with these \nnegative blitzes on their opponents. I am going to be frank. That is \nwhat I wanted to see American politics be all about after 1996. That is \nwhy I have tried to keep it positive and to focus on areas where in the \npublic policy arena people can be helped, people can be empowered, and \nthey can make choices that make a difference for their lives.\n  Certainly the debate on campaign finance reform has been contentious, \nbut I think we can all agree that reasonable ideas can help clean up \nthis process, reasonable ideas can help drain the swamp that has become \nthe way political campaigns are financed and run in much of this \ncountry.\n  I believe the stand-by-your-ad proposal, which holds candidates \naccountable, and which I was honored to have a chance to work with \nSenator Collins of Maine, is going to help clean up campaigns. It is \ngoing to help make candidates more accountable and make the politics \nand political discourse in this country more positive and more open.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2175-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the country of \nTunisia, which is celebrating the 46th anniversary of its independence \nfrom France.\n  I appreciate Tunisia's economic achievements. Tunisia's Gross \nDomestic Product has increased an average of 5.5 percent in the past 4 \nyears, and inflation is slowing. The government has worked to increase \nprivatization, and its prudent approach toward debt is commendable. The \nUnited States in 2000 exported approximately $350 million in goods to \nTunisia, and I believe our diplomatic ties will strengthen as our \ntrading activities increase. Stability in the Middle East is of \nparamount importance to both our countries, and I thank Tunisia for its \npast efforts to work toward peace.\n  Tunisia's policies toward women's rights and non-Muslims' religious \nfreedoms are exemplary in the Arab world, and I hope the nation's \nleaders will continue to work toward promoting greater political \nfreedom and respect for human rights throughout the region.\n  More than 200 years ago, the United States and Tunisia signed a \nTreaty of Peace and Friendship, and I look forward to many more years \nof cooperation between our nations.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the forty-sixth \nanniversary of Tunisian Independence from France.\n  The Republic of Tunisia is a great ally of the United States. Since \nher independence, Tunisia has become a model for economic development. \nThe Tunisian economy has been opened up to the outside world, and in \n1995, Tunisia became the first country south of the Mediterranean to \nsign a free-trade agreement with the European Union.\n  Tunisian President Ben Ali has been instrumental in implementing a \nstable and effective constitutional government, protecting democracy \nand increasing political participation by all citizens. The Republic of \nTunisia also has a commendable record on human rights, protecting all \ncitizens. In addition, Tunisia has actively contributed to the search \nfor a lasting peace in the Middle East, offering unwavering support to \nthe Middle East peace process.\n  While Tunisia has become a great contributor to the world both \neconomically and culturally, as Americans, we must also remember the \ntremendous role Tunisia played during World War II as part of the \nAllied Force and the support Tunisia offered the United States during \nthe Cold War. For this, we will always be grateful.\n  The United States was the first country to recognize Tunisia's \nindependence in 1956, and it is only fitting that we take the time to \nreflect on Tunisia's contributions to the world. I congratulate the \nRepublic of Tunisia and its citizens, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2175-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2175-S2176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION AND LOCAL AUTHORITY ACT \n                                OF 2002\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday I joined as an original \ncosponsor of legislation introduced by my Midwestern colleague, the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich. This legislation is similar to \nlegislation introduced by the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Bayh, in the previous Congress. I am pleased to be working \nwith the Senator from Ohio on this very important issue. I know that \nhe, as a former Governor, is intimately aware of the concerns that the \ngrowing trash trade poses for the States that we represent.\n  We in the Midwest, especially those of us fortunate enough to be from \nthe Great Lakes States, enjoy a very high quality of life, beautiful \nscenery, small, neighborly towns, and spectacular natural resources. We \nhold it as a particular point of pride that we, in many instances, have \nthe luxury of avoiding many environmental problems, and we have \nstructured our State and local governments in Wisconsin to try to be \nsure that we continue to avoid them. We in Wisconsin, however, are \nunable to protect our communities, which have done a good regulatory \njob, from having to deal with the solid waste mess created by our \nneighboring communities in other States. Instead, my State has been \nforced to accept other States' municipal solid waste in ever increasing \namounts.\n  We need to enact legislation to give back to States the power to be \nable to\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\ncontrol the flow of waste into State-licensed landfills from out-of-\nState sources. This legislation would give states the tools to do just \nthat. It gives States the power to freeze solid waste imports at the \n1993 levels, and to charge a $3 per ton fee on out-of-State trash. \nStates that did not accept out-of-State waste in 1993 would be presumed \nto prohibit receipt of out-of-State waste until the affected unit of \nlocal government approves it. Facilities that already have a host \ncommunity agreement or permit that accepts out-of-State waste would \nremain exempt from the ban. States would also be allowed to set a \nstatewide percentage limit on the amount of waste that new or expanding \nfacilities could accept. The limit cannot be lower than 20 percent. \nFinally, States, under this bill, are also given the ability to deny \nthe creation of either new facilities or the expansion of existing in-\nState facilities, if it is determined that there is no in-State need \nfor the new capacity.\n  My home State has tried to address this issue repeatedly on its own, \nwithout success. On January 25, 1999, a Federal appeals court struck \ndown a 1997 Wisconsin law that prohibits landfills from accepting out-\nof-State waste from communities that don't recycle in compliance with \nWisconsin's law. Wisconsin's law bans 15 different recyclables from \nState landfills. Under the law, communities using Wisconsin landfills \nmust have a recycling program similar to those required of Wisconsin \ncommunities under Wisconsin law, regardless of the law in their home \nState. About 27 Illinois towns rely on southern Wisconsin landfills. \nSince the law took effect, waste haulers serving those communities have \nhad to find alternative landfills for their clients, incurring higher \ntransportation costs in the process. Ilinois-based Waste Management \nInc. and the 1,300-member National Solid Waste Management Association \nwere the entities that challenged Wisconsin's law.\n  By recycling, Wisconsin residents have reduced the amount of \nmunicipal waste heading to landfills. Since the State's previous out-\nof-State waste law was struck down by the appeals court in 1995, the \namount of non-Wisconsin waste in Wisconsin landfills has tripled. When \nthe law was in effect, 7.7 percent of the municipal waste in Wisconsin \ncame from out of State. That has risen to more than 22.9 percent since \nthe law was struck down. Though this legislation will not afford \nWisconsin the ability to block garbage containing recyclables from our \nlandfills, it will at least give my State the ability to address the \noverall volume of waste entering our State.\n  In 1995, I supported flow control legislation sponsored by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and drawn substantially from the \nwork of the former Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. I have been very \nconcerned that the Senate, which passed that bill by a significant \nmajority vote of 94-6, has not taken up legislation to address this \nissue since that time. The issue of interstate waste control affects my \nhome State and more than 20 other States. For years, States have been \nfaced with the challenge of ensuring safe, responsible management of \nout-of-State waste, and the need for State control is even more acute \ntoday than in was in 1995. Congress is the only body that can give the \nStates the relief that they need from being overwhelmed by a tidal wave \nof trash.\n  We need to take prompt action on this matter, and this legislation is \na good first step. I urge my colleagues to consider lending this bill \ntheir support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2176-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as terrorists attacked our shores and \nbombarded our sense of security on September 11, 2001, Americans, and \nindeed freedom-loving people everywhere, wondered aloud how the United \nStates would respond. They didn't have to wait long for an answer. \nAmericans rose to the occasion by donating blood, by volunteering for \nrelief efforts, and by enlisting in America's armed forces. But such is \nthe American way. When duty calls, Americans are ready to answer.\n  With the military action in Afghanistan and the many theaters of the \nwar on terror serving as a backdrop, the movie, ``We Were Soldiers,'' \nchronicles one of the first major battles of the Vietnam War, and \nconveys the leadership and heroism of the units that served in the \nBattle of the Ia Drang Valley. Lt. Colonel Harold Moore led a battalion \nof First Cavalry soldiers into battle, displaying a sense of leadership \nthat fostered comradery but at the same time illustrated the great \nstakes for which they were fighting. During my own service in Vietnam \nas a member of the Army's First Cavalry, I felt the same bond with the \nmen around me, and I am pleased that this film was able to capture that \nbond so well.\n  The Vietnam War, unlike any other conflict beyond America's borders, \nwas a war that polarized public opinion. It was a struggle that took \nplace far from home that, to many people, had little impact on day-to-\nday life in the United States. But this movie succeeds in putting human \nfaces on the countless lives lost, as well as on the veterans who \nreturned home to a changed country. Although that is the context in \nwhich Ia Drang occurred, the movie does a remarkable job not focusing \non politics. Rather it is about the love and deep bond between men in \nbattle, fighting for their lives. Lt. Colonel Moore summed up his \ndedication to his men perfectly when he told them that although they \nmay not all make it back alive, he could guarantee they'd all make it \nback home.\n  The story of the Battle of Ia Drang is one of grit and determination. \nBut it is also one of staggering loss. In November of 1965, some 450 \nmen, under the command of Lt. Colonel Moore, were dropped into a small \nclearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by \nmore than 2,000 Northern Vietnamese soldiers, and confronted with the \ntype of conflict that would mark the war in Vietnam for years to come. \nThree-hundred-five of those 450 men never made it home; their names are \ninscribed on the third panel to the right of the apex, Panel 3-East, of \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, and in the thoughts of \nall Americans, men and women for whom they sacrificed their lives. As \nPresident John F. Kennedy said, ``A man does what he must--in spite of \npersonal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and \npressures--and that is the basis of all human morality.'' The men of Ia \nDrang certainly paid the ultimate price in protecting our freedom, and \nthis movie ensures that their story will not fade with time. But ``We \nWere Soldiers'' does more than simply tell a story from the history \nbooks. It reminds us all that it is our mothers and fathers, sisters \nand brothers, friends and neighbors who serve in America's armed \nforces. The men and women who protect our values every day are \ndeserving of their places in our thoughts and prayers, and we are \nforever grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2176-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today in observance of the 181st \nanniversary of Greece's independence and to pay tribute to the heroic \nGreek patriots who, against tremendous odds, ended nearly 4 centuries \nof oppressive foreign domination of their homeland. This arduous \nstruggle continued for eight years, until 1829, when independence was \nsecured and the first steps were taken toward the establishment of the \nmodern Greek state. Just as the\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nfounders of the new American nation looked to ancient Greece for \ninspiration and instruction, barely a generation later, Greek patriots \ntook inspiration from the American Revolution, seeing in its success a \npromise of their own future. The reigning monarchies of Europe were \nuniversally skeptical of the uprising in Greece, but in the newly \nindependent United States, it won overwhelming sympathy.\n  For nearly 200 years, the American and Greek peoples have shared a \nprofound commitment to democratic principles, and both have worked to \ncreate societies built on these values. In the two World Wars that \ndevastated the last century, Greece fought heroically in the allied \nstruggles for freedom and democracy. Similarly, during the cold war, \nGreece was a bulwark against totalitarian aggression and emerged as a \ndemocratic nation with a vigorous economy, a strong partner of the \nUnited States, and a full member of both NATO and the European Union. \nThis progress is manifested by the fact that Greece will host the 2004 \nOlympic Games. Likewise, Greece's presence in the Balkan and Eastern \nMediterranean, as the only member of the European Union in those \nregions, enables it to play a stabilizing role and serve as a model for \nother nations in that area as they seek to establish stable democratic \ninstitutions and modern economic systems.\n  The U.S.-Greece partnership has also been strengthened many times \nover by the distinctive contributions which Greek Americans have made \nto every aspect of life in our nation--in the arts, in business, in \nscience, and in scholarship. As Greek Americans have made this \nremarkable progress, they have also preserved important traditional \nvalues of hard work, education, and commitment to family and church--\nprinciples that strengthen and invigorate our communities.\n  Greek Independence Day therefore provides us with an appropriate \nmoment to reflect on the many ways in which the past and the future are \nknitted together. As we recall the long ago events of March 25, 1821, \nwe are mindful of the courage and sacrifice of those who worked and \nstruggled to build the democratic institutions that are the guarantors \nof freedoms for not only the Greek, but for peoples throughout the \nworld. We both rejoice in and revere these institutions, and we take \nthis occasion to commit ourselves once again to preserving and \nstrengthening them for generations yet to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2177-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING THE GIRL SCOUTS ON THEIR 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncommend the Girl Scouts on their 90th anniversary, which was celebrated \nlast week with the passage of a resolution designating the week of \nMarch 10 through March 16, 2002, as ``National Girl Scout Week.'' In \nless than a century, the Girl Scouts have gone from a group of 18 girls \nin Savannah, GA, to a worldwide organization with a current membership \nof over 3 million. In Illinois alone, there are 19 chapters across the \nstate working to keep alive Juliette Gordon Low's mission of inspiring \ngirls to reach their highest potential.\n  Today, the Girl Scouts are helping girls develop the skills and \ninterests they need to be happy and productive citizens in the 21st \nCentury. Through their many programs for girls aged 5 to 17, the Girl \nScouts encourage community service, a clean environment, a healthy and \nactive lifestyle, and an interest in world affairs.\n  I would also like to recognize the work of over 900,000 volunteers \nwho generously give their time and efforts to make the Girl Scouts a \ncelebrated success.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Girl \nScouts and the millions of girls who have put so much hard work into \ntheir scouting.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to an \norganization that, over the last 90 years, has helped millions of girls \nbuild the character and skills needed for success as adults.\n  The Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. is celebrating its 90th anniversary \nthis month. From its modest founding by Juliette Gordon Low, who \nbrought 18 girls from Savannah, Georgia, together in March 1912 to \nfocus on physical, mental and spiritual development, Girl Scouts has \ngrown to a membership of 3.8 million. That makes it the largest \norganization for girls in the world.\n  Through Girl Scouting, girls acquire self-confidence, learn \nresponsibility, and develop the ability to think creatively and to act \nwith integrity. It offers girls opportunities to learn about science \nand technology, money management and finance, sports, health and \nfitness, the arts, global awareness, community service, and much, much \nmore.\n  On top of that, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has established a research \ninstitute, which addresses violence prevention and seeks to bridge the \ndigital divide by offering activities to encourage girls to pursue \ncareers in math, science, and technology.\n  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has a long and distinguished history of \nhelping girls develop into healthy, resourceful women with a strong \nsense of citizenship. More than 50 million women are Girl Scout \nalumnae. Over two-thirds of our female doctors, lawyers, educators, and \ncommunity leaders were once Girl Scouts. With a track record like that, \nthere is no doubt that Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. will be serving \nAmerican girls for many years to come. I look forward to standing here \nagain in 2012 to salute the Girl Scouts on their centennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2177-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE OPENING OF THE CONSULATE OF UKRAINE IN MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nimportant event that will be occurring in my home State of Michigan \nthis weekend. On Saturday, hundreds of individuals will gather to \ncelebrate the opening of the Consulate of Ukraine in Michigan. This \nconsulate will be located at the Ukrainian Cultural Center in Warren, \nMI.\n  For a millennium, the Ukrainian people have successfully fought to \nmaintain and preserve their unique culture, language, religion and \nidentity. Such resiliency and perseverance stands as an inspiration for \nfree people everywhere, and bears witness to the depth, character and \nvibrancy of Ukrainian culture.\n  During the course of the past one hundred years, Michigan has become \nhome to a vibrant Ukrainian community that currently numbers over \n200,000 people, the vast majority of whom reside in the Detroit metro \narea. Many of the Ukrainians who moved to Michigan came here in search \nof freedom and the opportunities provided by our nation. The Ukrainian \npeople who came to the United States left behind the horrors of Czarist \nRussia, the famines of 1932 and 1933, Nazi encroachment and Communist \nrule, but they did not leave behind their love for the nation and the \nculture they left behind.\n  These immigrants played a vital role in the development of Detroit \nand our nation. Ukrainian-Americans worked in the plants and mills that \nmade Detroit the Arsenal of Democracy. While some Ukrainians served the \ncause of freedom at home, others have fought bravely in our nation's \nmilitary to preserve our freedom. Ukrainian-Americans have contributed \ngreatly to the prosperity of this nation, while maintaining ties to \ntheir culture and heritage. The Consulate of Ukraine in Michigan will \nenhance and expand the ties which unite the United States and Ukraine. \nIt will serve the people of Michigan, and will lead to increased \nsocial, cultural and economic interaction between the two nations.\n  Many people worked hard to make this Consulate a reality. In \nparticular, I would like to thank Borys Potapenko and Bohdan Fedorak \nfor their efforts to make the opening of this Consulate possible. I am \nsure that my Senate colleagues will join me in celebrating the opening \nof the Ukrainian Consulate in Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2177-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2177-S2178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRAGIC ANNIVERSARY FOR CAMBODIA\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, March 30 marks the fifth \nanniversary of the horrific terrorist attack against the Khmer Nation \nParty (KNP) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\n  Nineteen people were killed, and 141 injured, when four grenades were \nthrown during a legal and peaceful rally organized by opposition leader \nSam Rainsy to protest the lack of justice and the rule of law in \nCambodia. Among the injured was American democracy-worker Ron Abney.\n  Sam Rainsy's message was right on the mark. There was no justice in \nCambodia then, and there is none today.\n  On this tragic anniversary, the United States and other freedom-\nloving countries should condemn the corrupt and ineffective Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia (RGC) for failing to protect its citizens and to \ninvestigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of this terrorist \ncrime.\n  Unlike hard line Prime Minister Hun Sen and certain diplomats in \nPhnom Penh, this Senator has not forgotten those murdered and injured \nby terrorists on March 30, 1997. This Senator vividly recalls the \ndesecration by Cambodian authorities of the Buddhist stupa erected by \nthe opposition party in the memory of those senselessly killed. And \nthis Senator is left wondering why the RGC expended more time and \neffort destroying the stupa than investigating the crime itself.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate honor the memory of those slain in the \nterrorist attack by having the names of the victims publicly known \nappear in the Record following my remarks.

JUDE'S COUNCIL OF THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS IN BLACKWOOD, NJ\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your \nattention the good and charitable works of the Knights of Columbus St. \nJude's Council Number 12092 in Blackwood, NJ.\n  Founded in February of 1882 by Father Michael J. McGivney, the \nKnights of Columbus, the strong right arm of the Church, has grown to \nbecome the largest society of Catholic men in the world. More than 1.6 \nmillion men in 12,000 chapters from the United States, Canada, Mexico, \nthe Philippines, Cuba, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Guam, Spain, and \nthe Virgin Islands belong to this lay organization in the Catholic \nChurch.\n  Knights of Columbus are Catholic men committed to patriotism, \ncharity, and unity. And St. Jude's Council Number 12092 in Blackwood, \nNJ is no exception to this rule. Following the devastating events of \nSeptember 11, St. Jude's Council immediately mobilized their members to \nassist the victims families. Whether it was holding a blood drive or a \nfund-raising concert, St. Jude's Council was there offering a helping \nhand to the many family members who lost loved ones.\n  To affirm that our Nation stands united, the Knights distributed \n1,000 posters of the American flag to the citizens of Blackwood to \ndisplay in a show of support for our Nation and our servicemen and \nwomen. The St. Jude's Council has also hung ten large American flags \nthroughout the town, a moving tribute for all who drive through the \ntown to see. At another community event planned to honor the victims of \nthe World Trade Center, Karl Wirtz, a member of St. Jude's Council, \nlovingly created a replica of the New York City Firefighters raising \nthe American flag at Ground Zero.\n  But these acts of kindness and solidarity are nothing new to St. \nJude's Council, as volunteer service and charitable contributions are \nthe hallmarks of the Knights of Columbus. It was on these bedrock \nprinciples that the Order was founded over a century ago and St. Jude's \nCouncil remains true to these principles today. Always active in their \ncommunity, the Knights have held a fund-raiser for a seriously ill boy, \noffer a CPR course for local citizens, and assist the police department \nin getting out an anti drug/alcohol message through the DARE Program. \nThe Knights also provide religious education and activities for the \nyoung people in the community.\n  What is all the more remarkable is that in these hectic times, all of \nthese charitable acts have been performed in addition to the \nresponsibilities of family and career.\n  It is my pleasure to commend the Knights of Columbus St. Jude's \nChapter for all of the good deeds they have done and continue to do for \nthe State of New Jersey. Congratulations to St. Jude's Council Number \n12092 may you continue to be, In Service to One.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Elise \nTolliver of Nicholasville, Kentucky for her most recent accomplishment \nin the field of education. Elise, who attends East Jessamine Middle \nSchool, was recently named a United States National Award winner in \nEnglish by the United States Achievement Academy (USAA).\n  The USAA, which was founded to recognize the outstanding students in \nAmerica's colleges and secondary schools, received nearly 19,000 \nnominations from junior and senior high schools across America in 2000-\n2001. The USAA selects its winners based upon the recommendation of \nteachers, coaches, counselors, and other qualified sponsors and upon \nthe Standards of Selection established by the Academy. The criteria \nincludes a student's academic performance (the average GPA of all USAA \nmembers is 3.8), interest and aptitude, leadership qualities, level of \nresponsibility, enthusiasm, motivation to learn, ability to set and \nachieve goals, citizenship, attitude, cooperative spirit, \ndependability, and recommendation from a teacher or director.\n  Elise should be extremely honored and proud to receive such an \nhonorable distinction from such a highly respected source. This award \nspeaks not only to her ability to learn and apply her acquired \nknowledge but also to her ability to lead by positive example both in \nand outside of the classroom. As Winston Churchill so plainly stated, \n``The most important thing about education is appetite.'' Elise has \nproven without a doubt to her peers, teachers, and now the nation that \nshe in fact possesses this ``appetite'' to learn and constantly improve \nupon her self-being. I applaud Elise's efforts and urge her to continue \nto reach for the stars. I will be very interested to see how far her \nreach will extend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2178-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOS NICKOLAS KALIVAS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Christos Nickolas Kalivas, the first Greek American from \nManchester, NH to be killed in action during World War I. He is being \nhonored at the re-dedication ceremony of Kalivas Park in Manchester on \nMarch 23, 2002. The city has completed extensive renovations and \nupgrading of the park in anticipation of the event.\n  Christos was born on September 24, 1885 in the village of Vithos in \nKozanis, Macedonia, Greece. In 1908, he left his wife, Vasilike, and \ndaughter, Gilkeria, to immigrate to the United States in search of a \nbetter life. He hoped to eventually raise enough money to bring his \nfamily to the U.S. as well. Unfortunately, the difficult economic \nconditions of World War I made this goal impossible and he was forced \nto live with relatives in Manchester and work as a laborer for ten \nyears.\n  In May of 1918, he entered the United States Army. Just two months \nlater, on July 6, he went overseas as a member of Company C, 16th \ninfantry, 1st division. He was killed in action during the October 1918 \nMeuse-Argonne offensive in France, one month before the war ended. \nTragically, he had never reunited with his family.\n  Christos represented the citizens of New Hampshire and the United \nStates with courage and bravery. I commend the contribution he made in \nour Nation in a time of despair. It is truly an honor and a privilege \nto represent him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2178-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2178-S2179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Secretary of Agriculture Veneman \nhas proclaimed this to be ``National Agriculture Week.'' In this \nspirit, I rise today to recognize the countless and immeasurable \ncontributions of hard-\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nworking farm families across the country who throughout our nation's \nhistory have worked relentlessly to ensure the food security of our \nnation and to eliminate hunger around the world.\n  Some of my colleagues may believe I sound like a broken record when \nit comes to my advocacy for the nation's mid-section and its hard-\nworking food producers. But I like to remind them about an old saying: \n``We're only nine meals away from a revolution.'' In other words, empty \nstomachs can prompt a traditionally law-abiding populace to mob \nhysteria and mayhem. A stable food supply brings social stability.\n  For seven decades the Federal Government has recognized the \nimportance of maintaining a farm safety net to ensure America's \nhomegrown food security. The tragic event of September 11 underscored \nthe significant responsibilities the Federal Government must undertake \nto protect our national security interests at home and abroad.\n  Safeguarding the American public and shielding the U.S. economy, \ntransportation infrastructure, health care delivery systems, energy \nsupplies, natural resources and production agriculture from the threats \nof 21st century terrorism have become Washington's top priority. This \neffort must include a farm safety net that works to ensure our farmers \nand ranchers are able to continue feeding America by making a decent \nliving off the land. Otherwise, American consumers could well find \nthemselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers at the grocery store much \nlike we are today at the gas station.\n  We must not forget our nation's long agrarian heritage. In 1790, \nninety percent of the nation's labor force were farmers--feeding a \npopulation of only 4 million.\n  Today, with less than 2 percent of our population actively engaged in \nagriculture, our nation's family farmers feed a U.S. population of 265 \nmillion, along with millions of others around the world.\n  The contributions of the agriculture industry on our economy are \nmany. Agriculture is the largest positive contributor to our nation's \nbalance of trade. Last year, American farmers exported $53 billion \nworth of commodities. The State of Iowa alone exported more than $3 \nbillion worth of corn, soybeans, live animals, and red meats.\n  Moreover, according to the Department of Agriculture, each dollar \nfrom agricultural exports generates another $1.47 in additional \neconomic activity. Twenty-four million Americans depend on agriculture \nfor their livelihoods.\n  Despite the enormous contributions of farming to our country, today, \nfewer and fewer people have direct ties to life on the farm, and fewer \nstill depend solely on farming for their livelihood. Technological \nefficiencies and mechanical advances on today's farm require less labor \nto produce more food. While fewer hands may be needed on the farmplace, \nnew opportunities exist in food production and value-added agriculture \nto keep future generations of Iowans productive contributors in the \nfood chain.\n  In conclusion, farming has come a long way over the last 100 years. \nThe horse-drawn plow has turned into a tractor-drawn, fully-\ncomputerized farm implement. In the next 100 years, farmers will again \nserve as pioneers in newly-tilled fields of emerging technologies.\n  The world's food producers will not only feed the world but expand \ntheir traditional contribution to humanity as advances in agricultural \nsciences allow raw food to carry health, disease-resistant benefits for \nconsumers.\n  Whatever the future may hold, I will keep my nose to the grindstone \nin Washington to help Iowa's century farms and farm families enjoy \nanother 100 years of prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2179-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF BEATRICE CORBIN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

COURSEY\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Ernest D. \nCoursey, a true citizen and servant of Atlantic City, New Jersey. As a \nleader of the City's Council, he has worked diligently to improve the \ndaily lives of his neighbors and bring opportunity and hope to the \nthousands who call Atlantic City home. For his work and commitment, Mr. \nCoursey will receive the Charles A. Hayes Award, named for an \noutstanding public servant, a veteran of the United States Congress, \nand passionate defender of civil, human, and worker's rights.\n  First elected Third Ward Councilman on the Atlantic City Council in \n1991, Mr. Coursey quickly emerged as a leader. He rose first to Council \nVice President and later to Council President, while never forgetting \nhis constituents,\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nfocusing on the needs of children and Seniors. His annual holiday \nevents, food drives and Senior and Youth Days united the entire city \nand increased the sense of community.\n  After serving on the City's Council, he was appointed Confidential \nAide to the Mayor. This new role has enabled Mr. Coursey to bring his \nconsiderable leadership skills and knowledge of the residents' needs to \nthe entire City. As a life-long Atlantic City resident, Ernest D. \nCoursey has demonstrated his commitment to public service and to the \ncitizens of his hometown. His receipt of the Charles D.

It is my \nprivilege to acknowledge Mr. Coursey today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2180-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LEAMON HOOD\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nLeamon Hood, who will soon receive the Nelson ``Jack'' Hood Award for \nhis commitment to the labor community, and his political and social \nactivism.\n  Leamon was born in 1937 in Jackson Georgia, a small town outside of \nAtlanta. The fifth of seven children to former sharecroppers, Leamon \nlived there for the first 15 years of his life, before moving to \nAtlanta after the death of his mother. In his senior year in high \nschool, Leamon dropped out to join the United States Navy, where he \nsubsequently earned his G.E.D. and was trained as a Certified Air \nMechanic.\n  It was after he left the Navy in 1960 that Mr. Hood first experienced \nthe string of job discrimination, when racist hiring practices \nprevented him from getting employment as a civilian aircraft mechanic. \nAs a result, Leamon went to work as a janitor in a paint manufacturing \ncompany. However, he again was confronted with discrimination when in \n1962 he was fired from his job as a janitor after refusing to join the \nTeamsters Union, which at the time contractually restricted blacks to \njobs in the service department. Ultimately, Leamon became a school \ncustodian in Atlanta and helped organize the Classified School \nemployees into AFSCME. Yet even though he helped to organize his peers \ninto AFSCME, Leamon himself refused to join again as a result of the \npersistent segregation and discrimination he found in the union.\n  That finally changed in 1964, when the new President of AFSCME, Jerry \nWurf, removed all official racial barriers of segregation and \ndiscrimination. Leamon joined the union, and became one of its most \nactive members, at one point even seeking to become President of his \nlocal. Though he lost that bid, Leamon remained active and in 1967 he \nbecame one of the charter members in the Union's Staff Intern Program, \nwhich trained members to organize.\n  Since 1970 Leamon has served as an organizer throughout the country, \nincluding stints as an Area Director in Michigan, Tennessee, Florida, \nGeorgia, and several other states. In 1999 he was appointed a Regional \nDirector responsible for Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, where \nhe currently serves.\n  It is my firm belief that Leamon will continue this fine tradition of \nservice in the years to come, and will remain a tireless advocate on \nbehalf of those in the labor community. I congratulate him on receiving \nthe Nelson ``Jack'' Hood Award, and consider it a privilege to honor \nhim today on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2180-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2180-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2180-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 706.

A bill to authorize the appointment of additional Federal \ndistrict court judges for the middle and southern districts of Florida, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, an estimated 200,000 new Floridians every \nyear move into the Sunshine State, making Florida one of the fastest \ngrowing States in the Nation. As the population increases, so do the \nnumber of people seeking justice from the Federal Courts in our State.\n  Few are more familiar with these demands than the judges and \npersonnel of the United States Courts in Florida's Middle and Southern \nDistricts. The Judicial Conference of the United States has established \na benchmark caseload standard of 430 case filings per judgeship. This \nis a goal that is rarely met in Florida's Middle and Southern \nDistricts.\n  In fact, the number of case filings per judgeship in the Southern \nDistrict has remained above 500 since 1995; at the end of last year it \nstood at 609. In the Middle District the courts' weighted caseload with \n547 per judgeship at the end of 2001, 27 percent above the Conference \nstandard.\n  In light of this considerable burden on Florida's judges and the \noutlook for continued growth within the State, the United States \nJudicial Conference has recommended that Congress add one permanent and \none temporary judgeship to the Middle District and one permanent \njudgeship in the Southern District.\n  It is in accordance with these recommendations that my colleague from \nFlorida and I introduce legislation to establish these needed \njudgeships. It is my hope that these additional judges will help to \nalleviate the heavy burden currently placed on Florida's Federal \ncourts.\n  The administration of justice will continue to be a challenge in \nFlorida's Federal courts unless adequate resources are committed. \nPerhaps the most egregious example of this lack of resources is in the \nFort Myers division of the Middle District, where judge's criminal \ncaseloads stand at an astounding ninety percent above the national \naverage.\n  As Florida continues to grow, this burden will only increase. The \nservices provided by the Federal judiciary must grow to meet these \ndemands. I urge the Senate to support this legislation, ensure adequate \nresources for the administration of justice, and uphold the United \nStates Constitution's guarantee of fair and speedy justice.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Florida's Middle and Southern \nDistrict Courts desperately need additional judges. These jurisdictions \nare among the busiest in the Nation and they face an avalanche of new \ncases which threaten to further delay the administration of justice for \nthousands of Floridians. Simply put, Florida's judges are overwhelmed \nand unable to handle this many cases.\n  Today, Senator Graham and I are introducing legislation which will \ncreate one additional permanent judgeship for the Middle District of \nFlorida and one additional permanent judgeship for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida. Our legislation also creates a temporary judgeship \nfor the Middle District which will expire following the first vacancy \non the court which occurs no sooner than seven years after the \nconfirmation date of the individual named to fill the temporary \nposition.\n  Our intention is to ensure that Florida's Federal courts have the \njurists necessary to exact timely justice. After reviewing current \njudges' caseloads and consulting with the districts' chief judges, we \nbelieve authorizing new judgeships is absolutely essential to ensuring \nthat these jurisdictions are able to meet their statutory and \nconstitutional obligations. Florida's Federal courts need these judges \nand Senator Graham and I intend to do everything we can to get them.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee to quickly pass this legislation, so that we can bring relief \nto Florida's Middle and Southern District Courts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 2037. A bill to mobilize technology and science experts to respond \nquickly to the threats posed by terrorist attacks and other \nemergencies, by providing for the establishment of a national emergency \ntechnology guard, a technology reliability advisory board, and a center \nfor evaluating antiterrorism and disaster response technology within \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, earlier today, along with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Allen of Virginia, I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation that would establish the technology equivalent of the \nNational Guard. It is an effort we have been pursuing in the Science, \nTechnology, and Space Subcommittee. I am very pleased to have the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate on the subcommittee and pleased that he \nis in the chair as we discuss this legislation tonight.\n  This is a subject we have been working on since September 11 and the \ntragedy that struck our country that day.\n  We are all aware that the public sector, government, military, and \nlaw enforcement have begun a very significant mobilization effort to \nfight terrorism. It is a laudatory effort, one I fully support. This \npublic effort is not going to be successful alone, if we don't take \nsteps to tap the tremendous technology and science talents of America's \nprivate sector.\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n  Considering the enormous technological challenges faced on September \n11, the quality of emergency response is more than exceptional. But the \nmany private companies and their science and technology experts who \nrushed to offer their help that day have told our committee they can do \nmore. They can move faster, and they can help save more lives if the \nU.S. Congress provides a portal, an opportunity for them to more \naccessibly participate and offer their talents. That is why the \nlegislation Senator Allen and I offered today, the Science and \nTechnology Emergency Mobilization Act, provides an opportunity to tap \nthose talents of the private sector.\n  It doesn't create a large bureaucracy. It is not going to snarl our \nprivate companies in red tape. It is simply going to provide a gateway \nto bring the resources of the private sector to bear in the war against \nterrorism.\n  I believe, just as John F. Kennedy gave America's youth a forum for \npublic service, now is the time for our Government to throw open its \ndoors to a new generation raised on information technologies that will \nbe able to respond to the wide variety of technology and science-\nrelated challenges that arise in the wake of a terrorist attack or \nother disaster.\n  The legislation we are offering today offers four opportunities to \ncapitalize on the immense technology resources of our Nation. One I am \nespecially pleased about would establish a virtual technology reserve. \nAs my colleagues know, we have a strategic petroleum reserve in our \ncountry. It is an energy insurance policy, an energy bank, in effect, \nthat we can tap when we are in a crunch with respect to oil products. I \nthink we ought to look at technology as the same sort of resource.\n  So we have created a virtual technology reserve in our legislation \nthat would allow communities all across this country to put in place a \npreexisting database of private sector equipment and expertise that \nthey could call upon in the case of an emergency. Access to this \ndatabase would enable Federal, State, and local officials, as well as \nnongovernmental relief organizations, to locate quickly whatever \ntechnology or scientific help they might need from the private sector.\n  For example, a city official tasked with setting up a command center \nin the wake of an emergency might need laptop computers and high \ncapacity telecommunications equipment. A State health director facing a \npotential bioterrorism incident might need to locate experts with \nexpertise concerning a specific pathogen and to obtain special \ndetection and remediation technology as soon as possible. An emergency \nofficial coordinating in the field rescue and recovery efforts might \nneed a batch of hand-held radios or might need to bring in mobile \ncellular units to expand local cellular coverage and capacity so people \non the ground can communicate.\n\n  In all of these instances, the key is locating equipment and \nexpertise quickly. By turning to our virtual technology reserve, these \nofficials would have a quick way to identify companies that have what \nthey need and companies that have expressed their willingness to help \nin an emergency.\n  The Wyden-Allen legislation has several other provisions that we \nbelieve will help make a meaningful difference in this fight against \nterrorism. The legislation provides for the formation of rapid response \nteams of science and technology experts. It establishes a clearinghouse \nand test bed for new antiterror technologies. Suffice it to say, our \nGovernment has received thousands and thousands of ideas, unsolicited, \nfrom private companies and citizens all across this country with \nrespect to products to aid in the fight against terrorism. And there is \nno systematic way to evaluate the quality of those products.\n  The bipartisan legislation we brought to the Senate today would \nprovide that test bed and a plan to have those products evaluated.\n  Finally, our legislation provides for pilot projects to help overcome \na problem that seems incomprehensible in a communications center as \nadvanced as the east coast of the United States. We saw on September 11 \nthat first responders, people on the front lines, police and fire and \nothers, were not able to communicate to each other. Before our \nsubcommittee, we were told that on the east coast of the United States, \narguably the most sophisticated communications center on the planet, \nthere were firemen actually hand walking messages to their colleagues \nbecause all of the available communications systems--the hard-wire \nsystems, the land lines, the cell lines--was down. So we badly need to \nhave innovative work done in trying to make interoperable these \ncommunications systems that our first responders need.\n  Our Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space found, as we \nanalyzed the events of September 11, that the private sector was ready, \nwilling, and able to contribute, but too often they were up against \nobstacles when they wanted to help. Some couldn't get proper \ncredentials to access disaster sites. Some simply could not find the \nright place to offer their people their expertise and equipment and \nwere literally knocking on doors offering to help, and people literally \ncould use their skills.\n\n  On December 5 of last year, FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh testified \nbefore our subcommittee that emergency response officials could have \nused the help of people in the technology sector to set up databases to \ntrack the missing and injured, as well as the goods and services being \ndonated. But what Director Allbaugh has said--and he has been very \nhelpful in this effort--was there simply wasn't a centralized go-to \ndesk to provide experts for immediate needs.\n  In the event of a bioterror attack, we have been told by the health \nauthorities that communities would face the very same confusion. Right \nnow, if a town is hit with a biological agent and local officials are \nlooking for the closest medical authority, there is no comprehensive \nlist of certified experts to help them.\n  Suffice it to say, in our effort to try to come up with a coordinated \nplan to fight terrorism, there are going to be some difficult issues. I \nhave great sympathy for Tom Ridge as he tries to bring together these \nagencies--perhaps 20 agencies--that are going to be involved in this \neffort. There are going to be some very difficult decisions that have \nto be made to maximize the talents and work of these agencies.\n  But it seems to me the idea of having a preexisting database, so that \nin communities in Florida, and in Oregon, and across this country, if \nyou are hit with a bioterror agent or have a calamity involving a \nterrorist attack, that you would have a preexisting database of \nindividuals who can help and companies that are willing to donate \nequipment. That strikes me as eminently doable, something practical \nthat the Government can do to make a real difference. That is why our \nvirtual technology reserve and setting up these databases can make a \nreal difference.\n  In addition to that virtual technology reserve, the Wyden-Allen bill \nseeks to move experts into a community as rapidly as possible when \nproblems arise. To that end, in our bill we provide for the creation \nand certification of national emergency technology guard teams. We call \nthese teams NET guard teams. They would be made up of volunteers with \ntechnology and science expertise, and they would be organized in \nadvance and available to be mobilized on short notice.\n  After consulting at length with leaders in the Bush administration, \nwe have decided that these unique teams ought to be modeled after the \nurban search and rescue teams that are now under FEMA and the medical \nresponse teams under the Department of Health and Human Services. But \ninstead of providing search and rescue or medical services, which, of \ncourse, is what is available today, the NET guard teams would provide \nthe technology, information, and communications support to help \nrescuers work more effectively. Once assembled, NET guard teams can \nprovide technology-related help in the aftermath of floods, \nearthquakes, and other natural disasters as well.\n  In the testimony Director Allbaugh gave to the subcommittee, we were \ntold that the technology challenges that are facing crises such as the \nSeptember 11 attacks are not just technology problems, they are \nproblems that ultimately cost lives. The essence of this legislation is \nabout saving lives, and one way it can do that is to establish a \nstructure to form and activate\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nwhat we call NET guard teams of technology experts who can step in when \ncrises occur.\n\n  We also think science and technology experts from the Nation's \nleading private sector companies have a role to play before disaster \nstrikes. Clearly, we need to respond more effectively when there is a \ndisaster. But it is only common sense to utilize the talents and energy \nof those in the private sector in a preventive way as well, and that is \nalso a key feature of our bipartisan legislation.\n  Since September 11, thousands of experts and entrepreneurs have \ncontacted the Federal Government offering new technologies. We would \nlike to have those evaluated. That evaluative kind of effort can go \nforward as we employ a preventive kind of strategy for our leaders in \nthe private sector and for purposes of making sure we accept and \nevaluate and implement these ideas that are now flooding in from around \nthe country.\n  We create a Center for Civilian Homeland Security Technology \nEvaluation. It is going to have two purposes. It will serve as a \nnational clearinghouse for security and emergency response \ntechnologies, helping to match companies with innovative technologies \nwith the Government agencies that need them; it would provide a single \npoint of contact to which both companies and Government agencies could \nturn to have their technology proposals addressed.\n  What we have heard in our committee--and I have been told as well in \nthe Commerce Committee, and in other forums--is that the private sector \nreally doesn't know where to turn. Should they go to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services? They have been interested in ideas from \nprivate sector leaders. Should they go to the Department of Defense? \nThey are interested as well. We establish a center for evaluating \ntechnologies, so there will be a central clearinghouse for companies to \nknow where to turn.\n  More particularly, the center will operate a test bed to evaluate the \nability of proposed technologies to satisfy Government needs. This test \nbed will work in conjunction with existing Federal agencies and the \nnational laboratories. It is not meant to be a technology gatekeeper, \nsomehow having the Federal Government picking winners and losers, but \nit is designed to assist agencies that are now telling us they do not \nhave the capability to evaluate these technologies on their own. This \ntest bed is necessary, in my view, to keep new technologies from \nslipping through the cracks.\n  I don't want to see American lives lost because the Federal \nGovernment could not find a way to accommodate fresh, new ideas from \nour leaders in the technology and science area.\n  The legislation springs, as I have touched on, from firsthand \naccounts of what happened on September 11. Here in the Capital and in \nNew York, the terrorist strikes flattened telecommunications and \ninformation networks. Many people of New York wandered the streets, \nunable to find out anything about an injured or missing loved one or \neven to register their names. Web sites, voice mail, and e-mail systems \nof relief organizations filled up and crashed.\n  When emergency workers moved in, they told us they were hindered by \nthe fact that their communications systems could not work together. \nCourageous emergency workers told our subcommittee that communications \nbreakdowns made their job more difficult and more dangerous as well.\n  So for that reason, we would establish a pilot program under which \ngrants of $5 million each would be available for seven pilot projects \naimed at achieving interoperability of communications systems used by \nfire, law enforcement, and emergency preparedness and response \nagencies.\n\n  In simple English, what that is all about is making sure the police, \nfire, and health agencies can communicate with each other. It is \nprobably as important as anything the Government can do. But because in \nmany instances there are overlapping authorities in different systems, \nwe are not making that possible in our country. It involves a lot of \ncomplicated issues, many of which the occupant of the chair and I have \na chance to wrestle with in the Commerce Committee. Certainly spectrum \nor forum are a part of it.\n  At a minimum, we ought to test out through the pilot projects in the \nbipartisan bill we are introducing today some ideas for making it \neasier for police, fire, and health to communicate and save the lives \nof citizens, and certainly make their lives less dangerous as well.\n  The Nation's top technology companies have been very involved in \ndeveloping this effort, including Intel, Microsoft, America Online, and \nOracle, that have all expressed support for the legislation. All of \nthem believe that creating a high-technology reserve talent bank--a \ntalent bank that serves as a new force to confront a new threat--and \nthe other initiatives proposed in the Wyden-Allen bipartisan \nlegislation make sense. I thank them and other leaders in the private \nsector for their involvement.\n  In drafting the legislation, I have consulted with a number of \nleaders in the administration in the antiterrorism effort, including \nDirector Allbaugh; Richard Clarke, the President's Special Advisor for \nCybersecurity; Commerce Secretary Donald Evans; and John Marburger of \nthe Office of Science and Technology Policy. To a person, they have \nbeen very responsive and they have met us more than halfway in terms of \nmaking their own time and that of their staffs available. Senator Allen \nand I appreciate their bipartisan commitment.\n  I pledge tonight to continue to work with them and, on a bipartisan \nbasis, with the administration and with colleagues in the Congress on \nboth sides of the aisle, to move this bill forward as rapidly as \npossible.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that letters in support from \nseveral of the Nation's leading technology companies be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Intel Corporation,\n\n                                  Santa Clara, CA, March 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: I write to express our support for the \n     ``Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act'', your \n     legislation--soon to be introduced--that would establish a \n     national emergency technology guard and a civilian homeland \n     security evaluation center within NIST. This legislation \n     would provide a means for enhancing emergency response and \n     recovery of information technology infrastructure in the \n     event of major disasters such as the events on September 11 \n     of last year.\n       A national strategy for ensuring the resiliency of our IT \n     infrastructure against attacks and natural disasters is long \n     overdue, particularly as our country has become increasingly \n     dependent on the interconnected digital network. We look \n     forward to working with you on the details of this \n     legislation in committee and on the floor as it moves toward \n     enactment.\n       Again, we applaud your leadership and forward vision on the \n     need for strengthening our information technology backbone.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Andrew S.

Ron Wyden,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Wyden: I am writing to express Oracle's support for \n     the ``Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act'', \n     your proposed legislation that would establish a national \n     emergency technology guard, and a ``virtual technology \n     reserve'' consisting of a database of private sector \n     equipment and expertise that emergency officials may call \n     upon in an emergency. This legislation would improve and \n     enhance emergency response capabilities, particularly the \n     recovery of information technology infrastructure, in the \n     event of major disasters such as the events on September 11 \n     of last year.\n       As you well know, this country has become increasingly \n     dependent on continued operation of its vast information \n     networks. That is why a national strategy to ensure the \n     resiliency and continued operation of our information \n     technology infrastructure against attacks and national \n     disasters is critical. Oracle looks forward to working with \n     you on the details of your proposal as it moves through the \n     legislative process.\n       On behalf of Oracle, thank you for your leadership on \n     issues important to maintaining our nation's technology \n     infrastructure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert P.

We applaud your ongoing leadership on this \n     and other key technology matters in the United State Senate.\n       Microsoft is deeply engaged in security matters. Our \n     Trustworthy Computing Initiative, recently announced by Bill \n     Gates, places a primary emphasis on security, privacy and \n     reliability across our products, services and operations.\n       We agree with you that, in case of a national cyber \n     emergency, the Federal Government should draw upon the \n     brightest minds in industry in its efforts to protect Federal \n     agencies and other critical entities. In fact, on September \n     11th our Chief Security Officer was called to active military \n     duty to support the government's response to the attacks. He \n     recently left Microsoft to become the Vice Chairman of the \n     President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.\n       We view your focus on a National Emergency Technology \n     Guard, like our Trustworthy Computing Initiative, as a means \n     to strengthen America's cybersecurity via better trained \n     personnel.\n       We thank you again for the opportunity to comment on this \n     matter and commend you once again for your ongoing leadership \n     in cybersecurity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jack Krumholtz,\n         Director, Federal Government Affairs, Associated General \n     Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              AOL Time Warner,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden and Senator Allen: On behalf of AOL Time \n     Warner, I would like to express my appreciation for your \n     efforts and leadership in the area of antiterrorism and \n     disaster response, including the development of legislation \n     to address this critical issue.\n       September 11th forever changed the way our country thinks \n     about crisis response and emergency management, and has made \n     all of us realize the importance of working together as a \n     team when disaster strikes. Like so many other organizations \n     and individuals across the country and around the world, we \n     at AOL Time Warner watched with horror as the tragic events \n     of that day unfolded--and did what we could to contribute to \n     the immediate needs of the emergency response personnel, from \n     financial and humanitarian assistance to technical support.\n       Since that time, we have participated in numerous \n     discussions, including several ongoing initiatives led by the \n     Administration, about both how to prevent such a catastrophe \n     in the future and how to mitigate the effects of such a \n     disaster should the unthinkable occur again. It is clear from \n     these discussions and from our experiences on that day, that \n     one of the most critical objectives in formulating a disaster \n     response strategy is to ensure the functioning of our \n     communications infrastructure in the event of an emergency.\n       Your legislation, ``The Science Technology Emergency \n     Mobilization Act,'' recognizes the important role played by \n     volunteers--like those from our company and countless and \n     countless others across the nation--in providing technical \n     assistance to enhance communication in times of crisis, and \n     creates a mechanism for coordinating and deploying such \n     assistance in a systematic fashion during a national \n     emergency. We believe that this type of voluntary partnership \n     between industry and government is vital to ensuring that \n     disaster response and recovery efforts are coordinated and \n     effective.\n       We are grateful for your work on this issue of such \n     importance to our nation, and look forward to continuing to \n     work with both Congress and the Administration on matters \n     relating to security and critical infrastructure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Susan A. Brophy,\n          Senior Vice President, Domestic Public Policy, AOL Time \n     Warner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2187-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 228--HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE U.S.S.

SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nhonoring the 60th anniversary of the commissioning of the USS South \nDakota.\n  The USS South Dakota was the lead ship of a class of 35,000-ton \nbattleships and was officially commissioned on March 20, 1942. Few \nships in the history of the United States Navy have had such a \ndistinguished service record or have been as integral to the defense of \nour Nation. The Resolution I am submitting today honors both the USS \nSouth Dakota and her dedicated crew.\n  The USS South Dakota served throughout World War II, and became the \nmost decorated American battleship of the war having been awarded 13 \nbattle stars. In addition, the South Dakota became one of only four \nbattleships to receive the Navy Unit Commendation.\n  While the South Dakota spent the majority of its service in World War \nII in the Pacific, it did serve in the Atlantic along with the British \nHome Fleet from February to July 1943. However, no one can deny that \nthe crew truly distinguished themselves in the Pacific Campaign. Very \nfew of the battles fought in that theater of operation occurred without \nthe support of the USS South Dakota. In fact, the South Dakota saw \naction at the battle for Guadalcanal, the Battle of the Santa Cruz \nIslands, the invasions of the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands, the \nMarianas Campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the invasions of \nLeyte and Luzon in the Philippines, the invasions of Iwo Jima and \nOkinawa, and attacks on the home Islands of Japan. All told, the USS \nSouth Dakota was credited with sinking three enemy ships and downing 64 \nenemy aircraft during the war.\n  The proudest moment for the crew may have been when the South Dakota \nserved as the flagship for Admiral Chester W. Nimitz during the \nsurrender of Japan in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. For the ship, its \ncrew, and our Nation, this signalled the end of World War II and our \ncomplete victory over the forces of fascism. Following the surrender of \nJapan, the South Dakota was the flagship for Admiral William F. Halsey \nduring the return of the fleet to the United States.\n  On the 60th Anniversary of its commissioning, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to thank the crew of the USS South Dakota for their \nservice to our Nation. Their contributions to the freedoms we enjoy \ntoday is a debt we can never fully repay. I ask my colleagues to join \nwith me in remembering the USS South Dakota and honoring the lasting \nlegacy of her crew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2187-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2187-S2188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 229--CONDEMNING THE INVOLVEMENT OF WOMEN IN SUICIDE \n                                BOMBINGS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, \nMrs.\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nHutchison, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \nCantwell, Mrs. Carnahan, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 205) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 205\n\n       Whereas Ukraine stands at a critical point in its \n     development to a fully democratic society, and the \n     parliamentary elections on March 31, 2002, its third \n     parliamentary elections since becoming independent more than \n     10 years ago, will play a significant role in demonstrating \n     whether Ukraine continues to proceed on the path to democracy \n     or experiences further setbacks in its democratic \n     development;\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine can demonstrate its \n     commitment to democracy by conducting a genuinely free and \n     fair parliamentary election process, in which all candidates \n     have access to news outlets in the print, radio, television, \n     and Internet media, and nationally televised debates are \n     held, thus enabling the various political parties and \n     election blocs to compete on a level playing field and the \n     voters to acquire objective information about the candidates;\n       Whereas a flawed election process, which contravenes \n     commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe (OSCE) on democracy and the conduct of elections, \n     could potentially slow Ukraine's efforts to integrate into \n     western institutions;\n       Whereas in recent years, government corruption and \n     harassment of the media have raised concerns about the \n     commitment of the Government of Ukraine to democracy, human \n     rights, and the rule of law, while calling into question the \n     ability of that government to conduct free and fair \n     elections;\n       Whereas Ukraine, since its independence in 1991, has been \n     one of the largest recipients of United States foreign \n     assistance;\n       Whereas $154,000,000 in technical assistance to Ukraine was \n     provided under Public Law 107-115 (the Kenneth M. Ludden \n     Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2002), a $16,000,000 \n     reduction in funding from the previous fiscal year due to \n     concerns about continuing setbacks to needed reform and the \n     unresolved deaths of prominent dissidents and journalists;\n       Whereas Public Law 107-115 requires a report by the \n     Department of State on the progress by the Government of \n     Ukraine in investigating and bringing to justice individuals \n     responsible for the murders of Ukrainian journalists;\n       Whereas the disappearance and murder of journalist Heorhiy \n     Gongadze on September 16, 2000, remains unresolved;\n       Whereas the presidential election of 1999, according to the \n     final report of the Office of Democratic Institutions and \n     Human Rights (ODIHR) of OSCE on that election, was marred by \n     violations of Ukrainian election\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\n     law and failed to meet a significant number of commitments on \n     democracy and the conduct of elections included in the OSCE \n     1990 Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas during the 1999 presidential election campaign, a \n     heavy proincumbent bias was prevalent among the state-owned \n     media outlets, members of the media viewed as not in support \n     of the president were subject to harassment by government \n     authorities, and proincumbent campaigning by state \n     administration and public officials was widespread and \n     systematic;\n       Whereas the Law on Elections of People's Deputies of \n     Ukraine, signed by President Leonid Kuchma on October 30, \n     2001, was cited in a report of the ODIHR dated November 26, \n     2001, as making improvements in Ukraine's electoral code and \n     providing safeguards to meet Ukraine's commitments on \n     democratic elections, although the Law on Elections remains \n     flawed in a number of important respects, notably by not \n     including a role for domestic nongovernmental organizations \n     to monitor elections;\n       Whereas according to international media experts, the Law \n     on Elections defines the conduct of an election campaign in \n     an ambiguous manner and could lead to arbitrary sanctions \n     against media operating in Ukraine;\n       Whereas the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) on \n     December 13, 2001, rejected a draft Law on Political \n     Advertising and Agitation, which would have limited free \n     speech in the campaign period by giving too many \n     discretionary powers to government bodies, and posed a \n     serious threat to the independent media;\n       Whereas the Department of State has dedicated $4,700,000 in \n     support of monitoring and assistance programs for the 2002 \n     parliamentary elections;\n       Whereas the process for the 2002 parliamentary elections \n     has reportedly been affected by apparent violations during \n     the period prior to the official start of the election \n     campaign on January 1, 2002; and\n       Whereas monthly reports for November and December of 2001 \n     released by the Committee on Voters of Ukraine (CVU), an \n     indigenous, nonpartisan, nongovernment organization that was \n     established in 1994 to monitor the conduct of national \n     election campaigns and balloting in Ukraine, cited five major \n     types of violations of political rights and freedoms during \n     the precampaign phase of the parliamentary elections, \n     including--\n       (1) use of government position to support particular \n     political groups;\n       (2) government pressure on the opposition and on the \n     independent media;\n       (3) free goods and services given in order to sway voters;\n       (4) coercion to join political parties and pressure to \n     contribute to election campaigns; and\n       (5) distribution of anonymous and compromising information \n     about political opponents:\n        Now, therefore, be it\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the strong relationship between the United \n     States and Ukraine since Ukraine's independence more than 10 \n     years ago, while understanding that Ukraine can only become a \n     full partner in western institutions when it fully embraces \n     democratic principles;\n       (2) expresses its support for the efforts of the Ukrainian \n     people to promote democracy, the rule of law, and respect for \n     human rights in Ukraine;\n       (3) urges the Government of Ukraine to enforce impartially \n     the new election law, including provisions calling for--\n       (A) the transparency of election procedures;\n       (B) access for international election observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on election commissions;\n       (D) equal access to the media for all election \n     participants;\n       (E) an appeals process for electoral commissions and within \n     the court system; and\n       (F) administrative penalties for election violations;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its commitments \n     on democratic elections, as delineated in the 1990 Copenhagen \n     Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE), with respect to the campaign period and \n     election day, and to address issues identified by the Office \n     of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of OSCE \n     in its final report on the 1999 presidential election, such \n     as state interference in the campaign and pressure on the \n     media; and\n       (5) calls upon the Government of Ukraine to allow election \n     monitors from the ODIHR, other participating states of OSCE, \n     and private institutions and organizations, both foreign and \n     domestic, full access to all aspects of the parliamentary \n     election process, including--\n       (A) access to political events attended by the public \n     during the campaign period;\n       (B) access to voting and counting procedures at polling \n     stations and electoral commission meetings on election day, \n     including procedures to release election results on a \n     precinct by precinct basis as they become available; and\n       (C) access to postelection tabulation of results and \n     processing of election challenges and complaints.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2190-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2190-S2191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONDEMNING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN CHECHNYA\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 213\n\n       Whereas the United States Department of State Country \n     Reports on Human Rights for 2001 reports that the \n     ``indiscriminate use of force by [Russian] government troops \n     in the Chechen conflict resulted in widespread civilian \n     casualties and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of \n     persons'';\n       Whereas the United States Department of State Country \n     Reports on Human Rights for 2001 reports that Russian forces \n     continue to arbitrarily detain, torture, extrajudicially \n     execute, extort, rape, and forcibly disappear people in \n     Chechnya;\n       Whereas credible human rights groups within the Russian \n     Federation and abroad report that Russian authorities have \n     failed to launch thorough investigations into these abuses \n     and have taken no significant steps toward ensuring that its \n     high command has taken all necessary measures to prevent \n     abuse;\n       Whereas there are credible reports of specific abuses by \n     Russian soldiers in Chechnya, including in Alkhan-Yurt in \n     1999; Staropromysloviski and Aldi in 2000; Alkhan-Kala, \n     Assinovskaia, and Sernovodsk in 2001; and Tsotsin-Yurt and \n     Argun in 2002;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     cracked down on independent media and threatened to revoke \n     the license of RFE/RL, Incorporated, further limiting the \n     ability to ascertain the extent of the crisis in Chechnya;\n       Whereas Chechen rebel forces are believed responsible for \n     the assassinations of Chechen civil servants who cooperate \n     with the Government of the Russian Federation, and the \n     Chechen government of Aslan Maskhadov has failed \n     unequivocally to condemn these and other human rights abuses \n     or to distance itself from persons in Chechnya allegedly \n     associated with such forces; and\n       Whereas the Department of State officially recognizes the \n     grievous human rights abuses in Chechnya and the need to \n     develop and implement a durable political solution: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the war on terrorism does not excuse, and is ultimately \n     undermined by, abuses by Russian security forces against the \n     civilian population in Chechnya;\n       (2) the Government of the Russian Federation and the \n     elected leadership of the Chechen government, including \n     President Aslan Maskhadov, should immediately seek a \n     negotiated settlement to the conflict there;\n       (3) the President of the Russian Federation should--\n       (A) act immediately to end and to investigate human rights \n     violations by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, and to initiate, \n     where appropriate, prosecutions against those accused;\n       (B) provide secure and unimpeded access into and around \n     Chechnya by international monitors and humanitarian \n     organizations to report on the situation, investigate alleged \n     atrocities, and distribute assistance; and\n       (C) ensure that refugees and displaced persons in the North \n     Caucasus are registered in accordance with Russian and \n     international law, receive adequate assistance, and are not \n     forced against their will to return to Chechnya; and\n       (4) the President of the United States should--\n       (A) ensure that no security forces or intelligence units \n     that are the recipients of United States assistance or \n     participants in joint operations, exchanges, or training with \n     United States or NATO forces, are implicated in abuses;\n       (B) seek specific information from the Government of the \n     Russian Federation on investigations of reported human rights \n     abuses in Chechnya and prosecutions against those individuals \n     accused of those abuses;\n       (C) promote peace negotiations between the Government of \n     the Russian Federation and the elected leadership of the \n     Chechen government, including Aslan Maskhadov; and\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\n       (D) re-examine the status of Chechen refugees, especially \n     widows and orphans, including consideration of the possible \n     resettlement of such refugees in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/20/senate-section/article/S2191-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
