Mr. President, there have been a lot of rumors around here \nin the Senate--and I hope this is just a rumor--but I have heard that \nthe Senate minority, the Senate Republicans, are threatening to shut \ndown the Senate on Thursday or some time this week. The reason given is \nthat the President, this past Friday, talked about there being 11 \nvacancies in the circuit courts.\n  Now, that is interesting. I have spoken on the Senate floor for long \nperiods of time, in effect, defending the Judiciary Committee because \nthese same vacancies they cry about are vacancies they created. They \nwould not fill the vacancies during the 8 years President Clinton was \nin office, and now they are complaining because there are vacancies.\n  As we have spoken about on a number of occasions, Chairman Leahy has \ndone his very best to move these along. In the Senate, we have been led \nby Senator Daschle, as majority leader, and the various Democratic \nchairmen for less than a year. During that period of time, we have had \none Senate office building closed for months, we have had September 11, \nand lots of problems. But in spite of that, we have approved 52 judges \nalready.\n  But if they do decide they want to interrupt this very busy schedule, \nI think\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nthey will reveal just how out of touch they are with the American \npeople.\n  They want to focus attention on judicial nominations and what they \nportray as a delay in reviewing nominations. In fact, under Democratic \nleadership, the Senate has dramatically and rapidly accelerated the \npace of reviewing and confirming judicial nominations.\n  We have confirmed more judges in the past 10 months than were \nconfirmed in the first 10 months of 1995, when Republicans controlled \nthe Senate, and more than during the 12 months of 1996, 1997, 1999, and \n2000.\n  As you can see from this chart I have in the Chamber, it is not even \na close call. We have done extremely well. The Judiciary Committee \nshould be complimented for the work they have done.\n  We have acted to confirm these nominees quickly. The average number \nof days needed to confirm circuit court nominees has dropped from well \nover 300 days--that is almost a year; the levels when the Republicans \nin the Senate delayed action on President Clinton's nominations--to \njust over 100 days since the Democrats have controlled the Senate.\n  I think that is something Chairman Leahy and the Judiciary Committee \nshould feel good about. I think we, as Senators, should feel good about \nthis.\n  I think the work that has been done is exemplary. So if they focus on \nthis issue, I think we can easily make a convincing case for how much \nimprovement the Senate has made under the leadership of Senator Daschle \nand Senator Leahy as it relates to judges.\n  But it gives one pause to think that they are pushing these 11 \nvacancies on the same day there was an announcement that the \nunemployment rate is the highest it has been in 8 years. We have not \nhad an unemployment rate this high since the O.J. Simpson trial. It is \nat 6 percent now.\n  The President is shifting attention to a handful of jobs for judicial \nnominees instead of speaking about jobs for millions of unemployed \nAmericans.\n  There are now almost 9 million people in America who are unemployed. \nThere are 8.6 million Americans who are desperately seeking a job and \nare unable to find one.\n  We have a high unemployment rate in Nevada. I have heard the \nPresiding Officer talk about the jobs that have been lost in South \nCarolina, for example, in the textile industry, over the last several \nyears. When I heard the junior Senator from South Carolina talk about \nthe job loss in South Carolina, and the number being in the tens of \nthousands of people, I thought there was a mistake made. I could not \nbelieve that one industry could lose that many people in such a short \nperiod of time. But those facts are absolutely right. They have been \nverified many times.\n  So there are 8.6 million unemployed people all over the country. Many \npredict that unemployment will continue to rise. Unemployment seems to \naffect everyone, but some groups get hit hardest.\n  Women, for example, suffered most of the increase in joblessness last \nmonth. Their unemployment rate rose another four-tenths of 1 percent to \n5.4 percent. The unemployment rate for Blacks climbed to 11.2 percent. \nMore than 1 out of every 10 Black American men and women are out of \nwork. For Hispanics, the unemployment rate is 8 percent. So it would \nseem to me that we want to do a good job in filling these 11 vacancies \nfor circuit court judges, but it would also seem that we should focus \non the 8.6 million--almost 9 million--people out of work in this \ncountry and spend a little bit of time on that.\n  We have to take action to provide assistance for workers who have \nbeen displaced and help them find jobs--full-time jobs. Not only are \nmillions of Americans unemployed, but there are also millions who are \nunderemployed. They have jobs, but they are not very good jobs. This is \nespecially true of workers being paid the minimum wage.\n  So on Friday, the President talked about 11 circuit court vacancies, \nbut not a single word about the almost 9 million people who are \nunemployed, and not a single word about the minimum wage.\n  It seems to me those two issues may be a little more important than \nthese 11 judicial vacancies which they created.\n  Millions of Americans are being paid the minimum wage. In Nevada, and \nthroughout the country, many working families struggle to make ends \nmeet. The minimum wage remains at $5.15 an hour. It hasn't been raised \nin 5 years. The low minimum wage is a key reason why poverty has \ndoubled for full-time year-round workers since the late 1970s--from \nabout 1.3 million to 2.4 million in 2000--and it has contributed to \nNevada's 9.7 percent poverty rate. There are 2.4 million people who \nwork full time and are in poverty. A minimum-wage employee working 40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks a year earns $10,700. This is $4,000 below the \npoverty level for a family of three.\n  The majority of people drawing the minimum wage are women. Sixty \npercent of the people who draw the minimum wage are women. People think \nthese minimum-wage employees are at McDonald's flipping hamburgers, a \nbunch of teenagers. They are not. Sixty percent of the people who draw \nthe minimum wage are women. For 40 percent of these women, that is the \nonly money they get for themselves or their families.\n  Every day the minimum wage is not increased, it continues to lose \nvalue and workers fall further and further behind. Minimum-wage workers \nhave lost all their gains since they last raised the minimum wage in \n1997. The current purchasing power of the minimum wage remains more \nthan 32 percent below the 1968 level. If the minimum wage had kept up \nwith inflation, it would be up to about $8 an hour. No one is asking it \nbe kept up with inflation. We are just asking for a modest increase.\n  According to a survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 38 percent of \nthose seeking emergency food in the United States are employed, \ncompared with 23 percent in 1994. Local government officials cite low-\npaying jobs as the most common cause of hunger in their communities. \nMany people wrongly think of the typical minimum-wage worker as being \nsome teenage kid working to earn extra money to buy compact disks or to \ngo snowboarding. In fact, many minimum-wage workers struggle to care \nfor their families.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act would increase the Federal minimum wage by \n$1.50 over 2 years. We are not asking it be kept up with inflation from \nwhen it was first established. About 80,000 Nevadans and about 9 \nmillion Americans would get a raise up to $6.65 during the next 2 \nyears. This modest proposal would bring the real value of the minimum \nwage within a penny of the value it had in the 1980s.\n  This raise is critical to the economy of people all over America who \nare low-wage earners. A worker earning the minimum wage would have to \nwork 114 hours per week in order to afford a two-bedroom apartment in \nLas Vegas, NV. That would be the equivalent of almost three full-time \njobs.\n  America is a great country, the land of opportunity. One of our core \nvalues has been a strong work ethic. Workers have been responsible for \nour great economic success. Americans who work full time should not \nlive in poverty.\n  Going back to Friday when the President gave his plaintive plea for \nfilling the 11 vacancies on the circuit court of appeals, the rumor \nis--rumors usually have some basis in fact--that they are going to shut \nthis place down to get those 11 circuit court judges. They should get \nto shutting then.\n  The business we have to do is not for Democrats. It is for \nRepublicans and Democrats and Independents. It is for the executive \nbranch of Government, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch. \nWe can only do what we can do. If they want to shut down the Senate, \nthat is the power they have because this is the Senate of the United \nStates. If they believe 11 circuit court judges are worth more than the \n8.6 million unemployed and worth more than the minimum wage that has \nnot been increased in over 5 years, let them go to it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3889-9", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3889-S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JUDGES AND JOBS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wish to speak a few minutes about trade \nand the several bills on trade that have been pending for some time.\n  Trade promotion authority is the central element of what we are \nseeking to do. Trade is one of the most important issues with which we \nhave to deal. Transactions are made around the world in the billions of \ndollars every day, and we need the authority to negotiate trade \nagreements that fit us into world trade and, at the same time, are \nfavorable to the United States, which is a basic issue.\n  The Senator from Nevada was saying a moment ago that we ought to be \ndoing something about unemployment. I suggest doing something with \ntrade promotion authority. This is one of the basic issues with which \nwe have to deal in augmenting employment and stimulating employment.\n  Agriculture is very big in my part of the country and 40 percent \ndepends on foreign markets because we produce more than we consume in \nthis country. I wish to comment a moment on where we are and what I \nhope can happen.\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act has been amended to include three \nbills. It deals only with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and it \nhas expired. It needs to be reauthorized so we can deal with those four \nnations in terms of imports and exports. It was originally passed in \n1991 to provide an economic benefit to help those countries such as \nColombia with which we have such concern about their internal \nconflicts, drug activities, illegal drug production and trafficking, \nand a number of issues that are of great importance to us.\n  Time is running out to reauthorize the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act. I hope we can reauthorize it. It is the underlying bill. \nBut I have to tell my colleagues, in my view at least and I think in \nmost everyone's view, trade promotion authority is really the basis of \nour concern. I am a member of the Finance Committee, and trade issues \nare handled in the Finance Committee. We handled these three issues not \nas one but as separate issues. I suggest that is what we ought to be \ndoing: dealing with each bill separately.\n  We found ourselves, however, in a position where those who are \nskeptical of trade promotion authority are insisting on much more in \nthe trade adjustment bill as leverage for their support for trade \npromotion authority. On the other side, people who want trade promotion \nauthority are saying: We will not do that unless you give us a little \nless on trade adjustment. So we find ourselves in a conflict.\n  Trade promotion authority is generally known as fast track, which was \npassed by the committee in December by a 19-to-3 vote, a very strong \nvote. The discussions about all the aspects of the bill were held in \ncommittee, as they should be.\n  Basically, trade promotion authority falls into two categories: One, \nthe President's authority to proclaim changes in tariffs resulting from \nnegotiations of reciprocal trade agreements; two, procedures for \nimplementing provisions of such agreements which provide for changes in \nthe U.S. law, basically known as fast track.\n  Trade promotion authority is a process for the President or his \nrepresentatives to negotiate, guided by rules that are in law. They \nbring those agreements back to the Senate when they are completed for \nan up-or-down vote. It is really the only reasonable approach we can \ntake to accomplish negotiations. Obviously, 535 Members of Congress \ncannot do the negotiating for the country. The bill does provide a \nframework, an outline of how this can be done. Its purposes are:\n\n  Obtaining more open and equitable market access; reducing or \neliminating trade barriers and other trade-distorting practices; \nstrengthening the system of trading disciplines and procedures, \nincluding dispute settlement; promoting full employment in the United \nStates.\n  It is true that every industry is not always treated the same. Some \nare very successful; others find it more difficult. That is, I guess, \nthe reality we have in trade of any kind. That is part of it.\n  This bill requires Presidential consultation with the Congress \nbefore, during, and after a trade negotiation. Without that, why, we \nwill not have any agreements, and we have, indeed, fallen behind. This \nhas been out of the system since 1994. Other countries have negotiated \ntheir agreements among themselves, particularly in South America, and \nwe have not. We have negotiated relatively few.\n  To the extent we can agree that trade is necessary, trade is good for \nus overall, then we have to have a system for negotiating and not sit \nback while the rest of the world negotiates agreements and expect that \nwe are going to benefit from that situation.\n  As I indicated, it does provide for Senators to be more involved. It \nprovides legitimate opportunities for the Congress and others to \nexpress their concerns, which is proper.\n  It provides for ongoing consultation and debate during the process of \nagreements.\n  It creates an oversight group of Congress that is broad based and \nbipartisan.\n  It sets up this system that gives input by the Congress and yet \nallows the President to make agreements and then bring them back to the \nCongress for acceptance or rejection.\n  So we hear they are going to give him all the authority and have \nnothing to do with it. That is not the case. We still do have something \nto do with it. We do still have final approval as to what is done. So \nwe need to be doing some of those things.\n  A lot of the U.S. products, for instance, in agriculture still have \nvery high tariffs in other places. Our good friends from Japan have \nvery high tariffs on beef, for example, which comes partly from my \nState. So we need to be involved and protect our interests as well as \nbe fair with others and participate in this whole business of trade. So \nit is important.\n  As I mentioned, in agriculture, one out of every three acres planted \nis basically for export because we produce more. Under the farm bill \nthat is pending, we will be producing even more if we do not run into a \nconflict with trade because of the farm bill itself. We will be talking \nabout that starting tomorrow.\n  In 2001, American farmers exported $55 billion in agricultural \nproducts. That supports a great number of jobs. I know people have \ndifferent views about it. The fact is it is there and we need to \nparticipate. We can argue about how we do it and what the outcome is, \nbut it is pretty apparent we need to participate actively in deciding \nhow these things are going to be done. The European Union, for example, \nhas 15 free trade agreements in which we are not involved. Mexico has \nsigned 28 trade agreements; the United States has signed 3. So we are \nkind of being left behind in terms of what we are seeking to do.\n  One of the problems which we are going to have to deal with--it has \nalready been discussed a great deal, and I think it is being discussed \nnow in terms of hoping to come up with some agreement--is the trade \nadjustment authority, which is a legitimate concern about being able to \ndeal with people who might be put out of work and to have some kind of \na program that would be helpful to them. There was a program in place, \nbut it has expired. But we basically need financial and training \nassistance for workers displaced by import competition or for firms \nthat face a significant adjustment. Those things were done in \nconjunction with NAFTA, and they increase the number of weeks \nadversely-affected employees could receive assistance.\n  Now the question is: Are those made to be entitlements? Are those to \nbe made welfare programs that are everlasting? How do we define who is \navailable, who should be receiving those benefits? I think those are \nthings we have to be concerned with when talking about upstream and \ndownstream employees, people who are feeding into this industry who are \naffected. Where do we stop? How far do we go? How far do we go on the \nretail side? Without some definition, it could be a huge sort of \nwelfare program, when it is designed to be an assistance program that \nhelps people be trained and available to move back into the workplace. \nThat is what it is for, and that should be our goal. I hope it will be \nthe goal.\n  We have had some unusual things happen since the bill has left the \ncommittee. It left the committee in one form, and now it has been \namended\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\ninto quite a different form. So we go back to kind of where we were on \nthe energy bill, where the committee did not have an opportunity to \ntalk about it. So all those details, rather than being discussed in \ncommittee, which is the process normally used, have to come to the \nfloor to be discussed because they have not been available to be \ndiscussed with recommendations coming from the bipartisanship of the \ncommittee.\n  It is my understanding we are going to go to the farm bill tomorrow \nand Wednesday and conclude after 12 hours of debate on the report from \nthe conference committee, and then we will be returning, after that, \napparently to the trade promotion bills. I am hopeful we can deal with \nthem in a direct manner, that we can deal with them with an attitude as \nto how important it is to the United States and what is our best \nprocess for getting the best arrangement for Americans to participate \nin trade, because we are going to be participating in it one way or \nanother; there is no question about that.\n  The question is: What kind of a process can we put in place that \ngives us the best opportunity to equally participate, to our benefit \nhopefully, in world trade? I look forward to the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, we have had very little opportunity to \nreally discuss trade. This bill was called up on a weekend, without \ndebate. By Monday evening it was already moved for consent, so there \nwas no debate whatsoever given to actually calling up the fast-track \nmeasure for consideration, to discuss it.\n  We need a thorough discussion of exactly what is occurring in the \nglobalization in world trade. I am sorry I do not have a greater \naudience, but I will speak for the purposes of at least getting it in \nthe Record. Tomorrow we will be on the farm bill. There is a general \nslowdown with respect to the Dorgan amendment. We have only had one \namendment up.\n  I have a very important amendment relative to trade adjustment \nassistance. What we are providing, as I understand it, in the Daschle \namendment as a substitute for the fast-track measure itself, is trade \nadjustment assistance for the legacy cause, for those in steel who had \nretirement, and when the plants closed, of course, they went broke and \ncould not provide for that retirement.\n  I am a strong supporter of that situation, so long as we can consider \nthe post-NAFTA textile employees--we call them associates now, down \nsouth. Those associates who lost their jobs over the 8-year period \nsince NAFTA was enacted, have not been able to find new ones. I will \nhave a very important amendment.\n  I have 53,900 who have made claims for unemployment. One of the \ndistinguished leaders on the floor earlier today said he could not \nbelieve that figure. That figure comes from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, for those associates who have made claims for unemployment, \nhaving lost their jobs. I think it is just as important, or more \nimportant, since they have not been able to find any work, that they be \ntaken care of, that they have available the measure called COBRA, so \nthey can get their health care while they are looking. We are in \ndesperate circumstances.\n  Everyone knows of the wonderful success we have, and I share in it, \nwith respect to the German industries. When I was governor of South \nCarolina, I visited Germany in 1960, to try to attract corporations to \nopen plants in my state. In the 42 years since, I thought 117 companies \nhad opened plants. But last week when I said that, the German \nAmbassador heard me and has updated the figure for me. It is now 125 \nGerman industries. So we are rejoicing in the success of German \ninvestment in South Carolina, particularly everyone coming here for the \nBMW plant.\n  But the unemployment rate for the BMW plant in Spartanburg, where it \nis located, was 3.2-percent last year. It is now 6.1-percent. The \noverall unemployment of the State itself is 6 percent.\n  We are having a very difficult time replacing those jobs. At least we \nought to be able to get trade adjustment assistance for those \nunemployed associates.\n  I place with specific emphasis an article in the May 13 issue of \nBusiness Week, entitled ``Where The Recovery Won't Reach.''\n  Madam President, I think it is important that I cover this now while \nothers are not seeking recognition.\n\n       Unlike bouncebacks of the past, many jobs recently lost at \n     American factories may be gone for good.\n       The recession of 2001 may have been exceptionally mild for \n     the economy as a whole but it devastated U.S. manufacturing. \n     The number of manufacturing jobs fell from 18.5 million in \n     the middle of 2000 to 16.9 million today--a decline almost as \n     steep as during the harsh downturn of 1981-82.\n\n  Let me divert for a moment to say that years ago Sony's Akio Morita \ntold me that a country that loses manufacturing capacity will cease to \nbe a world power.\n  A generation ago, we had 26 percent of the workforce in \nmanufacturing. Today, it is less than 12 percent. We are hardly \nproducing anything.\n  When the debate resumes, I will have the figures with respect to what \nwe are not able to produce. The majority of what we consume in the \nUnited States in manufacturing, of course, is important.\n  Back to the article itself:\n\n       In the past, manufacturing employment typically rebounded \n     after a recession ended. After the 1981-82 downturn, \n     manufacturing got back about two-thirds of the jobs it had \n     lost. In the 1990s, growth in U.S. high-tech manufacturing \n     helped offset losses in industries such as steel and apparel. \n     By 1998, manufacturing employment had risen to only 11% below \n     its all-time high.\n       This time, however, the bounceback may not be so strong and \n     the bulk of the manufacturing job losses may be permanent. \n     The sharp decline in U.S. corporate profits, combined with \n     the burden of a strong dollar, is forcing companies to take a \n     fresh look at how they can cut costs. And in an increasingly \n     global economy, they're deciding it's cheaper to use foreign \n     factories than domestic ones.\n       The result: As U.S. demand rebounds, imports are rising far \n     faster than domestic production. First-quarter imports of \n     goods rose at a 10% annual rate, adjusted for inflation. \n     South Korean factories are ramping up production, while \n     electronics makers in Taiwan are restarting idle machines to \n     turn out chips, phones, and flat-panel displays. Meanwhile, \n     manufacturing output in the U.S. rose at a mere 3% annual \n     rate in the first quarter. What's worse, factory employment \n     shrank at a 6% annual rate, with no sign of a bottom.\n       The failure to generate manufacturing jobs at home may \n     already be muting the recovery.\n\n  Let me divert again to emphasize that it is not just the bankers in \nJapan. I am telling you--manufacturing, research, and high-tech both \nfrom the United States and Japan are all going to China.\n  We are going out of business here. We are hollering ``free trade, \nfree trade'' as if we are doing something to help the country.\n  Incidentally, the assistant majority leader, the Senator from Nevada, \njust pointed out that there could be a closedown by our Republican \ncolleagues later this week on the proceedings here in the Senate for \ntheir desire to confirm some 11 judges. Here they are talking about an \nemergency to close down proceedings and to close down the Senate for \njudges. We are looking for jobs, not judges.\n  Let me go back to the article.\n\n       The worsening of the trade deficit subtracted 1.2 \n     percentage points from economic growth in the first quarter, \n     the Commerce Dept. says.\n       And the economic drag appears likely to continue, as \n     manufacturers aggressively cut jobs even as demand picks up. \n     The employment index of the Institute for Supply Management \n     survey for April was 46.7, signaling further contraction of \n     the factory workforce. In recent days, DuPont announced plans \n     to cut about 1,400 U.S. textile manufacturing jobs, while \n     Kraft Foods Inc. said it would close a Chicago plant that \n     makes Shake 'N Bake coating mix. Maytag Corp. has transferred \n     four assembly operations to a maquiladora in Reynosa, Mexico, \n     and plans to transfer 12 others by August. In April, San \n     Francisco's Levi Strauss & Co., which once boasted of its \n     American-made clothing, said it would close six U.S. \n     factories and lay off 3,300 workers. That will leave it with \n     just two U.S. factories. Most of its clothing comes from \n     contractors in Latin America and Asia.\n       Intense competition makes low-cost regions hard to resist. \n     In electronics manufacturing, for instance, the labor cost \n     for assembling printed-circuit boards--the guts of\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n     electronics gear--is about $7 to $8 an hour in the U.S., vs. \n     about 50 cents an hour in China, estimates Jeffrey A. Bloch, \n     vice-president for electronics manufacturing services at \n     iSuppli Inc., a supply-chain consulting firm in El Segundo, \n     Calif.\n       The cost differential wasn't so compelling during the tech \n     boom of the late 1990s when companies like Cisco Systems Inc. \n     and Lucent Technologies Inc. were willing to pay extra for \n     the convenience of having production in the U.S., close to \n     their engineers and customers. ``Flexibility was more \n     important to them than cost,'' says Bloch. With the tech boom \n     over, he says, ``those industries have now decided to go to \n     the lower-cost regions.''\n       Moreover, so much of electronics manufacturing has moved to \n     Asia already that it's cheaper and easier to build gear there \n     than to ship all the little pieces across the Pacific for \n     assembly in the U.S., says Jim Sacherman, chief marketing \n     officer for Flextronics International Ltd., the Singapore-\n     based contract manufacturer. Flextronics says it will soon \n     have 75% to 80% of its production in low-wage regions, vs. \n     half in 2000. Once gone, production rarely shifts back to \n     high-cost regions. Says Sacherman: ``It's pretty hard under \n     any market conditions to say, `For these reasons, I'm going \n     to pay more.' ''\n       Adding to their attractiveness countries such as China, \n     Mexico, Malaysia, and South Korea are moving up the \n     manufacturing learning curve, boosting their productivity \n     faster than in the U.S. In the second half of the 1990s, U.S. \n     manufacturing productivity rose at a solid 4.6% rate--but \n     manufacturing productivity in South Korea, for example, \n     improved nearly 12% a year.\n       While most manufacturing jobs are in production, the \n     category also includes engineers, researchers, managers, and \n     support staff of manufacturing companies. Some white-collar \n     Americans are even moving to where the jobs are. To lure \n     Westerners and U.S.-based Chinese to a new billion-dollar \n     chip fab in Shanghai, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing \n     International Corp. is building an elementary and middle \n     school for their children.\n       It's not just in technology that jobs are shifting abroad. \n     In North and South Carolina, the heart of the South's once-\n     huge textile and apparel industry, many companies that had \n     been struggling to survive have finally capitulated. Worse \n     for them than the recession was the dollar's strength, \n     which triggered a flood of cheap imports. In the past two \n     years, the dollar is up sharply against the currencies of \n     apparel exporters such as Indonesia and South Korea.\n       Mainly because of the dollar's impact on import prices, \n     retail apparel prices have fallen 3% over the past year. \n     ``The strong dollar is just wiping manufacturing out,'' says \n     Cass Johnson, an associate vice-president at the American \n     Textile Manufacturers Institute.\n       Makers of machinery and steel are also suffering from the \n     dollar's rise. The job losses aren't even across industries. \n     Pharmaceuticals employment has increased 5% from a year ago \n     despite the recession. Auto industry employment is benefiting \n     from the construction of assembly plants in the U.S. by the \n     likes of Toyota, Honda, and Mercedes. Netting out Big Three \n     plant closings, productivity gains, and expansions by \n     Japanese, Korean, and German auto makers, ``auto employment \n     will hold even'' through 2010, predicts Sean McAlinden, \n     economics director at the Center for Automotive Research in \n     Ann Arbor, Mich.\n       For employers, closing U.S. factories makes all the sense \n     in the world. For employees, it can be a terrible shock. Take \n     General Electric Co., a leading advocate of globalizing \n     production. It uses Mexican factories to make everything from \n     medical diagnostic gear to appliances. ``They really don't \n     give any real consideration to the impact of their decisions \n     on workers,'' says Edward Fire, a vice-president of the \n     Communications Workers of America. GE says it has generous \n     retraining and separation programs and continues to have a \n     vibrant U.S. production base.\n       The ability of U.S. manufacturing to generate jobs at home \n     was one of the more pleasant surprises of the 1990s. The \n     inability to keep them here may be one of the unpleasant \n     surprises of this decade.\n\n  Now, there it is. I had been pleading last week with respect to the \noutflow of manufacturing. I quoted the General Electric policy, which \nsays they would not consider any supplier to GE unless the supplier \nmoved its facilities into Mexico. Here is the best of the best in \nAmerican industry, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the Conference Board, and the \nBusiness Roundtable, all arrayed to move and eliminate jobs from the \nUnited States of America. It is our duty, our responsibility, to \nmaintain jobs, to maintain the economic strength and security of the \nUnited States.\n  My friend, Robert Kennedy, who came to public acclaim for his book \n``The Enemy Within,'' sat at this desk, talking about labor. Today, I \ncould write that same book--``The Enemy Within''--and it would be about \nmanagement. That is our competition.\n  We are like that fifth column in the civil war in Spain. We are \nhaving the particular trade policy of the United States made downtown \non K Street. They bring it to the White House; get general approval for \nit; move to fix a vote on the House side; and barely get it--the White \nHouse got it by one vote, by promising to have a fundraiser. And \nPresident Bush went to the textile Piedmont to fulfill his commitment \nfor that one vote. So they now have passed fast track.\n  Over on this side, having gotten through, of course, the Finance \nCommittee, they now have the 60 votes to go ahead and enact fast track \nwithout any provisions whatsoever. As a result, as you can see this \nafternoon, where we have it now up for debate, there is no one here to \nlisten, for the simple reason: everybody knows the score. The vote is \nfixed. Why listen to the debate? Let's get it over with. We have a lot \nof work to do.\n  That is not how we should fulfill our responsibility under article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution. It is not the President, not the Supreme \nCourt, but the Congress that shall regulate foreign commerce.\n  So much for manufacturing it is all high-tech, high-tech. I have had \nto listen to that nonsense for the last 10 years. Retraining, \nretraining. I have retraining coming out of my ears. I can retrain for \nany kind of job anywhere at any time.\n  Then there is globalization. I don't want to sound like Al Gore, that \nI invented globalization, but a moment ago I said 40 years ago I went \non trade missions to Europe, as well as to Latin America. Now we have \n125 German plants in South Carolina. We have Michelin there, with four \nfacilities and its North American headquarters. We have Bowater's North \nAmerican headquarters in Greenville, SC.\n  Oh, yes, we have been working on trade. So don't start and act as if \nthere is a sudden change and you old fogies have to understand \nglobalization. And you have to understand and know about retraining \nand, more particularly, high-tech, high-tech.\n  Bunk.\n  Listen to this: the New York Times, dated April 21: ``Japan Braces \nfor a `Designed in China' World.'' Let me repeat that: ``Japan Braces \nfor a `Designed in China' World''--because that is the country that out \nmanufactures us. Japan has about 126 million people. We have 280 \nmillion people. We had a huge running start. Japan was decimated at the \nend of World War II. We had the only industry. Now, in a 55-year \nperiod, they are out manufacturing and out producing the United States \nof America.\n  Here is what they are doing. This article was written by James Brooke \nfrom Tokyo for the New York Times.\n  I quote:\n\n       In recent decades, Japanese companies invested to make \n     China the ``factory to the world.'' In recent months, Japan's \n     blue-chip manufacturers announced investments to make China \n     the ``design laboratory to the world.''\n       In a cascade of announcements this spring, blue-chip \n     Japanese manufacturing companies said they were planning \n     research and development units in China. Spurring the moves \n     are the low wages of Chinese engineers, a growing Chinese \n     market for computer chips and the hope that China's entry \n     into the World Trade Organization will bring protection for \n     patents.\n       The crumbling of an informal wall that long kept assembly \n     in China and research here may spell the end of Japan's last \n     great competitive advantage over its low-wage neighbor. And \n     it is yet another step in China's rise, one that means both \n     new opportunities and wrenching change for Japan, which has \n     lately been coasting on wealth built up in earlier, high-\n     growth decades.\n       Today's young Japanese have grown up in affluence, taking \n     for granted high wages and their nation's status as the \n     world's second-largest economy. But older Japanese returning \n     from visiting Chinese factories and laboratories report that \n     the hard-working, self-sacrificing Chinese workers remind \n     them of the Japanese workers of the 1960's.\n       As more and more Japanese manufacturing migrates to China, \n     the research and development activity is gradually following, \n     to be close to production.\n       ``China is quickly becoming a country of low wage and high \n     tech,'' Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox, warned \n     recently, echoing the spreading insecurities here. ``They are \n     going to prove to be extremely competitive with Japanese \n     companies.''\n       China, with an economy only one-quarter the size of \n     Japan's, has a long way to go. But the thousands of computer \n     engineers graduating annually from Chinese universities are \n     enough to keep wages at one-third the level in Japan, a \n     country facing a shortage of\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\n     engineers. With the number of 18-year-olds decreasing, \n     colleges across Japan are closing because of a shortage of \n     students.\n       Many of the biggest recent investments involve some of \n     Japan's biggest technology names. This month, the Matsushita \n     Electric Industrial Company opened a research and development \n     laboratory in Suzhou, China, for household appliances. By \n     2005, this lab and a Matsushita cellphone lab that open in \n     Beijing last year will employ 1,750 Chinese engineers.\n       Last month, the Nomura Research Institute, a leading \n     Japanese systems integrator, began outsourcing software \n     projects to China in an effort that will employ 1,000 Chinese \n     software engineers by 2005. The Toshiba Corporation is \n     planning a tenfold increase in the number of engineers at its \n     new chip development center in Shanghai, to 1,000 by 2004.\n       ``We intend to enlarge the R function in China,'' Yukio \n     Shohtoku, managing director of Matsushita Electric, said the \n     day after the lab opened. The complex, in Jiangsu province, \n     200 miles northwest of Shanghai, will concentrate on \n     developing air-conditioners, lights, refrigerators and \n     washing machines. His company, he added, does ``as much \n     software development outside Japan as possible'' because it \n     does not have enough engineers and the cost of engineering is \n     high in Japan.\n       Japanese companies are not pioneers in China. By the end of \n     2000, 29 multinationals, including Lucent Technologies, \n     Microsoft, and I.B.M. of the United States, Alcatel of France \n     and Nokia of Finland, had opened research and development \n     units in China.\n       Typical of Japan's investment frenzy this spring, Yomiuri, \n     a daily newspaper in Tokyo, recently ran a banner headline, \n     ``Toshiba Plan I.T. Plant in China,'' over an article that \n     cited company sources as saying the electronics concern \n     planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build a \n     huge information technology production and research complex \n     outside Shanghai. A Toshiba spokesman, Hiroyuki Izuo, \n     immediately denied the report. But given the wealth of detail \n     and Japan's tradition of news leaks, many business analysts \n     here believe that Toshiba is preparing a major project.\n       Japan Inc.'s new scramble to show individual \n     competitiveness looks a lot like Japan's old herd instinct. \n     Hitachi, Sony, Pioneer, Fujitsu and NEC are just some of the \n     other blue-chip companies that have announced plans recently \n     for research and development units in China.\n       Two weeks after the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation opened \n     an elevator research unit in Shanghai in February, a major \n     rival, the Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems Corporation, \n     opened a research unit, also in Shanghai. And two weeks after \n     plans were announced for the Honda Motorcycle R China \n     Company in January, the Yamaha Motor Company announced that \n     it would open a research and development unit in or near \n     Shanghai in 2003.\n       About 80 percent of the 11 million motorcycles made in \n     China last year were copycats of Japanese models, according \n     to the Japan Automobile Manufactures Association. With China \n     now in the World Trade Organization, Japanese manufactures \n     hope that it will crack down on sales of ``Yamehas'' and \n     ``Suzakis.''\n       Much of the new Japanese push into China is in \n     semiconductor design and production, long an area of Japanese \n     strength. The heavy investment this year comes after the \n     worst year by far for global chip market, but a year in which \n     chip demand in China grew about 30 percent. It is expected to \n     grow another 30 percent there this year.\n       Fueling this chip demand, China is now the world's largest \n     market for cellphones, and by 2006 is expected to surpass \n     Japan as the No. 2 market for PC's, after the United States. \n     In 30 years. China's population is expected to grow to 13 \n     times that of Japan, from 10 times greater today.\n       Chinese chip demand is expected to quadruple by 2010, to a \n     $48 billion market, Richard R. Chang, president of the \n     Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, said \n     in a speech here. His company, 38 percent owned by Royal \n     Philips Electronics, the Dutch giant, is part of a series of \n     Chinese chip makers whose executives have visited here in \n     recent weeks to drum up investment.\n       A surge is also expected in the number of high-tech \n     workers. At an information technology conference here last \n     month, Liu Jiren, chairman of the Neusoft Group, China's \n     largest software company, told Japanese investors that in \n     five years Chinese universities ``will produce 5 to 10 times \n     as many engineers as now.''\n       Over all, Japan will be short 300,000 high-technology \n     workers within three years, a Japanese government study \n     warned recently. Despite this shortage, hundreds of Japanese \n     managers and engineers, many forced into early retirement, \n     now work in China, usually for lower pay.\n       The flow of investment, both human and financial, is \n     changing the nature of China's export to Japan. Ever since \n     Japan and China established diplomatic ties in 1972, the two \n     largest Asian economies were seen as complementary.\n       ``There is a clear division of labor between the two \n     countries, with China specializing in labor-intensive \n     products and processes, while Japan concentrates in high-tech \n     products,'' C.H. Kwan, a senior fellow at the Japanese \n     government's Research Institute of Economy Trade and \n     Industry, wrote in a report six months ago. ``China's exports \n     look like Japan's imports and vice versa.''\n       In this relationship, China has sold goods like towels, \n     coal and spring onions to Japan, and Japan has sold laptops, \n     digital cameras and DVD players to China. Now China produces \n     and exports all these goods. The high-technology portion of \n     China's exports has more than tripled, to 18.5 percent last \n     year form 5 percent in 1985. But the goods produced by \n     Japanese companies have largely been designed in Japan.\n       The Japanese have long prided themselves on quality \n     production, relegating Chinese-made goods to discount shops, \n     Now, Japanese manufacturers and consumers say they do not see \n     much qualitative difference between Made in Japan and made in \n     China.\n       In a recent survey of 81 Japanese companies operating in \n     China, 62 percent of managers said they saw no difference in \n     the quality of products made in Japan from those made in \n     China. Fifteen percent said the Chinese products were of \n     better quality, according to the poll, which was commissioned \n     by The Nikkei Business Daily, Japan's leading business \n     newspaper, and Japan Management Association Consultants, a \n     private industry group.\n       These tectonic shifts are rattling the increasingly \n     insecure Japanese. In the 1990's China's economy grew seven \n     times as fast as Japan's. Such statistics help populist \n     politicians fan the flames as they play on Japanese fears of \n     this emerging--and ambitious--economic giant next door.\n       Last year, Japan reduced its foreign aid to China by 25 \n     percent, to $1.2 billion, the biggest cut since aid started \n     in 1979. The cut was not big enough for Shintaro Ishihara, \n     Tokyo's populist governor, who warned voters last month \n     that Japan ``has been providing H-bomb-producing China \n     with hundreds of billions of yen every year from your tax \n     money.''\n       According to the Kyodo News agency, Ichiro Ozawa, a \n     conservative opposition leader, warned recently that if China \n     `` gets too inflated, Japanese people will get hysterical.''\n       ``It would be so easy for us to produce nuclear warheads,'' \n     he continue.\n       But with Japan rivaling the United States as China's \n     biggest economic partner, such hostile talk has prompted a \n     series of ``China is not a threat'' statements.\n       The growth of the Chinese economy will not be a threat for \n     Japan,'' Li Peng, chairman of China's Parliament, told \n     Japanese investors in Japan this month in one such sally. \n     ``The size of the Chinese economy is still small compared \n     with that of Japan.''\n       Full economic cooperation with China will continue, Japan's \n     prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, vowed this month in a \n     speech at an Asian economic conference in China.\n       ``Some see the economic development of China as a threat,'' \n     Mr. Koizumi said. ``I do not. I believe that its dynamic \n     economic development presents challenges as well as \n     opportunities for Japan.\n       I see the advancement of Japan-China economic relations not \n     as a hollowing out of Japanese industry but as an opportunity \n     to nurture new industries in Japan and to develop their \n     activities in the Chinese market,'' added the prime minister, \n     an advocate of free-market changes at home.\n       In an exercise in raising morale, Mr. Koizumi recently \n     visited two Japanese high-technology companies in Tokyo and \n     said: ``I feel Japan's potential is high. Japanese people \n     should be more confident.''\n       Many business people in Japan think that China's growth \n     will provide jobs for the Japanese in new ways. For example, \n     a consortium of companies in the Japan Railway group is \n     talking with China about selling technology and materials to \n     build a Japanese-style ``shinkansen'' bullet-train system in \n     China.\n\n  We are having a hard time getting Amtrak going, and here they are \nbuilding bullet train systems in China. We cannot get a national \npassenger defense rail system in this country because we are worried \nabout 11 judges. We are not getting with the program. Terrorism war? \nTrade war, Madam President. It has been going on. We have been losing \nour shirts. We have been losing the war, but that is what it is. It is \na war without guns and without bombs and planes and tanks. But it is an \neconomic struggle in competition. There is nothing free about this war; \nI can tell you that right now.\n\n       But looking 25 years ahead, when China's economy is \n     expected to surpass Japan's, some Japanese say they will have \n     to adjust to playing a secondary role to their huge neighbor.\n       ``Over the last 4,000 years of history, Japan has been a \n     peripheral country to China, with the exception of this one \n     last century,'' said Kenichi Ohmae, author of ``China \n     Impact,'' published in Japan this month. ``In the future, \n     Japan will be to China what Canada is to the United States, \n     what Austria is to Germany, what Ireland is to Britain.''\n       Despite the move of higher and higher technology \n     manufacturing and research to China, for the near term at \n     least Japan will retain an edge in animation, video games and \n     the most advanced consumer electronics, Mr. Ohmae predicted. \n     The Nintendo Company, for instance, produces 70 percent of \n     its GameBoy Advance units in China and plans to start \n     producing GameCube video-game consoles there this summer. But \n     like most Japanese multinationals, Nintendo keeps most of its \n     research and design in Japan.\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n       Not content to write about China's high-technology boom, \n     Mr. Ohmae, former chairman in Japan of McKinsey & Company, \n     the consulting firm, is investing in back-room data \n     processing and telephone information call centers in Dalien, \n     China. Both operations take advantage of the linguistic links \n     of China and Japan and new fiber optic telephone and high-\n     speed data connections. ``Half a million Japanese-speaking \n     Chinese live in northeastern China.'' Mr. Ohmae said, \n     referring to an area with long investment ties to Japan. \n     ``The costs are one-tenth that of Japan.\n       ``There is no border,'' he added, spinning a future of ever \n     closer economic integration. ``Part of the business goes to \n     China. Part remains in Japan. I don't see a clear, industry-\n     by-separation of China and Japan.''\n\n  Madam President, these are the things the Senate ought to be paying \nattention to. We need to pay our bills, rebuild the economy, cut out \nthis Enron accounting of on-budget/off-budget, unified budget, and all \nthe fancy words. Enron didn't start them. These politicians started it \nlong before Ken Lay left Missouri to go down to Texas and start his \ncharade.\n  The truth is we in the U.S. Government have been playing with Enron \naccounting, and there is more coming up. We have a budget deficit. They \ndon't call it a budget deficit. The Republicans have their budget; now \nlet the President submit it. Let's call it up and see what they are \ngoing to do with it. But I will be suggesting--among other things--a \nfreeze. Just take this year's budget for next year. We just passed the \nmain defense bills--Labor, Health and Human Resources--just before \nChristmas. So here we are less than five months later. We would not \nhurt anybody with a freeze. Let's just take that hold-the-line \napproach, except in national defense and homeland security. We can put \nthose aside.\n  Let's debate the budget the President has submitted and consider what \nhe asked for. He submitted his defense budget. Let's consider that and \ndebate it and vote it. But let's not spend the whole darn time talking \nabout how we are saving money. We can just take this year's for next \nyear.\n  Madam President, we would save almost $155 billion over five years. \nWe would save $155 billion, rather than spend an extra $155 billion. \nSenator Thurmond and I are going to get by. But the Presiding Officer \nis going to have to pick up our bill. All the other young leaders we \nhave in the U.S. Congress--we are just adding to the national debt. \nAnother item to come up is the national debt. I don't mind if those who \ncut the revenues to increase the debt, rather than pay down the debt--\nif they will give us a modicum of votes over there. They play a \npolitical game. I voted for the increase of the debt, but I want to see \nthe debt come down. Don't act as if we don't know how it happened. We \nknow exactly how it happened.\n  It has the economy and the market's in Washington and New York just \nfrozen in their tracks because of our leadership. The President, is \nplaying T-ball, or running out to some Federal facility or some school \npatting the little children on the head, and then patting the \npocketbooks at night with a fundraiser. We cannot get him in the Oval \nOffice and find out what's going on. He wants a $4 trillion additional \nloss of revenue, which increases the debt some $4 trillion. So they \nwill come up here and say, well, we have to increase the debt. It is an \nemergency situation. They start moving things around with Enron \naccounting. By June 28, they have to pay the interest costs to the \nSocial Security trust fund--you see, they keep spending the Social \nSecurity money by issuing these bills, and they will have to pay it \nback and they won't have the money.\n  So we will have to do something by June 28, and let's see the \ndisposition of these tax cutters. We gave 8 years of the finest economy \nin the history of these United States of America under President \nClinton by increasing taxes. Yes, we cut spending. We also increased \nthe taxes.\n  This Senator and others, without a single Republican vote, increased \ntaxes on Social Security, and we voted to increase taxes on gasoline. \nWe took the hard stand. Yes, we lost the Senate in 1994. It cost us \npolitically, but we did it, and we stuck to our guns. Now they come \nwith their leadership: Let's cut taxes; let's buy the vote; tell them \nthe Government is too big; and it is the people's money, they know how \nto spend it better than we do. What kind of childish talk is that?\n  America knows the city hall and the State houses back home are going \nto have to pay their bills. They have increased taxes in certain \nStates, almost a dozen of them, and they are having to cut programs \nright across the board. They are not saying: Let's cut the revenues \nanother $4 trillion. Come on.\n  These are the issues we ought to be talking about, and let's get with \nit for a trade policy. We need a value-added tax to pay that bill and \nto equalize production and international trade. Every industrialized \ncountry in the world has a VAT save the United States of America. Now \nwe need one. We can use it to pay for the war, but we have our \nleadership, our President, saying that we are not going to pay for the \nwar. Since we have a war, we are going to run deficits, and, \nincidentally the war is never going to end.\n  What kind of leadership is that? I never heard of such a thing. No \nwonder this country is in trouble. Everybody is amused. Politics is a \nspectator sport. The Government in Washington is just the weekend \nshows. As long as we do not get anything done--when in doubt do nothing \nand stay in doubt all the time, but keep spending, keep running up the \ndebt and talking to everybody about how we are saving Social Security. \nWe are not saving Social Security. We are spending it.\n  We at least ought to pay for this war on terrorism. We paid for every \nwar we have ever had. More than anything, we ought to start to engage \nin this trade war. It is not just manufacturing. Everything I read \npertaining to Japan pertains to the United States of America. That is \nwhere our technology has gone. So do not say I have to understand \nglobalization and free trade, free trade. The word ``trade'' means just \nthat. It is not free. They continue to treat it as aid, and we are not \nin a position now to do that. We have to aid our hometown communities \nin America and rebuild our industrial strength and our economic might.\n  That is what is on this Senator's mind. I wish there were others in \nthe Chamber to debate the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act because \nthis bill is a hope to the solution of the drug problem. This is not \ntrade. We do not get anything, but we hope if we can give them more \ntextiles to produce, they will get out of producing cocaine and produce \nT-shirts and send them to us. That is the whole Andean trade bill.\n  This is the biggest sham I have ever seen. Incidentally, I remembered \none point I wanted to emphasize about productivity. The textile worker \nof the United States of America is the most productive textile worker \nin the world. In fact, let me embellish. The industrial worker of the \nUnited States is the most productive industrial worker in the entire \nworld.\n  Madam President, what is not producing is the U.S. Government, this \nCongress, this Senate. I am hopeful we can start discussing real issues \nand cut out all the political and parliamentary maneuvers so we can \nvote on the Dorgan amendment. I have plenty other amendments that \npertain to the bill with respect to trade adjustment assistance for \npost-NAFTA workers, some 53,900 in my State. You cannot ask me to vote \nfor some and not for all. We have to be fair with everyone. That is \nour hope, our duty, and our responsibility.\n\n  I do appreciate the distinguished Chair indulging me this afternoon. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3895-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3895-S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, today I give tribute to \nsome Oregon heroes. Over the past year, I have come to the Senate floor \non several occasions to describe the tragic events in the Klamath Basin \nlast year. Today, I wish to salute some of the heroes, who when \nwatching their neighbors in need, responded with great compassion and \nservice to their community.\n  In April of last year, the farm economy of Klamath Falls was sent \ninto a tailspin when the decision was made to forego water deliveries \nto farmers in favor of protecting threatened and endangered fishes. \nAlmost overnight, the devastating effects of the water shut-off began \nto be felt. In one month's time, the number of families seeking \nassistance from the local food bank jumped by seven hundred.\n  The response from the surrounding community was incredible. Farmers, \ncar dealerships, coffee shops, gas stations, banks, schools, and \ncountless others came together to lend their support to folks in the \nKlamath Basin. On June 15 of last year, Joe Gilliam, President of the \nOregon Grocers Association, with the help of grocers from around the \nstate, gathered 240,000 pounds of food. This food helped feed the \ncommunity for nearly two months.\n  In August, Oregon Senator and farmer Gary George of Pendleton, Oregon \ndecided that he too had to do something. He set out and, with the help \nof Oregonians In Action, raised $30,000. Also in August, KDOV Radio, \nPerry Atkinson and his son Oregon Senator Jason Atkinson, and sixty \nchurches in the Medford area, joined together in collecting 27,000 \npounds of food. They delivered it in two twenty-four-foot Ryder trucks.\n  The examples of kindness go on and on. For as tragic as the situation \nlast year in the Basin was, Oregonians from around the State responded \nwith an equal level of benevolence. With the help of hundreds of \ncommunity volunteers and under the direction of Niki Sampson, the \nKlamath Falls-Lake County Food Bank has distributed 830,000 of pounds \nof food and non-food products.\n  This has been a very emotional year, and as a United States Senator \nand as an Oregonian, I am very proud of how the people in my state have \nresponded. The generosity shown by so many truly reaffirms one's faith \nin the goodness of people. In my mind, every single person who \nvolunteered his or her time or resources is a hero. Today, I salute the \nworkers, the volunteers, and all those who gave of themselves to help \nthis community in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3896-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CINCO DE MAYO\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, I am proud to take this \nopportunity to recognize the Mexican holiday, Cinco de Mayo. This \nholiday is a day to celebrate and appreciate Mexican history and \nculture. I would also urge all Americans to take this opportunity to \nlearn more about the important contributions Mexicans and Mexican-\nAmericans have made to the United States.\n  The Cinco de Mayo holiday dates back to the mid-19th century. In \n1862, the democratic nation of Mexico found itself under invasion from \nthe French, led by Napoleon III. On its march to conquer Mexico, the \nFrench army met the Mexican army in the city of Puebla, just 100 miles \neast of Mexico City. On May 5, 1862, the ill-equipped and outnumbered \nMexican army under Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, would defy all \nodds and defeat the superior French army at the Batalla de Puebla. This \ndefeat of the French, one of the strongest militaries in the world, \nwould become a symbol of the strength and determination of the Mexican \npeople.\n  As immigration to the United States increased during the Mexican \nRevolution and in subsequent years, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans \ndemonstrated these same qualities on the battlefield in defense of the \nAmerican flag. They were among the first to volunteer for the U.S. \narmed forces during World War I and an estimated 375,000-500,000 \nMexican-American soldiers served with honor during World War II. Jose \nP. Martinez of Colorado would become the first American and one of many \nMexican-Americans to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for his \nheroism during World War II. Americans of Mexican descent would also \nserve in the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, and the Gulf War. \nThey continue to enlist in high numbers and remain committed to \nmilitary service in defense of the United States.\n  Military service is just one of countless contributions Mexicans and \nMexican-Americans have made to the United States. Cesar Chavez's \npassion for justice and the right to organize resulted in improved \nliving and working conditions for people in California and throughout \nthe United States. Diego Rivera's artwork continues to inspire Latino \nartists as well as others to paint murals that beautify our cities and \nare available for the general public to appreciate. Missouri is also \nproud of one of its own, Hector Barreto, who currently serves as \nAdministrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. There are \ncurrently 13 Mexican-American members in the House of Representatives \nand I look forward to the day when I will have Mexican-American \ncolleagues here in the U.S. Senate as well.\n  The same strength of character and determination that was displayed \nby the Mexican army at the Batalla de Puebla is evident in today's \nMexican-American leaders in business, labor, not-for-profits, \ngovernment, and in the arts. It is fitting that as we celebrate the \nCinco de Mayo holiday, we also recognize the valuable cultural, social, \nand political contributions Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have made \nand continue to make in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3896-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3896-S3897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, today we highlight the recent \nobservance of April 28 as Workers Memorial Day. Workers Memorial Day \nrecognizes workers who have been killed or injured in the workplace \nover the past year. The first Workers Memorial Day was observed in \n1989. April 28 was chosen because it is the anniversary of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act and the day of a similar remembrance \nin Canada. Every year, many communities and businesses join together to \nrecognize workers who have been killed or injured on the job.\n  In honor of Workers Memorial Day, I want to relate a story about one \nperson in Alabama that has truly made a difference in improving worker \nsafety. Each year since 1995, the Fairhope, Alabama-based FIGHT \nProject, Families in Grief Hold Together, FIGHT, holds a memorial \nservice on Workers Memorial Day for people who die in work-related \naccidents in south Alabama. The FIGHT Project is led by Mr. Ron Hayes. \nMr. Hayes lost his 19-year-old son Patrick due to a workplace accident. \nPatrick was walking across a corn elevator filled with grain when he \nwas pulled down into the grain and suffocated. Through his tireless \nefforts, Mr. Hayes, prompted the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, to revise its standard for protecting almost \n250,000 workers at 24,000 grain elevators and mills. Mr. Hayes not only \nspent considerable time trying to determine the cause of his son's \naccident, but quit his job to become an advocate of workplace safety. \nHe organized the non-profit organization, the FIGHT Project, to provide \nguidance to families who have lost a loved one in a workplace accident. \nMr. Hayes has since become a expert on work-related deaths, illnesses \nand injuries. Mr. Hayes has spent countless hours trying to ensure safe \nworking environments for America's workers. He has also assisted \nhundreds of families who have lost love ones, including working closely \nwith the families of the 13 Jim Walters miners who were killed in \nBrookwood, AL, last year. He has been an invaluable resource to me as I \nserve on the Health, Education, Labor, and pensions Committee, which \noversees OSHA.\n  Mr. Hayes was recently appointed by Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as \na member of the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and \nHealth, NACOSH. NACOSH was established under the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act of 1970 to advise the Secretaries of Labor and Health \nand Human Services on Occupational Safety and Health Programs and \nPolicies. Mr. Hayes is working with OSHA and the rest of the Department \nof Labor to improve worker safety around that nation.\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\n  According to OSHA, there are a disproportionately high number of \nwork-related deaths suffered by non-English speaking workers. On \nWorkers Memorial Day, Mr. John Henshaw, Assistant Secretary of Labor \nfor Occupational Safety and Health, announced that the agency will soon \nbegin to collect data on country of origin and English language \ncapability for all workers involved in fatality or other serious \naccident investigations. The agency will also for the first time begin \nto collect site-specific information on construction projects where \nmany immigrants and other workers die every year. The new data \ncollection will enable OSHA to analyze language and country of origin \ninformation to determine what role language barriers and other risk \nfactors play in fatalities and other workplace accidents. The agency \nwill then use this data to take steps to improve safety for these \nworkers.\n\n  I want to point out that in commemoration of Worker Memorial Day, Mr. \nHenshaw also announced that, effective immediately, he will write \npersonally to the families of workers killed on the job to express \nOSHA's sorrow for the loss. Working with Mr. Hayes over the last few \nyears, I know how important it is to the victim's families that the \nGovernment is aware of the problem and working to do everything \npossible to prevent more workers from dying or being injured on the \njob. I would like to reiterate Mr. Hayes' recent statement about the \nimportance of reducing the accident and injury rate to the point where \nthis type of initiative is not needed at all. I believe Secretary Chao \nand Mr. Henshaw are committed to this goal and I stand ready to aid \ntheir efforts.\n  We know that many businesses are working hard and successfully to \nimprove worker safety. Some Alabama companies have recently been \nrecognized by OSHA as achieving successful results in reducing \ninjuries. Since 1982, OSHA has been recognizing American work sites \nthat have exemplary safety records and show continued commitment to \nworkplace safety and health. Sites meeting the Voluntary Protection \nProgram standards typically experience injury and illness rates 53 \npercent below the industry average. Three sites in Alabama: ATOFINA \nChemicals Inc. in Axis, AL; Occidental Chemical Corporation in Mobile, \nAL; and United Space Alliance, LLC Huntsville Operations in Huntsville, \nAL, were recognized by OSHA as Star sites for their achievements in \nworker safety. These successes were achieved with voluntary programs, \nteamwork and determination.\n  Workers Memorial Day gives us the opportunity to remember the workers \nwho have lost their lives and highlight these important worker safety \nissues. The more attention we give the subject and the more we work \ntogether the better chance we have to be successful in reducing and \nthen eventually eliminating workplace injuries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3897-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3897-S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEDICATION OF SPARK MATSUNAGA ELEMENTARY AND LONGVIEW SCHOOL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, on Sunday I had the privilege of \nattending the dedication ceremony for the Spark Matsunaga Elementary \nand Longview School in Germantown, Maryland. This exceptional state-of-\nthe-art school facility houses a general education elementary school, \nSpark Matsunaga Elementary, and special education school for children \nwith disabilities, Longview School.\n  It is appropriate that this new school honors the memory of a truly \nremarkable man and former colleague--Senator Spark Matsunaga. Over the \ncourse of a lifetime of service to the people of Hawaii and America, \nSpark exhibited fortitude, courage, and persistence in fighting for \nwhat was right and what was best.\n  As noted by Dr. Jerry Weast, superintendent of Montgomery County \nPublic Schools, this is the first public school in the nation named in \nhonor of an Asian American. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, \nRepresentative Connie Morella, Hawaii State Senator Matt Matsunaga, and \nKeene Matsunaga were a few of the speakers who spoke of Senator \nMatsunaga's distinguished life and career. A children's chorus \nentertained and sang the school song. The ``Home of the Geckos,'' \nMatsunaga Elementary has made a wonderful start with dedicated teachers \nand administrators and a diverse and involved community of students and \nparents.\n  Spark Matsunaga's commitment to justice and lifetime of service to \nAmerica merits this singular recognition. Throughout his career, Sparky \nworked to ensure that all Americans enjoyed the fruits of liberty and \nunderstood our shared responsibilities for keeping our country free and \nstrong.\n  Spark Matsunaga's legacy of public service, espousal of the art of \npeacemaking, and commitment to justice is a wonderful example for the \nstudents and staff that proudly work and learn at Matsunaga Elementary \nSchool.\n  I know that Helene Matsunaga and the Matsunaga family are deeply \nappreciative of this unprecedented tribute, and the people of Hawaii \ntake pride in Montgomery County bestowing this honor on Senator \nMatsunaga and his service to our great Nation.\n  Madam President, I ask that a copy of the commemorative biography of \nSpark Matsunaga distributed at the dedication be printed in the Record.\n  The biography folllows:\n\n              Senator Spark Masayuki Matsunaga, 1916-1990\n\n       Our school is proud to bear the name of this great American \n     whose legacy will inspire our community forever. Senator \n     Matsunaga's memory will serve to remind students and staff \n     that public service, strong educational goals, patriotism and \n     personal pride are qualities to live by. Senator Matsunaga \n     will be remembered for all his work to teach the principles \n     of peace yet value just causes for humanity. He knew when to \n     use his talents to inspire change and was never afraid to \n     stand proudly to have his voice heard.\n       Spark Matsunaga, a war hero who became a Untied States \n     Senator from Hawaii, dedicated his career to promoting peace \n     and achieving justice. A Japanese-American, Matsunaga served \n     with distinction in the 100th Infantry battalion, the first \n     Japanese American unit formed during World War II, for which \n     he received the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. As a \n     political leader, he was a champion of civil rights for all \n     Americans regardless of race. As a member of the United \n     States Senate, he worked to promote the peaceful resolution \n     of conflicts, and he fought for the redress for survivors of \n     the World War II internment camps.\n       Masayuki Matsunaga was born on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii, \n     on October 8, 1916. His childhood friends nicknamed him \n     Spark; he later legally adopted the name. Matsunaga attended \n     the Kauai public schools before entering the University of \n     Hawaii in 1937, majoring in education and serving in the \n     Reserve Officer Training Corps. Upon graduation in June 194l, \n     Matsunaga was commissioned in the Army and was serving on \n     active duty on the island of Molokai when Japan attacked \n     Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Shortly afterward, he and \n     other Japanese-Americans were relieved of their duties and \n     shipped to a military facility, Camp McCoy, in Wisconsin, \n     while the War Department in Washington decided whether they \n     could fight for America. Matsunaga, along with the other \n     soldiers, petitioned President Roosevelt for a chance to \n     prove their loyalty.\n       In the Spring of 1942, President Roosevelt and other \n     Washington leaders determined that Japanese-Americans in the \n     army would be loyal to the country; Matsunaga and 1,500 other \n     Japanese-Americans formed the 100th Infantry Battalion and \n     trained for combat duty. In September 1943, the battalion was \n     sent to Italy; Matsunaga was wounded twice in the same night \n     while moving through a minefield. After recuperating, \n     Matsunaga could not go back to combat but received two Purple \n     Hearts and the Bronze Star for his heroic acts, and was \n     assigned to a replacement battalion.\n       Late in the war, he returned to the U.S. where he gave 800 \n     speeches to help Japanese-Americans become integrated into \n     the mainstream of American life after being released from the \n     detention camps where they were kept during the war. The \n     100th Infantry Battalion eventually became a part of the \n     442nd Regimental Combat Team of Japanese-American soldiers, \n     the most decorated unit in U.S. military history.\n       Matsunaga returned to Hawaii in 1946, worked in veterans \n     affairs briefly, married, and then entered Harvard Law School \n     in 1948. After graduation, he practiced law in Hawaii and \n     began his political career, being elected to the Territorial \n     Legislature in which was known as the ``Democratic \n     Revolution'' of 1954 engineered by veterans of the 100th and \n     442nd to take control of the legislature for the first time. \n     Matsunaga and other Japanese-Americans were among the leaders \n     in Hawaii's bid for statehood, which passed in 1959.\n       In 1962, Matsunaga won a seat in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, making the rights of immigrants, the welfare \n     of veterans, and the defense of Japanese-Americans and other \n     minorities his hallmarks. In 1976, he was elected to the U.S. \n     Senate, supporting legislation to establish a research \n     organization called the United States Peace Institute and to \n     authorize the post of Poet Laureate. As a Senator, he was \n     also a major proponent of\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n     the use of renewable energy sources and Soviet-American \n     cooperation in space exploration. Perhaps Matsunaga's \n     greatest achievement in the Senate was obtaining redress for \n     Japanese-Americans who had been unjustly interned during \n     World War II. The survivors of the camps received ``token \n     monetary compensation'' and an apology from President Ronald \n     Reagan. Another signature legislative achievement was the \n     Spark Matsunaga Hydrogen Research and Development Act, which \n     was passed in 1990 and provides funding for research into \n     alternative energy sources. His last official act was to cast \n     a vote in favor of continuing the Clean Air Act.\n       In 1990, Senator Matsunaga died while serving the U.S. \n     Senate. In his honor, the University of Hawaii established \n     the Matsunaga Institute for Peace in which scholars explore \n     ways to resolve differences without resorting to \n     violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3898-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING AMERICA'S NURSES\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe women and men across the Nation who daily stand on the front lines \nof the health care profession. This week, May 6 through May 12, we \ncelebrate National Nurses Week in their honor. Through their service to \nthe patients and communities for whom they care, nurses continue to \ndeliver health care despite the unprecedented difficulties they face. \nIt is a testament to their sustained professionalism and genuine \ncompassion that, regardless of these challenges, America's nurses are \nstill the first to respond to the everyday tragedies and the first to \nbe prepared for the extraordinary ones.\n  America's population is not only growing larger, it is growing older \nand the implications of these demographic trends are severe for the \nhealth care delivery system. The nursing workforce, in both the private \nand public sectors, is challenged by personnel shortages as nurse \nrecruitment and retention becomes more problematic. Cutbacks in \nMedicare reimbursements have exacerbated the situation, and our rural \nand elderly communities have suffered from the inaccessibility of care \nas a result. The Department of Veterans Affairs is particularly \naffected by this situation as the aging veteran community becomes \nincreasingly more care-dependent. The Health Resources and Services \nAdministration released a study in February of 2001 describing the \nplight of registered nurses in the United States and recommending that \nsignificant steps be taken to preserve the nation's supply of nurses.\n  To this end, I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation, put forth \nby Senator Hutchinson, that addresses these issues and offers genuine \nsolutions to the problems underlying the nursing profession's shortage. \nPortions of this bill were incorporated into legislation that the \nSenate passed in December, and the House of Representatives has acted \nfavorably on a bill to boost nurse employment as well. I am hopeful \nthat the differences between the two chambers' bills can be reconciled \nand that a final measure can be soon sent to the President for his \nsignature. Enactment of the proposed nursing legislation would initiate \nnew approaches to retaining and recruiting highly qualified individuals \nin this field of health care. Among these approaches would be expanding \nnurse-loan repayment and scholarship programs, career ladder and \nfaculty development opportunities, and multi-media campaigns to \nencourage Americans to consider nursing as a career choice. Preserving \nand promoting the nursing workforce is imperative if we are to maintain \nour country's ability to deliver first-class medical care.\n  Nurses, and the indispensable position they serve in medicine, are \nnear and dear to me; theirs is a commitment to health care I have \nwitnessed throughout my life, my mother, sister and wife all have \nnursing backgrounds, and mine is a keen appreciation for the \nprofession. Nurses deserve our appreciation and support, particularly \nas they weather the administrative difficulties of their practice. I \ninvite my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking America's nurses \ntoday for the vital role they play as the healers and caretakers of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3898-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I again speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 19, \n1993 in Seattle, WA. A man attacked two lesbian women, pushing one \nthrough a window. The assailant, Terrance Donato Scott, was charged \nwith a hate crime in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3898-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3898-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \ntreaties and sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/06/senate-section/article/S3898-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 3, 2002, during adjournment of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 169.
