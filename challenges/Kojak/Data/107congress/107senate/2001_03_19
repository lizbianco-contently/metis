Mr. President, I have sought recognition in morning \nbusiness to reference legislation on campaign finance reform which I \noriginally offered on September 18, 1997, as S. 1191. I refer to it \ntoday because there are a number of specific provisions which may form \nthe basis for amendments to S. 27. I wanted to give my colleagues \nexpress notice that I might be offering such.\n  My bill does six things: First, it eliminates soft money; second, \ndefines express advocacy; third, requires affidavits for independent \nexpenditures; fourth, adopts the Maine standby public financing \nprovision; fifth, eliminates foreign transactions which funnel money \ninto U.S. campaigns; sixth, limits and requires reporting of \ncontributions to legal defense funds.\n  A major portion of debate will occur on the issue of soft money. The \nSupreme Court of the United States in Buckley v. Valeo defined advocacy \nand issue ads in a way which has been very perplexing and very \ntroubling, and in Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme Court said:\n\n       In order to preserve the provision against invalidation on \n     vagueness grounds, section 6608(e)(1) must be construed to \n     apply only to expenditures for communications that in express \n     terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified \n     candidate for Federal office.\n\n  And then the Supreme Court went on to amplify what express advocacy \nmeant, saying vote for X or vote against X.\n  There have been decisions which have said that it is not mandatory to \nhave a statement ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' in order to satisfy \nthe requirements of express advocacy. It is my view that in the ensuing \n25 years we have seen advertisements which were clear cut advocacy ads \nwhich did not contain any\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nmagic words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' I would give two \nillustrations--one from the Democratic National Committee and a second \nfrom the Republican National Committee in the 1996 Presidential \nelection.\n  A Democratic National Committee television commercial said:\n\n       American values. Do our duty to our parents. President \n     Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole-Gingrich budget tried to \n     cut Medicare $270 billion. Protect families. President \n     Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families. The Dole-\n     Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million of \n     them. Opportunity. President Clinton proposes tax breaks \n     for tuition. The Dole-Gingrich budget tried to slash \n     college scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets \n     our challenges. Protect our values.\n\n  Inexplicably, this has been viewed as an issue ad, but nothing could \nbe clearer on its face than that it advocates the election of then-\nPresident Clinton and the defeat of then-candidate Senator Dole.\n  Then compare a Republican National Committee ad. The announcer comes \non and says:\n\n       Compare the Clinton rhetoric with the Clinton record.\n\n  Then President Clinton comes on in a video tape saying:\n\n       We need to end welfare as we know it.\n\n  Then the announcer comes back and says:\n\n       But he vetoed welfare reform not once but twice. He vetoed \n     work requirements for the able-bodied. He vetoed putting time \n     limits on welfare, and Clinton still supports giving welfare \n     benefits to illegal immigrants. The Clinton record hasn't \n     matched the Clinton record.\n\n  Then President Clinton's face comes on and he says on a video tape:\n\n       Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\n  Then the announcer comes on and says:\n\n       Tell President Clinton you won't be fooled again.\n\n  Here again the other side of the coin--inexplicably interpreted to be \nan issue ad and not an advocacy ad. In my judgment, Mr. President, \nthose ads clearly constitute advocacy. And when the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo said they needed to preserve the act against \ninvalidation on vagueness grounds, I would suggest that what has \nhappened in the intervening 25 years is that advocacy ads may now be \ndefined legislatively. And as Justice Jackson said in one of his famous \ncomments, when there are close issues and there is a congressional \ndeclaration, that is weighed very heavily by the Court on the \nconsideration even of constitutional issues. The Supreme Court has \nruled in Buckley v. Valeo on the critical issue of coordination, saying \nthat when ``expenditures are controlled by or coordinated with the \ncandidate and his campaign,'' that such control or coordinated \nexpenditures are treated as contributions rather than expenditures.\n  So the Court said if you have coordination on soft money, it \nconstitutes a contribution and would be governed by the limitations of \nthe Federal election campaign law. But what has occurred is exactly the \nopposite. In a 6-0 vote on December 10, 1998, the Federal Election \nCommission rejected its auditor's recommendation that the 1996 Clinton \nand Dole campaigns repay $17.7 million and $7 million, respectively, \nbecause the national committee parties had closely coordinated their \nsoft money issue.\n  Here we have the Supreme Court saying that where there is \ncoordination, they count, but you have coordination and the rule is \nflouted by the Federal Election Commission, which again illustrates the \nneed for a modification of what is advocacy, what is coordination, and \nwhat ought to be subject to campaign finance limitations.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that:\n\n       Even a significant interference with protected rights of \n     political association may be sustained if the State \n     demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs \n     means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of \n     associational freedoms.\n\n  Then the Supreme Court goes on to talk about values to be preserved \non the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\n  It is obvious at this stage, some 25 years after Buckley v. Valeo, \nwith the public indignation as to what has happened with the avalanche \nof soft money and with the concurrence of much official action in a \nclose time sequence with the avalanche of enormous sums of soft money, \nso that when the Supreme Court talks about the appearance of \ncorruption, which of course is different from corruption--it is very \ndifficult to prove a bribe, very difficult to prove a quid pro quo to \nestablish the existence of corruption--but when the Court recognizes \nthe ``appearance of corruption'' as a factor which justifies limitation \non speech, then, with the 25 years of experience, it is my view that \nlegislation directed at soft money and directed at a modification of \nthe definitions of advocacy and issue ads would be upheld as being \nconstitutional.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today with respect to soft \nmoney would prohibit the national committees or political parties from \nsoliciting or receiving any contributions not subject to the provisions \nand caps of the Federal Election Campaign Act and provides further that \nState party committee expenditures that may influence the outcome of a \nFederal election may be made only from funds subject to the limitations \nand prohibitions imposed by Federal law.\n  The bill requires affidavits for independent expenditures for the \nindividual making the so-called independent expenditure and affidavits \nfrom the candidate, the campaign manager, and the campaign treasurer \nthat, in fact, those so-called independent expenditures were not made \nin coordination with the campaign. There is obviously a great deal more \nattention paid on individual conduct where that conduct is subject to \nan affidavit which is prosecutable under the substantial penalties for \nperjury. There is continuing suspicion that these so-called independent \nexpenditures are, in fact, not independent.\n  The Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, has upheld independent \nexpenditures saying that freedom of speech entitles someone to spend as \nmuch money as he or she may choose as long as it is not in coordination \nwith the candidate or the campaign. In order to take a significant step \nforward in ascertaining and ensuring that so-called independent \nexpenditures are really independent, my legislation calls for that kind \nof an affidavit.\n  The provision relating to the Maine standby public financing \nprovision is an interesting one, which provides for public funding when \nan individual spends a phenomenal sum of money for his or her own \ncampaign. It is an open secret that individuals are prepared to spend \nvirtually unlimited sums of money, as illustrated by the past election, \nor by prior elections. I oppose public financing generally, but it \nseems to me that where that sort of excessive expenditure is made, \nthere ought to be public financing which would come into play to match \nthat enormous outpouring of an individual's wealth. If public financing \nwere available, it is obvious that the individual wouldn't be inclined \nto spend all of his or her own money if it were to be matched by public \nfunding. In a day when seats in the Senate are subject to purchase, the \nMaine standby provision is one which ought to be adopted as a matter of \nFederal law.\n  We are about to embark on the consideration of the McCain-Feingold, \nS. 27, at 1 o'clock. The provision of this legislation which I am \nsubmitting now, which, as I say, had been submitted on September 18, \n1997, as then S. 1191, contains a number of revisions which are \npossibilities for my offering as amendments to S. 27. There is no doubt \nthat we are going to become very deeply involved in the constitutional \nissue on what is an issue ad and what is an advocacy ad and how we deal \nwith soft money.\n  In the 1996 Presidential elections, the line was blurred beyond \nrecognition between party and candidate activities. There is \nsubstantial evidence that soft money was spent illegally during the \n1996 campaign by both parties. According to a November 18, 1996, \narticle in Time magazine, President Clinton's media strategists \ncollaborated in the creation of a DNC television commercial. The \narticle describes a cadre of Clinton-Gore advisors, including Dick \nMorris, working side by side with DNC operatives to craft the DNC \nadvertisement which extolled the President's accomplishments and \ncriticized Republican policies. Republicans did the same.\n  Such cooperation constitutes violation of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act [FECA] which provides:\n\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\n\n       Expenditures made by any person in cooperation, \n     consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or \n     suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political \n     committees, or their agents, shall be considered to be a \n     contribution to such candidate. 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(7)(B)(1)\n\n  Thus, if the alleged cooperation between the Clinton/Gore campaign \nand the DNC took place, then all of the money spent on those DNC \nadvertisements constituted contributions to the Clinton campaign. Under \nFECA, such contributions would have to be reported upon receipt and \nwould have to be included when calculating the campaign's compliance \nwith FECA's strict contribution and expenditure limits. The failure to \ntreat the expenditures as contributions would be a violation of FECA, \nand the knowing and willful failure to treat the expenditures as \ncontributions would be a criminal violation of FECA.\n  There are indications that the Clinton/Gore campaign advisors did \nrealize they were violating the law at the time. The Time article \nquotes one as saying, ``If the Republicans keep the Senate, they're \ngoing to subpoena us.''\n  The content of the DNC and RNC advertisements appears to have \nviolated Federal election law. When an entity engages in issues \nadvocacy to promote a particular policy, it is exempt from the \nlimitation of FECA and can fund these activities from any source. When \nan entity engages in express advocacy on behalf of a particular \ncandidate, it is subject to the limitations of FECA and is not \npermitted to fund such activities with soft money. Where the DNC and \nRNC advertisements did contain express advocacy, and funded these \nadvertisements with soft money, then these committees violated FECA.\n  The FEC defines ``express advocacy'' as follows:\n\n       Communications using phrases such as ``vote for \n     President,'' ``reelect your Congressman,'' ``Smith for \n     Congress,'' or language which, when taken as a whole and with \n     limited reference to external events, can have no other \n     reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified federal candidate. 11 CFR 100.22\n\n  In my judgment, both the DNC and RNC television advertisement crossed \nthe line from issues advocacy to express advocacy. While the DNC and \nRNC ads did not use the words ``Vote for Clinton'' or ``Dole for \nPresident,'' these advertisements certainly urged the election of one \ncandidate and the defeat of another. For example, the following is the \nscript of a widely broadcast DNC television commercial:\n\n       American values. Do our duty to our parents. President \n     Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to \n     cut Medicare $270 billion. Protect families. President \n     Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families. The Dole/\n     Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million of \n     them. Opportunity. President Clinton proposes tax breaks for \n     tuition. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college \n     scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets our \n     challenges, protects our values.\n\n  Does this advertisement convey any core message other than urging us \nto vote for President Clinton?\n  The RNC ads similarly crossed the line into express advocacy. The \nfollowing is the script of a widely broadcast RNC television \ncommercial:\n\n       (Announcer) Compare the Clinton rhetoric with the Clinton \n     record.\n       (Clinton) ``We need to end welfare as we know it.''\n       (Announcer) But he vetoed welfare reform not once, but \n     twice. He vetoed work requirements for the able-bodied. He \n     vetoed putting time limits on welfare. And Clinton still \n     supports giving welfare benefits to illegal immigrants. The \n     Clinton rhetoric hasn't matched the Clinton record.\n       (Clinton) ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, \n     shame on me.''\n       (Announcer) Tell President Clinton you won't be fooled \n     again.\n\n  Similarly, the Democrats, through their shared use of campaign \nconsultants such as Dick Morris for Clinton-Gore 1996 and the \nDemocratic National Committee, crossed the line into illegal \ncontributions on television advertisements.\n  There has been substantial information in the public domain about the \nPresident's personal activities in preparing television commercials for \nthe 1996 campaign. The activity of the President has been documented in \na book by Dick Morris and in public statements by former Chief of \nStaff, Leon Panetta. There is no doubt--and the Attorney General \nconceded this in oversight hearings by the Judiciary Committee on April \n30, 1997--that there would be a violation of the Federal election law \nif, and when the President prepared campaign commercials that were \nexpress advocacy commercials contrasted with issue advocacy \ncommercials.\n  This bill will end the charade by providing a clear-cut statutory \ndefinition of express advocacy wherever the name or likeness of a \ncandidate appears with language which praises or criticizes that \ncandidate.\n  This bill would put teeth into the law to make independent \nexpenditures truly independent. Current law requires political \ncommittees or individuals to file reports quarterly until the end of a \ncampaign and to report expenditures of more than $1,000 within 24 hours \nduring the final 20 days of the campaign. This legislation would \nrequire reporting for independent expenditures of $10,000 or more \nwithin 24 hours during the last 3 months of a campaign. This bill would \nrequire the individual making the independent expenditure or the \ntreasurer of the committee making the independent expenditure to take \nand file an affidavit with the FEC that the expenditures were not \ncoordinated with the candidate or his-her committee. Then, the Federal \nElection Commission would notify within 48 hours the candidate, \ncampaign treasurer, and campaign manager of that independent \nexpenditure. Those individuals would then have 48 hours to take and \nfile affidavits with the FEC that the expenditures were not coordinated \nwith the candidate or his/her committees.\n  Taking such affidavits coupled with the penalty for perjury would be \nsignificant steps to preclude illegal coordination.\n  Anyone who watched the Governmental Affairs hearings in 1997 knows \nthe alarming role of illegal foreign contributions in our 1996 \ncampaigns. This legislation would strengthen the existing law to better \nprevent transactions which effectively fund domestic political \ncampaigns with foreign financing schemes.\n  Under current law, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute \nmoney or anything of value, including loan guarantees, either directly \nor indirectly through another person, in connection with an election to \nany political office. Knowing and willful violations can result in \ncriminal penalties against the offending parties.\n  Mr. Haley Barbour's testimony before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in 1997 highlights the need to strengthen and more actively \nenforce the foreign money statute to ensure that foreign nationals do \nnot circumvent this intended prohibition on foreign political \ncontributions. This bill would clarify the law to cover all \narrangements from foreign entities through third parties where funds \nfrom these transactions ultimately reach a U.S. political party or \ncandidate.\n  In his testimony, Mr. Barbour acknowledged that the National Policy \nForum [NPF], which he headed, received a $2.1 million loan guarantee in \nOctober 1994, from Young Brothers Development, the U.S. subsidiary of a \nHong Kong company which provided the money. The loan guarantee served \nas collateral for a loan NPF received from a U.S. bank. Shortly \nthereafter, NPF sent two checks totaling $1.6 million to the Republican \nNational Committee [RNC]. NPF ultimately defaulted on its loan with the \nU.S. bank and Young Brothers eventually ended up paying approximately \n$700,000 to cover the default.\n  The weak link in the existing law is that many people have argued \nthat the Federal campaign finance law does not apply to soft money. \nAccordingly, there are those who would argue that the NPF transaction \ndescribed above would be legal so long as only soft money was involved. \nWe need to make it 100 percent clear that foreign nationals cannot \ncontribute to U.S. political parties or candidates under any \ncircumstances. My bill closes this potential loophole by explicitly \nstating that the foreign money provisions of the bill apply to all \nforeign contributions and donations, both soft and hard money.\n  The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley \nversus Valeo prohibits legislation limiting the amount of money an \nindividual may spend on his-her campaign. Maine recently enacted a \nstatute designed to deal with this issue which provides a model for \nFederal legislation.\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\n  Under the Maine legislation, a voluntary cap is placed on the total \namount that candidates can spend during their campaigns for public \noffice. The law further provides that if one candidate exceeds the \nspending limit, an opponent who has complied with the limit will be \ngiven public matching funds in an amount equal to the amount by which \nthe offending candidate exceeded the spending limit. With such matching \nfunds available, it would be a real deterrent to prevent a candidate \nfrom exceeding the expenditure cap since that candidate would no longer \nreceive an advantage from his or her additional expenditure. This \nprovision would probably not result in significant public expenditures; \nand to the extent it did, it would be worth it.\n  This bill would subject contributions for legal defense funds to \nlimits and mandatory disclosure for all Federal office holders and \ncandidates. Testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee in 1997 \ndisclosed that Mr. Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie brought in $639,000 for \nPresident Clinton's legal defense fund. While those funds were \nultimately returned, there was never any identification of the donors \nand the fact of those contributions was delayed until after the 1996 \nelection.\n  Contributions to legal defense funds pose a public policy issue \nsimilar to campaign contributions.\n  This bill would impose the same limits on contributions to legal \ndefense funds which are required for political contributions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the legislation I \nintroduced in 1997, along with an executive summary, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1191\n\n                    (Introduced September 18, 1997)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Spending Limits on Senate Campaigns.--The bill imposes \n     the following voluntary limits on the amounts that a \n     candidate can spend in a Senate primary and general election:\n       Primary--67% of the state's general election expenditure \n     limit.\n       General--$400,000 plus an additional amount based upon the \n     population of each state (with a floor of $950,000). Under \n     this formula, New York would have a general election \n     expenditure limit of $3,994,500, Pennsylvania would have a \n     limit of $2,899,000 and Delaware would have a limit of \n     $950,000.\n       2. Standby Public Financing.--Similar to the recently-\n     enacted Maine statute, when a candidate exceeds the voluntary \n     spending caps, his qualifying opponent(s) will receive public \n     funding in the amount of the excess. This provisions should \n     act primarily as a deterrent and should not result in \n     significant public outlays.\n       3. Soft Money--Political Parties.--The bill prevents \n     candidates for Federal office from using soft money (i.e. \n     money not subject to the restrictions, caps and reporting \n     requirements of FECA--the Federal Election Campaign Act) to \n     fund their campaigns by doing the following:\n       Prohibits national committees of political parties (e.g. \n     the DNC and the RNC) from soliciting, receiving or spending \n     soft money.\n       Prohibits candidates for Federal office from soliciting or \n     receiving soft money.\n       Prohibits state, district and local committees of political \n     parties from spending or disbursing soft money for any \n     activity that may affect the outcome of a Federal election.\n       Caps the amount any individual or entity may contribute to \n     state parties for use in Federal elections at $20,000/year.\n       4. Foreign Money.--The bill clarifies Federal election law \n     to provide that foreign nationals and other foreign entities \n     may not make any contributions to Federal elections. This \n     provision will make clear that the proscription on such \n     contributions applies to soft money as well as hard money \n     contributions.\n       5. Clarifying the Definition of Independent Expenditures.--\n     The bill ensures that ``independent expenditures'' on behalf \n     of a particular candidate by a third party will be truly \n     independent from the candidate by providing that:\n       All entities which make independent expenditures relating \n     to a candidate for Federal office will have to sign an \n     affidavit stating whether or not such an expenditure was made \n     in coordination with any candidate.\n       Within 48 hours of receipt of such a certification, the FEC \n     shall notify the candidate to which the expenditure refers \n     that such expenditure has been made.\n       Within 48 hours of such notice, the candidate (and his \n     campaign manager and treasurer) will have to submit a signed \n     affidavit stating whether or not the independent expenditure \n     was made in coordination with the candidate.\n       6. Donations to Legal Defense Funds.--The bill seeks to \n     control contributions to legal defense funds--the ``first \n     cousin'' of campaign contributions--by imposing the following \n     limitations and requirements:\n       No person can make a contribution of over $10,000 a year in \n     the aggregate to the legal defense fund of a holder of \n     Federal office or a candidate for Federal office.\n       A holder of Federal office or a candidate for Federal \n     office that accepts contributions to a legal defense fund \n     must file detailed quarterly reports on such contributions \n     and the identity of the donors with the Federal Election \n     Commission.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, will you advise me of the time \navailable under the special orders?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. was under the control of the Senator from Illinois. \nHowever, that time has arrived. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:50 p.m. will be under the control of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2428-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2428-S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call the attention of my colleagues \nto a release by OPEC on Friday where OPEC indicated it was cutting the \nproduction of oil approximately 1 million barrels a day, to \napproximately 24.2 million barrels a day. This follows a cut in \nFebruary of 1.5 million barrels a day. I am sure many will not reflect \non the significance of this action, but as we go into the summer \nseason, the realization, again, that we are dependent on OPEC warrants \na little consideration this afternoon.\n  Many people forget that in 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo and \nthe Yom Kippur war, we were approximately 37 percent dependent on \nimported oil. Today we are 56 percent dependent on imported oil.\n  It is not that there is necessarily a shortage of oil in the world, \nbut because of our increased dependence on OPEC and their awareness \nthat they are better off tightening up the supply and keeping the price \nhigh, we have seen a rather curious and significant effect associated \nwith our dependence on OPEC and our economy.\n  What has happened is the OPEC nations have decided it is better to \ncurtail the supply and keep the price high than to continue to produce \noil. As a consequence, we are seeing fourth quarter earnings of the \nFortune 500 dramatically affected by the cost of energy, and \nparticularly oil. It is estimated that in the last 18 months, one of \nthe major contributors to a decline in our economy, and hence a decline \nin the stock market, is the cost of energy.\n  We have seen OPEC operate over the years in a rather undisciplined \nfashion. That has changed dramatically. Today we see an organized OPEC, \na group of countries that actually set a cartel in the sense of setting \na price, something that would be inappropriate and subject to antitrust \nlaws in the United States. They got together and decided they were \ngoing to maintain a floor and ceiling on the price of oil. That floor \nwas going to be about $22, and the ceiling was going to be about $28. \nSo each time the price begins to fall, OPEC reduces its supply. As a \nconsequence, we are seeing oil prices now about $25 a barrel. About 18 \nmonths ago, we were seeing oil prices at $10 a barrel.\n\n  OPEC fears, obviously, any slowdown in economic growth that will lead \nto an oil glut, so they simply reduce the supply. Any reduction in \nworld supply does affect our economy as well as the world's economy and \nmakes higher prices for energy.\n  There are those who suggest there might be another OPEC cut on the \nhorizon that might be up to 2 million barrels per day if a continued \nslowdown in the economy actually prevails.\n  What does this mean for the American consumer? The Energy Information \nAgency predicts that prices of gasoline this summer may run from $1.60 \nto as high as $2.10 a gallon for the rest of this year. The reason for \nthat, obviously, is supply and demand: our increasing demand and our \nincreasing dependence on imports.\n  I indicated we were looking at about 56 percent dependence on OPEC, \nbut it gets worse. The Department of Energy has suggested that by the \nyear 2004 to 2005--somewhere in that area--we will be close to 60 \npercent dependent. In the year 2010, we will be somewhere in the area \nof 65 percent dependent.\n  What we really have to do is begin to spotlight how we can decrease \nour dependence on imported energy supplies, reduce reliance on foreign \noil imports. That is rather amusing to me as we\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nlook at the facts associated with what is happening in our economy and \nthe energy crisis that, for all practical purposes, with the exception \nof what is happening in California, we have chosen to ignore, in spite \nof the fact that last week the Wall Street Journal came out with an \narticle indicating that the State of New York will have to increase its \nproduction generating capacity of energy somewhere in the range of 25 \npercent in the next year to avoid brownouts, blackouts, and shortages.\n  It is a funny thing because unless the wheel really squeaks, we do \nnot maintain any attention to take the necessary steps to avoid that. \nWe just simply assume it will not happen or it probably will occur on \nsomebody else's watch or somehow we will get through.\n  Let me share with you what has changed. In 1988, U.S. consumption of \noil was 13.2 million barrels a day. In January of this year, it was \n14.6 million barrels a day. Consumption has gone up dramatically--\nroughly 1.3 million barrels a day.\n  The offset to that is production. What is our production in the \nUnited States? Our production in 1988 was 8.1 million barrels, and it \nhas dropped. In January, production in the U.S. was 5.9 million barrels \na day. We are down over 2 million barrels of U.S. daily \nproduction. That equates, obviously, to a dependence on more imports.\n\n  What are our imports? In 1989, they were 5.1 million barrels a day. \nIn January of this year, they were 8.6 million barrels a day. So \napproximately 3.35 million barrels a day more is imported into this \nNation than back in 1998. As I indicated, our foreign dependence in \n1998 was about 39 percent; today it is 59 percent. The price of crude \noil in 1998 was $18 compared to $29, $27 today. Adjusted for inflation \nfor the year 2001, that is $26 vis-a-vis $35 a day. That is what has \nchanged.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the national security interests of this \ncountry. I said many times on this floor it is rather ironic we should \nhave a foreign policy that depends to a significant degree on imported \noil from Iraq, our good friend Saddam Hussein. We fought a war in 1991. \nWe lost 147 lives. We had 437 wounded, 23 taken prisoner. I don't want \nto even estimate the cost to the American taxpayer. That was a war over \noil. Make no mistake about it. It was to ensure that Saddam Hussein did \nnot invade Kuwait and go on into Saudi Arabia and control the world's \nsupply of oil. We fought that war. We won that war.\n  But what are we doing today? We are importing 750,000 barrels of oil \nfrom Iraq, our good friend Saddam Hussein. Isn't that ironic?\n  Let me go a step further. It gets worse. We have flown 234,000 \nindividual sorties--airplane flights to enforce the no-fly zone over \nIraq--since 1992. What are we doing? One could simplify the debate and \nsuggest we are taking that 750,000 barrels of oil, putting it in our \nairplanes, and then bombing.\n  Let's go a little further. What is he doing with the money we pay for \nthat oil? He is taking care of his Republican Guards. No question about \nthat. Then instead of taking care of the needs of his people, he is \ndeveloping a missile delivery capability of biological and chemical \ncapability. At whom is he aiming? One of our greatest allies--Israel. \nMaybe I am oversimplifying that, but if you boil it down, that is what \nit amounts to. Rather ironic. We just seem to shrug our shoulders and \nsay that is the way it is.\n  I will ask the question of our national security interests. At what \npoint do we reach a degree of dependence on imports where we compromise \nour national security?\n  There was a report prepared a few weeks ago by the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies. It took about 3 years to complete \nthat report. It launched its strategic energy initiatives and began to \nexamine at what point we began to compromise our national security. The \nbottom line is we are already there.\n  Some of the highlights of this report deserve some examination. The \nreport assesses the international energy supply and demand relationship \nlikely to prevail in the first two decades of the 21st century--in \nother words, the next 20 years--and is identifying what effect it will \nhave on global markets between 2000 and 2020 in that study. The energy \noutlook to 2020 is not very bright. It suggests during the next 20 \nyears, provided there is no extended global economic dislocation, \nenergy demand is projected to expand more than 50 percent. Further, it \nstates the growth will be unevenly distributed with demand increasing \nin the industrialized world by some 23 percent while more than doubling \nfrom a much lower base in the developed world, with Asia accounting for \nthe bulk of the increase. It is not just the United States. We \nthink the world revolves around us. There are developing nations; there \nis China.\n\n  Further, it states that central to the geopolitics of energy is the \nfact that energy demand will be met in essentially the same way it was \nmet at the end of the 20th century, fossil fuels--mainly oil--providing \nthe bulk of global energy consumption, rising marginally from 86 \npercent in 2000 to an 88-percent share in 2020.\n  And oil will dominate global energy use. They identify from where the \noil will come. The Persian Gulf will remain the key marginal supplier \nof oil to the world markets, with Saudi Arabia in an unchallenged lead, \nand if estimates are correct, the Persian Gulf will expand oil \nproduction during that time of 2000 to 2020. That is from where it will \ncome.\n  It further states that U.S. net imports will continue their steady \ngrowth. It further states that electricity will continue to be the most \nrapidly growing sector of energy demand in developing countries in \nAsia, central South Africa, and South America showing the greatest \nincrease.\n  Then it goes into the geopolitics--this is on what every member of \nthis body should reflect--the continuing domestic fragility of key \nenergy producing states. We will be relying on oil from unstable \ncountries and regions throughout much of the century. By the year 2020, \nfully 50 percent of the estimated total global oil demand will be met \nfrom countries that pose a high risk of internal instability.\n  Further, the growing fact of nonstate actors will be evident in three \ndistinct areas: First, employing new information technologies, \nnongovernment organizations--NGOs will play a growing role in defining \nthe ways energy is produced and consumed. Second, terrorist groups, \nwith access to the same technologies, will be in a position to inflict \ngreater operational damage on increasingly complex energy \ninfrastructures. Radical activists will be in a position to disrupt \noperation infrastructures through cyberterrorism. The potential for \narmed conflict in energy-producing nations will remain high.\n  I recommend each member review this CSIS report because it stresses \nthe vulnerability of the United States to increasing dependence on \nenergy.\n  I conclude with one reference. A number of my colleagues are on a \nbill to put an area known as ANWR, in my State of Alaska, into a \nwilderness. We have a chart showing a map of the area in question. It \nis appropriate to recognize a few facts. They are often misstated. ANWR \nis 19 million acres. ANWR is not at risk because ANWR has already been \nforeclosed into a wilderness in this area, 8.5 million acres, and 9 \nmillion acres is set off as a refuge and is an undisturbed area. There \nis a village, Katovik, with 227 people. There are people in it who live \ntheir lives there. We have a picture of the village. You can see the \nocean, the radar, the village homes, the airport, and so forth. My \npoint in bringing this up is to shatter the myth that somehow this is \nan unoccupied area.\n\n  It is beyond my comprehension why some Members would object to our \nenergy bill, which has ANWR in it as a relief, if you will, to reduce \nour dependence. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In conclusion, let me bring up the reality that we \nhave an energy bill that is about 303 pages long. It covers increasing \nenergy efficiency, alternate fuels, and increasing our own domestic \nresources. It seems that all the interested parties, including the \nmedia, are concerned with one small portion, and that is the portion \nthat suggests we reduce our dependence on imports and imported energy. \nThat is one of the objectives in the bill--to reduce our imports of \nforeign energy to less than 50 percent by the year 2010.\n  To get back to this area, because it is the area of dispute, we are \nlooking at a\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nlease-sale in this coastal plain. The reason that is the area is that \nit is estimated approximately 10 billion to 16 billion barrels of oil \nare mainly in this area. If it is within the estimate of 16 billion \nbarrels, it will be the largest oilfield found in the world in the last \n40 years.\n  Here is Prudhoe Bay, which has been 20 percent of America's \nproduction for the last 27 years, and the pipeline, 800 miles long, \ntraverses this area. There are some in this body who want to put it \ninto wilderness. Some are proposing they filibuster the bill. That is \nlike fiddling while Rome burns.\n  We have an energy crisis in this country. We are looking for relief. \nWe have an area where we have identified a significant likelihood of a \nmajor discovery that would relieve our dependence on imported oil, and \nsome Members want to put it into wilderness, some Members want to stop \ndiscussion of the bill, some Members want to filibuster. When will we \nlearn from experience? The experience is, if you are looking for oil, \nyou go where you are most likely to find it. The geologists tell us \nthis is the place. The infrastructure and an 800-mile pipeline are \nalready there. But the environmentalists say no. They don't have any \nscientific evidence to suggest it cannot be done, they simply say no \nbecause it gives them a cause, membership dollars, and so forth.\n  People are concerned about the caribou. Here is a picture of the \ncaribou. You have seen it before, Mr. President. They are wandering \naround Prudhoe Bay, they are not disturbed, they are very comfortable. \nThese are real, Mr. President, they are not stuffed.\n  I can show you another picture. This happens to be 3 bears going for \na walk. They happen to be walking on a pipeline because it is easier \nthan walking in the snow. There is a compatibility here. I am not \nsuggesting there is not change, but I am suggesting we have the \ntechnology to do it safely.\n  Here is a chart with the new technology. This came out of the New \nYork Times science section. This shows how drilling occurs today, with \n3-D seismic. You can directionally drill and find these pockets of oil.\n  Lastly, the technology of how it is done with the ice roads. We \ndevelop no gravel roads. We put down chipped ice. This is a platform in \nPrudhoe Bay area, but it is the same in the ANWR area. You can see \ncars--not cars, these are pickup trucks, traversing to supply this. \nWhen this is gone, what you will see in the 2\\1/2\\ months of summer is \na picture looking like this. That is the technology. There is \nabsolutely no scientific evidence to suggest we cannot do it safely.\n\n  Finally, do we really care where our energy comes from? Virtually all \nthe oil produced in Alaska is consumed in California, Washington, and \nOregon. If it does not come from Alaska, they are going to get it. Do \nyou know where it is going to come from? It is going to come in foreign \nships, because every single drop of oil that moves from Alaska has to \nflow in a vessel owned by a U.S. company with U.S. crews, built in a \nU.S. shipyard, because that is what the Jones Act mandates regarding \nthe movement of goods and services between two American ports.\n  California should concern itself, and so should Washington, because \notherwise that oil will be coming in in foreign vessels, owned by \nforeign companies that do not have the deep pockets of an Exxon-Valdez.\n  I will be talking about this at other times, but I implore my \ncolleagues to reflect on reality. We have some relief here if we have \nthe gumption and commitment to recognize the scientific capability and \ntechnology that we now have to do it right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the portion of the executive \nsummary of the CSIS study on the vulnerability of this Nation to \nimported energy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) \n     launched its Strategic Energy Initiative (SEI) in mid-1998 on \n     the premise that the benign global energy situation that had \n     prevailed since the late 1980s masked two dangers.\n       First, it obscured significant geopolitical shifts both \n     ongoing and forthcoming that could affect future global \n     energy security, supply, and demand.\n       Second, it led to complacency among policymakers and the \n     public about the need to incorporate long-term global energy \n     concerns into near-term foreign policy decisions.\n       By midyear 2000 the state of the world oil market had \n     undergone considerable turbulence, marked by rapidly rising \n     oil prices as oil-exporting countries were benefiting from \n     staged reductions in production that had been initiated more \n     than two years earlier. The delicate balance between supply \n     and demand was demonstrated once again.\n       Instead of dwelling on the oil market turbulence in 2000, \n     however, this report assesses the international energy \n     supply-and-demand relationships likely to prevail in the \n     first two decades of the twenty-first century, highlighting \n     the different ways that geopolitical developments could \n     affect global energy markets between 2000 and 2020. In light \n     of the world's future energy needs, this report series also \n     points out the contradictions inherent in certain of the \n     energy objectives and foreign policies pursued by the United \n     States and other Western governments. Finally, the report \n     offers policy considerations that, if implemented, could help \n     ensure that energy supplies are adequate to meet projected \n     worldwide demand, are not excessively vulnerable to major \n     interruptions, and are produced in ways that minimize damage \n     to the environment.\n       It may appear that parts of this assessment are unduly \n     pessimistic, that positive factors have been overlooked. \n     These SEI assessments do stress prospects for instability and \n     for interference in energy supplies, but only to alert \n     policymakers about the fragility of reliable and timely \n     supplies.\n\n\n                         energy outlook to 2020\n\n       During the next 20 years, providing there is no extended \n     global economic dislocation, energy demand is projected to \n     expand more than 50 percent. This growth will be unevenly \n     distributed, with demand increasing in the industrialized \n     world by some 23 percent while more than doubling, from a \n     much lower base, in the developing world, with Asia \n     accounting for the bulk of this increase. At some point \n     during this period, the developing world will begin to \n     consume more energy than the developed world. Energy supply \n     will need to be expanded substantially to meet this demand \n     growth. Although the Persian Gulf will remain the key \n     marginal oil supplier, all producing countries must \n     contribute to supply to the extent they can.\n       Central to the geopolitics of energy during 2000-2020 is \n     the fact that energy demand will be met in essentially the \n     same ways as it was met at the end of the twentieth century. \n     Fossil fuels will provide the bulk of global energy \n     consumption, rising marginally from an 86 percent share in \n     2000 to an 88 percent share in 2020. Although oil will \n     dominate global energy use and coal will retain its central \n     role in electricity generation, natural gas use will increase \n     noticeably. Indeed the relative contributions of oil and coal \n     to world energy consumption will actually decline whereas \n     only natural gas will demonstrate a growth in both absolute \n     and relative terms. Nuclear power will decline in both \n     relative and absolute terms; renewables, including \n     hydropower, and alternative energy sources, while growing in \n     absolute terms, will not capture a greater relative share of \n     the market.\n       Development of oil and gas reserves is judged sufficient to \n     meet projected global demand well beyond this period. The \n     most noticeable trend during 2000-2020 will be the growing \n     mutual dependencies between energy suppliers and consumers. \n     Key aspects of this trend, which are set out below, may \n     appear rather obvious--and they are; how to respond in \n     today's changing environment is much less so.\n       The Persian Gulf will remain the key marginal supplier of \n     oil to the world market, with Saudi Arabia in the \n     unchallenged lead. Indeed, if estimates of future demand are \n     reasonably correct, the Persian Gulf must expand oil \n     production by almost 80 percent during 2000-2020, achievable \n     perhaps if foreign investment is allowed to participate and \n     if Iran and Iraq are free of sanctions.\n       While the Persian Gulf's share of world oil production \n     continues to expand, the share of North America and Europe, \n     the world's most stable regions, is projected to decline.\n       The share of world oil production from the Soviet Union is \n     projected to increase from 9 percent to almost 12 percent. \n     But, as had been the case in earlier years, this oil will \n     follow the market, not attempt to lead it.\n       The Caspian oil contribution to world supply will be \n     important at the margin but not pivotal.\n       Asian dependence on Persian Gulf oil will rise \n     significantly, and the resulting necessity for longer tanker \n     journeys will put more oil at risk in the international sea \n     lanes.\n       European dependence on Persian Gulf oil will remain \n     significant.\n       The European need for natural gas will be covered by a \n     handful of suppliers, Russia being the most significant, \n     which underscores a worrisome dependency.\n       U.S. net oil imports will continue their steady growth.\n       Anticipated growth in the use of natural gas--in \n     considerable part engendered as a fuel for electric power \n     stations--raises a new series of geopolitical issues, leading \n     to new political alignments.\n       Electricity will continue to be the most rapidly growing \n     sector of energy demand; developing economies in Asia and in \n     Central and South America will show the greatest\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\n     increase in consumption. The choice of primary fuel used to \n     supply power plants will have important effects on the \n     environment.\n       Technological change and improvements in energy efficiency \n     have made their mark on recent energy supply-and-demand \n     balances. Future energy supply and demand must reflect not \n     only a continuation of these successes but an acceleration \n     wherever possible.\n\n\n            geopolitics and energy: a symbiotic relationship\n\n                  How Might Geopolitics Affect Energy?\n\n       Four main geopolitical trends are likely to influence \n     energy supply and demand during the years ahead.\n       The continuing domestic fragility of key energy-producing \n     states. The world drew some portion of its energy supplies \n     from unstable countries and regions throughout much of the \n     twentieth century. By 2020, fully 50 percent of estimated \n     total global oil demand will be met from countries that pose \n     a high risk of internal instability. A crisis in one or more \n     of the world's key energy-producing countries is highly \n     likely at some point during 2000-2020.\n       Globalization. Economic globalization will impose new \n     competitive and political pressures on many of the world's \n     leading energy producers and consumers. It will serve as a \n     spur for growth in global energy supply and demand. It could \n     also lead to serious swings in energy prices and demand \n     because country-specific or regional recessions or other \n     influencing events can now be transmitted quickly around the \n     world. In such a globalized world, energy producers and \n     consumers will become ever more sensitive to their mutual \n     interdependence.\n       The growing impact of nonstate actors. This impact will be \n     evident in three distinct areas. First, adroitly employing \n     new information technologies, non-governmental organizations \n     (NGOs) will play a growing role in defining the ways that \n     energy is produced and consumed. Second, terrorist groups, \n     with access to the same technologies, will be in a position \n     to inflict great operational damage on increasingly complex \n     energy infrastructures. Third, radical activists will be in a \n     position to disrupt operational infrastructure through \n     cyberterrorism.\n       Conflict and power politics. The potential for armed \n     conflict in energy-producing regions will remain high. Early \n     in the twenty-first century, as a result, a weakening of U.S. \n     alliance relationships in Europe, the Persian Gulf, or Asia \n     could have major impacts on global energy security. U.S. \n     concerns over the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD) and the desire to promote democratization \n     and market liberalization around the world will also have a \n     significant effect on key energy exporters. The future \n     viability of the energy-producing states in the Caspian and \n     Central Asia will be shaped by the competing objectives or \n     interests of Russia, the United States, and adjacent regional \n     powers.\n\n                  How Might Energy Affect Geopolitics?\n\n       There are five main ways in which energy may affect \n     geopolitical outcomes:\n       Swings in energy demand. A dramatic decline in global \n     energy consumption, brought on by economic recession, could \n     trigger instability in many of the world's major energy-\n     exporting countries. Conversely, continued economic growth, \n     accompanied by rising energy demand, would place more power \n     in the hands of the exporters.\n       Swings in energy supply. Just as demand is vulnerable to \n     sharp shifts up or down, so is supply. If discovery and \n     development of new reserves and the addition of producing \n     capacities match demand growth, an acceptable balance between \n     supply and demand can be maintained. But a number of factors \n     must be satisfied if supply growth is to be encouraged, \n     including an attractive host-country investment climate and \n     the opportunity for acceptable investment returns. At the \n     same time, political events and logistical interruptions can \n     interfere with supply.\n       Competition for energy in Asia. As countries in Asia seek \n     to secure growing levels of energy imports, two geopolitical \n     risks emerge. First, historical enmities might boil over into \n     armed conflict for control of specific energy reserves in the \n     region. Second, the rising dependence of China on Persian \n     Gulf oil could well alter political relationships within and \n     outside the region. For example, China might seek to build \n     military ties with energy exporters in the Persian Gulf in \n     ways that would be of concern to the United States and its \n     allies.\n       Energy and regional integration. Energy infrastructure \n     projects may serve to strengthen bilateral economic and \n     political ties in certain instances. In Asia, for example, \n     energy networks, along with trade liberalization, could serve \n     to reduce historical tensions and place Asian economic growth \n     on a firmer footing. Similar forces might come into play in \n     Europe, linking Russia to the European Union (EU); in South \n     Asia, drawing Bangladesh and India closer together; and in \n     the Far East, linking Russia and China.\n       Energy and the environment. Environmental concerns will \n     have an increasingly important geopolitical bearing on energy \n     decisionmaking by governments, by producers, and by consumers \n     in the next decades. Should governments pursue aggressive \n     strategies for reducing carbon emissions, a new political \n     fault line could emerge between developed and developing \n     countries.\n\n\n                policy contradictions and considerations\n\n       The interplay of geopolitics and energy early in the \n     twenty-first century is at the root of an array of complex \n     policy challenges that governments around the world must now \n     confront. The three interlocking policy challenges are to \n     ensure that (1) in the long term, supplies will be adequate \n     to meet the world's energy needs; (2) in the short term, \n     those supplies are reliable and not subject to serious \n     interruptions; and (3) at all times, energy is produced and \n     consumed in environmentally acceptable ways.\n\n                          Energy Availability\n\n       U.S. policy today contains a fundamental contradiction. Oil \n     and gas exports from Iran, Iraq, and Libya--three nations \n     that have had sanctions imposed by the United States or \n     international organizations--are expected to play an \n     increasingly important role in meeting growing global demand, \n     especially to avoid increasing competition for energy with \n     and within Asia. Where the United States imposes unilateral \n     sanctions (Iran and Libya), investments will take place \n     without U.S. participation. Iraq, subjected to multilateral \n     sanctions, may be constrained from building in a timely way \n     the infrastructure necessary to meet the upward curve in \n     energy demand. If global oil demand estimated for 2020 is \n     reasonably correct and is to be satisfied, these three \n     exporters should by then be producing at their full potential \n     if other supplies have not been developed.\n       History has demonstrated that unilateral sanctions seldom \n     are successful in persuading nations to alter their behavior. \n     Multilateral sanctions provide a broader front and a greater \n     guarantee of success. Multilateral sanctions test the ability \n     and willingness of enforcing nations to hold together for the \n     duration, however, while both multilateral and unilateral \n     sanctions are viewed as targets of opportunity for the \n     entrepreneurial trader.\n       Western governments should avoid the indiscriminate use of \n     sanctions. The value of multilateral sanctions should be \n     weighed against the value of engagement and dialogue. When \n     the use of sanctions is deemed admissible in the support of \n     international interests, governments should adopt a graduated \n     approach and make every effort to ensure that the coverage of \n     the sanctions is as targeted as possible. This should include \n     a cost-benefit analysis of whether curtailing investment in, \n     or revenue from, energy production will genuinely dissuade \n     the target government from the specific behavior that \n     provoked the imposition of sanctions.\n       Despite a limited success record, sanctions will continue \n     to be used as a tool of foreign policy--as a means of \n     rejecting the conduct of a particular nation--simply because \n     there are no acceptable alternative courses of action. The \n     world will have to live with the inherent limitations of the \n     sanctions.\n       Policy consideration: Avoid the indiscriminate use of \n     sanctions. The value of multilateral sanctions should be \n     weighed against the value of engagement and dialogue. When \n     the use of sanctions is deemed admissible in the support of \n     international interests, ensure that the coverage of \n     sanctions is as targeted as possible. Unilateral sanctions \n     are not an effective policy tool.\n       A similar contradiction exists in U.S. policy toward the \n     Caspian region and Central Asia, where the United States is \n     committed to reinforcing the newly independent states but \n     where contrasting U.S. policies toward Iran, Turkey, and \n     Russia are likely to influence, rightly or wrongly, the \n     construction of commercially viable pipelines for the export \n     of Caspian oil and gas. A policy approach that ties exports \n     primarily to one pipeline route--with the goal of avoiding \n     Iran and Russia as transit states--before the political and \n     economic viability of that route is known may undercut the \n     pace of energy development in the region, to the dismay of \n     both producing states and potential transit states.\n       Oil and gas exports from the Caspian region and Central \n     Asia hold the prospect of becoming a valuable additional \n     source of energy supply. Even as the U.S. government works to \n     make feasible an East-West transportation corridor that \n     bypasses Russia and Iran, the United States should not \n     obstruct the development of alternative routes that would \n     ultimately offer exporters a diverse and economically \n     attractive set of options for transporting oil and gas to \n     foreign markets, especially those markets in Asia and the Far \n     East.\n       Policy consideration: Do not obstruct the development of \n     economic routes that would ultimately offer Caspian and \n     Central Asian exporters a diverse set of options for \n     transporting oil and gas to foreign markets.\n       Beyond these contradictions, if Western governments are to \n     ensure adequacy of supply early in the twenty-first century, \n     policies must be framed toward encouraging energy-producing \n     countries to open their energy sectors to greater foreign \n     investment. This would include provisions for the enforcement \n     of contracts, guarantees for private property, anticorruption \n     measures, and stable fiscal regimes. Increased private \n     investment must occur as early as possible in exploration and \n     production facilities and in transportation infrastructure, \n     especially in Asia, if the world's energy supplies are to \n     reach markets in sufficient quantities during the 2010-2020 \n     period.\n       Policy consideration: Encourage energy-producing countries \n     to ensure that their energy sectors attract and support \n     greater foreign investment.\n       Given the continuing importance of a small group of energy-\n     producing and -exporting countries to the future health of \n     the\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\n     global economy, it is vital that the United States and other \n     Western governments place diplomatic relations, trade \n     policies, and foreign assistance programs with each of these \n     countries at or near the top of policy priorities.\n       It is in the self-interest of the United States and other \n     Western governments to support China--rapidly emerging as a \n     major oil importer--as it diversifies its sources of and \n     forms of imported energy and encourage China to not rely \n     excessively on the Persian Gulf. China is considering \n     development of an infrastructure to support oil and gas \n     imports from Russia and Central Asia and also for transit \n     onward to other countries in the Far East. Collaborative \n     cross-national energy infrastructure projects can play an \n     important role in lessening the risks of future conflict over \n     energy resources. However, such energy linkages may not \n     always be in the best political interests of the United \n     States.\n\n                           Energy Reliability\n\n       In the early decades of the twenty-first century, because \n     burgeoning energy demand must be met largely by a small \n     number of oil and gas suppliers and because supply routes are \n     lengthening, the risk posed by supply interruptions will be \n     greater than it was at the end of the twentieth century.\n       Military conflict will remain a threat to most energy-\n     producing regions, particularly in the Middle East where \n     almost two-thirds of the world's oil resources are located. \n     In addition, domestic turmoil within the key energy-producing \n     countries constitutes another threat to reliability of energy \n     supplies. At least 10 of the 14 top oil-exporting \n     countries run the risk of domestic instability in the near \n     to middle term.\n       The United States should retain as far as possible its \n     ability to defend open access to energy supplies and \n     international sea lanes. At a time when the administration \n     faces myriad competing demands for military and peacekeeping \n     interventions, this mission should be considered a strategic \n     priority and may call for greater emphasis on, and increased \n     investment in, appropriate military capabilities.\n       Policy consideration: The United States should retain as \n     far as possible its ability to defend open access to energy \n     supplies and international sea lanes.\n       Some observers are concerned that the United States may \n     seek relief from its self-imposed responsibility as the \n     protector of the world's sea lanes, which are used for the \n     transport of fuels and are becoming more crowded. U.S. allies \n     in Europe and Asia should be prepared to shoulder a greater \n     share of the financial cost of protecting energy supply, \n     including sea-lane protection.\n       Policy consideration: U.S. allies in Europe and Asia should \n     be prepared to shoulder a greater share of the financial cost \n     of protecting energy supply, including sea-lane protection.\n       No protector comparable with the U.S. role on the high seas \n     exists for the increasingly important long-distance pipeline \n     infrastructure. At a government-to-government level, \n     international agreements to protect pipeline systems might \n     have a deterrent effect. Governments must also find ways to \n     work with the private sector to minimize the vulnerability of \n     all energy infrastructures to sabotage or terrorist attack. \n     Cyberterrorism may well pose the greatest threat during the \n     time period under review.\n       Policy consideration: Governments must find ways to work \n     with the private sector to minimize the vulnerability of \n     energy infrastructure to sabotage or terrorist attack, \n     including cyberterrorism.\n       The more feasible approach in the near to medium term to \n     mitigate the risks of gas-supply interruptions is to \n     encourage importing countries to promote diversity among \n     suppliers and delivery routes. European governments, \n     particularly in view of their high dependence on Russian gas, \n     should look closely at how security of gas supply might be \n     enhanced.\n       To meet these challenges to reliable supply, importing \n     nations must engage in contingency planning. The practice of \n     holding government-financed strategic petroleum reserves is \n     one essential method of limiting the impact of supply \n     interruptions, provided that the stocks held are truly \n     reserved for the intended purpose and not for manipulating \n     domestic prices. Governments should maintain and, where \n     appropriate, expand government-financed and -controlled \n     strategic petroleum reserves. This could include extending \n     the International Energy Agency (IEA) emergency preparedness \n     program to nonmember countries that will become major oil \n     importers and supporting the concept of regional stabilizing \n     initiatives. For the foreseeable future, however, it would \n     appear to be impractical and prohibitively expensive to \n     hold strategic natural gas reserves.\n       Policy consideration: Governments should maintain and, \n     where appropriate, expand government-financed and -controlled \n     strategic petroleum reserves, reserving their use for supply \n     interruptions.\n\n                       Energy and the Environment\n\n       Energy production and use have become linked to \n     environmental concerns. Air pollution, oil spills, and their \n     impact on habitats are among the many challenges confronting \n     government and the energy industry.\n       However, the energy industry's primary source of \n     international friction may revolve around the issue of global \n     climate change, as amply demonstrated by the contentious \n     debate over the cost and benefits of the Kyoto Protocol.\n       The United States is unlikely to ratify the Kyoto Protocol \n     in its present form. Clearly, global climate change can \n     potentially have major implications for the economies of the \n     world. Continued research and understanding of the facts are \n     imperative for progress on this issue.\n       By 2020, energy consumption by the developing countries of \n     the world is expected to exceed energy consumption by the \n     developed countries. This may hold particular implications \n     for the environment. Technologies must be made available to \n     help ensure that, for developing countries, the burning of \n     fossil fuels releases minimal pollutants. Moreover, fuel \n     choices must be broadened to include cost-competitive nuclear \n     electric power.\n       There will be no easy solutions. Clean-coal technology \n     stands beyond the economic reach of most developing \n     countries. Switching from coal to natural gas will take time \n     inasmuch as deliveries will be dependent on the availability \n     of costly long-distance natural gas pipelines and \n     liquefaction and regasification facilities for the export and \n     import of liquefied natural gas.\n       Policy consideration: Economically and environmentally \n     sound technologies must be made available to help developing \n     countries meet increasing energy demands.\n       Nuclear power is emissions free but poses its own set of \n     competing policy concerns, ranging from reactor safety to \n     waste disposal and nuclear weapons proliferation. Western \n     governments should assess the conditions under which nuclear \n     power could make a significant contribution to electricity \n     supply in the developing world by first assessing those \n     conditions under which nuclear power could make a continuing \n     contribution to their own supply.\n       Developing country decisionmakers would have to ask \n     themselves, ``Is this the most sensible answer to our power \n     problems, and is this option reasonably affordable?'' Three \n     essential criteria for a fourth-generation nuclear power \n     reactor, suitable above all for use in developing countries, \n     would have to be met.\n       Modular construction, with a generating capacity of \n     approximately 100 MW;\n       Cost competitive compared with fossil-fuel generating \n     plants; and\n       Proliferation resistant.\n       Policy consideration: Western nations should assess the \n     conditions under which nuclear power could make a significant \n     contribution to electricity generation in the developing \n     world.\n       A major challenge for the future is quite evident: how to \n     produce, transport, and burn fossil fuels in massive amounts \n     but in an environmentally friendly manner. Is that possible \n     only through technological breakthrough? Because in \n     democratic countries the regulation and deregulation process \n     can involve lengthy legislative and executive interaction and \n     a complex public vetting process, simply recommending that \n     policymakers eliminate those regulations that inhibit \n     bringing technological innovation to market is meaningless. \n     Instead, Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development (OECD) governments should expand basic research \n     leading to more efficient fuel use and to viable alternative \n     fuels. At the same time, governments should fashion \n     regulatory processes and standards that favor the market \n     success of environmentally friendly innovative energy \n     technology.\n       Countries should review the extent to which subsidies for \n     domestic energy sectors are inconsistent with their global \n     energy policies.\n       Policy consideration: OECD governments should expand basic \n     research on energy technologies; concurrently, policymakers \n     should eliminate those environmental regulations that inhibit \n     bringing technological innovation to market. All governments \n     should review the extent to which domestic energy subsidies \n     are inconsistent with global energy policies.\n\n\n                        THREE BROAD CONCLUSIONS\n\n       Three broad conclusions can be drawn from this analysis of \n     geopolitics of energy into the twenty-first century.\n       The United States, as the world's only superpower, must \n     accept its special responsibilities for preserving worldwide \n     energy supply.\n       Developing an adequate and reliable energy supply to \n     realize the promise of a globalized twenty-first century will \n     require significant investments, and they must be made \n     immediately.\n       Decisionmakers face the special challenge of balancing the \n     objectives of economic growth with concerns about the \n     environment. This challenge has multiple parts: finding ways \n     to increase security and reliability of supply; ensuring \n     greater transparency in energy commerce; and strengthening \n     the role of international institutions in matters of energy \n     and the environment.\n       One of the ironies at the turn of the century is that, in \n     an age when the pace of technological change is almost \n     overwhelming, the world will remain dependent, during 2000-\n     2020 at least, essentially on the same sources of energy--\n     fossil fuels--that prevailed in the twentieth century. \n     Political risks attendant to energy availability are not \n     expected to abate, and the challenge for policymakers is \n     how to manage these risks.\n\n                              What's New?\n\n       The influence of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) on \n     public and private energy-\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\n     related policy decisions is perceived to be expanding.\n       Projected energy consumption in developing countries will \n     begin to exceed that of developed countries, a change that \n     will carry political, economic, and environmental \n     considerations.\n       The spread of information technology and use of the \n     Internet dramatically change the way business is conducted, \n     and this change carries with it a new set of vulnerabilities.\n       The prospects of cyberterrorist attacks on energy \n     infrastructure are very real; such attacks may be the \n     greatest threat to supply during the years under review.\n       Global warming is attracting growing attention, and that \n     attention will likely shape debate on future energy policies; \n     it is hoped that debate will reflect sound science and \n     factual analysis.\n\n                           Security of Supply\n\n       If U.S. military power is committed to a limited but \n     extended protection effort in Northeast Asia, the capacity to \n     respond to a crisis like that of 1990 in the Persian Gulf \n     will be severely limited. The United States will need to \n     rebalance its security relations.\n\n                         Policy Contradictions\n\n       The greater need for oil in the future is at odds with \n     current sanctions on oil exporters Libya, Iraq, and Iran.\n       The United States deals with energy policy in domestic \n     terms, not international terms; U.S. energy policy is \n     therefore at odds with globalization.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 1 p.m. shall be under the control of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have 5 minutes remaining in our time; \nis that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the chairman of the Energy Committee, the Senator \nfrom Alaska, for the work he has done on the energy problem. Clearly, \nwe have one; there is no question. The question is, How do we best \nresolve it?\n  We are in desperate need of a national energy policy. We have not had \none for a number of years. We need to have some direction with respect \nto domestic production--how much we want to let ourselves become \ndependent on OPEC and other such issues. It seems there are a number of \nissues about which the chairman has talked.\n  We need to talk about diversity. We have all kinds of things we can \ngo on: We can go on oil, on gas, on coal--which is one of our largest \nreserves. We need to make it more clean. Of course, we can do that. We \ncan take another look at nuclear, look again at our storage problems. \nIt is one of the cleanest sources we have. Hydro needs to be maintained \nand perhaps improved. We need to go to renewables, where we can use \nwind and sunlight and some of the other natural sources.\n  I will always remember listening to someone back in Casper, WY, a \nnumber of years ago, saying we have never run out of a source of fuel; \nwhat we have done is found something that worked a little better. So we \nneed to continue research to find ways to do that.\n  We need to have access to public lands. That doesn't mean for a \nminute we are not going to take care of those public lands and preserve \nthe resources and the environment. But we can do both. We have done \nthat in Wyoming for a number of years. We have been very active in \nenergy production, and at the same time we have been able to preserve \nthe lands. That is not the choice, either preserve it or ruin it. That \nis not the choice we have.\n  We also need to do some more research on clean coal, one of our best \nenergy sources.\n  I was just in Wyoming talking to some folks who indicated we need to \nfind ways to get easements and move energy. If it is in the form of \nelectricity, it has to be moved by wholesale transmission. We need a \nnationwide grid to do that, particularly if we are going to deregulate \nthe transmission and the generation side, which we are planning to do.\n  We have to have gas pipelines. California has become the great \nexample. They wanted to have more power. Their demand increased and \nproduction went down. Then they said: We will deregulate. So they \nderegulated the wholesale cost and put a cap on resale cost. Those \nthings clearly don't work.\n  We have to have some incentives to produce--tax incentives, probably, \nfor low-production wells.\n  We need to eliminate the boom-and-bust factor so small towns are not \nliving high one day and in debt the next.\n  Finally, we need to take a look at conservation, of course. You and I \nneed to decide how we can use less of that energy and still maintain \nour kind of economy and way of life.\n  I again thank the chairman of the Energy Committee for all he is \ndoing and urge him to continue so we can set the right direction for \nthis country in order to have the energy we need and save our national \nresources as well. I am persuaded we can do both.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2433-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, S. 27 is discharged \nfrom the Committee on Rules and Administration, and the clerk will \nreport the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 27) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the time \nbetween 1 and 3:15 p.m. today be equally divided for debate only \nbetween the chairman and ranking member. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that at 3:15 today I be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I will \nnot object--that would not in any way preclude Members from coming down \nfor opening statements. We want to make sure everyone can make their \nopening statements. I know there are a lot of Members who would like to \nmake opening statements on the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I believe that is what the time is \nfor. I concur with the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There may be more than 2 hours, and Members may come down \nafterwards since some Members are coming back late this afternoon. I \nwould like to make that clear.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I urge Members who have opening statements to make on this bill \nto come to the floor between now and 3:15. Obviously, later in the day \nduring consideration of amendments Members can make whatever statements \nthey wish. But to have some coherency to the remarks, this would be the \nappropriate time to do so. We urge Members to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I am \nwondering if anyone knows that there is going to be a vote this \nafternoon. That was talked about last week.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that there was \na plan to have a vote at 6:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to any of the requests? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we are in business for opening \nstatements, if anyone would like to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield 30 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I say to my distinguished colleague, \nmy statement would be 5 minutes long.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As always, I defer to my commander on this, the senior \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend, Senator Feingold, for \nhis partnership and for his friendship.\n  Today we begin the first open Senate debate in many years on whether \nor\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\nnot we should substantially reform our campaign finance laws. I want to \nthank Senators Lott and Daschle for their commitment to allowing a fair \nand open debate, and for their assurance that the Senate will be \nallowed to exercise its will on this matter and vote on the legislation \nthat emerges at the end of the amendment process.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, may I ask my friend to yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am into my statement. After 5 minutes, I will be \nprivileged to do so.\n  Madam President, I want to thank as well, Senator McConnell, our \nsteadfast and all-too-capable opponent, who honestly and bravely \ndefends his beliefs, for agreeing to the terms of this debate, a debate \nthat we hope may settle many of the questions, held by advocates and \nopponents of reform, that have yet to be resolved by this body.\n  I, of course, want to thank from the bottom of my heart, all the co-\nsponsors of this legislation for their steadfast support, and for \nproving to be far more able and persuasive advocates of our cause than \nI have had the skill to be.\n  Most particularly, I want to thank my partner in this long endeavor, \nSenator Russ Feingold, a man of rare courage and decency, who has \nrisked his own career and ambitions for the sake of his principles. To \nme, Madam President, that seem a pretty good definition of patriotism.\n  I want to thank the President of the United States for engaging in \nthis debate, and for his oft stated willingness to seek a fair \nresolution of our differences on this issue for the purpose of \nproviding the people we serve greater confidence in the integrity of \ntheir public institutions. Too often, as this debate approached, our \ndifferences on this issue have been viewed as an extension of our \nformer rivalry. I regret that very much. For he is not my rival. He is \nmy President, and he retains my confidence that the country we love \nwill be a better place because of his leadership.\n  Lastly, I wish to thank every Member of the Senate--especially \nSenator Hagel, my friend yesterday, my friend today, my friend \ntomorrow--for their cooperation in allowing this debate to occur so \nearly in what will surely be one of the busier congressional sessions \nin recent memory. I thank all my colleagues for their patience, a \npatience that has been tried by my own numerous faults far too often, \nas I beg their indulgence again. Please accept my assurance that no \nmatter our various differences on this issue, and my own failings in \narguing those differences, my purpose is limited solely to enacting \nthose reforms that we believe are necessary to defend the government's \npublic trust, and not to seek a personal advantage at any colleague's \nexpense.\n  I sincerely hope that our debate, contentious though it will be, will \nalso be free of acrimony and rancor, and that the quality of our \ndeliberations will impress the public as evidence of the good faith \nthat sustains our resolve.\n  The many sponsors of this legislation have but one purpose: to enact \nfair, bipartisan campaign finance reform that seeks no special \nadvantage for one party or another, but that helps change the public's \nwidespread belief that politicians have no greater purpose than our own \nreelection. And to that end, we will respond disproportionately to the \nneeds of those interests that can best finance our ambition, even if \nthose interests conflict with the public interest and with the \ngoverning philosophy we once sought office to advance.\n\n  The sad truth is that most Americans do believe that we conspire to \nhold onto every single political advantage we have, lest we jeopardize \nour incumbency by a single lost vote. Most Americans believe that we \nwould let this Nation pay any price, bear any burden for the sake of \nsecuring our own ambitions, no matter how injurious the effect might be \nto the national interest. And who can blame them? As long as the \nwealthiest Americans and richest organized interests can make the six \nand seven figure donations to political parties and gain the special \naccess to power that such generosity confers on the donor, most \nAmericans will dismiss the most virtuous politician's claim of \npatriotism.\n  The opponents of reform will ask if the public so distrusts us and so \ndislikes our current campaign finance system why is there no great cry \nin the country to throw us all out of office? they will contend--and \nthis point is disputable--that no one has ever lost or won an election \nbecause of their opposition to or support for campaign finance reform. \nYet public opinion polls consistently show that the vast majorities of \nour constituents want reform, and believe our current system of \ncampaign financing is terribly harmful to the public good. But, the \nopponents observe, they do not rank reform among the national \npriorities they expect their Government to urgently address. That is \ntrue, but why is it so?\n  Simply put, they don't believe it will ever be done. They don't \nexpect us to adopt real reforms and they defensively keep their hopes \nfrom being raised and their inevitable disappointment from being worse.\n  The public just doesn't believe that either an incumbent opposing \nreform or a challenger supporting it will honestly work to repair this \nsystem once he or she has been elected under the rules, or lack \nthereof, that govern it. They distrust both. They believe that whether \nwe publicly advocate or oppose reform, we are all working either openly \nor deceitfully to prevent even the slightest repair of a system they \nbelieve is corrupt.\n  So they avoid investing too much hope in the possibility that we \ncould surprise them. And they accommodate their disappointment by \nbasing their pride in their country on their own patriotism and that of \ntheir neighbors, on the civilization that they have built and defended, \nand not on the hope that politicians will ever take courage from our \nconvictions and not our campaign treasuries.\n  Our former colleague, Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, recently \nreminded me of a poll that Time magazine has conducted over many years. \nIn 1961, 76 percent of Americans said yes to the question, ``Do you \ntrust your government to do the right thing?'' This year, only 19 \npercent of Americans still believe that. Many events have occurred in \nthe last 30 years to fuel their distrust. Assassinations, Vietnam, \nWatergate, and many subsequent public scandals have squandered the \npublic's faith in us, and have led more and more Americans from even \ntaking responsibility for our election. But surely frequent campaign \nfinance scandals and their real or assumed connection to misfeasance by \npublic officials are a major part of the problem.\n  Why should they not be? Any voter with a healthy understanding of the \nflaws of human nature and who notices the vast amounts of money \nsolicited and received by politicians cannot help but believe that we \nare unduly influenced by our benefactors' generosity.\n  Why can't we all agree to this very simple, very obvious truth: that \ncampaign contributions from a single source that run into the hundreds \nof thousands or millions of dollars are not healthy to a democracy? Is \nthat not self-evident? Is it to the people, Madam President. It is to \nthe people.\n  Some will argue that there isn't too much money in politics. They \nwill argue there is not enough. They will argue that soft money, the \nhuge, unregulated revenue stream into political party coffers, is \nnecessary to ensure the strength of the two-party system. I find this \nlast point hard to understand considering that in the 15 years or so \nthat soft money has become the dominant force in our elections the \nparties have grown appreciably weaker as independents become the fast \ngrowing voter registration group in the country.\n  Some will observe that we spend more money to advertise toothpaste \nand yogurt in this country than to conduct campaigns for public office. \nI don't care, Madam President. I am not concerned with the costs of \ntoothpaste and yogurt. We aren't selling those commodities to the \npublic. We are offering our integrity and our principles, and the means \nwe use to market them should not cause the consumer to doubt the value \nof the product.\n  Some will argue that the first amendment of the Constitution renders \nunlawful any restrictions on the right of anyone to raise unlimited \namounts of money for political campaigns. Which drafter of the \nConstitution believed or anticipated that the first amendment would be \nexercised in political campaigns by the relatively few at the expense \nof the many?\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\n  We have restrictions now that have been upheld by the courts; they \nhave simply been circumvented by the rather recent exploitation of the \nso-called soft money loophole. Teddy Roosevelt signed a law banning \ncorporate contributions. Harry Truman signed a law banning \ncontributions from labor unions. In 1974, we enacted a law to limit \ncontributions from individuals and political action committees directly \nto the candidates. Those laws were not found unconstitutional and \nvacated by the courts. They were judged lawful for the purpose of \npreventing political corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n  Those laws were rendered ineffectual not unlawful by the ingenuity of \npoliticians determined to get around them who used an allowance in the \nlaw that placed no restrictions on what once was intended essentially \nto be a building fund for the State parties. That fund has run to the \nbillions of dollars, and I haven't noticed the buildings that serve as \nour local and State party headquarters becoming quite that magnificent.\n  Ah, say the opponents, if politicians will always find a way of \ncircumventing campaign finance laws, what is the point of passing new \nlaws? Do I believe that any law will prove effective over time? No, I \ndo not. Were we to pass this legislation today, I am sure that at some \ntime in the future, hopefully many years from now, we will need to \naddress some new circumvention. So what. So we have to debate this \nmatter again. Is that such a burden on us or our successors that we \nshould simply be indifferent to the abundant evidence of at least the \nappearance of corruption and to the public's ever growing alienation \nfrom the Government of this great Nation, problems that this system has \nengendered? I hope not, Madam President. I hope not.\n  The supporters of this legislation have had differences about what \nconstitutes the ideal reform, but we have subordinated those \ndifferences to the common good, in the hope that we might enact those \nbasic reforms that Members of both parties could agree on. It is not \nperfect reform. There is no perfect reform. It could be improved, and \nwe hope it will be during this debate. We have tried to exclude any \nprovision that could be viewed as placing one party or the other at a \ndisadvantage. Our intention is to pass the best, most balanced, most \nimportant reforms we can. All we ask of our colleagues is that they \napproach this debate with the same purpose in mind.\n  I beg my colleagues not to propose amendments intended only to kill \nthis legislation or to seize on any change in this legislation that \nserves our basic goal as an excuse to withdraw your support. The \nsponsors want to have votes on all relevant issues involved in campaign \nfinance reform and will support amendments that strengthen the \nbipartisan majority in favor of reform and that do not prevent us from \nachieving our fundamental goal of substantially reducing the influence \nof big money on our political system.\n  If we cannot agree on every aspect of reform; if we have differences \nabout what constitutes genuine and necessary reform, and we hold those \ndifferences honestly--so be it. Let us try to come to terms with those \ndifferences fairly. That is what the sponsors of this legislation have \ntried to do, and we welcome anyone's help to improve upon our efforts \nas long as that help is sincere and intended to reach the common goal \nof genuine campaign finance reform.\n\n  I hope we will, for the moment, forget our partisan imperatives and \ntake a risk for our country. Perhaps that is a hopelessly naive \naspiration. It need not be. I think the good men and women I am \nprivileged to serve with are perfectly capable of surprising a \nskeptical public, and maybe ourselves, by taking on this challenge to \nthe honor of the profession of which we are willing and proud members.\n  Real campaign finance reform will not cure all public cynicism about \nmodern politics. Nor will it completely free politics from influence \npeddling or the appearance of it. But I believe it will cause many \nAmericans who are at present quite disaffected from the machinations of \npolitics to begin to see that their elected officials value their \nreputations more than their incumbency. And maybe that recognition will \ncause them to exercise their franchise more faithfully, to identify \nmore closely with political parties, to raise their expectations for \nthe work we do. Maybe it will even encourage more of them to seek \npublic office, not for the privileges bestowed upon election winners, \nbut for the honor of serving a great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, how much time remains of the original \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty minutes remain under the original \nrequest.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Wisconsin, I believe, yielded time to the \nSenator from Arizona. Of the 30 minutes that were yielded to the \nSenator from Wisconsin, 15 minutes remain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield my time to the Senator from Connecticut and \nthen ask if I could speak after him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, today the Senate begins debate on a \ndefining issue in American politics--the question of whether unlimited, \nunregulated contributions to political campaigns are forwarding \ndemocracy or undermining it.\n  In this Senator's mind, the answer to that question is quite clear: \nno democracy can thrive--if indeed survive--if it is awash in massive \nquantities of money:\n  Money that threatens to drown out the voice of the average voter of \naverage means; money that creates the appearance that a wealthy few \nhave a disproportionate say over public policy; and money that places \nextensive demands on the time of candidates--time that they and the \nvoters believe is better spent discussing and debating the issues of \nthe day.\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation before the Senate today is a good \nfirst start toward reform of a campaign system that is broken, plain \nand simple. I, for one, would like to have public financing of our \nFederal Campaigns. I would like to see free or reduced-rate TV and \nradio time for candidates during the peak of the campaign season. I \nwould like for any negative ad to display the face and voice of the \ncandidate on whose behalf that ad is aired.\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation is not as comprehensive as some of us \nwould prefer. But it does address two of the most pressing deficiencies \nin our system of campaign finance: Undisclosed soft money \ncontributions, and sham issue ads.\n  I have consistently supported this legislation. Today I call on my \ncolleagues, and President Bush, to work with us to restore \naccountability to our system of campaign finance and confidence in our \nsystem of representative democracy.\n  Let me be absolutely clear on one essential point. Unlike previous \ndebates, this time we have an opportunity to pass meaningful campaign \nfinance reform.\n  We can reclaim our system of financing campaigns by cutting off the \nflow of unregulated and unlimited soft-money. We must end it, and not \njust mend it.\n  Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I feel \nstrongly about the need for reform, and I am frustrated at this body's \ncontinued inability to move forward with legislation to address this \nproblem.\n  Time and again we have seen thoughtful, appropriate and, I must \nemphasize, bipartisan efforts to stop the spiraling money chase that \nafflicts our political system, only to see a minority of the Senate \nblock further consideration of the issue.\n  It is almost as if the opponents of reform are heeding the humorous \nadvice of Mark Twain, who once said, ``Do not put off until tomorrow \nwhat you can put off until the day after tomorrow.''\n  It is now long past the day after tomorrow, and we simply cannot \nafford to wait any longer to do something about the tidal wave of money \nthat is drowning our system of government and eroding the public's \nconfidence in the integrity of our democracy.\n  With that said, I strongly support S. 27, known as the McCain-\nFeingold legislation. Why do I support it? Because it is ``real'' \nreform, not ``sham'' reform. And I congratulate my two colleagues for \ntheir persistence and tenacity in pursuing it.\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\n  This bill accomplishes critically important goals. It closes the most \nserious loopholes in our current campaign finance system. The bill \nshuts down the system of unlimited, unregulated, and undisclosed soft \nmoney; bans direct or indirect contributions from foreign nationals; \nrequires disclosure of electioneering communications mas- querading as \nissue ads; and prohibits fund-raising by Federal officials on Federal \nproperty.\n  There are those of my colleagues who would argue that when it comes \nto political campaigns, money is speech and speech should be unlimited.\n  Let me be clear--I cannot agree more that political speech should be \nunlimited. The free flow of information and ideas is the hallmark of a \ndemocracy. But to equate speech with money is not only a false \nequation, it is also a dangerous one to our democracy.\n  When that speech and those ideas are paid for overwhelmingly by a few \nwealthy individuals or groups or foreign nationals or anonymous groups \nor by undisclosed contributors, the speech is neither free nor \ndemocratic. It is encumbered by the unknown special interests who have \npaid for it. And it minimizes or excludes the speech of those who lack \nsubstantial resources to counter it.\n  This special interest speech--paid for with unlimited, undisclosed \nsoft money--creates, at a minimum, the appearance of undue influence, \nif not an implied quid pro quo by the contributor.\n  Does anyone seriously believe that corporations and associations \ncontribute millions of dollars in soft money just because they are good \ncitizens and want to encourage free speech? Let us be serious.\n  It cannot be argued that such special interest soft money \ncontributions were made to promote political speech and better public \npolicy without any expectation of consideration in return.\n  That expectation of special consideration, or an unspoken quid pro \nquo, is the very appearance of undue influence that the Supreme Court \nhas repeatedly upheld as a compelling reason for limiting campaign \ncontributions.\n  Unlimited contributions simply do not equate to free speech. Although \nthe final statistics on the total amount of money contributed in the \n2000 election cycle is not yet complete, we do know the overall \nestimate for expenditures on federal elections in the 1999-2000 \nelection cycle is between $2.4 and $2.5 billion. That is a conservative \ntotal.\n  Let me put that in perspective for my colleagues. The average \nexpenditures necessary for a winning Senate candidate increased from \n$609,000 in 1976 to over $7 million in the 1999-2000 election cycle. At \nthat amount, the average Senate candidate would have to raise the \nequivalent of $3,000 per day, seven days a week, for the entire six-\nyear Senate term.\n  It is past time to restore sanity, and accountability, to our system \nof financing elections.\n  I welcome this debate and look forward to amendments offered to both \nimprove the McCain-Feingold legislation and restore the integrity of \nthe manner in which we finance elections.\n  This debate is one of the most significant and important ones we will \nhave, not only in this session of Congress but at any time in recent \nmemory. I welcome the debate and look forward to the arguments.\n  How much time have we consumed of that 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I will withhold my time. Does the Senator want 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 43 minutes of time.\n  Mr. DODD. I yielded 30 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin and \nyielded time to the Senator from Arizona. I am told the Senator from \nArizona used about 15 minutes of that. I presumed----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will yield back my time to the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in 1986 I was elected to the Senate. I can \nremember during the last week or 2, maybe 3 weeks of that campaign, I \nwoke up one morning to learn that all over the State of Nevada there \nwere signs placed by my opponent--4-by-8 signs. I thought, how foolish \nfor him to be spending these dollars on this--money for signs. It had \nto cost tens of thousands of dollars to put those signs all over \nNevada.\n  Little did I realize this was the beginning, from my perspective, of \nthe loosening of campaign laws, because I learned that if you looked at \nthese signs, they were paid for by the State Republican Party--\nthousands and thousands of dollars spent by the State Republican Party \nwhich benefited my opponent. Had my opponent had to pay for those out \nof the money he raised, he could not have afforded it.\n  I filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, and many \nmonths later they were saying it was OK. That was confirmed sometime \nlater by the U.S. Supreme Court, saying there is, in effect, unlimited \nmoney that can be spent by State parties.\n  As we know, these issue advocacy ads all over the country have become \npart of the way it is done in America today. That is how campaigns are \nrun.\n  The State of Nevada then was a very small State, with about a million \npeople. I got up on the Senate floor in 1987 and talked about what \nhappened to me and how this must not take place in the future. I could \nnot believe we would not change the law, and we have not changed the \nlaw. It has gotten worse every year. I have been through two reelection \ncycles, and it has gotten worse. In 1998, Nevada was a State with fewer \nthan 2 million people--about a million and a half people. In that race, \nmy good friend John Ensign and I spent over $20 million--$4 million \nwith our campaign money and $6 million issue advocacy ads by the State \nRepublican Party and the Republican Party--a State as small as Nevada, \n$20 million. And that doesn't count the independent expenditures that \nwere made.\n\n  In Nevada, probably $23 million was spent in the race between Senator \nReid and Senator Ensign. Neither spent more money than the other. We \nboth spent a lot of money. The independent expenditures were run \nagainst John Ensign and were run against me.\n  I say to my friend from Wisconsin, I am depending on him to try to \nwork through all this. I think I understand the law, what is being \ndone. He has been a master at this. I admire and appreciate very much \nwhat he has done. I have said to my staff and to my friends, it can't \nbe any worse than what it is now. We need to change the law. How in the \nworld can you spend in the State of Nevada more than $23 million? \nPeople don't like to acknowledge it, but, of course, we are involved in \nraising the soft money, going to people and asking them for these huge \namounts of money.\n  So I commend and applaud my friend from Wisconsin. I admire his \ntenacity, his courage, and I admire his ability to persevere through \nbig obstacles. But also he should recognize that we as Democrats have \nstuck with him through thick and thin. I was here when Senator Byrd--I \nthink we hold the record for attempts to invoke cloture: seven times on \ncampaign finance. When Senator Byrd was leader, he tried to do that. I \nalso say I am glad to see some Republicans coming aboard now. \nPreviously, it was basically Senator McCain alone on campaign finance \nreform; now there are others.\n  I know there is a lot of talk about, do we really need campaign \nfinance reform. I want this record to pronounce to everyone within the \nsound of my voice, things cannot be worse than what they are now. We \nneed to get back to the way it used to be, where you had to raise money \nfrom individuals and they would give you money unsolicited. This \npresent system is not working, in my opinion, and it should be changed.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes of \nthe original 30.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, in the beginning, when nobody jumped \nfor the ball, I was happy to commence my talk. But it is music to my \nears to hear leaders such as Senators Dodd and Reid come out here in \nthe beginning of the debate and talk about the importance of this \nissue. They have been with us every step of the way.\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\n  As Senator Reid has indicated, I am extremely grateful for the kind \nof support we have had. This is when we need it, more than any other \ntime. This is a great way to begin. I will give my longer statement \nlater. It is better to get into the process.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I commend Russ Feingold and John McCain. \nThis has been a long battle, going back years now. Nobody is claiming \nperfection. We are sailing into uncharted waters when we engage in the \nreform of a campaign financing system, but I underscore what Senator \nReid of Nevada has said: A system that has over $23 million spent to \nwin the votes of a State with a million and a half people is a system \ntotally out of control.\n  These two Senators have taken the lead. I think America appreciates \nwhat they are trying to do. Our fervent hope is that before this debate \nconcludes, either later this week or at the end of next week, this \nbody, for the first time in more than a quarter century, will have \nsubstantially reformed a political process--not made it perfect. We \nshould not hold that out as a possibility, but we can certainly make it \nbetter than it presently is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I assure my colleagues on the other \nside of this debate that we are not going to be too restrictive about \ntime. There are more speakers on the other side, which is often the \ncase in this debate. I want to make sure Senator Hagel gets the time he \nneeds. I will take the time I need. Unless someone else in our general \norbit here on this subject comes, we will try to accommodate people on \nthe other side. I know Senator Cochran is looking for an opportunity to \nspeak. I hope we can accommodate him out of my time.\n  Having said that, Madam President, how much does the Senator from \nNebraska desire?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, the Senate is about to engage in an open \nand full debate on campaign finance reform. It is time for this debate.\n  My friends, John McCain and Russ Feingold, deserve much credit for \ngetting the Senate to this point. They have been passionate in their \nefforts to reform the system. If the Senate passes a campaign finance \nreform bill--and I believe we can--it will be largely due to their \nefforts and leadership.\n  We have an opportunity to achieve something relevant and meaningful. \nMy hope, my goal, for the outcome of these 2 weeks is to get a \nbipartisan bill approved by the Senate that brings reform to the \nsystem, is constitutional, and that President Bush will sign.\n  Whatever we do, we must look to expand, not constrict, opportunities \nfor people to participate in our democratic process.\n  We must be careful not to abridge the rights of Americans to \nparticipate in our political system and have their voices heard. \nPolitical parties, individuals, and organizations that represent \nmillions of Americans all have rights guaranteed by the first amendment \nto the Constitution. These rights guarantee that they can express \nthemselves politically and participate in the electoral process.\n  Democracy is messy. We are going to hear a number of examples of how \nmessy and unfair democracy is over the next 2 weeks. Our system is \nimperfect, but our Government works because of the rights of all people \nto participate in this democracy. We should take steps to encourage \ngreater participation in the process. We should expand the ability of \nthe American people to get involved. We must not weaken political \nparties or other important political institutions of our system.\n  Over the next 2 weeks, we will need to guard against taking actions \nthat will have unintended consequences. The answer to reforming our \nsystem is not to shut people out or diminish the abilities of our \ninstitutions and individuals to participate in the process.\n  We must also guard against impugning each other's motives on the \nfloor of the Senate. No Senator has the high moral ground over any \nother Senator. There are and will be differences on campaign finance \nreform. Let us debate these differences without assigning sinister \nmotives to our opponents. The Nation and the world will be peeking in \nthrough their television windows to witness this Senate debate. Will \nthey see dignity, respect for others' opinions, honest discourse, and \nelevated debate? I believe so. Our country deserves it, and we owe it \nto our fellow citizens.\n  This is a historic moment for the Senate to rise above the shrill \npolitical rhetoric of our time. How do we best change our campaign \nfinance system? For me, the core of campaign finance reform must begin \nwith accountability, openness, and disclosure. These are the essential \ncomponents of reform.\n  I start from a fundamental premise that the problem in the system is \nnot the political party; the problem is not the candidate's campaign; \nthe problem is the unaccountable, unlimited outside moneys and \ninfluence that flows into the system where there is either little or no \ndisclosure. That is the core of the issue we will debate beginning \ntoday.\n  The political parties are and have been a vital component for our \nsystem, especially for a challenger to take on a well-financed, \nentrenched incumbent. Who else is there to support that challenger, be \nthat challenger a Democrat or a Republican, unless the challenger is \nself-financed? It is the party who activates the base and gets out the \nvote and helps give that challenger a forum to get his or her message \nout. That is good. That is helpful. That is important to democracy.\n  Political parties encourage participation. They promote \nparticipation. They are about participation. They educate the public. \nThey ensure the viability of all in the system. Their activities are \nopen, accountable, and disclosed.\n  Have there been abuses? Oh, yes, there have been abuses. By the way, \nabuses in the political system did not just begin with so-called soft \nmoney or non-Federal money. It is instructive for all of America to go \nback into the mid-1800s and look at some of the Harper's Weekly \nmagazines.\n  Ask yourself the question: Is our political system cleaner today, is \nit more open today, is it more honest today than it was in the 1800s, \nearly 1900s? Oh, yes, it is; absolutely it is. So there must be some \nframe of reference that we come from with an educated debate on \ncampaign finance reform.\n\n  Any reform that weakens the parties will weaken the system. It will \nlead to a less accountable system. It will lead to a system less \nresponsive to and accessible by the American people.\n  Why do we want to ban soft money to political parties, that funding \nwhich is now accountable and reportable? This ban would weaken the \nparties and put more money and control in the hands of wealthy \nindividuals and independent groups who are accountable to no one.\n  If any one of us in America wishes to find out who is running a \ntelevision or a radio spot for a candidate or against a candidate, you \ncannot now find that information. Why is that? Because it is not \ndisclosable. I know that is difficult for many in this country to \nbelieve but that is the case.\n  When you take power away from one group, it will expand power for \nanother group. I do not believe, as well, that our problems lie with \ncandidates for public office and their campaigns. Their campaigns are \nfully open to the public. All dollars raised and expended are \ndisclosed. The voters can hold them responsible and should and must \nhold candidates accountable.\n  Have we had bad players in the system? Do we have bad players now in \nthe system? The American public will make that judgment.\n  Recent years have been ripe with accounts of those who dance on the \npin head of technicality and who skirt the law because there is no \ncontrolling legal authority, but I do not know how you legislate \nethical behavior. Of course, if it was just a matter of laws and \nregulations, then we would have no crime in America. Why? Because we \nhave laws against murder, we have laws against robbery, we have laws \nagainst everything. If it was that simple--just pass another law--the \nworld would be just fine.\n  We cannot allow our outrage at the morally questionable actions of a \nfew lead us to tamp down the system so tightly that we shut out the \ninvolvement of the overwhelming majority. What sense does that make?\n  The more money that is pushed outside the reportable system of \ncandidates and political parties, the less\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\ncontrol candidates will have over their own campaigns. Voters can hold \ncandidates responsible for their conduct. They cannot hold outside \ngroups and wealthy individuals accountable.\n  I believe the greatest threat to our political system today is those \nwho operate outside the bounds of openness and accountability, not \nthose who operate inside the bounds of accountability and reportability \nand disclosure.\n  In recent years, we have seen an explosion of multimillion-dollar \nadvertising buys by outside organizations. These groups and wealthy \nindividuals come into an election, spend unlimited sums of money, and \nleave without anyone knowing who they are or how much they spent or \nwhy. They can have a major impact on the outcome of any election--any \nelection--especially in small States.\n  Do they have a right to participate? Of course they have a right to \nparticipate, but their actions must be disclosed.\n  In the fall of 1999, I introduced a bipartisan bill to reform our \ncampaign finance system. I reintroduced that legislation this year with \nseveral Democratic and Republican colleagues. I am pleased to report \nthat more and more of my colleagues have come on as cosponsors to this \nlegislation in the last couple of days.\n  The components of our legislation will genuinely improve the way \nFederal campaigns are financed. We increase disclosure requirements for \ncandidates, parties, independent groups, and individuals. The current \nsystem provides no disclosure for the activities of outside groups or \nindividuals. We ensure that the name of the individual, the \norganization, its officers, addresses, phone numbers, and the amount of \nmoney spent are all made public immediately.\n\n  Our legislation limits soft money contributions to political parties \nto $60,000 per year. That is far below the unlimited millions--\nunlimited millions--that are now pouring into the system with no \naccountability, no disclosure. This is a significant limit.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that two-thirds of all the \nsoft money contributions in the last election cycle came from those who \ngave more than the $120,000 limit for a 2-year cycle, which is part of \nour bill. Two-thirds of the soft money contributors in the last cycle \nwould have been subject to this cap. I say to those who question the \ncap, whether it is relevant, important, or whether it does anything, I \nthink the Wall Street Journal numbers address that issue. We limit soft \nmoney but do not ban it so political parties are not disadvantaged by \nwealthy individuals and independent organizations. This is particularly \nimportant because it is at the State level of our politics, State party \norganizations that have the responsibility of getting out the vote, of \norganizing the vote, the registration drives, the grassroots \nparticipation. In the process, that very vitality is the core of \nrepresentative government. Why cut that off, that accountable \ndisclosure of money, to make the system more a part of every citizen's \nopportunity to participate?\n  As originally provided for in the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n1974, soft money, non-Federal money, in fact, can be used by political \nparties for various activities over the course of an electoral process. \nI hear some talk that this is a new phenomenon. If this is new, why, \nsince 1974, has the Federal Election Commission had 7 pages of \nregulations as to how to use soft money? It isn't new. These are \nlegitimate, worthy, and important functions of the political parties \nand should not be inhibited by a total ban on soft money. I do believe \nwe need to tighten the definition on the uses of soft money. This \nshould be part of any reform bill we pass, and we can do that and \nshould.\n  Today's hard money contribution limits are worth less than one-third \nof their value when the 1974 act was passed. This funding goes directly \nto candidates' campaigns and political parties and is the most \naccountable method of political financing. Every dollar contributed, \nevery dollar spent, is fully reported to the Federal Election \nCommission. Everybody knows who is making that contribution. The \nindividual limit of $1,000 in 1974 equates to $3,300 today. Our bill \nraises this limit to $3,000 and indexes it for inflation. By doing \nthis, we ensure individuals have the same ability to participate as \nthey were granted in the groundbreaking 1974 legislation.\n  Furthermore, we believe our campaign finance reform proposals would \nall pass constitutional muster. This is a legitimate concern--whether, \nin fact, we pass a bill that will withstand appropriate constitutional \nscrutiny and protect the rights of the first amendment.\n  I believe the constitutional issues are as critical as any we will \ndebate over the next 2 weeks. The Constitution is the foundational \ndocument of our Nation. The rights guaranteed within that document \ncannot be dismissed because of political expediency, regardless of how \nnoble the motive of the reform effort. Our system is imperfect. \nRepresentative government is imperfect, but certainly we can expect a \nhigher standard from our political leaders than we have seen in the \npast. Personal accountability is the core of political accountability.\n  Congress has a genuine opportunity to work with President Bush to \nachieve real reform. The President supports campaign finance reform. I \nlook forward to working with all my colleagues during this debate to \nget a constitutional, bipartisan campaign finance reform bill passed, \none that the President will sign, that will genuinely reform our \nsystem. That would be an achievement of which we all would be proud.\n  Mr. M4cConnell. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Kentucky \ncontrols 43 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for \noutlining the alternative he will be offering some time during the \ncourse of this debate. There is no question this is a constitutional \namendment. There is no question the changes it seeks to achieve are \nconstitutional. It is very thoughtful. I congratulate him for his fine \nstatement.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Arizona. We are all in the business \nof looking at public opinion. We know the American people are \ninterested in the energy crisis; they are interested in education; they \nare interested in tax relief. They are not particularly interested in \ncampaign finance reform. I have often said it ranks with static cling \nas one of the great concerns among the American people. Through the \nsheer tenacity of the senior Senator from Arizona, we are here today \nbeginning a debate over the next 2 weeks on a subject of very little \ninterest to the American people. I give him credit for his tenacity and \naggressiveness in pushing this item forward on the floor of the Senate \nearly in this new administration.\n  I like the tone of the discussion I have heard so far. I have noticed \nthere hasn't been any discussion about corruption. We had that \ndiscussion a year and a half ago and there has not been a single bit of \nproof offered. I like the restraint I sense in the Chamber today. \nHopefully we will not have any unsubstantiated charges of corruption. \nHopefully any Senator who makes such a charge will prove it. The \nabsence of unsubstantiated charges of corruption, it seems to me, is \nalso a step in the right direction in having a civil debate, and \nlowering our voices and pursuing this discussion in the way the \nPresident would like for us to pursue it with lower voices and in a \ncivil manner.\n  The self-styled and media-pronounced reformers are captives of a \nCatch-22 that is titled ``campaign finance reform.'' By the way, my \nfavorite definition of ``special interest'' is a group against what I \nam trying to do. I love those groups that are for what I am trying to \ndo. That is a group of outstanding Americans trying to achieve a \nworthwhile purpose. To truly achieve their professed goals, reduction \nof special interests means foreclosing all opportunities for \nparticipation in politics. Some of our Democratic allies have actually \ndone that. I remember 10 years or so ago when we thought the Japanese \nhad done everything right. We were afraid they were buying up all of \nthe American property and there was a great fear that the Japanese \nsomehow had gotten the better of us in world competition. In Japan, \nthey have been concerned about the influence of money and politics and \nthey have squeezed it all the way out. In Japan,\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nwhere they are unimpeded, unfettered by anything such as the First \nAmendment we have, the Japanese Government limits the number of days \nyou can campaign, the number of speeches you can give, the types of \nplaces you can speak, the number of handbills and bumper stickers you \ncan print, and the number of megaphones you can buy--one. Each \ncandidate is entitled to one megaphone.\n\n  This was passed in order to deal with money in politics. They wanted \nto get it all out of politics, and they have. In the desire to get \nmoney out of politics, it was designed to improve the image of the \npoliticians and the Parliament, so they squeezed all the money out of \npolitics, got them down to one megaphone per candidate, and ``no \nconfidence'' in the legislators has risen to 70 percent and voter \nturnout has continued to decline.\n  That is just one example. There are others of our democratic allies \naround the world who have been into this issue much further than we \nhave gone, at least so far, and they have all had the same results: \nSqueeze the money out of politics, quiet all the voices, the cynicism \ncontinues to rise, the turnout continues to go down; and the reason for \nthat of course is that cynicism and turnout are not related to this \nissue at all; they are related to whether or not there is a belief that \nthe legislators are tackling the real challenges confronting the \ncountry.\n  The original recipe of McCain-Feingold, back in 1995 and 1997, tried \nto do a lot of what I have just described they have done in Japan: It \nhad candidate spending limits; it had a ban on PACs--eliminate them; it \nhad a bundling ban; it had a party soft money ban and an all-\nencompassing restriction on citizens groups who engaged in issue \nadvocacy and independent expenditures. In other words, the entire \nuniverse of political participation--with, of course, the glaring \nexception of the media, where political activism is conveniently carved \nout of the existing campaign finance law under which we operate today, \nas well as on page 15 of the current McCain-Feingold bill. The media we \nalways sort of carve out of these restrictions because the presumption, \nI guess, is they have a greater right to the First Amendment than any \nof us.\n  In 1997, McCain-Feingold sponsors capitulated on the crown jewel of \ncampaign reformers, and that was spending limits on campaigns \nthemselves. Thus, those of us who approached this issue as the Supreme \nCourt does, from a constitutional perspective, considered that a battle \nwon. Candidate spending limits were gone. It was the belief--certainly \nmy belief--that members of my party would be strenuously disadvantaged \nby spending limits, so we were happy they were gone. But prior to that, \nwe had been told time and time again there could be no reform without \nspending limits. But candidate spending limits are gone. I am glad \nabout that, and we consider that a victory.\n  Since that time, those advocating reform have been in retreat in one \nform or another. Having first waved the white flag on these previously \nnonnegotiable candidate spending limits, we stand here today with a \nvery different kind of bill and, I must say, a brighter outlook than 8 \nyears ago at the outset of the last big floor engagement, when we had \nlots and lots of amendments.\n  Eight years ago, campaign spending limits were on the verge of \nenactment and would have extinguished any chance of sustained success \nof my party in congressional elections. We Republicans have to spend \nmillions every election just to get a fair shake and counter the \nliberal bias so prevalent in the news and entertainment media.\n\n  So candidate spending limits mercifully are off the table. That means \nour direct campaigns are not on the hook, and we rejoice in that.\n  The PAC and bundling bans were jettisoned from McCain-Feingold as \nwell, and I must say I am happy about that. I don't think there is \nanything wrong with people banding together in order to pool their \nresources and support candidates of their choice. That is as \nconstitutional as apple pie and ought not to be restricted.\n  A few months later, in 1998, the citizens group restrictions were \naltered and a new--and, I would argue, also unconstitutional--bright \nline was drawn by the Snowe-Jeffords provision where an \nunconstitutionally vague line had been in the original McCain-Feingold. \nBut that did not get anywhere either, inviting vehement opposition from \ncitizens groups who would be affected, and disdained and ridiculed by \nconstitutional experts who would litigate if it were ever enacted, such \nrestrictions already having been struck down in Federal court over 20 \ntimes.\n  Let me just take a moment on this. None of us really likes the degree \nto which outside groups get involved in our campaigns. We don't like \nit. We would like to control these campaigns. But under the First \nAmendment, the campaign is not ours to control, and be it ever so \nirritating when some group who hates us comes in and starts talking \nabout us in proximity to an election, that doesn't mean we can \nlegislate it out of existence through our votes in this Chamber.\n  It irritates us, but there are a lot of things you have to endure in \npublic life, from media criticism to outside issue groups who irritate \nus. But just because it irritates us doesn't mean there is any \nconstitutional basis for eliminating it. In fact, the courts over 20 \ntimes since Buckley--over 20 times since Buckley--have struck down \nvarious efforts by State and local governments to hamper, inhibit, make \nit more difficult for outside groups to criticize us in proximity to an \nelection. So the chances of that being upheld are slim to none.\n  In 1999, McCain-Feingold was peeled back even further, and the last \nvote we had on this issue provided only two features: A party soft \nmoney ban and what we would have to charitably call a bogus Beck \nprovision which actually eviscerates current worker protections rather \nthan codifies them as the McCain-Feingold subtitle purports.\n  So the last time we had a vote on this issue in the Senate, a cloture \nvote, was on a party soft money ban only, with a bogus Beck provision. \nWhat we have before us now is a beefed-up McCain-Feingold, again with \nthe party soft money ban plus various efforts to restrict the voices of \noutside groups.\n  One of the issues we are going to be dealing with here in the course \nof the debate is the so-called nonseverability clause. It is in the \nPresident's statement of principles. Why is it there? It is there \nbecause we have an obligation not to pass laws that are clearly \nunconstitutional.\n  I hear that some of the proponents of this year's version of McCain-\nFeingold oppose a nonseverability clause, and I really find that \nmystifying. If they are so confident that the bill is constitutional, \nwhat is wrong with a nonseverability clause to guarantee that the bill \neither rises or falls together? They should have had a nonseverability \nclause back in 1974. What happened then was legislation passed that had \nspending limits for campaigns and contribution limits for individuals. \nThe spending limits got struck down, the contribution limits got \nupheld, were not indexed, and we have today a situation in which we are \nleft with $1,000 contribution limits set at a time when a Mustang cost \n$2,700 and candidates, particularly in big States, who were not \nfortunate enough to be wealthy, have to spend--well, there is not \nenough time. There is not enough time. If you are running in California \nand you do not have the advantage of being already well known or \nextraordinarily rich, 2 years is not long enough to pool together \nenough resources at $1,000 a contributor to be competitive.\n  One of the single biggest problems we have is the failure to index \nthe hard money contribution limit back in the 1970s. Why do you think \nparties are relying more on soft money? Because there isn't enough hard \nmoney. Nobody capped the cost of the media at the 1974 level. I hear \nthat we may have an amendment to deal with the question of availability \nof media. I think that is a good idea. I look forward to taking a look \nat the details of it.\n  We ought to be dealing with the real problem here. The real problem \nis not that there is too much money in politics; there is too little \nmoney in politics--particularly hard money--all of which is limited and \ndisclosed and it is given directly to parties and candidates to \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. Yet nobody on \nthe so-called ``reform side'' is trying to deal with the single biggest \nproblem that we have. I hope during the course of this debate that \nproblem will be taken care of.\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\n  The only way to get at the core of this problem, if Senators believe \nthe influence of money and politics is so pernicious, is to change the \nFirst Amendment.\n  You have to go right to the core of the problem. The junior Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Fritz Hollings, will offer that amendment at \nsome point as he has periodically over the years. He deserves a lot of \ncredit for understanding the nub of the problem. The nub of the problem \nis you can't do most of these things as long as the First Amendment \nremains as it is.\n  So Senator Hollings, at some point, I think under the consent \nagreement, will probably at the end of the debate offer a \nconstitutional amendment so the Federal and all 50 State governments \ncan have the unfettered latitude to regulate, restrict, and even \nprohibit any expenditures ``by, in support of, or in opposition to a \ncandidate for public office.'' It would carve and etch out of the First \nAmendment, for the first time since the founding of our country and the \npassage of the Bill of Rights, giving to the government at the Federal \nand State level the ability to control political speech in this \ncountry. It is worth noting that would also apply to the media.\n  One of the world's largest defense contractors, such as General \nElectric, could even be prohibited from owning America's No. 1 \ntelevision station such as NBC, and a news anchor, such as Tom Brokaw, \ncould even be prohibited from mentioning a candidate's name within 60 \ndays of an election. This is a serious proposal. This will be offered \nonce again on the floor of the Senate.\n  Barring such a wholesale repeal of constitutional freedom, a lot of \nwhat we are going to be doing in the next 2 weeks will probably fall \nwell short of the constitutional mark. But I hope that Senators will \ntake their responsibilities seriously and not just vote for anything, \nhoping the courts will at some point save us from ourselves.\n  A good deal of this is not in question. Virtually the exact language \nof the so-called Snowe-Jeffords language designed to make it more \ndifficult for outside groups to criticize any of us in proximity to an \nelection has been struck down within the last year and a half.\n  That is pretty clear evidence that this particular language is not \nconstitutional.\n  As we go through these amendments, if they are clearly Federal court \ncases on point, I hope Members of the Senate will not ignore that. We \nswore to uphold the Constitution. I know sometimes it is hard to figure \nout what that means in the context of a given vote. But on some of \nthese issues, it is not that unclear. There will be a decision on \npoint.\n\n  I want to make another point about non-Federal money.\n  Senator Hagel was talking about his proposal to cap but not \ncompletely eliminate non-Federal money. I do not know what I think \nabout that. But I think it is important to get the record straight \nabout non-Federal money.\n  The average soft money contribution to the Republican Senatorial \nCommittee last cycle was $520. That is less than one-tenth of 1 percent \nof the money that the Republican Senatorial Committee raised.\n  If you look at the Republican National Committee and the Republican \nSenatorial Committee, the largest contribution either of us got during \nthe course of the year was $250,000. Admittedly, that is a very large \ncontribution, but any one of those $250,000 contributions would have \nrepresented less than one-half of 1 percent of the total money raised \nby either the Republican Senatorial Committee or the Republican \nNational Committee.\n  You can make a case, as Senator Hagel has made and will make again \nwhen he offers his substitute, that it ought to be capped. But I think \nyou can't make a case that it ought to be eliminated. Why should the \nRepublican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee have \nto finance their efforts on behalf of mayoral candidates in Omaha, NE, \nwith Federal dollars? This is a Federal system. Under McCain-Feingold, \nthe Republican Governors' Association would be obliterated, eliminated, \ngone; the Democratic Governors' Association, gone. Why? Because they \ndon't operate with Federal money.\n  We have national political parties. We already have a scarcity of \nFederal hard dollars even to do the job for our Federal candidates. And \nunder this proposal with that same sort of finite source of Federal \nhard dollars, the great national party committees would have to operate \non behalf of Federal candidates and everybody else out of the same pool \nof resources. Regretfully, the bill does not take the money out of \npolitics. It takes the parties out of politics. In what way is that a \nstep in the right direction?\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post had a big article that included soft \nmoney contributions to the national political parties. It was pretty \nsignificant--the suggestion being that if we pass McCain-Feingold that \nmoney wouldn't be spent.\n  It would be spent all right. It just wouldn't be given to the \nparties.\n  Each of those interests who care about what we are doing here, who \nbelieve that it may have an impact on their business or their interest, \ncannot be constitutionally restricted from speaking. Maybe some court \nsomewhere would let us completely federalize the national parties and \ncompletely eliminate their ability to operate in State and local races \nwith Federal dollars. Maybe some court would let us do that. But no \nFederal court in America is going to let us quiet the voices of all \nthese interests that have a perfect right to go out and engage in issue \nadvocacy up to and including the day of the election. There isn't any \nserious person who knows anything about the First Amendment who \nbelieves that we could do that.\n  The proposal before us is designed to inhibit the ability of the \npolitical parties and would have no impact whatsoever on outside \ngroups, nor should it.\n  They are entitled in this free society to have their say.\n  Mr. President, I have a series of newspaper editorials and columns \nfrom columnist George Will that I want to have printed in the Record. \nHe has been particularly active in writing about this subject. I ask \nunanimous consent to have them all printed seriatim in the Record. I \nwill add to the record in the next few days additional articles on this \nsubject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Mar. 19, 2001]\n\n                        James Madison Remembered\n\n\n  madisonian doctrine today has its opposite--call it mc cainism, an \n                         antipluralist populism\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       There is no monument to James Madison in Washington, There \n     is a tall, austere monument to the tall (6'2''), austere man \n     for whom the city is named, a man of Roman virtues and \n     eloquent reticence. There is a Greek-revival memorial to \n     Madison's boon companion, the tall (6'2'') elegant, eloquent \n     Jefferson, who is to subsequent generations the most \n     charismatic of the Founders. But there is no monument to the \n     smallest (5'4\") but subtlest of the Founders, without whose \n     mind Jefferson's Declaration and Washington's generalship \n     could not have resulted in this republic.\n       So this Friday, as an insufficiently grateful nation gives \n     scant notice to the 250th anniversary of Madison's birth, \n     pause to consider what he wrought, such as the Constitution, \n     and the first 10 amendments, called the Bill of Rights. \n     Pretty good work, that, but not more impressive than \n     Madison's thinking that was the Constitution's necessary \n     precursor. He became the Father of the Constitution only \n     because he was the founder of modern democratic thought.\n       Before Madison produced his revolution in democratic \n     theory, there had been a pessimistic consensus among \n     political philosophers: If democracy were to be possible, it \n     would be only in small societies akin to Pericles' Athens or \n     Rousseau's Geneva--``face to face'' societies sufficiently \n     small and homogeneous to avoid the supposed threats to \n     freedom--``factions.'' In turning this notion upside down--\n     that is what a revolution does--Madison taught the world a \n     new catechism of popular government:\n       What is the worst result of politics? Tyranny. To what form \n     of tyranny is democracy prey? Tyranny of the majority. How \n     can that be avoided? By preventing the existence of \n     majorities that are homogenous, and therefore stable, durable \n     and potentially tyrannical. How can that be prevented? By \n     cultivating factions, so that majorities will be unstable and \n     short-lived coalitions of minorities. Cultivation of factions \n     is a function of an ``extensive'' republic.\n       Which brings us to what can be called Madison's sociology \n     of freedom, explained in his contributions to the most \n     penetrating and influential newspaper columns ever penned--\n     the Federalist Papers, to which Alexander Hamilton and John \n     Jay also contributed.\n       In Federalist 10 Madison wrote that ``the extent'' of the \n     nation would help provide ``a\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\n     republican remedy for the diseases most incident to \n     republican government.'' He said: ``Extend the sphere, and \n     you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you \n     make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have \n     a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens.'' \n     Because ``the most common and durable source of factions'' is \n     ``the various and unequal distribution of property,'' the \n     ``first object of government'' is ``protection of different \n     and unequal faculties of acquiring property.''\n       The maelstrom of interestedness that is characteristic of \n     Madisonian democracy often is not a pretty spectacle. \n     However, Madison knew better than to judge politics by \n     esthetic standards. He saw reality steadily and saw it whole, \n     and in Federalist 51 he said people could trace ``through the \n     whole system of human affairs'' the ``policy of supplying by \n     opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives.''\n       Madison's 250th birthday comes at a melancholy moment. A \n     banal and middle-headed populism--call it McCainism--is \n     fueling an assault this month on Madison's First Amendment \n     freedoms of speech and association. In the name of political \n     hygiene, advocates of ``campaign-finance reform'' are waging \n     war against the Madisonian pluralism of American politics.\n       Madisonian doctrine considers factions inevitable and \n     potentially healthy and useful. McCainism stigmatizes \n     factions as ``special interests'' whose rights to associate \n     and speak politically for their interests should be strictly \n     limited and closely regulated by government. Madison's First \n     Amendment says, ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \n     the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people . . . \n     to petition the government for a redress of grievances.'' \n     McCainism advocates speech rationing by the multiplication of \n     government-imposed limits on the right of individuals and \n     groups to spend money for the dissemination of political \n     speech.\n       McCainism says money ``taints'' politics. Madisonian theory \n     asks: What would politics consist of if it were ``untainted'' \n     by the vigorous, unfettered participation of factions on \n     whose interests government impinges? McCainism aims to crimp \n     the activities of political parties by banning contributions \n     of ``soft money'' (used for party building, not for \n     particular candidates' campaigns or for expressly advocating \n     the election of defeat of specific candidates).\n       The Founders did not anticipate the necessity of political \n     parties. However, Madison quickly came to think that parties \n     could moderate factions by channeling and disciplining them. \n     Campaign-finance reformers are always unpleasantly surprised \n     by the unintended consequences of their reforms. Were they to \n     succeed in banning soft money, they would be startled by an \n     utterly predictable result of the hydraulics of political \n     money: Money banned from the parties would flow instead to \n     other--often wilder--factions.\n       Then the reformers, who cannot see a freedom without \n     calling it a ``loophole'' that needs closing, would try to \n     extend government regulation of political speech to the \n     speech of those factions. Madison, wise about the untidiness \n     of freedom, would respond by reminding the reformers of his \n     reform--the First Amendment.\n       Madison undertook the thankless task of explaining the \n     implications for democracy of the unflattering fact that men \n     are not angels, and posterity has not thanked him with the \n     sort of adulation bestowed upon Jefferson. However, in 1981 \n     the Library of Congress, which began with Jefferson's \n     donation of his library, needed a new building and named it \n     after the most supple intellect among the Founders--the James \n     Madison Memorial Building. Perhaps that would suffice as a \n     monument to Madison. Or maybe his monument is our \n     constitutional government, which proves the possibility of \n     liberty under law in an extensive--a continental--republic.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2001]\n\n                         . . . Let Us Hope Not\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Disquieting rumors persist that some of President Bush's \n     advisers are eager to sign a campaign finance ``reform'' \n     bill, or at least to avoid vetoing one. Bush should beware of \n     what Edmund Burke called ``the irresistible operation of \n     feeble councils.''\n       And he should be aware of the Colorado case argued before \n     the Supreme Court last Wednesday. If the court affirms the \n     judgment of two lower courts in that case, the McCain-\n     Feingold bill is patently unconstitutional.\n       Although a plain statement of the salient fact seems \n     preposterous, the unvarnished truth is that McCain-Feingold's \n     premise is: There is something inherently corrupt about the \n     relationship between political parties and their candidates. \n     Thus the bill would ban ``soft money'' contributions to \n     parties--unregulated money that can be spent for party-\n     building, voter turnout, issue advocacy and other purposes, \n     but not to ``directly influence'' the election of candidates \n     for federal offices.\n       Last week, a quarter of a century after the Buckley v. \n     Valeo ruling, which struck down much of the 1974 campaign \n     finance law, the court for the first time heard arguments \n     about whether it is constitutional for the government to \n     limit a party's direct expenditures--``hard dollars''--for \n     its candidates. In Buckley, the court held that limits on \n     political money--contributions and expenditures--implicate \n     ``the most fundamental First Amendment activities,'' and \n     therefore government bears a heavy burden of demonstrating a \n     compelling need to limit those activities. The only such \n     justification the court considers sufficient is the need to \n     prevent corruption or the appearance thereof.\n       Well. In 1986 the Colorado Republic Party ran ads \n     criticizing a Democratic congressman who was considering \n     running for the Senate. It did this before the Republican \n     Senate candidate had been chosen. Nevertheless, the Federal \n     Election Commission charged that this expenditure violated \n     federal limits on party expenditures for candidates. Ten \n     years later the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the FEC, \n     saying the ads were ``independent expenditures'' and thus not \n     subject to the ``hard dollar'' limits.\n       The Supreme Court remanded the case for the lower courts to \n     consider whether those ``hard dollar'' limits themselves are \n     constitutional at all. In response, the district court and \n     the 10th Circuit have both said they are not. Last Wednesday \n     the FEC asked the Supreme Court to say they are. But how can \n     it without saying preposterously, that there is a substantial \n     risk of parties corrupting their own candidates by supporting \n     them?\n       As the district court said on remand: ``The FEC seeks to \n     broaden the definition of corruption to the point that it \n     intersects with the very framework of representative \n     government.''\n       The FEC is a bureaucracy. Bureaucracies have a metabolic \n     urge to maximize their missions. The FEC's mission is to \n     regulate political discourse. A president's primary mission, \n     stated in his oath of office, is different--to defend the \n     Constitution. Bush understands the conflict between his duty \n     and the FEC's urge.\n       Around 7 a.m., Jan. 23, 2000, the day before the Iowa \n     caucuses, candidate Bush was in Des Moines preparing to \n     appear on ABC's ``This Week.'' One of those who was to \n     question him (this columnist), not wanting to ambush him with \n     unfamiliar material, and wanting from him a considered \n     judgment, took the unusual step of telling Bush he would be \n     asked if he agreed with a particular proposition from an \n     opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas. The proposition, \n     given to Bush on a 3-by-5 card, was:\n       ``There is no constitutionally significant distinction \n     between campaign contributions and expenditures. Both forms \n     of speech are central to the First Amendment.''\n       Asked if he agreed that there is something ``inherently \n     hostile to the First Amendment'' in limiting participation in \n     politics by means of contributions by individuals (Bush \n     favors banning ``collective speech'' by corporations, or by \n     unions without members' prior written consent), he briskly \n     replied: ``I agree.'' And asked if he thinks a president has \n     a duty to make an independent judgment about the \n     constitutionality of bills and to veto those he considers \n     unconstitutional, he replied: ``I do.''\n       This puts Bush on a collision course with much of the \n     political class and most of the media. It may become the \n     first disruption of his serene relations with them, but there \n     eventually must be a first, and the stake--the First \n     Amendment--is worth a fight.\n       Bush has served himself and the country well by his \n     congeniality efforts, but he will serve neither by continuing \n     them until it costs him respect. It will cost him that if he \n     signs McCain-Feingold.\n       Genius, said Bismarck, involves knowing when to stop. He \n     had in mind waging war, but the same is true of waging \n     niceness.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 8, 2001]\n\n                    Second Thoughts About soft Money\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       In ``Murder in the Cathedral,'' T.S. Eliot, a better poet \n     than moral philosopher, has a character say,\n       The last temptation is the greatest treason:\n       To do the right thing for the wrong reason.\n       Actually, in Washington it is good enough when people do \n     the right thing for any reason. So it is gratifying, if not \n     notably noble, that some Democrats, having recalibrated their \n     self-interest in the light of last year's elections, are \n     rethinking their enthusiasm for eviscerating the First \n     Amendment in the name of campaign finance reform.\n       Prior to the last election cycle, they favored banning \n     ``soft'' money--the money contributed to political parties \n     for uses other than for particular federal candidates, and \n     not used expressly to advocate the election or defeat of a \n     candidate. However, having done well in the 1999-2000 soft-\n     money sweepstakes, and lagging behind Republicans in hard \n     dollars--conditions to political parties that are limited but \n     can be spent for particular candidates--Democrats are having \n     second thoughts.\n       Those Democrats whose controlling principle is the pursuit \n     of short-term party advantage will have third thoughts if \n     convinced that their party's success at raising soft money \n     was contingent on control of the presidency. But some Bush \n     advisers may begin favoring a ban on soft money if many \n     Democrats become wary of a ban. Tactical considerations \n     always dominate when the political class writes laws limiting \n     communication about--and competition against--itself.\n       In 1897 Nebraska, Tennessee, Missouri and Florida banned \n     corporate contributions because, in the 1896 presidential \n     race, such contributions helped William McKinley defeat the \n     man who carried those states, William\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\n     Jennings Bryan. In 1974 Congress enacted spending limits \n     (declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1976) for \n     House races of $75,000 (about $200,000 in today's dollars), \n     far below what challengers must spend to threaten an \n     incumbent. The Senate limits, also declared unconstitutional, \n     would have protected incumbents. The limits started at a base \n     of $250,000 and varied with a state's population, and \n     included not just the candidate's direct spending but any \n     spending ``relative to a clearly identified candidate.''\n       Arguments for more regulation of political speech are \n     fueled by hyperbole about supposed ``torrents'' of money \n     pouring into politics. Such hyperbole probably has been heard \n     ever since George Washington, at age 25, first ran for the \n     Virginia House of Burgesses in 1757, spending 39 pounds for \n     160 gallons of rum and other beverages for the 391 eligible \n     voters--more than a quart of drink, at a cost of (in today's \n     currency) $2, per voter.\n       However, since the Voting Rights Act (1965) and the 26th \n     Amendment (1971) greatly expanded the electorate, spending \n     per eligible voter in congressional races, in today's \n     dollars, has hovered in a range from approximately $2.50 to \n     $3.50 per eligible voter, inching up slightly in the highly \n     competitive elections of 1994 and 1996 and reaching \n     approximately $4 in the competitive elections of 1998--a bit \n     more than the cost of one video rental.\n       If spending in the two-year 1999-2000 cycle for all \n     candidates for all offices--federal, state and local--reached \n     the ``obscene'' (as critics call it) total of $3 billion, \n     that was $15 per eligible voter, And $3 billion--$2 billion \n     less than Americans spend annually on Halloween snacks--is \n     five-one-hundredths of one percent of GDP.\n       So writes Bradley Smith in ``Unfree Speech: The Folly of \n     Campaign Finance Reform'' (Princeton University Press), which \n     surely will be this year's most important book on governance, \n     Smith, now serving on the Federal Election Commission, warns \n     that if reformers succeed in getting the First Amendment \n     thought of as a mere ``loophole'' in a comprehensive regime \n     of speech rationing, they will have legitimized perpetual \n     tinkering with the regulation of political speech for \n     partisan advantage after every election cycle has been \n     analyzed.\n       It is arguable whether, or how much, the First Amendment \n     should protect obscenity, pornography, this or that \n     ``expressive activity'' (e.g., topless dancing, flag \n     burning), ``fighting words'' or commercial speech. However, \n     no serious person disputes that the amendment's core concerns \n     is political speech. And the Supreme Court says, \n     incontrovertibly, that in modern society, political speech \n     depends on political spending.\n       As to whether limits on political spending abridge freedom \n     of political speech, consider the Supreme Court's analogy: \n     Would the constitutional right to travel be abridged if \n     government limited everyone to spending only enough for one \n     tank of gasoline? Or would the First Amendment right of free \n     exercise of religion be abridged if government limited the \n     right to spend money for church construction or for \n     proselytizing?\n       The First Amendment--freedom--is the right reason for \n     opposing ``reforms'' designed to regulate, and diminish, \n     political discourse. But if only tactical considerations can \n     cause Democrats to do the right thing, the wrong reason will \n     be welcome.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 11, 2001]\n\n                     Fending Off the Speech Police\n\n                          [By George F. Will)\n\n       The coming debate on campaign fiance ``reforms'' that would \n     vastly expand government regulation of political \n     communication will measure just how much jeopardy the First \n     Amendment, and hence political freedom, faces. Recent \n     evidence is ominous.\n       In 1997, 38 senators voted to amend the First Amendment to \n     empower government to impose ``reasonable'' restrictions on \n     political speech. Dick Gephardt has said, ``What we have is \n     two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech \n     and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy \n     democracy.'' Bill Bradley has proposed suppressing issue \n     advocacy ads of independent groups by imposing a 100 percent \n     tax on such ads. John McCain has said he wishes he could \n     constitutionally ban negative ads--ads critical of \n     politicians.\n       The basis of political-speech regulation is the 1971 \n     Federal Election Campaign Act. Bradley Smith, a member of the \n     Federal Election Commission and author of ``Unfree Speech: \n     The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform,'' calls the act ``one \n     of the most radical laws ever passed in the United States.'' \n     Because of it, for the first time Americans were required to \n     register with the government before spending money to \n     disseminate criticism of its officeholders.\n       Liberals eager for more regulation of political speech \n     should note the pedigree of their project. The act's first \n     enforcement action came in 1972, when some citizens organized \n     as the National Committee for Impeachment paid $17,850 to run \n     a New York Times ad criticizing President Nixon. His Justice \n     Department got a court to enjoin the committee from further \n     spending to disseminate its beliefs. Justice said the \n     committee had not properly registered with the government and \n     the committee's activities might ``affect'' the 1972 \n     election, so it was barred from spending more than $1,000 to \n     communicate its opinions. After the expense of reaching a \n     federal appellate court, the committee defeated the FEC, but \n     only because the committee had not engaged in ``express \n     advocacy'' by explicitly urging people to vote for or against \n     a specific candidate.\n       In 1976 some citizens formed the Central Long Island Tax \n     Reform Immediately Committee, which spent $135 to distribute \n     the voting record of a congressman who displeased them. Two \n     years later this dissemination of truthful information \n     brought a suit from the Federal Election Commission's speech \n     police, who said the committee's speech was illegal because \n     the committee had not fulfilled all the registering and \n     reporting the campaign act requires of those who engage in \n     independent expenditure supporting or opposing a candidate. \n     The committee won in a federal appellate court, but only \n     because it had not engaged in ``express advocacy.''\n       In 1998, with impeachment approaching, Leo Smith, a \n     Connecticut voter, designed a Web site urging support for \n     Clinton and defeat of Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) When the \n     campaign of Johnson's opponent contacted Smith, worried that \n     his site put him and their campaign in violation of the act, \n     he sought a commission advisory opinion.\n       Although Smith neither received nor expended money to \n     create this particular Web site, the Commission said the \n     law's definition of a political expenditure includes a gift \n     of ``something of value,'' and the commission noted that his \n     site was ``administered and maintained'' by his personal \n     computer, which cost money. And that the ``domain named Web \n     site'' was registered in 1996 for $100 for two years and for \n     $35 a year thereafter. And ``costs associated with the \n     creation and maintaining'' of the site are considered an \n     expenditure because the site uses the words that bring on the \n     speech police--it ``expressly advocates'' the election of one \n     candidate and the defeat of another.\n       The commission advised Smith that if his site really was \n     independent, he would be ``required to file reports with the \n     commission if the total value of your expenditures exceeds \n     $250 during 1998.'' If his activity were not truly \n     independent, his ``expenditures'' would have to be reported \n     as an in-kind contribution to Johnson's opponent. Smith \n     ignored the commission, which, perhaps too busy policing \n     speech elsewhere, let him get away with free speech.\n       Today Internet pornography is protected from regulation, \n     but not Internet political speech. And campaign finance \n     ``reformers' aspire to much, much more regulation because, \n     they say, there is ``too much money in politics.''\n       Actually, too much money that could fund political \n     discourse is spent on complying with the act's speech \n     regulations. To cover compliance costs, the Bush and Gore \n     campaigns combined raised more than $15 million. And Bradley \n     Smith notes that because of the law's ambiguities and the \n     commission's vast discretion, litigation has become a \n     campaign weapon: Candidates file charges to embarrass \n     opponents and force them to expend resources fending off the \n     speech policy.

Will)\n\n       With this week's beginning of Senate debate on campaign \n     finance reform, we will reach the most pivotal moment in the \n     history of American freedom since the civil rights revolution \n     3\\1/2\\ decades ago. The debate concerns John McCain's plan to \n     broaden government limitations on political spending in order \n     to intensify government supervision of political speech, \n     which depends on that spending.\n       McCain's attempt to expand government abridgement of the \n     First Amendment's core concern comes in the context of \n     rapidly multiplying rationales for vitiating First Amendment \n     protection of political speech. In recent years law school \n     journals have featured many professors' theories about why \n     the amendment--``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \n     the freedom of speech''--should not be read as a limit on \n     government. Rather, they argue, the amendment empowers--\n     indeed, in today's world it requires--government to regulate, \n     limit and even ``enhance`' political speech.\n       Consider a symptomatic new book, ``Republic.com,'' by \n     University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein, whose \n     ingenuity deserves better employment. He vigorously attacks a \n     nonexistent problem, to which he proposes a solution that is \n     only, but very, useful as an illustration of the hostility \n     that a portion of the professoriate has toward the plain text \n     of the First Amendment.\n       The supposed problem that Sunstein wants government to \n     address is a maldistribution of information and opinion. He \n     begins with a truism, that a heterogeneous society needs the \n     glue of a certain level of common experiences. Then he \n     postulates a problem. It is that the very richness of today's \n     information and opinion environment--the Internet, cable, \n     etc.--allows people to design a personalized menu of \n     communications, deciding what they want to encounter and what \n     they want to filter out of ``a communications universe of \n     their own choosing.''\n       Sunstein says unplanned, unanticipated, even--perhaps \n     especially--unwanted encounters are ``central to democracy.'' \n     They help us understand one another and prevent social \n     fragmentation and the extremism that ferments in closed \n     cohorts of the like-minded hearing only ``louder echoes of \n     their own voices.'' Sunstein worries especially that the \n     Internet, by bestowing on individuals the\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n     power to customize what they encounter, enables people to \n     bypass ``general interest intermediaries'' such as newspapers \n     and magazines.\n       Not so long ago, intellectuals worried that mass media \n     where homogenizing American culture into uniform blandness. \n     Now Sunstein worries about new technologies allowing people \n     to ``wall themselves off'' from differences of opinion, \n     forming isolated enclaves.\n       What makes Sunstein's book pertinent to campaign finance \n     reformers' current assaults on the First Amendment is not the \n     plausibility of his diagnosis--who in cacophonous \n     contemporary America feels insufficiently exposed to \n     differences? But note the audacity of his prescription. He \n     would have government use various measures--from ``must \n     carry'' requirements for broadcasters to mandatory links \n     connecting Web sites to others promoting different views--to \n     manage ``the scarce commodity'' of the public's attention. \n     Government, he thinks, should actively ``promote exposure to \n     materials that people would not have chosen in advance.''\n       Now, never mind the many practical problems implicit in \n     Sunstein's theory, such as how government will decide which \n     views are insufficiently noticed, and how government will \n     ``trigger'' (Sunstein's word) public interest in them. But \n     mind this:\n       Sunstein is an ardent campaign finance reformer for the \n     same reason he recommends government management of the \n     information system. He thinks the First Amendment mandates \n     this. He does not read the amendments as a ``shall not'' \n     stipulation that proscribes government interference with \n     individual rights. Rather, he reads it as a mandate for \n     active government management of the public's ``attention.''\n       To Sunstein, and to many similar academic advocates of \n     speech-management through campaign finance reform, what is \n     important about the First Amendment is not its text but the \n     ``values'' they say the amendment represents. They say those \n     values--vigorous debate; deliberative democracy; political \n     heterodoxy--require that the amendment's text be ignored as \n     an anachronism that modern life (the Internet, the costs of \n     campaigning in the age of broadcasting, etc.) has rendered \n     inimical to the amendment's values.\n       Politicians who, in the name of campaign finance reform, \n     favor increased government supervision of political \n     communication are not motivated by such recondite reasoning. \n     They simply want to tilt the system even more toward the \n     protection of incumbents, or of their ideological interests, \n     or of their ability to control their campaigns by controlling \n     the ability of others to intervene in the political \n     discourse.\n       However, campaign finance reformers depend on academic \n     theories about why it is acceptable to act as though the \n     First Amendment does not mean what it says.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just wrap it up for the time being by imagining \nfor a moment the world envisioned by this legislation before us. That \nis a world where political parties are attacked by their own, beaten \ndown, stripped of their constitutional rights, and ultimately left as \nshells of their former selves.\n  In his book ``The Party's Just Begun,'' University of Virginia \npolitical science professor Larry Sabato writes a section entitled ``A \nWorld Without Parties'' where he imagines a world with weak and feeble \nparties. The national parties today are stronger than they have ever \nbeen in my lifetime. They may have been stronger in the previous \ncentury--the 19th century--but they are now stronger than they have \never been and more useful for services provided to candidates up and \ndown the Federal scale than ever. What would life be like without a \nstrong two-party system? Surely even the parties' severest critics \nwould agree that our politics would be poorer from any further \nweakening of the party system. We have only to look at who and what \ngains as parties decline in influence. The first big gainers: Special \ninterest groups and PACs. Their money, labels, and organizational power \ncan serve as a substitute for parties. Yet instead of fealty to \nnational interest or a broad coalition party platform, the candidate's \nloyalties would be pledged to narrow special interest agendas.\n  Bear in mind what he is talking about here.\n  When a PAC contributes to a party, that money then becomes part of \nthe broad party appeal. But a PAC, operating only on its own, has a \nvery narrow concern. Who else gains? Wealthy candidates and celebrity \ncandidates gain. Their financial resources or their fame can provide \nname identification or, for that matter, simply replace party \naffiliation as a voting cue. Already, at least a third of the Senate \nseats are filled by millionaires. And the number of inexperienced but \nsuccessful candidates drawn from the entertainment and sports worlds \nseems to grow each year.\n  So again, as you reduce the influence of parties, who benefits? \nSpecial interests and PACs, wealthy candidates, celebrity candidates.\n  Who else gains? Why, incumbents, of course. The value of incumbency \nincreases where party labels are absent or less important since the \nfree exposure incumbents receive raises their name identification \nlevel. There would also be extra value for candidates endorsed by \nincumbents or those who ran on slates with incumbents.\n  Who else benefits as the parties decline in influence? The news \nmedia, particularly television news, gains. Party affiliation is one of \nthe most powerful checks on the news media, not only because the voting \ncue of the party label is in itself a countervailing force but also \nbecause the perceptual screen erected by party identification filters \nmedia commentary.\n  Who else gains? Why, political consultants gain. The independent \nentrepreneurs of the new campaign technologies--such as polling, \ntelevision advertising, and direct mail--secure more influence in any \nsystem when the parties decline. Already they have become, along with \nsome large PACs, the main institutional rivals of the parties, luring \ncandidates away from their party moorings and using the campaign \ntechnologies to supplant parties as the intermediary between candidates \nand volunteers.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is not a pretty picture. That is not a \npretty picture. Remember, as I conclude my remarks here for the moment, \nthat this bill before us at the beginning of this debate targets \npolitical parties. It purports to do a few other things, but no serious \nconstitutional scholars believe that that can be done or, if we did, it \nwould be upheld in court.\n\n  So make no mistake about it, this targets the political parties. Of \nwhat value is it, in our American political system, to weaken the \nparties, the one entity out there that will always support challengers, \nno matter what?\n  Boy, I tell you, there are some advantages to incumbency. PACs tend \nto like you. Individual contributors tend to like you. You get more \ncoverage. On whom can a challenger depend? Either his own pocketbook, \nif he is lucky enough to have a lot of money, or the political party, \nthe one entity there to go to bat for a challenger in American \npolitical competition.\n  So I welcome the debate. This is going to be an interesting debate. \nNone of us has any real idea how it is going to end, which makes this a \ngood deal different from the discussions we have had on this issue in \nrecent years. We are going to have a lot of fine amendments. The first \namendment will be offered by Senator Domenici of New Mexico. It will be \nlaid down at 3:15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I see my colleague from Mississippi here.\n  How much time does the distinguished Senator need? Five minutes?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, 5 minutes would be ample.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the principal \nsponsors of this bill, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, for \ntheir leadership and for their perseverance.\n  This day has been a long time coming, but the time has finally come \nfor campaign finance reform. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nbill as it was reintroduced at the beginning of this Congress in \nJanuary. I am convinced it is time for the Senate to take action to \nreform the way Federal election campaigns are financed which are, in \neffect, overwhelmingly dominated by the huge amounts of unregulated and \nundisclosed money being spent by organizations, unions, corporations, \nand wealthy individuals to influence the outcome of Federal election \ncampaigns.\n  It is time to ensure that those who do try to influence the outcome \nof Federal elections will have to report their expenditures so the \ngeneral public will know who is trying to influence the\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\noutcome of political campaigns and how they are spending their money to \ndo so.\n  I also commend the Senate leaders, Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle, for \nscheduling the debate on this bill so the Senate has an opportunity to \nwork its will. Amendments can be offered by any Senator, with ample \ntime for debate and consideration of any suggestions for changing or \nimproving this legislation.\n  This bill, S. 27, in my view, strikes the right balance that we are \ntrying to accomplish. I may support some of the amendments that are \noffered. As a matter of fact, I am hopeful that I will be able to offer \nan amendment of my own to strengthen the disclosure requirements. I \nthink it will improve the bill as it now stands. I think the public has \na right to know clearly who is spending the money that affects the \noutcome of Federal elections and how they are spending it.\n  We all see the ads. We are overwhelmed by the total number of \ntelevision ads and other mailings that are sent out during a political \ncampaign these days in House races, in Senate races, and even the \nPresidential election this past year. Voters have to be confused. Who \nis running the ads? It says ``The Good Government Committee,'' but who \nis that? Or it says something else that sounds really good, as though \nthey are on the side of right and justice and right thinking. So they \nput the ad up that suggests or insinuates that one or the other of the \ncandidates isn't on the right track, either on one subject or just \ngenerally speaking, it isn't good for the State or the district or the \ncountry, or suggests that there may be something in the background of \nthe candidate that is suspicious, that needs to be looked at very \ncarefully. The insinuation, the misleading tone, the negative aspect of \npolitical campaigns is fueled by the huge amounts, the juggernaut, an \nalmost imperceptible amount of influence being brought to bear on these \ncampaigns by who knows what source, who knows who is behind the \nspending.\n\n  I am hopeful we will work hard to get a bill reported out and passed \nby the Senate. We have a wonderful opportunity to do so. The time to \nact is now. Some of the raising and spending of the money, I am \nprepared to suggest, looks more like money laundering operations than \naboveboard political campaigns that would reflect credit on the \npolitical system of our country. That needs to be changed. This is the \nvehicle to change it.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will work its will and pass this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 25 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, coauthor \nof the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from \nConnecticut. I am extremely pleased to come to the floor today to begin \nthe debate on the McCain-Feingold-Cochran bill. Of course, the Senator \nfrom Arizona has been the original inspiration on this issue and the \nperson who was able to make this issue and this bill, in particular, \nsomething of national attention and something that actually was \nimportant in the discussions in the Presidential debates last year. I \nhave greatly enjoyed these 6 years of working with John McCain on this \nissue.\n  Let me also say, if I could have picked one Senator from the other \nside to sort of put us over the top, to change the dynamic of this, \nsomebody whom I have always respected, although we have rarely agreed \non the issues, that person is Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi. His \ncredibility and the respect of the Members of this body for him are so \nprofound that when he became a major sponsor of this bill, it made it \npossible for us to have this debate. It is because he joined us, and I \nam grateful.\n  This debate has been a long time coming. It is our first truly open \ndebate on campaign finance reform in many years. We are no longer \nlimited to a few days of speeches or parliamentary wrangling and a \ncloture vote or two. Instead, we are going to have an open amending \nprocess, a vigorous debate, and, in the end, I think we can pass a bill \nfor which this body and the country can be proud.\n  We have a rare opportunity before us. We also face a great test. The \nopportunity is clear. In the next few weeks we can take a major step \ntoward closing the loopholes that have made a mockery of our campaign \nfinance laws. We have the power to close these loopholes, and we have \nthe duty to close them. The American people will be watching this floor \nover the coming days and weeks. They want to know whether we can \nfinally do what is right. Can we finally close the door on the soft \nmoney system that leaves us so vulnerable to the appearance of \ncorruption.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky was happy that so far in the debate the \nword ``corruption'' had not been mentioned. I am sorry, but the choice \nof the word ``corruption'' is not my choice. It is the standard that \nthe U.S. Supreme Court has said we have to deal with if we are going to \nlegislate in this area. It is not John McCain's word. It is not my \nword. It is the word of the Court. The Court said, in Nixon v. Shrink \nMissouri Government PAC:\n\n       Buckley demonstrates that the dangers of large, corrupt \n     contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are \n     corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. The opinion noted \n     that the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 \n     election demonstrate that the problem of corruption is not an \n     illusory one.\n\n  I am sorry the Senator from Kentucky does not want us to talk about \nit, but the Court says we can't do a bill about it unless we do talk \nabout it. So we are going to talk about it. We are going to talk about \ncorruption, but, more importantly, what is much more obvious and much \nmore relevant is the appearance of corruption. It is what it does to \nour Government and our system when people think there may be corruption \neven if it may not exist.\n  Can we finally say, together, as legislators, as representatives of \nthe people, that soft money isn't worth that risk, that it isn't worth \nrisking the appearance of corruption to keep this big soft money \nsystem? That is the test we are about to take. This debate will test \nwhether we can pull back from the soft money status quo to which we \nhave become so accustomed over the past few years. This debate will ask \nwhether we think this is really how our democracy is supposed to be.\n  The public has already answered that question. The vast majority of \nAmericans are outraged by the soft money system. They look at us and \nwonder why year after year, Congress after Congress, we let the soft \nmoney system chip away at our integrity. Day by day, with every vote we \ncast, people wonder was it the money. They doubt us, and we all know \nthat. We see it every day. We open up the newspaper and read another \nstory about how a powerful industry pushed through this bill or a union \nused a contribution to win this provision or a wealthy individual got \nspecial treatment on an amendment. It is getting to the point where it \nis difficult to debate any issue, any issue at all where these \nquestions are not raised.\n  Our parties raise unlimited money with one hand, and we cast our \nvotes with the other. And we dare the public to doubt us every time we \nmiss an opportunity to fix this system such as the one before us today. \nWe cannot afford to keep taking this risk with the public's trust. The \npublic's patience is not limitless, and it should not be. We have a \nmoment here, a rare moment, to regain the public's trust. I know it \nwon't be easy. Real change never is. But the time is right and the will \nof the people is behind this reform.\n  All eyes are on this Senate. Either we rise to the occasion and meet \nthe test before us or we let the American people down again. Either we \nfinally ban soft money in the next few weeks or we let them conclude \nthat we are so addicted to this system, so tainted by corruption or at \nleast the appearance of corruption that, once again, we cannot change.\n\n  As my colleagues know, the centerpiece of this bill is the ban on \nsoft money. In this regard, let me especially thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, for her tireless effort in working \nwith me to meet with individual Senators to persuade them to join us on \nthe bill and with some significant success. As she and I\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\nknow, the rise of soft money has been so recent and so rapid that one \nhas to sort of take a minute and look at how rapid it has been.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1992, I wasn't even sure what soft money \nwas, or at least I didn't know everything that could be done with it. \nAfter a tough race against a very well-financed incumbent who spent \ntwice as much as I did, I was mostly concerned when I came here with \nthe difficulties of people running for office who were not wealthy. I \nam still concerned about that and still think we need to address it, \nand we should get on to it after we do this.\n  My commitment to campaign finance reform was forged from that \nexperience. Since I came to this distinguished institution, soft money \nhas exploded, with far-reaching consequences for our elections and the \nfunctioning of the Congress.\n  As the chart I have shows, soft money first arrived on the scene of \nour national elections in the 1980 elections after a 1978 FEC ruling \nopened the door for parties to accept contributions from corporations \nand unions who are barred from contributing to Federal elections. The \nruling intended these donations to be used for what the FEC termed \n``party building,'' meaning purposes that are unrelated to influencing \nFederal elections. The best available estimate is that the parties \nraised under $20 million in soft money in the 1980 cycle, and it didn't \nchange much in 1984. The loophole remained pretty much dormant.\n  In 1988, soft money nearly doubled when both parties began raising \n$100,000 contributions for both the Bush and the Dukakis campaigns, an \namount that was unheard of prior to 1988. By the 1992 election, the \nyear I was elected to this body, soft money fundraising by the major \nparties had doubled yet again, rising to $86 million. Of course, the \n$86 million raised in 1992 was a lot of money. It was nearly as much as \nthe $110 million that the two Presidential candidates were given in \n1992 in public financing from the U.S. Treasury. There was growing \nconcern about how the money was spent.\n  Despite the FEC's decision that soft money could be used for \nactivities such as ``get out the vote'' and voter registration \ncampaigns without violating the Federal election law's prohibition on \ncorporate and union contributions in connection with Federal elections, \nthe parties sent much of their soft money to be spent in States where \nthe Presidential election between George Bush and Bill Clinton was \nclose or where there were key contested Senate races. Still, even in \n1992, soft money was far from the central issue in our debate over \ncampaign finance reform in 1993 and 1994. And then in 1995, when \nSenator McCain and I first introduced the McCain-Feingold bill, our \nbill included a ban on soft money, but it wasn't even close to being \nthe most controversial provision of our bill, and actually nobody paid \nany attention to it in 1995.\n\n  Then, as we all know, came the 1996 election and the enormous \nexplosion of soft money fueled by the parties' decision to use the \nmoney on phony issue ads supporting their Presidential candidates. As \nyou can see from the chart, the total soft money fundraising \nskyrocketed as a result of that judgment. When the parties had raised \n$262 million in soft money in 1996, that was appropriately considered \nan incredible sum. And it was. There were 219 people who gave $200,000 \nor more in soft money in that cycle, 1996.\n  But today, if you can believe it, only 4 years later, 1996 looks like \na small-time operation compared to the 2000 cycle. I think they are \nstill counting from the year 2000. But I believe we know now that the \nparties raised $487.5 million in soft money in the year 2000. That \ndwarfs the amount raised in 1992, and it comes close to doubling the \namount raised in 1996. The Wall Street Journal reported the other day--\nand I say this in response to the comments of the Senator from Kentucky \nabout the average soft money contribution being $500--that nearly two-\nthirds of that gigantic total I showed you of nearly $500 million was \ngiven by just 800 donors who gave at least $120,000 each. That is a far \ncry from an average of $500--800 donors, giving an average of $120,000 \neach. That is what was the core of the last election.\n  This chart shows the huge growth of the megadonors over time. It is \nexponential. A select group of wealthy people, unions, and corporations \nwhom the parties have come to depend on for these huge sums of money is \nwho is dominating this fundraising.\n  That brings us right back to the item we have to talk about--even \nthough some don't want us to talk about it--and that is the perception \nof corruption. People are uncomfortable with the parties and, by \nextension, all of us, relying on a concentrated group of wealthy donors \nfor a significant part of our fundraising. The American people are \ntroubled by that, and so are many of us.\n  Recently, our colleague, Senator Miller from Georgia, wrote an \nopinion piece in the Washington Post on his deep misgivings about the \ncurrent fundraising system. He wrote that he doesn't sleep as easy as \nhe used to when campaigns weren't defined by how money can be raised \nand spent.\n  I would like to read a passage from Senator Miller's op-ed, where he \ndescribes what fundraising is like today:\n\n       I locked myself in a room with an aide, a telephone, and a \n     list of potential contributors. The aide would get the \n     ``mark'' on the phone, then hand me a card with the spouse's \n     name, the contributor's main interest, and a reminder to \n     ``appear chatty.'' I'd remind the agribusinessman that I was \n     on the Agriculture Committee; I'd remind the banker I was on \n     the Banking Committee.\n       And then I'd make a plaintive plea for soft money--that \n     armpit of today's fundraising. I'd always mention some local \n     project I gotten--or hoped to get--for the person I was \n     talking to. Most large contributors understand only two \n     things: what you can do for them and what you can do to them.\n       I always left that room feeling like a cheap prostitute \n     who'd had a busy day.\n\n  These are Senator Miller's words. Those are powerful words, and they \nare hard to stomach. I deeply admire the Senator from Georgia for many \nreasons, but especially for being willing to write what we all know to \nbe true. Many colleagues have told me privately they are uncomfortable \nwith this system. One Senator told me here on the floor that he felt \nlike taking a shower after he had made a call for a $250,000 \ncontribution.\n\n  We have Senators who can't sleep; we have Senators who feel they have \nto take a shower after doing fundraising calls. We have a pretty \nbizarre system. This system cheapens all of us. The people in this body \nare good people; I know that. They care deeply for this country. We \nhave to get rid of this soft money system before it drives the good \npeople away from public service and drives the public even further away \nfrom its elected leaders.\n  Senator Miller also wrote in his op-ed that while he supports McCain-\nFeingold, he thinks it is not enough, that it is only a step in the \nright direction. I agree. After we pass this bill, I hope we will do \nmore, and I look forward to working with the Senator from Georgia and \nothers on broader reform.\n  Senator Miller's words are brutally honest. I think when we are \nhonest with ourselves about what our system has become, real change \ncan't be far behind. Money should not define this democracy, and it \ndoesn't have to. We don't have to pick up the paper and read headlines \nsuch as ``Influence Market: Industries that Backed Bush Are Now Seeking \nReturn On Investment.'' That headline ran in the March 6 Wall Street \nJournal. I think we all know what that means, and so does everyone \nelse.\n  The assumption that we can be bought, or that the President of the \nUnited States can be bought, has completely permeated our culture. The \nlead of this article reads:\n\n       For the businesses that invested more money than ever \n     before in George W. Bush's costly campaign for the \n     Presidency, the returns have already begun.\n\n  This is a new administration. It is a new start. And then you have to \nread that, which is quite an accusation. But it is one that people \ndon't hesitate to make these days. Whether we are Democrat or \nRepublican, we should all be saddened by such an accusation, perhaps \nangry at it, but we can't ignore it or just blame the media for it.\n  There is an appearance problem here, Mr. President. No one can deny \nthat. But the newspapers didn't create it; we did. I am reminded what \nthe great Senator Robert La Follette, from my home State of Wisconsin, \nsaid in response to those who argued that the press of his day, the \nearly 1900s, was spreading\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nhysteria about the power of the railroads over the Congress. He said:\n\n       It does not lie in the power of any or all of the magazines \n     of the country or of the press, great as it is, to destroy, \n     without justification, the confidence of the people in the \n     American Congress. It rests solely with the United States \n     Senate to fix and maintain its own reputation for fidelity to \n     the public trust. It will be judged by the record. It can not \n     repose in security upon its exalted position and the glorious \n     heritage of its traditions. It is worse than folly to feel, \n     or to profess to feel, indifferent with respect to public \n     judgment. If public confidence is wanting in Congress, it is \n     not of hasty growth, it is not the product of ``jaundiced \n     journalism.'' It is the result of years of disappointment and \n     defeat.\n\n  Mr. President, I think Senator La Follette had it right. It is not \nthe media or the public's fault if what goes on here looks corrupt. It \nis our fault. We have to do something about it. In the next 2 weeks, we \nhave a golden opportunity to do something about it.\n  Here's another recent example of the public's distrust of our work: \n``Tougher Bankruptcy Laws--Compliments of MBNA?'' That headline \nappeared in Business Week magazine on February 26th. The article goes \non to say, ``MBNA is about to hit pay dirt. New bankruptcy legislation \nis on a fast track. Judiciary panels in the House and Senate have held \nperfunctory hearings, and a bill could be on the House and Senate \nfloors as early as late February.'' Again, the implication is clear. It \nis widely assumed that the credit card issuers called the shots on the \nsubstance of the bankruptcy bill that we passed last Thursday. Isn't it \ntroubling that people are so quick to assume the worst about the work \nwe do here on this floor? I think it's a real crisis of confidence in \nour system. And that's why we are taking up this bill--because we have \nto repair some of that public trust. Our reputation is on the line. We \naren't going to get a pass from the American people on this one, and we \ndon't deserve one.\n  The appearance of corruption is rampant in our system, and it touches \nvirtually every issue that comes before us. that's why I have Called \nthe Bankroll on this floor 30 times in less than two years. Because I \nthink it's important for us to acknowledge that millions of dollars are \ngiven in an attempt to influence what we do. Because that's why people \ngive soft money, and I don't think anyone would even try to dispute \nthat. I won't detail every bankroll here--because that would take all \nday. But let me just review some of the issues they addressed, to show \nhow far reaching this problem really is.\n  I have Called the Bankroll on mining on public lands, the gun show \nloophole, the defense industry's support of the Super Hornet and the F-\n22, the Y2 K Liability Act, the Passengers' Bill of Rights, MFN for \nChina, PNTR for China, and the tobacco industry. I have talked about \nagriculture interests lobbying on an agriculture appropriations bill, \ntelecommunications interest lobbying on a tower-siting bill, and \nrailroad interests lobbying on a transportation appropriations bill. I \nhave talked about contributions surrounding the Financial Services \nModernization Act, nuclear waste policy, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, and the ergonomics issue. I have also Called the Bankroll on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights--twice, the Africa trade bill--twice, the \noil royalties amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations \nbill--twice, and I have Called the Bankroll on three tax bills, and \nfour separate times on the bankruptcy reform legislation that we just \npassed.\n\n  People give soft money to influence the outcome of these issues, \nplain and simple. And as long as we allow soft money to exist, we risk \ndamaging our credibility when we make the decisions about the issues \nthat the people elected us to make. They sent us here to wrestle with \nsome very tough issues. They have vested us with the power to make \ndecisions that have a profound impact on their lives. That's a \nresponsibility that we take very seriously. But today, when we weigh \nthe pros and cons of legislation, many people think we also weigh the \nsize of the contributions we got from interests on both sides of the \nissues. And when those contributions can be a million dollars, or even \nmore, it seems obvious to most people that we would reward our biggest \ndonors.\n  That is the assumption people make, and we let them make it. Every \ntime we have had the chance to close the soft money loophole, this body \nhas faltered. If we can't pass this bill, history will remember that \nthis Senate faced a great test, and we failed. That the people accused \nus of corruption, and in our failure to pass a real reform bill, we \nconfirmed their worst fear.\n  The bill before us today offers a different path. If we can support \nthe modest reforms in this bill, we can show the public that we \nunderstand that the current system doesn't do our democracy justice. \nThis is just a modest bill. It is not sweeping. It is not comprehensive \nreform. It only seeks to address the biggest loopholes in our system.\n  The soft money ban is the centerpiece of this bill. Our legislation \nshuts down the soft money system, prohibiting all soft money \ncontributions to the national political parties from corporations, \nlabor unions, and wealthy individuals. State parties that are permitted \nunder State law to accept these unregulated contributions would be \nprohibited from spending them on activities relating to Federal \nelections. And Federal candidates and officeholders would be prohibited \nfrom raising soft money under our bill. That's a very significant \nprovision because the fact that we in the Congress are doing the asking \nis what gives this system an air of extortion, as well as bribery.\n  McCain-Feingold-Cochran also addresses the issue ad loophole, which \ncorporations and unions use to skirt the federal election law. This \nprovision, originally crafted by Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords, \ntreats corporations and unions fairly and equally. I want to be clear \nhere. Snowe-Jeffords does not prohibit any election ad, nor does it \nplace limits on spending by outside organizations. But it will give the \npublic crucial information about the election activities of independent \ngroups and it will prevent corporate and union treasury money from \nbeing spent to influence elections.\n  Under the bill, labor unions and for-profit corporations would be \nprohibited from spending their treasury funds on radio or TV ads that \nrefer to a clearly identified candidate and appear within 30 days of a \nprimary or 60 days of a general election. 501(c)(4) non-profit \ncorporations can make electioneering communications only as long as \nthey use only individual contributions. Disclosure is significantly \nincreased for these (c)(4) advocacy groups, and across the board for \nanyone who spends over $10,000 in a calendar year on these kinds of \nads.\n  I'm sure Senators Snowe and Jeffords will describe this provision of \nthe bill in greater detail as we go forward, and we will have a \nspirited debate about whether it should be strengthened or even removed \nfrom the bill altogether. Let me just say that I believe the Snowe-\nJeffords provisions is a fair compromise and the right balance. It \nfairly balances legitimate first amendment concerns with the goal of \nenforcing the law that prohibits unions and corporations from spending \nmoney in connection with Federal elections.\n  In this bill, we also codify the Beck decision and strengthen the \nforeign money ban. The bill strengthens current law to make it clear \nthat it is unlawful to raise or solicit campaign contributions on \nFederal property, including the White House and the United States \nCongress. We also bar Federal candidates from converting campaign funds \nfor personal use, such as a mortgage payment or country club \nmembership.\n  I recognize that some of our colleagues are concerned about the \ncoordination provision, which specifies circumstances in which \nactivities by outside groups or parties will be considered coordinated \nwith candidates. I want to let our colleagues know that we are \nlistening, and we are working on a modification of that section of the \nbill. We will offer an amendment during this debate that I hope will \nsatisfy most of the concerns that have been raised.\n\n  Throughout this process, we have welcomed the input and suggestions \nof our colleagues, and we will continue to do so throughout this \ndebate. Over the next two weeks, every Member of the Senate will have \nan opportunity to contribute to this debate, and I hope each of us \nwill. There are 100 experts on campaign finance law in this body. We've \nall lived under this system. We\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nknow how campaigns work. The success of this reform depends on a \nvigorous and informed debate, and I think we will have it.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure most of my colleagues are aware of the \nserious political crisis underway as we speak in the nation of India. \nJournalists posing as arms dealers shot videos with hidden cameras on \nwhich politicians and defense officials were seen accepting cash and \nfavors in return for defense contracts. Those pictures have caused a \nhuge scandal. The Indian Defense Minister has resigned, and we don't \nknow yet now great the repercussions will be.\n  One thing that struck me as I read the news reports of these events \nwas two of the people caught on tape were party leaders, including the \nleader of the ruling party, the BJP, Mr. Bangaru Laxman. Let me read \nfrom an AP story of March 16:\n\n       Laxman denied that the journalists identified themselves to \n     him as defense contractors or discussed weapons sales. He \n     said they were presented as businessmen and that accepting \n     money for the party is not illegal in India.\n\n  I am not going to say that what is happening in India is the same as \nthe system we have in the United States, and I'm certainly not going to \ncomment on the guilt or innocence of any party leader or political \nofficial in that sovereign country. But the government of India is \nhanging by a thread based on possibly corrupt payments of a few \nthousand dollars by people posing as defense contractors. We have \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars flowing to our political \nparties from business and labor interests of all kinds. And our \ndefense, like Mr. Laxman's is, ``it's legal.'' We have a system of \nlegalized bribery, a system of legalized extortion, in this country. \nBut legal or not, like the videotaped payments in India, this system \nlooks awful.\n\n  The eyes of the Nation are on this Chamber. This group of 100 \nSenators can prove to the public that we are the Senate that the people \nwant us to be. But the public's patience is wearing very thin. We \ncannot pick up the phone to raise soft money with one hand, and cast \nour votes with the other for much longer. The harm to the reputation of \nthe Congress is simply too great. If we fail to pass real reform, we \nchoose soft money over the public trust. That's a risk we cannot afford \nto take. We have a rare opportunity before us, and a great test. Let us \nseize the opportunity for reform, and meet the test before us with a \nfirm commitment to restoring the public's faith in us and the work we \ndo. The public doubts whether we can do it, Mr. President, but I \nbelieve that we can, and I believe that we must.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from California requests how \nmuch time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time do you have?\n  Mr. DODD. There are 13 minutes remaining. Why not take 6 of it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That would be great.\n  Mr. President, I wish to start out by thanking Senators McCain and \nFeingold for their hard work on this very important piece of \nlegislation. I know it is hard to challenge the status quo. I commend \nthem both for their courage and their commitment to this cause. My own \ncommitment goes back to my early days as a candidate for political \noffice 25 years ago. I have supported such efforts to change our \ncampaign finance system whenever I have gotten the opportunity. I thank \nmy friends for getting us this opportunity. It wasn't easy to do it. \nThey worked hard and they got it.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I became even more of a rabid supporter of \ncampaign finance reform, as I learned I had to raise $12 million at \nthat time in 1992.\n  After my second run for the Senate, in which I had to raise $20 \nmillion, I became so supportive of campaign finance reform that I am \ntruly ready to clamp down on this obscene situation. Yes, if there are \nsome unforeseen consequences, I am willing to take a look at how to fix \nit, but today we must support this change regarding soft money.\n  I want to give my colleagues some figures. For someone from \nCalifornia who does not have independent wealth, in order to raise $12 \nmillion--and that is an old number; it is probably going to be up to \n$30 million the next time--just $12 million, I would have to raise \n$10,000 a day 7 days a week for 6 years. What a way to be a Senator \nwhen you are consistently worried about how you are going to raise this \nmoney.\n  I say to my friends, Russ Feingold and John McCain, that I liked \ntheir other versions better than this one because they went further; \nthey did more. They included an incentive to lower the amount of money \nwe could spend. I liked it better. They allowed you to get lower prices \nfor TV and mailings.\n  This version is not my favorite one, but it is the only game in town \nthat does something about clamping down on the soft money abuses. \nTherefore, I will be supporting it.\n  I want to talk a minute about the broadcast industry. What a \nsituation. When I ran the last time, to get a 30-second spot on prime \ntime, it cost $50,000 to get one ``Barbara Boxer for Senate'' spot on \nTV. I always thought we owned the airwaves. Isn't there a way we can do \nbetter than this? In other words, the people of the country should be \nable to get our message, but why should it cost these obscene amounts \nof money?\n\n  The fact is, the Court, as my friend, Senator McConnell, has said so \noften, has equated money and speech. I respectfully disagree. It means \nsomeone with wealth has more free speech than I do because they can \nspend their own money. That is not right. I think our founders would \nturn in their graves thinking about that one. We are all supposed to be \nequal. We are all supposed to have free speech. Why should one of us \nhave more free speech than another?\n  I think the Buckley case ought to be reheard, but that is a debate \nfor another day, and in 6 minutes I could never go into all its \nnuances.\n  There are three proposals essentially before us. One is the McCain-\nFeingold bill which I support, one is the Hagel bill which I do not \nsupport, and one out there is a vague proposal by President Bush which, \nto me, is a total sham, and I will explain why I think that way.\n  I truly think Chuck Hagel is trying hard to come up with an \nalternative. I do not agree with it because I think it opens the \nfloodgates of hard money and does not do enough to cap soft money. I \nknow he is trying hard to put something forward that he thinks will \nhold up.\n  I want to talk a minute about the President's approach. First, he \nwants to punish working people by making them sign off before a dollar \ncan be used by a union. I always thought this was a free society. \nPeople join unions freely, and if they do not like their union \nleadership, they can vote them out.\n  The President knows what he is doing. He is after working men and \nwomen in this country. Just look at his tax cut. He does not do \nanything to help them. They are in the dog house, so he is going to \nhurt working men and women by this so-called Paycheck Protection Act \nthat makes no sense. This idea of having the shareholders check off \nevery time somebody wants to make a contribution is just absolutely \nunworkable. Then he puts a little caveat in there that puts the entire \nissue at risk because we think it will be struck down by the courts. It \nis a cynical ploy.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my friend if I can have an \nadditional minute in addition to the 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is a tie-in between what we do here \nand the large contributions that come into this arena. Let's look at \nthe President.\n  The President likes things as they are. He gets these big unregulated \ncontributions. So what has he done? He has only been in office a couple \nof months: International gag rule, a payback to the far right that gave \nhim a lot of money; repeal of the ergonomics workplace protection rule, \na payback against working men and women; bankruptcy reform aimed at \nhelping banks and credit card companies, a payback; plans to open up \nthe Alaska wildlife refuge for drilling, a payback\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nto the oil companies; reversal of his campaign pledge on \nCO2, carbon dioxide emissions, a payback to the coal \nindustry; tax cuts aimed at the richest people--those are the only ones \nwho make out on this one; they walk away and smile all the way to the \nbank--a payback to his contributors.\n  His campaign finance position is a payback to all those folks. I hope \nwe will support McCain-Feingold. I think it is worthy of passage.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Dodd for the time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 3 minutes--5 minutes, \nwhatever my colleague from Michigan----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 5 minutes if the Senator has it.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend Senators McCain and \nFeingold for bringing us to this point, to this moment of truth. I also \ncommend our leadership, both the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader and the chairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee, for \nhelping to organize a time period which will allow us to have a free-\nwheeling and open debate.\n  This is finally the moment of truth on campaign finance reform. The \nnext few weeks will help us determine whether we recapture the faith \nwhich is at the heart of our democracy or whether we let it again slip \nfrom our grasp.\n  Decades have transpired since our predecessors enacted the current \ncampaign finance laws. It was not easy. It took a scandal of momentous \nproportions--the financial irregularities associated with the 1972 \nPresidential campaign--to bring Congress to action, but act it did.\n  Now it is our moment of truth, our moment to decide whether we rescue \nthe law which our predecessors had the good sense and courage to enact, \nor whether the moment is drowned in a sea of excuses.\n  Let's begin with some basic truths.\n  Truth No. 1: There are contribution limits embodied in our law, \nmeaningful limits, and if the law were followed and interpreted as \noriginally intended, we would not be here today. Let's look at those \nlimits in the system which we put in place 25 years ago.\n  Individuals are not supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate \nper election, $5,000 to a political action committee, $20,000 a year to \na national party committee, $25,000 total in any 1 year for all \ncontributions combined.\n  Corporations and unions are prohibited from contributing anything to \na candidate except through carefully prescribed political action \ncommittees. The limit of a corporate or union PAC contribution is \n$5,000 per candidate.\n  Presidential campaigns are supposed to be financed just with public \nfunds.\n  Those are the laws on the books today.\n  Truth No. 2: The Supreme Court has upheld the legality and \nconstitutionality of those contribution limits in a number of cases, \nincluding Buckley v. Valeo and Nixon v. Missouri Government Shrink PAC. \nIn those cases, the Supreme Court held that limits on contributions do \nnot violate free speech.\n  Truth No. 3: The soft money loophole has effectively destroyed those \ncontribution limits. The loophole is huge. Since you cannot give more \nthan a limited amount to a candidate, give all you want to his or her \nparty and, of course, the party turns around and spends that money \nhelping the candidate win election. Soft money has blown the lid off \nthe contribution limits of our campaign finance system. As many \ncommentators, colleagues, and constituents have said, practically \nspeaking, there are no limits.\n  The truth is, the public is offended by this spectacle of huge \ncontributions, and well they should be, and we should be, too.\n  Just one reason why we should not enjoy the spectacle--and the public \ncertainly does not--is that in order to get these large contributions, \naccess to us is openly and blatantly sold. We sell lunch or dinner with \n``the committee chairman of your choice'' for $100,000. This is a \nbipartisan problem. Both parties do it.\n\n  From an RNC, 1997 annual gala: For $100,000, you get a luncheon with \nthe Senate and House leadership and the Republican House and Senate \ncommittee chairmen of your choice.\n  We sell access to insiders meetings, strategy sessions, participation \nin congressional advisory groups, or trade missions. The open \nsolicitation of campaign contributions in exchange for access to people \nwith the power to affect the life or livelihood of the person being \nsolicited creates an appearance of impropriety and a misuse of power.\n  From the Democratic National Committee, for $100,000, you get a \nmeeting with the President, you go on a trade mission with leadership \nas they travel abroad to examine current and developing political and \neconomic issues, and a whole lot of other benefits--large contributions \nin exchange for access.\n  The moment of truth is now. We must not let this moment pass without \ndoing what we believe is right and necessary to restore public \nconfidence in ways in which campaigns are financed and run.\n  I thank both Senators McCain and Feingold for their extraordinary \ncourage, their determination, their grit. I thank also our leadership \nand the chairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee for helping \nto schedule this debate in a way in which I think we can resolve this \nfestering problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Kentucky has 13 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There are other speakers on the other side awaiting \nthe arrival of Senator Domenici. I am happy to dole out some of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DODD. This has been helpful. I commend my colleagues from Arizona \nand Wisconsin, and my colleague from Michigan, who always gives an \neloquent statement, along with Harry Reid and the Senator from \nMississippi. I commend Senator Hagel and Senator McConnell for \nexpressing their points of view on one of the most significant debates \nwe are apt to have in this Congress; that is, over the very issue of \nhow we raise the necessary dollars to campaign for the very offices \nwhich we hold and which we seek reelection to not only here but in the \nother body.\n  It has been fascinating to note over the last 25 years that we have \nhad public financing for Presidential races; every single candidate, \nboth Democrat and Republican, going back to the late 1970s, has \nsupported and used public financing, along with the limits imposed as a \nresult of accepting public dollars to campaign for the Presidency of \nthe United States. We are not yet debating a public financing mechanism \nfor races in the House and the Senate. Depending on the outcome of this \ndebate, at some future date that may be the case.\n  I have supported public financing in the past and believe it is the \nway we can end up without any constitutional question of limiting the \namount of dollars that come into campaigns and other restrictions we \nmay believe appropriate on how we conduct our efforts to seek Federal \noffice in this country.\n  The bottom line is clear. Whether you agree with public financing or \nnot, the point articulated by the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, and others is that this system is broken. It is a failed \nsystem. When you have to spend the hours we do every day for 6 years \nconducting a Senate campaign--and I don't envy candidates from New \nYork, California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, where the cost of seeking a \nSenate seat in those States has moved to $15-, $20-, $30 million--when \nyou must raise, as the Senator from California pointed out, $10,000 a \nday, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year for 6 years in order to compete for \nthe Senate seat in that State, and if someone turns around and says \nthere is not enough money in politics, I wonder on what planet they are \nliving. If you have to raise $10,000 a day, plus being a Senator to \nrepresent your State, go to your committee hearings, meet constituency \ngroups, answer the phone, send out the mail, the system is not broken? \nThe system is not flawed? This is incredible.\n  It has been said by the authors of the bill, it is not a perfect \nproposal. I regret it is not the earlier McCain-Feingold proposal. \nThere is some unevenness in the bill in applying provisions where this \nis applicable to some groups and organizations and not others. I am \ntold that is the political reality. I am not comfortable with that as a \nreason why we don't have a level playing field for all groups.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n  This is the one chance we will have to do something about this \nsystem. It is the one chance remaining to try to make meaningful \nchanges in the law. If it is not perfect, if there are unintended \nconsequences, we can come back and arrange or correct that. But we \nshouldn't not do anything and leave the system as it presently is \nconstructed.\n  It is hard enough to get people to vote today, to participate, to \nsupport those who seek public office. I am not going to suggest that \nautomatically we are going to have some great conversion on the road to \nDamascus where all of a sudden the mass of the American voting public \nwill collectively say, hallelujah, the system has been cleaned up and \nwe can now all engage in the support of our candidates because McCain-\nFeingold is adopted. That is naive.\n  But I do believe the American public will respond favorably if this \nSenate in these next 2 weeks adopts the McCain-Feingold legislation and \nsays: While we haven't dramatically changed the system, we have \nimproved it dramatically. That is my hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Domenici is here. He will be recognized at \n3:15 to lay down the first amendment.\n  I conclude the opening comments by saying, as I said before, McCain-\nFeingold will not take money out of politics; it will take the parties \nout of politics.\n  Having said that at the beginning of 2 weeks of a wild ride, it will \nbe easier to predict who will win the NCAA tournament than how the bill \nwill come out after 2 weeks of amendments. I think there is one \nprediction I can make fairly confidently. I think there will be an \neffort, hopefully not supported by a majority but an effort to water \ndown anything that might offend the AFL-CIO. I predict by the end of \nthis debate there will be no paycheck protection, watered down \nrestriction on coordination and issue advocacy as it applies to the \nAFL-CIO, and no disclosure of the union ground game. So it is about the \nonly prediction I will confidently make, that before we are finished \nwith this debate, the opposition to the AFL-CIO will have been taken \ncare of by the watering down and massaging of language to the point \nwhere they sign off on it.\n  I hope that will not be the case because last year they spent \nconsiderably more on the election than either of the two political \nparties. I repeat, they spent more on the election last year than \neither one of the two great political parties.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me finish my point and I will be happy to yield.\n  I hope by the time we get to the end of the debate, they will still \nthink they are impacted. I yield to my friend from Arizona for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will bring it up at another time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky controls the time \nuntil 3:15.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Domenici is here and ready to go forward. I \nbelieve everybody on the floor has already spoken at least once.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I point out to the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator \nfrom Maine has arrived. I believe she has a brief opening statement for \nthe remainder of the time, if that is acceptable to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator from Maine can do it in 5 minutes. I \ndon't want to delay Senator Domenici's amendment. The Senator can do it \ninto his amendment, into the discussion on his amendment. She can also \nmake an opening statement, if she so desires.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why don't colleagues just decide how much time she \nneeds. I am willing for her to do that now. In fact, I have somebody \nout there who needs me for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Maine my remaining 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n  Madam President, I am delighted we are beginning the debate on the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001, and of the campaign finance \nreform efforts that have been led for many years by my good friends, \nSenators McCain and Feingold. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor \nof their bill, which takes several critical steps toward reform of our \ncampaign finance system.\n  I have long supported campaign finance reform. When I was running for \nthe Senate in 1996, I promised to advocate reform, and I kept that \npromise by becoming an early cosponsor of McCain-Feingold during my \nfirst year in the Senate.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 goes a long way toward \nfixing a broken system. First and foremost, the bill closes the most \nglaring loophole in our campaign finance laws by banning the unlimited, \nunregulated contributions known as ``soft money.'' Second, the bill \nregulates and limits the campaign advertisements masquerading as issue \nads that corporations and labor organizations often run in the weeks \nleading up to an election. And third, the bill prohibits foreign \nnationals from contributing soft money in connection with federal, \nstate, or local elections.\n  My home State of Maine has a deep commitment to preserving the \nintegrity of the electoral system and ensuring that all Mainers have an \nequal political voice. Mainers have backed their commitment to an open \npolitical process in both word and deed. In many regions of Maine, town \nmeetings in which all citizens are invited to debate issues and make \ndecisions are still prevalent. This is unvarnished, direct democracy. \nIt contrasts sharply with the increasing ability of people with more \nmoney to speak longer and louder in federal elections. Maine's \ntradition of town meetings and equal participation rejects the notion \nthat wealth dictates political discourse. Maine citizens feel strongly \nabout reforming our federal campaign laws, as do I.\n  Soft money has become the conduit through which wealthy individuals, \nlabor unions and corporations have in many ways seized control of our \npolitical process. The problem with soft money was evident during the \n1997 hearings by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, chaired \nby my good friend, Senator Thompson. During those investigations, we \nheard from one individual who gave $325,000 to the Democratic National \nCommittee in order to secure a picture with the President of the United \nStates. We also heard from the infamous Roger Tamraz who testified that \nthe $300,000 he spent to gain access to the White House was not enough \nand that, next time, he would spend $600,000. And we heard of \nindividuals, such as Chinese millionaire Ted Sioeng, who orchestrated \nnearly $600,000 in political contributions during the 1996 election \ncycle. Sieong, we later discovered, was a self-described agent of the \nChinese government who made his fortune manufacturing a popular brand \nof cigarettes in China.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, soft money donations \nnearly doubled in the 2000 presidential election cycle, from $262 \nmillion in 1996 to $488 million in 2000. Other estimates set the \nfigures even higher. At the same time, regulated, hard money donations \nincreased a little more than 10-percent.\n  In short, soft money is a growing wave that threatens to swamp our \ncampaign finance system. Each election cycle, the wave gains momentum \nand size. Just two presidential elections ago, soft money contributions \ntotaled $86 million, or one-sixth of the amount raised in the latest \ncycle. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 has served our country \nwell. But those seeking ways to influence our elections have found \nloopholes that have overwhelmed the rule themselves. I therefore \napplaud the bipartisan efforts of Senators McCain and Feingold and \npledge my continued support throughout the long process ahead. I know \nwe are in for a spirited debate and believe that, ultimately, the will \nof the majority of Americans will prevail. They want reform. It is time \nwe heed their message.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 112\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe it is in order now for me to \nsend an amendment to the desk, and I do so on behalf of myself and \nSenator Ensign.\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for himself and \n     Mr. Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 112.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nDomenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, for those interested in campaign \nreform, obviously this is a rare opportunity for the United States to \nsee a full debate on this issue. If you will forgive me, those who are \ninvolved in the underlying debate, I choose to depart from the subject \nmatter that has been debated for the last 2 hours and concentrate on \njust one new phenomenon that is occurring in elections in the United \nStates that I think has to be righted, and that has to do with the \ngrowing number of men and women who run for the Senate and pay for \ntheir own campaigns with large amounts of money.\n  We have been talking about large amounts of money coming from all \ndifferent sources. Some think that is changing the election campaigns \nfor the better; some think it is changing them for the worse. But I \nthink one thing we ought to seriously worry about and wonder about is a \nman or woman who chooses to run for the Senate and says: I want to use \nmy constitutional rights to spend $5 million, $10 million, $20 million, \n$30 million, $40 million, $50 million of my own money--his or her own \nmoney--to get elected.\n  That is OK, says the Supreme Court. Far be it for the Senator from \nNew Mexico to think I know how to change that. I do not. I am not sure, \nif I knew how, that I would want to. But what I do know is, whoever \nchooses to do that has a huge, unfair opportunity over their opponent.\n  Why do I say that? Because, you understand, and everybody listening \nshould understand, that when you run for the Senate, you cannot go \ncollect $10,000 and $20,000, and $40,000 contributions.\n  Let's start off looking at a candidate who is going to spend $10 \nmillion or $20 million or $30 million of his or her own money, and then \nlook at their opponent. Under current election laws, that opponent can \nraise money from individuals--rich, or moderately rich, or ordinary \ncitizens who are not very rich--but they are limited to $1,000 per \nelection.\n  The occupant of the chair just went through an election. She knows \nwhat I am talking about--$1,000 per contributor in the primary and the \ngeneral election. Think of that for a moment. That used to be the \nprimary way to raise money for a Senate candidate to run his or her own \ncampaign. Just think of what a Senator has to do, to raise $5 million \nthat way.\n  Also, there is no way you can do it with $1,000 or $2,000 \ncontributions. You would have to have a breakfast, a lunch, and a \ndinner every day with $1,000 contributors, with 10, or 15, or 20 at \neach event, and do it for about 1 year to be able to raise $5 million.\n  Is it fair, even though it is constitutionally authorized, for a \nwealthy American to put up whatever amount they want? We have seen it \nin large scale go from over $45 million down to $5 million, or $6 \nmillion, or $7 million, and we have seen a very large number of \nsuccesses from those who do that.\n  I regret to say I am not sure I would do that for a Senate seat if I \nhad a lot\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nof resources. I have been here a long time. I am not sure it is worth \n$20 million, in any event. Maybe when I first started, I would have \nbeen very excited about it. I still love it, but I just wonder if I \nwould put up $20 million, or $30 million, or $40 million to beat my \nopponent who couldn't come close to raising the money.\n  Let's get down to what I am trying to do. What I am trying to do is \nleave that alone. I can't change that. What I can say is that somebody \nwho intends to do that has to publicly disclose it at various intervals \nin the campaign. Then we start to raise the caps for the nonmillionaire \ncandidate so that they have more latitude to raise money to compete \nwith the person who is going to contribute millions of their own money.\n  Essentially, in that context, it is an equalizer amendment; it is a \nfair play amendment; it is a ``let's be considerate of a candidate who \nisn't rich'' amendment--whatever you choose to call it.\n  I want to describe what I choose to do in this amendment.\n  First of all, the person who intends to spend large amounts of their \nown money--I want to say it again: Senator Domenici from New Mexico is \nnot trying to stop that. I am fully aware that I couldn't even if I \nwanted to. I do not know if I would if I could. But the U.S. Supreme \nCourt said that is a freedom of speech issue with the person who can \neither borrow large amounts of money or who wants to spend large \namounts of money.\n  What I say is they must declare the intent to spend more than a half \nmillion dollars within 15 days of being required to file a declaration \nof candidacy.\n  Over $500,000--let's do that one first. Fifteen days, if you are \ngoing to spend $500,000--over $500,000--opponents, individuals and PACs \nare increased threefold. If it is $500,000 of your own money, then that \n$1,000 contribution turns to $3,000 for the opponent. The PACs go from \n5 to 15.\n  If you go beyond the $500,000, and you are going to spend $750,000, \nthen everything is increased by five times. Those are the caps that \ncurrently operate. Instead of $1,000, it will be $5,000 per election, \nand the same on the PACs.\n  If you are going to do $1 million, then direct party contribution \nlimits or party coordinated expenditures limits are eliminated, as well \nas you eliminate the cap on individual contributions, and the cap stays \nat five times. It stays at five times at the highest category, but then \nthe party contributions and party coordinated expenditures which have \ncaps on them are eliminated.\n  It has one other feature. I don't really mean it for anybody in the \npast; I just want it to apply in the future. But you see, there is \nanother practice that has come into play that I don't think is fair. \nThat is, you use your own money or you lend yourself money. Then, after \nyou are elected, you go have a lot of fundraisers as an elected \nSenator, and you pay yourself back. Frankly, I don't think you ought to \ndo that. If you are going to spend $5 million and go out there and \nrobustly tell everybody you are spending $5 million of your own money, \nor $10 million of your own money--I guess we have had somebody spend \n$40 million of their own money--you shouldn't get elected and go out \nand have fundraisers to collect the money back once you have won the \nseat, which you essentially won by putting in such a huge amount of \nyour own money.\n\n  This limits candidates who incur personal loans in connection with \ntheir campaign in excess of $250,000. They can do $250,000 and then \nreimburse themselves with fundraisers. But anything more than that, \nthey cannot repay it by going out and having fundraisers once they are \nelected with their own money.\n  I don't think the details are very important to this amount. I think \nif Senators see what I see, they are going to want to adopt this \namendment. This whole debate is about what people perceive as too much \nmoney being put into campaigns at one level or another.\n  I am not sure I know what that is in terms of party participation. I \nam listening to the debate. I am complimenting Senator McCain and \nothers who are working on the bill and those who are coming up with \nother amendments. But I think the amendment I have also addresses a \ngrowing issue that should be of great concern, whether it is a \nRepublican, a Democrat, or a third-party candidate.\n  If you are going to run for the Senate, and if you are going to put \nhuge amount of your own money into the campaign, it is patently unfair \nthat your opponent would be limited to fundraising levels that are 26 \nyears old without a change, which is $1,000 per primary and $1,000 per \ngeneral from your friends who want to help you.\n  Just think for a moment. If you are so fortunate to have somebody run \nagainst you with $20 million of their own money, just think of what is \nahead of you--to go out and raise the money you need to run a fair \ncampaign against $20 million and raise it $1,000 at a time per election \nand a $5,000 limitation on PACs. It is patently wrong and unfair.\n  If it is constitutional to fix it--and I believe this may be \nconstitutional because, as a matter of fact, we are denying no rights \nto the wealthy if they want to put in their money. But to the person \nwho runs against them, we say we want to give you a chance to stay in \nthe playing field by raising limits on how you can raise money and from \nwhom.\n  I note my friend from Kentucky wanting to be recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator has raised an extraordinarily important \nissue with regard to the dilemma that a modestly well-off candidate \nfaces when running against someone of extraordinary wealth. I think he \nhas come up with an amendment to bring some justice to that situation.\n  I am also curious if the Senator has thought about another value: \nThat there will be one or more amendments dealing with that 26-year-old \nhard money contribution limit of $2,700.\n  Imagine the unknown candidate running in a State such as California \nagainst somebody who is either well known or well off. The Senator \nsuggested it would be difficult to compete against such a person in New \nMexico or Kentucky. I ask my friend whether he thinks there would be \nany chance in the world of a candidate running against a millionaire in \na big State such as California.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, it seems to me we have seen some evidence of \nthat, for there was a race out there--I am not using names of who did \nthis but there was a very huge amount of money spent by a candidate. \nThe candidate didn't happen to win. But essentially the opposition had \na terrible time raising money to compete. It just turned out that there \nwas something else happening in that election.\n  Given the money that people in California have who made these large \nfortunes, if one of them chooses to go in and put up really a big \nportion of their own money, an opponent at $1,000 per individual and \nper election and $5,000 in PAC money--essentially the major ways of \nraising money--I don't see how they can compete.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from New Mexico agree, then, that \nfailure to index the so-called hard money contribution limit back in \nthe mid 1970s has completely distorted the process across the board?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No question about it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And it is one of the single biggest problems we should \ntry to remedy during this debate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no doubt in my mind that we ought to try to \nfix that. I, as one Senator, saw this issue that I am addressing \narising in 1987. So I introduced a bill that we called the wealthy \ncandidate bill. Frankly, we did not have a debate that looked like it \nwas going to bring reform. So I just kept introducing it every 2 years. \nOne time, Senator Dole offered something very much similar. But the \nunderlying bill never did proceed beyond the debate stage.\n  I want everybody to understand. I want to repeat, just in very simple \nterms, that I do not know whether a very wealthy candidate will be a \ngreat Senator, a good Senator, or not so good Senator. I do not know \nthat. I am not trying to say because you have $10 million or $40 \nmillion to spend on your campaign, you should not run and use your own \nmoney--not at all. Nor am I suggesting that if you spend a huge\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\namount--$40 million--and win that you were the better or the lesser \ncandidate.\n  I am merely saying, we established rules limiting what the opponent \ncan spend. These are statutory rules that are 26 years old, coming out \nof Watergate, that say what the opponent to that wealthy candidate can \nspend. It is in that regard that I speak. If, in fact, the wealthy \ncandidate wants to disclose, as prescribed in this statute, that he is \ngoing to spend this money--and, of course, there are statute law \npenalties if they do not comply with the law--if they do that, then it \nwould seem to me you ought to amend the 26-year-old limitations, which \nare under attack here as being too low anyway. There are a number of \namendments in the bill saying that number is too low.\n  Now, believe it or not, as of right now, those low numbers apply even \nto an opponent of somebody who will declare under this statute that \nthey are going to spend $1 million of their own money as prescribed in \nthis law.\n  So with that, I do not know if we have any formal opposition on the \nfloor. If we do, I certainly would be willing to exchange views with \nthem. But from my standpoint, I think we ought to adopt this amendment \nbefore the day is out and have done one piece of laudable work on the \nfirst day.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I need 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nMinnesota needs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I need no more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Actually, I would love to make a more general \npresentation about money and politics, but, I say to my good friend \nfrom New Mexico, I want to just start out with a few rather jarring \nstatistics.\n  Do you know how many U.S. citizens contribute more than $200 to a \nrace today? Four out of every 10,000. That is .037 percent. Do you know \nhow many Americans give contributions of $1,000 or more? It is .011 \npercent. So it seems to me that what we have is a system where people \nthink if you pay, you play; if you don't pay, you don't play.\n  My colleague comes on the floor with an amendment that says the way \nto deal with the problem of people being millionaires--by the way, I \ndon't take this amendment personally; it will not damage me at all--but \nmy colleague comes out here with a proposal that says the way to deal \nwith the problem of millionaires financing their own candidates is to \nbasically take the limits off of contributions, so that we now have a \ncontest between millionaires and people who can run by getting support \nfrom millionaires or from large financial interests, be it individual \ncontributions to them or contributions to the party.\n  This is meant to be a proposal where the word for the people in the \ncountry is that the Senate, in the first amendment that we are going to \nconsider, has taken a giant step forward in reform by putting more \nmoney into politics. I do not think that is what people want to hear. \nAnd they are right.\n  With all due respect, I think what my colleague from New Mexico has \ndone is make an argument for public financing. That is what this is \nabout. If you want to deal with the problem of millionaires or people \nwho have a lot of money using their own money to win elections or, as \nyou see it, to help contribute to their winning, the way to solve the \nproblem is not by taking the limits off of hard money contributions.\n  By the way, there is going to be more and more of that done. Again, \nless than 1 percent of the population contributes $200 or more; and \neven less of the ``less than 1 percent'' contribute $1,000 because \npeople do not have that money. People do not go to $500,000 barbecues \nand all the rest. They have their own barbecues with their neighbors. \nPeople make $100 contributions to charities. They do not make these \nkinds of contributions.\n  What this amendment has done is simply added to the problem by saying \nnow what we are going to have, through this amendment, is yet even more \nmoney put into politics by the very top of the population, be it \nwealthy people of financial interests on whom all of us are going to be \nmore dependent. So now what we are going to have--and this is supposed \nto be the first amendment for reform: The people who have their own \nresources, millionaires, versus people who have access to millionaires \nand large financial interests. That is not the only choice.\n\n  If we are serious about this, I will tell you how you can get around \nit. There are some great Senators who are independently wealthy. We all \nagree that is not the point we are making. And maybe there are some \nothers who are not so great. That isn't the point. The point is, if you \nwant to deal with this problem, then you have a clean money, clean \nelection proposal; you have public financing. People agree on that. And \nthen the public owns the elections.\n  If someone says they do not want to be bound by spending limits, they \ndo not want to take part in clean money, clean elections, then you know \nthe way it works. The Presiding Officer knows. She is from Maine. Then \nthere is additional money that can go to candidates to make up for the \nadvantage that those who are spending their own resources have to make \nit a level playing field. But the race still belongs to the public. It \nstill belongs to the people. And then the people who get elected belong \nto the people. And then the Capitol belongs to the people. And then the \nGovernment belongs to the people. And then people have more confidence \nin the political process. And people think they can be more involved. \nAnd little people, who do not have all the money, feel more important. \nAnd they are more important.\n  This amendment is not a great step forward. This is one big, huge, \ngigantic leap backward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a brief \nstatement?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. On our side, whatever time remains on behalf of Senator \nDaschle, I give that allotment of time to Senator Feingold. He can \nallot the time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this amendment. I believe \nI have some personal experience which I will share with the Senate. It \nhas to do not with a general election but with a primary.\n  That is an issue that sometimes we forget because there are many \nStates where the primary is the ultimate election--States that are \noverwhelmingly Democratic, such as the State of Massachusetts, and \nStates that are overwhelmingly Republican, quite frankly, such as the \nState of Utah.\n  The real contest in 1992, when I ran for the Senate, was the primary, \nwhich I won by about 10,000 votes, compared to the general election, \nwhich I won by 180,000 votes. Percentage-wise, I won the primary 51.5 \nto 48.5. I always add the half to make it sound as if it was a better \nvictory than just 51-49. I won the general election by a 16-point gap.\n  So the primary was the big issue. I had to spend my own money in that \nprimary race. I remember a conversation with the then-chairman of the \nSenatorial campaign committee, Mr. Gramm of Texas, who warned me with \nthe following story about the perils of spending your own money. He \ntalked about the two fellows in Texas--I don't remember their names so \nI will call them Joe and Bill--who both put their own money into the \nrace. At the end, on election night, when Joe had won, Bill said to \nhim: Joe, if I had known you were going to spend $4 million of your own \nmoney, I would never have gotten in the race, to which Joe said: Bill, \nif I had known I was going to spend $4 million of my own money, I would \nnever have gotten into the race.\n  You get caught up in these things and the money starts coming. And if\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nyou have it, you just keep saying, well, another $100,000, another \nflight of ads, another mailing, and that will put us over the top. Then \nyou look back and say: I shouldn't have done it. I spent too much \nmoney.\n  In our primary race, my opponent, a man of considerable means, spent, \nwe now know, after all of the tallying up has been done, $6.2 million \nin the State of Utah in the primary. I know there are some States where \n$6.2 million does not seem to be a lot. That happened to be more than \nwas spent that same year in the Republican primary in California in \ntotal, of all of the candidates. It worked out, in terms of the number \nof votes--I know the Senator from Kentucky likes to talk about the cost \nper vote--to about $40 a vote that he spent: 150,000 votes, roughly, $6 \nmillion, about $40 a vote. He actually spent 6.2 but he fundraised \n$200,000. The other $6 million was out of his own pocket.\n  In order to win that primary, I spent around $2 million. I wasn't as \nsuccessful as my opponent. I couldn't raise $200,000 because everybody \nwas sure my opponent was going to win. The only amount of money I got \nwas from members of my family, a few very close friends who felt sorry \nfor me, and a couple of others who came across because they decided \nthey believed in me. I spent about $2 million or one-third the amount \nmy opponent spent.\n  The point of this, with respect to the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Mexico, comes from a conversation I had with the candidate for \nGovernor, as we were talking about that primary race and the way it was \nbeginning to turn. As it started out, as you might imagine, with my \nopponent spending $6 million of his own money, it was assumed he was \ngoing to win. Everybody thought I was wasting my time; everybody \nthought I was crazy. Then it began to turn. It began to shift. You \ncould feel it.\n  Those of us who have been in campaigns know how that goes. You are \nout on the hustings. You just get a feel for the way people are \nbeginning to think. This other candidate who was out on the hustings, \ntoo, running for governor, said: It is beginning to shift. It is \nbeginning to turn. It is beginning to come your way, and it looks as if \nyou are going to make a race out of it. Indeed, you might even win. \nThen he made the key point that is appropriate to the amendment of the \nSenator from New Mexico. He said: Of course, you are the only candidate \nwho could have done this. You are the only candidate who could have \ncaused this coronation not to happen.\n\n  I don't think he was talking about my political skills, although I \nhave a big enough ego to assume that I have some. He was talking about \nthe fact that I could fund my campaign in a style to compete against \nthis self-funded candidate who was funding his campaign.\n  Assume that I went into that race without having $2 million of my own \nmoney. Assume I went into that race having to raise the money $1,000 at \na time. Assume I went into that race having to go around and plead with \npeople to help me. It is very clear I would not have raised $100,000. \nIt is very clear I would not have been able to buy a single television \nad. All of the money I could have raised would have been eaten up in \nfundraising costs. The only way I was able to compete against a self-\nfunded candidate and, indeed, win was the fact that I had my own funds \nso that there was no cap on my spending.\n  I found that spending $6.2 million in Utah in a primary can become a \nself-defeating kind of activity. He ran out of places to spend it. He \nwas buying ads on the Saturday morning cartoons because there weren't \nany other places to buy ads. That caused him, frankly, some problems, \nas people laughed a little bit at that.\n  The fundamental point that the Senator from New Mexico has made is \nthat if I were limited to the standard kind of fundraising activity, I \nwould not have been able to compete with that candidate, as he \nexercised his constitutional right to spend his own money. I would have \nbeen denied the right to express myself unless, as it turned out, I had \nsignificant personal funds of my own.\n  I offer a real-life example of how important it is, when you are \ndealing with a candidate with virtually unlimited funds, for the \nopposition to have something other than the traditional $1,000-per-head \ncontribution. I repeat: If I had lived under the circumstance with only \n$1,000 per head, there is no way I could have competed in that primary, \nand I would not be in the Senate today. There may be many who would \napplaud that possibility that I not be here.\n  I think the Senator from New Mexico has come up with the right \nsolution. If you are going to deal with somebody who has unlimited \nfunds out of his own personal pocket, you have to release his opponent \nfrom the restrictions of the present circumstance. That is what the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico would do. That is why I intend \nto support it. I have lived through that experience. I know how \ndifficult it is for the underdog to raise money under the present \nsystem when the outcome is assumed to be predetermined and how much a \ndifference can be made if the underdog is released from those \nrequirements and given an opportunity to express himself.\n  I had an opponent who outspent me three to one, but because I had \nsufficient money to get my message out, I was able to defeat him. I \nthink we ought to give that same opportunity to every other opponent \nwho has a message, faced with that kind of challenge on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Tennessee 12 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n12 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I regret I didn't get to the floor in \ntime to discuss this a bit with the sponsor of the amendment, Senator \nDomenici. He is, as we all know, one of the more thoughtful Members of \nthis body. Anything he offers I take very seriously. He is clearly \naddressing an issue we have talked about a lot and which concerns a lot \nof us, concerning a campaign where one individual can put in a \ntremendous amount of his own personal money and the other candidate \ndoes not have that kind of wealth and is bound by the hard money limits \nwe have.\n  As I understand the amendment, the well-off candidate would still be \nbound by the hard money limits. If that is the case, my concern is \nwhether or not we are not getting into a constitutional difficulty. The \nSupreme Court has said, of course, that an individual, if they have a \ngreat deal of money, can put as much of that money as they want into \ntheir own campaign. It is a matter of free speech. If that is the case, \nthen I wonder whether or not it would be looked upon as disadvantaging \nthat wealthy candidate if we gave some rights to the other candidate \nthat we did not give him.\n  In other words, if his hard money limits were still restrained, and \nthe hard money limits of the opponent were lifted, that would not be \nequal treatment under the law, it seems to me. Clearly, the wealthy \ncandidate would still probably wind up with more money; he would have \nhis own. But I don't think that is the issue. If, in fact, the wealthy \ncandidate has a right under the first amendment to do that, that kind \nof wipes the slate clean. Constitutionally, you can't consider that, it \ndoesn't seem to me. We have to ask ourselves whether or not raising the \nhard money limits for one candidate and not the other is valid under \nthe 14th amendment equal protection law.\n  I would also wonder whether or not, from the standpoint of a \ncontributor, if I wanted to contribute to a wealthy candidate under \nthose circumstances, under this amendment, if passed, I would be \nlimited to, let's say $1,000. If I wanted to contribute to his \nopponent, the limits would go up incrementally, as I understand it, to \nsay $5,000, or whatever. What about my rights as a donor? Should I be \nrestrained from contributing more to one candidate than another because \nhe has exercised his constitutional rights? I certainly have not had an \nopportunity to study this, and I am not suggesting that I have the \nanswer to my own question. But I do wonder--and I see Senator Domenici \nis on the floor--I say to my friend, if we are keeping the hard money \nlimits on the wealthy candidate, whether or not we have an equal \nprotection problem.\n  I would think the answer to that problem and a way to avoid the \nconstitutional dilemma would be to raise\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nthe hard money limits for all candidates. The wealthy candidates \ncertainly would still have the advantage, but in terms of the hard \nmoney limits they would be equalized.\n  I think Senator Domenici is absolutely correct when he talks about \nthe limits that we placed on candidates in 1974 being very outdated--a \n$1,000 contribution today is worth about $3,300, with inflation. We \nhave hamstrung our candidates and forced more and more money being \nspent in outside ads and, in my opinion, become more and more reliant \nupon soft money. It looks to me as though we could go a long way toward \nsolving the disadvantage, which the Senator from New Mexico has \nrightfully pointed out, that a candidate without the wealth has by \nlifting the hard money limits on that candidate. It would not have as \nmuch significance if you lifted them on the wealthy candidate, perhaps. \nBut you would have the equality and thereby possibly avoid an equal \nprotection problem that we might have under the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator permit me to answer?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know my friend, Senator Wellstone, was on the floor, \nand I didn't get to hear his entire statement. But if you were informed \nby either his speech or something else you read that I take the limits \noff, I do not. As a matter of fact, based on a schedule of how much the \nwealthy candidate is going to spend, we raise the caps for the \nnonwealthy candidates to 2 times, 3 times, and the highest they get is \n5 times, or the most you could raise is $5,000 in individual \ncontributions, and 5 times 5, or $25,000, in PACs.\n  Frankly, I don't think there is an equal protection problem either \nbecause the Senator from New Mexico is not saying in any respect that \nthe wealthy candidate is limited in terms of how much they can spend. \nThey exercise their privilege and their right, which the courts have \nsaid they have. I tried to see if there was a way to limit something \nbecause we have seen as much as $40 million or more spent in a \ncampaign. Since everybody is worried about excessive money in \ncampaigns, I feel very sorry for a candidate who has to raise from his \nor her friends $1,000, and we raise it to 2 and then 5--$5,000--while a \ncandidate exercising his rights can spend 5, 10, 20, and still have \nexactly the same rights in terms of the caps, unless we raise them. If \nwe don't raise them for the nonwealthy candidate, they are going to be \nstuck at $1,000 and $2,000 per election, while the wealthy candidate \ncan contribute as much as he wants. Where would there be an equal \nprotection clause?\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Essentially, as a former lawyer--I am not pretending to \nbe a constitutional specialist here. I haven't had a chance to \ncertainly research this. By the time we finish this discussion, perhaps \nothers will have had time to weigh in on it.\n  I understood the Senator's amendment, I think, correctly. My concern \nis that even though we do nothing here to diminish the constitutional \nrights of the wealthy candidate, but keeping the hard money limits on \nhim while raising the hard money limits for his challenger, we are not \ndealing equally with regard to the hard money limits. Obviously, the \ndollars are different. The dollars will undoubtedly be outweighed in \nfavor of the wealthy candidate. But in terms of equal treatment, that \nconcerns me.\n  As I said, it also concerns me from the standpoint of the donor. Does \na donor have a right to give as much to one candidate as another? \nShould they have a right to give as much to the wealthy candidate as \nthey give to the other? Is there an equal protection concern there? \nThat, I must say, concerns me.\n  I think we would be better served--and I plan to offer, if no one \nelse does, an amendment that would raise the hard dollar limits for \neverybody. I think the answer to a candidate's problem--any candidate's \nproblem--especially a challenger, is to get to that threshold. Not that \nhe is going to be outspent necessarily because most of the time a \nchallenger is going to be outspent, but to raise the limits so that a \nchallenger can get to the threshold of credibility as a candidate.\n  Someone mentioned the State of California. There are other big States \nwhere nowadays a $1,000 individual limit on a candidate makes it so it \nis virtually hard not only to run but to recruit a candidate to even \ntry to run under those circumstances.\n  What we need to do, I think, is to raise the limits for all \ncandidates from $1,000 to $3,000 on the individual limit side. It still \nwould not be keeping up with inflation. My concern has never been the \nconcern the Senator from Minnesota has expressed, when he said what is \nbad is that we are putting more money in the system--I don't think it \nis for me to say how much money belongs in the system or how much \nshould be spent in a general sense. What concerns me is large amounts \nof money going to individual candidates or on behalf of individual \ncandidates.\n  We should not be nickel and diming these individual contributions--\nthe difference between $1,000 and $3,000--when our real concern ought \nto be the hundreds of thousands that are coming in in soft money. So I \nmake the suggestion as one who thinks we ought to get rid of soft \nmoney. If we would raise the hard money limits so that we would not \nunnaturally constrain the ability of a candidate to reach the threshold \nof credibility to run a decent race, he would not need the soft money.\n  He would not need the benefit of the independent expenditures where \nall the money seems to be going nowadays. I am certainly in sympathy \nwith the desired results of the Senator from New Mexico. He is pointing \nout a problem that many of us have faced from time to time. I simply \nwonder out loud whether or not there might be a better way of \naddressing this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator from Utah yield me time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have time on my own amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator want to speak? I want to say a few \nwords to my friend.\n  Madam President, I believe we can cite some cases which indicate that \nthe concern of the Senator of Tennessee about one candidate having \ndifferent limitations under public financing, that they have been done \ndifferently and they have not been held unconstitutional. I ask the \nSenator to think one more time with me.\n  If you look at the effect on individual campaigns for the Senate, and \nif the Senator from Tennessee is disconcerted about the existing laws, \nthen I ask him whether he would not be a bit disconcerted about the \ngrowing number of candidates who spend huge amounts of their own money \nand the opposition is limited to the meager rationing--that is 26 years \nold--of $1,000 per person per election and $5,000 for a political \naction committee.\n  If that is not something that concerns us in terms of large amounts \nof money being put into the system and, more specifically, that has a \nvery good chance of electing a Senator--the other things we are not \nquite sure of--we are worried about some of the abuses of which Senator \nMcCain is speaking having an impact on the public trust and those kinds \nof generic things.\n  I am getting concerned that this Senate, which I dearly love--a while \nago, I wondered out loud whether it was worth $20 million which \nsomebody wants to pay for a seat, but I did that jokingly.\n\n  It seems to me one could conclude that there will be 25 Senators in \nthis place who will have spent their own money to be elected in the \nnext decade, in 15 years, and you would have rendered the opposition to \nthose candidates. They do not have a chance. Maybe I do not have the \nbig-State figures, but they would not have a chance in the State of \nTennessee or my State. If somebody comes up with $15 million, you \ncannot raise the money.\n  I hope the Senator will look at it. This is at least one way to say \nwe do not like that.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I say to my friend, if I can \ninterrupt.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Not only do I share the Senator's concern, I will go \nthe Senator one better. I say not only raise the hard money limits for \nthe nonwealthy candidate, but go ahead and raise it for the wealthy \ncandidate, too. He may not use it. That might make it easier \nconstitutionally.\n  I am in total agreement and sympathy with what the Senator from New\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nMexico is saying. I am trying to figure out a way that will get us \nthere that will stand the scrutiny.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Thompson very much.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the Senator from Arizona 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, Senator Snowe, who has been a vital part \nof this effort with respect to probably the most controversial section \nof our legislation, is waiting to speak. I will be brief.\n  I appreciate very much what the Senator from New Mexico is trying to \ndo. All of us are aggravated and sometimes astounded when we hear of \n$70 million being spent in a Senate race.\n  The way I read it from the handout it says:\n\n       If the candidate exceeds $1 million in personal \n     expenditures, the direct party contribution limits and party \n     coordinated expenditure limits are eliminated.\n\n  It does not say capped; it says ``eliminated.'' If that is incorrect, \nI suggest the Senator from New Mexico fix that. If that is true, then a \nmillionaire can spend $1 million and immediately the other person can \nraise $50 million in coordinated and direct party expenditures.\n  Finally, in all due respect for the Senator from New Mexico, this is \na meat-ax approach to a problem that requires a scalpel. The State of \nWyoming in the year 2000 had a voting-age population of 358,000. The \nState of California had a voting-age population of 24,873,000.\n  Madam President, $1 million in Wyoming, in all due respect to my \nfriends from Wyoming, probably buys every television station in \nWyoming; $1 million in California is a drop in the ocean. This does not \nget at really the different aspects of a small State or a big State. If \nI had $1 million, I could buy a lot of TV in New Mexico. I cannot buy \nvery much in California.\n  In all due respect to a very good-intentioned and well- intentioned \namendment in an area we need to address, including free television time \nfor candidates, including raising hard money as a part of a total ban \non soft money and other ways we can attack this, I think this may be \nthe wrong way to do it. My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I agree with the Senator from Arizona. \nThis amendment is obviously very well intentioned. It tries to get at a \nproblem in the original McCain-Feingold bill. We tried to address the \nissue of wealthy candidates being able to spend unlimited amounts while \nthe others are constrained.\n  The problem is, the Senator from New Mexico does have aspects of this \nthat involve unlimited contributions in response. That is not the same \nas some of the other techniques we have talked about in the past.\n  For example, when I first ran for the Wisconsin State Senate, under \nour State's public financing, if somebody spent too much money either \nfrom somebody else or their own, the State would provide some form of \npublic financing benefit for someone who would limit their overall \nspending.\n  What Senator McCain and I tried to do in our original bill was say, \nfor example, if a wealthy person agreed not to spend too much of their \nown money but somebody else did, the people who constrained themselves \nwould get the benefit of free television time or reduced cost for their \ntelevision time.\n  Those are very different ways to encourage this kind of activity and \nthis kind of restraint than actually having unlimited contributions in \nresponse.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona that this is not the way to go, \nas well intentioned as it is.\n  I yield 30 minutes of our time to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Feingold for yielding \nme this time.\n  I rise today in support of the McCain-Feingold legislation to reform \nour system of campaign financing in America.\n  First, I applaud the sponsors of this legislation, Senators McCain \nand Feingold, for their courage and their remarkable commitment to the \ncause of campaign finance reform. Their determination on this issue has \nbeen nothing short of extraordinary, if not legendary, and it can truly \nbe said that we would not be here today debating this issue if it were \nnot for their leadership. Both have gone to the mat time and time again \nfor this cause, and I commend them for bringing us to this day.\n  We have certainly tried to start down the road to reform on a number \nof occasions during my 6-year tenure in the Senate. Unfortunately, \nthose roads proved to be procedural dead-ends.\n  I thank the leadership for scheduling this time and for committing to \nan open process by which we can have real debate and, at the end, I \nhope real reform.\n  This could truly be our moment. This could be a tremendous time that \npeople will point to in the future when we turned the corner on this \nissue and made substantive changes that will make a real and positive \ndifference in the way campaigns in this country are funded.\n  When one stops and thinks about it, it is remarkable that the last \ntime there were major changes to Federal election law were amendments \npassed to the existing laws in 1979. In 1979, disco was in the \nnightclubs, President Carter was in the White House, and some of the \nstaff we have working in our offices were not even born yet. It has \nbeen a long time in coming.\n  There is little question that there is a strong sense that campaigns \nin this country have spiraled out of control. There is a strong sense \nthat elections are no longer in the hands of individual Americans. As \nthe old saying goes, perception becomes nine-tenths of reality, and the \nreality is we have a system in need of overhaul.\n  Soft money totals doubled since the 1998 elections, with a total of \nover $1 billion in soft money for the 2000 elections. In fact, in 1980, \nwhen soft money really came into being, Republicans and Democrats \ncombined raised an estimated $19 million, according to Colby College \npolitical science professor Anthony Corrado. Two decades later, that \ntotal had ballooned to more than $487 million. This is money that is \nskirting around the edges of Federal campaign finance law, and I \nsupport the soft money ban contained in the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation.\n  The fact is, this is money that was never intended to help Federal \ncandidates for office. It was intended to help build the strength of \nparties, which is a goal I support. But what we have seen is a \nveritable flood of money being given without limits that is very much \ninfluencing our Federal elections. What the public sees is a system by \nwhich access and influence is gained through the size of a check, not \nthe weight of an argument.\n  At the same time we address the soft money issue, I also think it is \ncritical that we address the ever burgeoning segment of electioneering \npopularly known as sham issue advertising. We do so in a way carefully \nconstructed as to pass constitutional muster. I am speaking of \nadvertisements influencing the Federal elections in this country but \nget off scot-free when it comes to any degree of disclosure or any \ndegree of prohibitions normally associated with campaigning.\n\n  Let there be no mistake. The record I intend to outline will show \nthese advertisements constitute campaigning every bit as much as any \nadvertisements run by candidates themselves or any ad currently \nconsidered to be express advocacy and therefore subject to Federal \nelection laws.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for his tireless \nwork. It has been a privilege to work with him and champion the cause. \nI express my appreciation to the sponsors of this bill for including \nthis provision in the McCain-Feingold ban of soft money. This is a \ncritical component and critical element of the overall problems we are \nconfronting in modern-day elections.\n  I have spoken of the exploding phenomenon of the so-called issue \nadvertising in elections. That phenomenon continues unchecked and will \ncontinue unchecked if we turn a blind eye to reality. I am talking \nabout broadcast advertisements that are influencing our Federal \nelection, in the overwhelming number of instances designed to influence \nour Federal elections, and yet no\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\ndisclosure is required and there are none of the funding source \nprohibitions that for decades have been placed on other forms of \ncampaigning. These are broadcast ads on television and on radio that \nmasquerade as informational or educational but are really stealth \nadvocacy ads for or against candidates.\n  They must be doing a very good job because there are more and more of \nthem all the time. That is the trend. According to a 2001 report from \nthe Annenberg Public Policy Center, which has been studying this trend \nalmost since its inception--particularly since the 1996 election cycle \nwhich is where we saw a dramatic change and transformation toward this \ntrend in elections--in the past three cycles we have seen the spending \non these issue ads go from $150 million in 1996 to $340 million in 1998 \nto $500 million in the year 2000 election. In a very short period of \ntime the spending for these issue ads that go below the radar--in other \nwords, they don't require the kind of disclosure, the kind of \nrestrictions that other forms of expenditures on advertisements \nrequire--has gone from $135 million in 1996 upwards of $500 million, \nhalf a billion in the election of the year 2000. In a very short period \nof time we have seen a dramatic growth in the expenditures on these \ntypes of ads.\n  As detailed by a 2001 report entitled ``Dictum Without Data: The Myth \nof Issue Advocacy and Party Building,'' written by David Magleby at the \nCenter for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young \nUniversity:\n\n       The broadcast advertising, used by labor and then copied by \n     business organizations in 1996, unleashed a new dimension of \n     electioneering . . . Permitting electioneering through issue \n     advocacy to continue is an open invitation to individuals and \n     groups to avoid disclosure requirements and contribution \n     limits.\n\n  That is the essence of what we are talking about. We are talking \nabout disclosure. We are talking about sunlight, not censorship. We are \ntalking about the public's right to know. We are talking about citizens \nmaking informed decisions about the quality and sources of the \ninformation they receive from messages that are influencing their \nvotes.\n  How does the Snowe-Jeffords provision address this issue? It is \nsimple and straightforward. First, we require disclosures on groups and \nindividuals running broadcast ads within 30 days of a primary, 60 days \nbefore a general election that mention the name of a Federal candidate \nor show a likeness of a Federal candidate. The disclosure threshold is \n$1,000 for each individual donor for that organization that sponsors \nsuch an ad that runs in that window, 60 days before a general election, \nthat mentions a Federal candidate.\n  That $1,000 trigger is five times the contribution amount that \ncandidates are required to disclose. We create a higher threshold, a \n$1,000 donation to any organization that engages in this kind of \nadvertising 60 days before a general election and 30 days before \nprimary.\n  Second, it prohibits the use of union, of corporation treasury money, \nto pay for these ads, in keeping with longstanding provisions of law. \nAs the next chart shows, corporations have been banned from directly \nparticipating in Federal elections since 1907. That is not a dramatic \nchange in law. It has been that way for virtually a century. The same \nis true when it comes to labor unions' direct participation in making \npolitical contributions to elections. They have been prohibited since \n1947. Both of these prohibitions have been in law for a very long \nperiod of time.\n  The law said in 1947, when it came to the Taft-Hartley Act, when it \ncame to unions, it is unlawful for any national bank or any corporation \norganized by the authority of any law of Congress to make contributions \nor expenditures in connection with any election to political office.\n  That is what it comes down to. It is clear; it is common sense; it is \nconstitutional; it is not speech rationing but informational, \ninformation that the public has the right to know.\n  Indeed, there is nothing in this provision that bans any form of \nspeech. We are saying if an organization or an individual spends more \nthan $10,000 per year on broadcast ads, you cannot use union or \ncorporation money. That is the only ban on anything in this amendment. \nIf you do decide to engage in that kind of advertising, you have to \ndisclose who is bank rolling the ads if you donate more than $1,000. \nYou have to disclose the identity of the organization and the donor.\n  We are not requiring every group to disclose entire membership lists, \nonly the major sponsorships of these advertisers because it tells us \nsomething about the message being sent. We developed this approach in \nconsultation with noted congressional scholars and reformers such as \nNorm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute; Joshua Rosenkrantz, \ndirector of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU; and Daniel Ortiz, \nJohn Allan Love Professor of Law at the University of Virginia School \nof Law.\n  This provision is narrowly and carefully crafted and based on the \nprecept that the Supreme Court has made clear that for constitutional \npurposes, campaigning--make no mistake about what these ads do; these \nare campaign ads; they are not issue advocacy ads--is different from \nother speech. It is built upon the bedrock of legal and constitutional \nprinciples extending current regulations cautiously and only in the \nareas in which the first amendment is at its lowest threshold.\n  We will hear a lot of statements throughout the next 2 weeks about \nthe Supreme Court's landmark decision in Buckley vs. Valeo, arguing if \nan ad is not what is known as express advocacy, if it does not include \nthe so-called magic words such as ``vote for candidate X'' or ``vote \nagainst candidate X'' then we cannot impose disclosure requirements and \nwe cannot place source restrictions on their spending. Period. End of \nstory.\n  I refute that mistaken notion. I want to say emphatically that such \nan interpretation of Buckley is not the end of the story--far from it. \nYou do not have to take my word for it. As a Brennan Center report from \nthe year 2000 said:\n\n       We must recognize that, as a legal matter, Congress is not \n     foreclosed from adopting a definition of ``electioneering'' \n     or ``express advocacy'' that goes beyond the ``magic words'' \n     test [for or against] . . . as long as vagueness and \n     overbreadth concerns are met, Congress is presumably free to \n     draft new legislation that is more effective in achieving its \n     constitutionally valid goals.\n\n  According to the Center's scholars' letter of this month:\n\n       Congress has the power to enact a statute that defines \n     electioneering in a more nuanced manner, as long as its \n     definition adequately addresses the vagueness and overbreadth \n     concerns expressed by the court.\n\n  Certainly, this provision is not vague. We draw a bright line. Anyone \nwill know that running ads more than $10,000 in a given year, \nmentioning a Federal candidate 30 days before a primary, 60 days before \na general election, and seen by that candidate's electorate, being \naired in that candidate's district or State, will be covered by this \nprovision. Anyone not meeting any single one of those criteria will not \nbe affected.\n  As to the issue of broadness or overbreadth, again quoting the \nBrennan Center letter:\n\n       A restriction that covers regulable speech can be struck if \n     it sweeps too broadly and covers a substantial amount of \n     constitutionally protected speech as well. But under the \n     overbreadth doctrine, the provision will be upheld unless its \n     overbreadth is substantial. A challenger cannot topple a \n     statute simply by conjuring up a handful of applications that \n     would yield unconstitutional results.\n\n  The empirical evidence demonstrates that this provision and the \ncriteria included in this amendment are not ``substantially \noverbroad.'' The fact of the matter is, we have a body of evidence on \nthese kinds of ads that never existed before, that there effectively is \nno line between the express advocacy and the sham issue ads in terms of \nvoter perception.\n  In other words, an ad that runs, that says, ``John Doe is dishonest \nand corrupt and un-American, call John Doe and tell him how you feel,'' \nis seen every bit as much to be an ad designed to influence a Federal \nelection as an ad using the so-called magic words such as, ``Vote for \nJohn Doe.''\n  As a legislative body, we are allowed to devise a solution to this \nnew problem, and the Court will give it a fresh look. The truth is that \n25 years ago the Court issued a decision to try to cure a previous \nstatute that was poorly and vaguely written, at a time that is now over \na quarter of a century ago. The\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nfact is, the Court has not had any new law from Congress to consider on \ncampaign finance reform in the last 25 years in order to review the \nmatters, in order to review the kinds of trends that have taken place \nthat have reinterpreted law that was passed more than 26 years ago.\n  So it is our prerogative, Madam President, and, I would say, our \nobligation as a legislature, to try to craft solutions to problems when \nit is in our public interest. That is why we have three branches of \nGovernment. We will hear it may have a constitutional question. We have \nnever hesitated when we have deemed it to be in the public's interest, \ngovernment's interest, our country's interest, to pass legislation--and \nin fact in some cases even testing the courts. We did that on the line-\nitem veto. It did not deter Members of the Senate or Members of the \nHouse from voting for that legislation because there were some \nconstitutional questions.\n  The same is true for the flag-burning issue. Many of us are in \nsupport of that constitutional amendment. There have been some \nconstitutional questions raised, but again that should not deter the \nlegislative branch of Government from moving forward on what it deems \nand perceives to be in the Government's interests.\n  Again, as we look at some of the analyses and interpretations that \nhave been done in recent studies on election trends, let me again go \nback to how some of the experts are defining it.\n  In the Magleby v. Brigham Young University study that was done this \nyear, as they said as they defined the uses of political money in \ncampaigns and elections:\n\n       . . . neither the Supreme Court (back in their 1976 \n     decision) nor the FEC had substantial data with which to \n     create their rulings. Dictum was created without data. . . . \n     If respondents see election issue advocacy in the same way as \n     candidate or party communication--\n\n  Both of which are considered ``express advocacy'' by definition--\n\n     then the Buckley distinction is mistaken.\n       This report, appropriately entitled ``Dictum without \n     Data,'' bills itself as ``the first systemic test of the \n     court's assumption that the magic words are a reasonable \n     standard for what constitutes election-related activity.''\n\n  Again, what is most telling about the next chart is the statistics \nthat are represented: The degree to which these ads are intended to \ninfluence the voters' vote. We hear issue advocacy. No one is denying \nthat every group should have the right to issue their ads talking about \ntheir positions on a particular issue. But in this study--again, it is \nanother interesting phenomenon of the current election trends--\nrespondents were asked the degree to which these ads influenced their \nvotes: On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 meaning that the ad was not at all \nintended to influence their vote--in this case it was in the \nPresidential election--and 7 meaning the ad was clearly intended to \ninfluence how they would vote in the Presidential election, how would \nthey rank this ad?\n  Guess what. The ads that they viewed to be the most influential of \nall the ads run were the ones that were run by interest groups that \nmentioned a candidate, that are supposedly issue ads, even more than \nthe ads that were run by the candidates themselves.\n  In other words, candidates who ran their ads that obviously very \nclearly were intended to speak for a candidate on behalf of their \nissues projecting an image, projecting their positions on certain \nissues--those were seen to be less influential than the ads run by \nthese interest groups that identified a candidate 60 days before \nelection.\n  Furthermore, a remarkable 70 to 71 percent scored the election issue \nadvocacy ads as a 7; 70 to 71 percent thought they were more \ninfluential, and 83 percent gave the ads a 6 or a 7. Remember that 7 \nwas the highest point, meaning they had the greatest impact, \nreinforcing the fact that these ads are seen as an attempt to influence \ntheir vote in the days before a campaign.\n  What is even more interesting if you look at this chart, the election \nissues ad, the ones that opponents would have us believe are strictly \nissue ads and are not influencing elections because they do not contain \nexpress advocacy--these election issue ads were seen as more clearly \nintended to be about the election or defeat of a particular candidate \nthan the candidate's own ads.\n  I think this is very illustrative of the problem we are now facing \nwith these so-called issue ads but which really are ads intended and \ndesigned to influence the outcome of an election, and they come out \nfrom under the disclosures and restriction requirements under the \nFederal election laws. That is why they come beneath the radar, because \nthey are not required to be disclosed.\n  We do not know who finances these ads. We don't know the identity of \nthese organizations. All we know is that somebody is spending a whole \nlot of money for these kinds of advertisements.\n  So if you think about it, the ads that the candidates themselves were \nrunning, ads which were automatically classified as express advocacy \nbecause candidates were running them--they were obviously ads to run in \nfavor of a candidate or against a candidate and to get one's votes--\nthose ads were perceived as less clearly intended to influence their \nvotes than the so-called issue ads. So it is no wonder then that the \ncandidates themselves have taken to running ads without mentioning the \nmagic words ``vote for or against.''\n  Again, the Brennan Center, in their report on the 1998 elections, \nfound that only 4 percent of candidate ads used the magic words--4 \npercent. In other words, 4 percent of the ads that were run by \ncandidates, sponsored by candidates, did not use those magic words \n``for'' or ``against.''\n  Keep in mind that there is a legal benefit for the candidates who run \nthe so-called issue ad. So the only reason they would have chosen this \nroute over ads saying ``vote for me'' or ``vote against'' is that they \nbelieved the nonmagic words--not using those words--were more effective \nin getting their campaign message across, which, of course, is what all \nthese organizations found out themselves.\n  Furthermore, the report concluded, as our experience demonstrates, \nthat policy distinctions such as those drawn by the Court and the FEC \ncan have no basis in actual experience. Much of what falls under the \nBuckley definition of issue advocacy is indistinguishable to \nrespondents from party and candidate communication. Yet issue advocacy \noperates under very different rules, which, of course, is to say no \nrules, and has negatively affected our electoral process and candidate \naccountability.\n  We now have established how effective these ads are in influencing \nour elections and how irrelevant the ``magic words'' that were \nmentioned back in the Buckley v. Valeo decision by the Supreme Court in \n1996 have become.\n  Let's see how the Snowe-Jeffords provision dovetails with these ads \nat the end of an election and further evidence as to what these ads are \nreally doing and the role they are playing in our elections, and ever \nmore so.\n  The effectiveness of these kinds of ads is not lost on these \nsponsors. First of all, we know they have gone up from $135 million in \nthe 1996 election to $500 million in the year 2000 election. But let's \nlook at the final months of the election in the year 2000 and TV spots \nthat mentioned candidates--all of the ads we are talking about in the \nfinal 2 months of the election. Ninety-five percent of the television \nspots that aired 2 months before the election mentioned the candidate's \nname.\n  Why would you suppose that an average of 95 out of 100 ads were \ntalking about candidates in the final months of an election? Is that \njust a remarkable coincidence? Obviously.\n  As you see from this next chart, again, it talks about the final 2 \nmonths of the last election and that 94 percent of the televised issue \nspots made a case for or against a candidate.\n  Again, there is further proof of the fact that all of those ads that \nwere run 2 months before an election--the 60-day period that we address \nin this legislation--were ads that were run by issue organizations that \nmention a candidate--95 percent of them. Ninety-four percent of those \nads were seen as making a case for or against the candidate.\n  So obviously they understand that those ads do and will influence the \noutcome of an election because they identify candidates 60 days before \nan election. Ninety-five percent of those ads are mentioning a \ncandidate by name.\n  Let's get the content of these ads. I guess it won't come as a shock \nto all of us who are on the election cycle that 84 percent of these \ntelevised spots have an\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nattack component. Eighty-four percent have an attack component. \nObviously, they are also designed to influence the outcome of a \ncampaign because they are negative advertisements, and, in fact, \nthe interest groups in this last election cycle ran the most negative \nads. They were informational ads; they weren't comparative ads. They \nweren't comparing records, but they were frontal attack ads.\n\n  People have a right to do that. What they shouldn't have a right to \ndo is to run these ads that are clearly campaign ads and yet they do \nnot have to disclose a dime; they don't have to play by any of the \ncampaign finance rules whatsoever. To argue otherwise, frankly, I think \nflies in the face of logic.\n  This record clearly shows that the Snowe-Jeffords provision embodied \nin the McCain-Feingold legislation in fact is not overly broad. But if \nall of that isn't enough, let me tell you something further about a \nreport that was issued just last week that not only confirmed what the \ntrack record already indicates but provided additional proof of the \nproblems we are facing in this election cycle.\n  The report that was issued last week entitled ``The Facts about \nTelevision Advertising and the McCain-Feingold Bill,'' written by \nJonathan Krasno and Kenneth Goldstein, studied issue advertising in the \n2000 election in the top 75 media markets. In it, they ask the \nquestion: ``Would the definition of electioneering created by McCain-\nFeingold inadvertently capture many of those commercials that might be \nconsidered pure issue advocacy?'' Because there is a concern when you \nlook at the Constitution side of the question: What about a group that \nwants to advocate in behalf of their issue in that election cycle of 60 \ndays?\n  Guess what. When they ran those ads by various focus groups, and \nidentified those ads, only 1 percent of those ads were true issue \nadvocacy ads; 99 percent were not. Ninety-nine percent of those ads \nwere not issue advocacy; they were electioneering. Just 1 percent of \nthe total number of ads would be captured by the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision that would have been viewed to be issue advocacy. In other \nwords, just 1 percent of what would be genuine issue ads appeared after \nLabor Day and mentioned the Federal candidate. The other 99 percent \nwere electioneering ads.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court would not knock down \nanything based on a few examples. We are talking about thousands and \nthousands of ads. We are not discussing a provision in this legislation \nthat is overly broad or vague. We are not talking about ads that are \npurely designed to convey an issue. But what we are addressing here and \nwhat we are saying is we are trying to get at the disclosure of the 99 \npercent of those ads that have identified a candidate, that run in that \n60-day period, that clearly are intended to influence the outcome of an \nelection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. I ask the Senator from Wisconsin for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 38 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. On both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 38 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and 60 minutes remaining for the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DODD. How much more time?\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Not even 10; probably about 5.\n  Mr. DODD. I know my colleague from California seeks 15 minutes, and I \npresume others may follow. Why don't you take 10, and that will leave \nus plenty of time for the Senator from California. Why don't we make it \n7. In that way, we have a little more room.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 7 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  In this final report that was issued, we now see an evaluation of the \nrelationship between TV ads and the congressional agenda. I have been \nasked the question: Well, what about a group that wants to run an ad in \nthat 60-day period and we happen to be in session? It could affect \ntheir ability to be able to communicate. Again, it wouldn't deny them \nthat ability, but it would require disclosure when they mention a \ncandidate 60 days before an election.\n  But what is interesting about this chart, and what it illustrates, is \nit tracks the number of candidate ads that run as we get closer and \ncloser to the election. And it compares to the number of issue ads that \nwere run throughout the year in the top 75 media markets, and then the \nnumber of votes going on in Congress.\n  Guess what. The ads that were run by those so-called issue \norganizations tracked the ads that were run by candidates. The bottom \nline shows the votes in Congress. As you can see from the chart, those \nads run by those issue organizations were not done to track what was \ngoing on in Congress. What they were doing was running ads to track the \ncandidate's ads.\n  As you can see by these two lines on the chart: The ads of the issue \norganizations and the ads run by the candidates themselves during that \nperiod of time are almost identical. It had nothing to do with what we \nwere doing in Congress.\n  So, obviously, the intent of these ads, beyond the fact that they \nmention a candidate in that 60-day window before the general election, \nis designed to influence the outcome of the election, not concerned \nabout what is taking place in Congress.\n  So again, I think it is pretty clear in terms of their intent, in \nterms of what they are attempting to do, and what is the focal point of \nthese ads.\n  I will get into a lot of this later because I think this is an issue \nthat bears repeating throughout the course of this debate over the next \n2 weeks, to remind people we are not talking about those genuine issue \nads that Buckley v. Valeo and the Supreme Court thought of 26 years \nago. We are talking about a whole new phenomenon in America in modern \nday politics of which everybody is well aware.\n  So let's talk about the difference between the two ads. We will call \nthis the electioneering ad. It does not say ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst''--again, those magic words. Back in the 1976 Supreme Court \ndecision, the Supreme Court said, as an example, you should use those \nwords ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' to determine that these are \ntruly political-type election ads.\n  But look at new ads that have cropped up, particularly in the last \nthree election cycles, to show you the difference.\n  First, we have the electioneering ad. This is what would be covered \nby the Snowe-Jeffords provision in terms of disclosure. The announcer \nsays:\n\n       We try to teach our children that honesty matters. \n     Unfortunately, though, Candidate X just doesn't get it. \n     Candidate X urged her employer to buy politicians and judges \n     with money and jobs for their relatives. Candidate X \n     advertises corruption . . . Call candidate X. Tell her \n     government shouldn't be for sale. Tell her we're better than \n     that. Tell her honesty does matter.\n\n  Now, can anyone say with a straight face that this ad isn't a clear \nattack ad on a candidate? Shouldn't we know who is paying for this ad \nrunning 60 days before an election with $1,000 donors, when an \norganization is spending more than $10,000 in a campaign period?\n  Now, let's look at the genuine issue ad, which is the difference, if \nwe are talking about a genuine issue ad, which this provision would not \napply to. Again, let's read it:\n\n       This time of the year, the average person's thoughts turn \n     to the IRS. Now we all know one person can't fight 'em. But a \n     bunch of average folks like us can eliminate the IRS with the \n     new Fair Tax Plan, the only plan that's fair to everybody . . \n     . Some things are worth a good fight. Call to join us.\n\n  You could even say ``call your Senator, call your representative,'' \nor you could even provide your Representative's phone number in the ad. \nIf you are not identifying the candidate, you will not come under the \ndisclosure provisions in this 60-day period.\n  That is the true distinction of the type of ad we are attempting to \nforce disclosure on, the ones in which they identify a candidate by \nname 60 days before an election.\n  I think the American people are entitled to know who is financing \nthese ads. That is what this amendment gets to the heart of: whether or \nnot we are prepared to do that at this moment in time, in this \nCongress, and seeing the extraordinary developments in our elections \nand what has transpired to see some of the monstrosities that\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nhave evolved through our election practices that have reached the point \nin time when we are seeing $500 million being spent on so-called issue \nads, sponsored by organizations or individuals of which we do not know \ntheir identity.\n  I think the time has come to develop the approach that requires \ndisclosure that meets and will withstand constitutional scrutiny, so \nthat all Americans will understand who is trying to influence these \nelections.\n  We are not trying to get at those groups that genuinely want to be \nable to convey their message through television broadcasts or radio \nadvertisements. What we are trying to do is to identify those groups of \ndonors who are trying to influence the outcome of an election shortly \nbefore that election occurs.\n  I think the time has come to pass this sweeping reform. Something \nalong the way has certainly gone wrong. The McCain-Feingold legislation \nwould certainly make that difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, no State has contributed more to the \ncause of campaign finance reform than the State of the last Speaker and \nthe Presiding Officer. Not only has the State of Maine come up with \nsome of the most innovative State-level initiatives, but it has sent us \ntwo Senators who have been the stalwarts in our group throughout our \nentire process. We are grateful to the State of Maine for these two \nSenators being here and being such great advocates for this cause.\n  With that, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished author \nof the bill.\n  Madam President, I want to begin by thanking both Senators Feingold \nand McCain not only for this bill but also for their many forays out in \nthe countryside where I think they have really brought home the cause \nof campaign spending reform to the American people.\n  I have had the privilege, as have you, of voting for this bill a \nnumber of times. I will vote for it again. I will vote for it without \namendments, and I will probably vote for it with amendments.\n  This bill addresses a significant problem, and that is soft money. By \neliminating soft money from federal campaigns, I think S. 27 cures the \nmost dastardly problem with the way campaigns are currently conducted. \nI think the amendment that Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords have \nadded to the campaign reform bill makes it an even better bill. So we \nhave a good bill before us.\n\n  Madam President, a while back, when Senator Alan Simpson was a Member \nof the Senate, and we had just concluded a meeting of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Immigration--it was a Friday--I said to Senator \nSimpson: Are you going home?\n  He said: Yes, I'm going home to Wyoming to campaign.\n  I said: Well, you have no notice to set up an event.\n  And he said: Well, I just go to Cody, and I go and have lunch at the \ngrill, and I see everyone in Cody. So that is the way I campaign.\n  It brought home to me how different campaigns are across this great \nland. In California, a State with more people than 21 other States \ncombined, you cannot just go home and, without making plans, go into \nthe corner drugstore and campaign.\n  Campaigns are, indeed, very costly. I have been involved in four \nstatewide campaigns in the last decade. I have raised well over $50 \nmillion: $23 million in 1990, in a race for Governor; $8 million in \n1992, in my first race for the Senate; and 2 years later, $14 million \nin the 1994 election. My opponent in that election spent $30 million of \nhis personal wealth in his attempt to defeat me. In this past race, \njust concluded, I raised $9 million.\n  Now, whereas I support McCain-Feingold as it is, I must also comment \nthat the Domenici amendment we are now considering has a good deal to \nrecommend in it.\n  Let me talk about my own experience, from the 1994 election I just \nmentioned. It was February. It was raining outside. I turned on the \ntelevision to watch the Olympics, and what did I see? I saw a full \nspot--in February--by my opponent--a minute spot in the middle of the \nOlympics. My heart dropped into my heels, and I knew at that instant \nthat I was in for a grueling campaign.\n  In fact, my opponent was able to have what we call a maximum buy on \ntelevision for all but 2 weeks of the remaining part of the year \nbecause he was able, quite simply, to write a check to pay for that \nadvertising.\n  You don't have to hire a certified public accountant. You don't have \nto hire fundraisers. You don't have to spend tens of thousands of \ndollars on computers and so on and so forth. It is a very different \ncampaign if a person has extraordinary private wealth. That is where \nthe Domenici amendment becomes important in all of this because it aims \nto level the playing field.\n  In that 1994 campaign, I saw how important trying to level the \nplaying field is. The fundraising demands I faced were extraordinary. I \nam a pretty good fundraiser. As it turned out, I simply couldn't keep \nup with my opponent's spending. I couldn't keep up with $30 million of \npersonal wealth. I could raise about $14.5 million. And to do that, I \nhad to put some of my own money into that race.\n  What Senator Domenici is trying to do with his amendment is to say \nthat the person who is going to put his or her own wealth into a race \nmust say so up front. If the amount the candidate intends to spend is \ngoing to exceed $500,000, then the opponent of the self-financing \ncandidate can have the hard money contribution caps raised threefold. \nIf the wealthy candidate spends between $500,000 and $1.0 million, then \nthe hard money contribution limits increase fivefold. Over $1.0 \nmillion, and the new hard money limits stay in place, and limits are \nlifted on direct party contributions and coordinated expenditures. The \nDomenici amendment doesn't prohibit wealthy candidates from spending \ntheir own money to run for the House or Senate, but it is an attempt to \nlevel the playing field for their opponents if they do.\n  Increasingly, I see that only wealthy candidates are going to run in \nsome of these big races unless we do something to level that playing \nfield. I understand Senator DeWine may well put forward an amendment to \nmodify the new caps set forth in the Domenici amendment. I would prefer \nto see the caps modified. As I understand the procedure, at the end of \nthe 3 hours of debate, there will be a motion to table Domenici \namendment. I certainly will vote not to table this amendment. It is \nimportant that we try to level the playing field.\n  I also will mention one other amendment I will either make myself or \nsupport, if it is offered by others. That is an amendment to increase \nthe hard money cap per candidate per election. In the early 1970s, \nnearly 30 years ago, $1,000 was set as the hard money cap per election: \n$1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general. That was really fine \nin those days. You could have a lot of volunteer help. There was not an \nin-kind requirement. You could raise money more easily.\n  Since that time, we have had something called inflation. Senator \nMcCain pointed this out the other day. Thirty years ago, a car cost \n$2,700. Now it costs $22,000. The cost of campaigning has risen even \nmore dramatically. I can tell the Senate, television spots have \nincreased. The price of stamps has increased. The price of campaign \nstationery has increased. The price of direct mail has increased. The \nprice of telemarketing has increased. Virtually every aspect of \ncampaigning, from the salaries for consultants to the paper on which \nyou write--all of it is much more expensive today.\n  Frankly, we should increase the hard money contribution cap, either \nto $3,000 per election, which would keep pace with inflation, or at \nleast to $2,000. As I said, I can certainly vote for the McCain-\nFeingold bill as it is. But if candidates are going to have any chance \nto keep up with these independent campaigns, with these independent \ninterest groups that operate without contribution limits or disclosure \nrequirements, we should look at raising the hard money contribution \nlimit. At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment to do just \nthat.\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\n  For my purposes right now, I indicate my support for the Domenici \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my time be charged to the sponsor of the \namendment, Senator Domenici. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJeffords follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't hear the request.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I asked unanimous consent that the time I have used \nbe charged to the Senator from New Mexico, along with any time I might \nhave remaining so that he might use it in support of the amendment and, \nif it is agreeable, that Senator Jeffords might follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I was going to say the time should be \ncharged to me. I don't object to that. I wonder if Senator Jeffords \nwould let me have 3 minutes before he speaks to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nwill be so charged. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, I greatly appreciate her comments. The amendment may \nbe negotiable in terms of how we better balance the playing field, but \nthere is no question that she has hit the nail right on the head.\n  One of the brand new problems of the last decade or so is the growing \npropensity on the part of men and women--great people--who have decided \nto pay for their campaigns with their own money and use the privilege, \nthe right that the Supreme Court has said they have, that that money \ncannot be limited. So we have more and more candidates spending up to \n$5-, $10-, $20-, $30-, even $40 million-plus of their own money. That \nis fine with this Senator. I am not here trying to do anything about \nthat. The Supreme Court has spoken.\n  I have heard from a Senator saying she would support the Domenici \namendment based upon having experienced an opponent who contributed in \nmultiples of $10 million for their campaign out of their own coffers, \nto which she had to respond under ancient laws that limited her to \n$1,000 per contributor, per primary and per general, and $5,000 per \nprimary and general from a collection of people who call themselves a \nPAC. That kind of limitation must have had her spending more than half \nher time raising money while her opponent didn't win but the opponent \nhad all of his time to run and had none of the rigid rules and \nregulations that engulfed her campaign. Sooner or later, we have to fix \nthat.\n  As I said, I wanted to fix it in a big way. My first draft of this \namendment was to take everything off the opponent, no limits. They \ncould do whatever they would like, just as they used to years ago, so \nlong as they listed it. Others have said, no, leave some limitations. \nSo we are in the process-- mine having left some limitations--we are in \nthe process of working with other Senators who would like to refine the \nDomenici amendment. I am willing to do that.\n\n  I thank the Senator from California. I, too, hope if we have a motion \nto table, we don't table it, so if we want to modify it to get a better \nproduct, we can, if that is what Senators would like to do.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to one of our strong \nsupporters and cosponsors, the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I also thank the Senator from California for her very astute \ncomments, especially relative to the amendment of my good friend, \nSenator Pete Domenici. I think that is an excellent start. We are going \nto have a better bill. We have a great bill right now.\n  I thank also Senators McCain and Feingold for the tireless devotion \nthey have shown to this issue, ensuring the Senate would be able to \nfully consider this very important legislation. I especially thank my \ncolleague, Senator Snowe, for her work and for her very excellent \npresentation. I know she has even more to say about the amendment on \nwhich she and I have worked so hard for so many years. Hopefully, we \nwill see a good result this year.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues question the importance the \nAmerican public places on passing campaign finance reform legislation. \nNot only do I think the American public believes this issue needs to be \naddressed by Congress, I believe the desire has only increased \nfollowing the controversy surrounding the pardoning of Marc Rich.\n  Our current campaign finance system has left many Americans \ndisillusioned with the political process and feeling disconnected from \ntheir elected representatives.\n  This is an important factor in leading people to opt to stay on the \nsidelines rather than participate in the electoral process. Passing \ncampaign finance reform will help boost our disturbingly low rate of \nvoter turnout in national elections.\n  I was first elected to Congress following the Watergate scandal, \nright around the time Congress last enacted comprehensive reform of our \ncampaign finance system. I have watched with growing dismay during my \nover twenty-five years in Congress as the number of troubling examples \nof problems in our current campaign finance system have increased. We \nwere close to enacting comprehensive campaign finance reform in 1994, \nand I am the most confident now since that time that we will enact this \nimportant legislation.\n  I look forward to a full and open debate on the issue of campaign \nfinance reform in the coming days, and believe at the end that the \nfinal bill should have certain characteristics:\n  It must be comprehensive in nature;\n  It must increase disclosure requirements on sham issue ads;\n  It must ban soft money; and\n  It must help restore the public's confidence in our political system.\n  In order to accomplish these goals, we must come together to work for \npassage of meaningful campaign finance reform. I am heartened by the \nwide bipartisan group supporting our legislation. We have members from \nthe right, left and middle in support of this bill. That does not mean, \nthough, that we will stop working with our colleagues to craft \nadditional ideas to address the problems with the current campaign \nfinance system. My ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive campaign \nfinance bill that will garner the support of at least 60 Senators, and \nhopefully more.\n  One of the most important aspects of any bill the Senate may pass, is \nthat it must be comprehensive. If we fail to address the problems \nfacing our campaign finance system with a comprehensive balanced \npackage we will ultimately fail in our mission of reforming the system. \nClosing one loophole, without addressing the others, will not do enough \nto correct the current deficiencies, and may in fact create new and \nunintended consequences.\n  We have all seen first-hand the problems with the current state of \nthe law as it relates to sham issue advertisements. I have focused much \ntime and effort on developing a legislative solution on this topic with \nmy colleague Senator Snowe, and was pleased that this solution was \nadopted by the Senate during the 1998 debate on campaign finance \nreform. I was also proud to cosponsor the comprehensive campaign \nfinance bill Senators McCain and Feingold introduced last Congress that \nincluded this legislative solution.\n  I feel strongly that the legislation the Senate must ultimately vote \non include some kind of changes to the current law concerning sham \nissue advertisements. We have crafted a reasonable, constitutional \napproach to this problem. Our provision will require disclosure of \ncertain information if you spend more than $10,000 in a year on \nelectioneering communications which are run 30 days before a primary or \n60 days before a general election. It also prohibits the direct or \nindirect use of union or corporate treasury monies to fund \nelectioneering communications run during these time periods. I will \ncome to the floor at a later time to more fully discuss our provision, \nincluding the need for this provision, why it is constitutional, and to \naddress\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nsome of the arguments our opponents continue to raise concerning these \nprovisions.\n  I look forward to a full and open debate on this important issue, and \npledge to continue working with my colleagues to enact comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform into law this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Daschle, I extend 15 \nminutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, I rise in support of \nthe Domenici amendment. I want to salute my colleague from New Mexico. \nI think he is addressing a very serious concern that all of us--not \njust Members of the Senate and candidates but every American--should \nshare. When the Supreme Court decided over 25 years ago, in the case of \nBuckley v. Valeo, that we could not limit the amount of personal wealth \nthat a candidate could spend in a campaign, they said it was a tribute \nto free speech; that the wealthiest among us should be able to spend as \nmuch money as they have or want to spend to become candidates for \npublic office.\n  Sadly, our system of government, and certainly our system of \npolitical campaigns, is geared so that those with the most money can \noverwhelm candidates of modest means. I think candidates in America are \nnow broken down into two categories. I call them M or \nmegamillionaires and mere mortals. I happen to be in the second \ncategory. If you are a mere mortal running for office nowadays, you \nspend every waking moment on the telephone trying to figure out ways to \nraise the literally millions of dollars necessary for your election \ncampaign. This is a reality.\n  In a State such as mine, Illinois, it will cost you $10 million to \n$15 million to be elected to the Senate. That is not an uncommon amount \nor an extraordinarily large amount; that is reality. It reflects the \ncost, primarily, of radio and television. I will be offering an \namendment during the course of the debate with some colleagues that \naddresses the cost of television in particular because we have this \nstrange anomaly where we say the television stations have to give \ncandidates for office the lowest rate available on the station. Yet, \nbecause of a few loopholes in the law, they end up offering us what is \nknown as preemptable time, which means anybody who offers 50 cents more \ncan knock our ad off the air. So it becomes a bidding war.\n  We find in every 2-year period of time, the cost of television is \ngoing up 20 percent. What does it mean? For a candidate for reelection \nin the Senate, every 6 years the same amount of television that was \nbought 6 years before will cost 60 percent more. That is the escalation \nof costs in campaigns.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of McCain-Feingold. I think they are \naddressing a serious problem in our system, where we have this \ndiscrepancy between soft money and hard money. But at the root of the \nproblem in American campaigns is the amendment offered by Senator \nDomenici which goes after the self-funding, the very wealthy candidate, \nand the cost of media. If we are going to have meaningful campaign \nfinance reform, I think we need to address both. I lament the fact that \nthis has become a bidding war. I think Senator Domenici would agree \nwith me on that. What else can we do with a Supreme Court decision that \nallows individuals to spend literally millions of their own money while \nmere mortals running for office are trying to keep up.\n  The Senator waives some of the limitations on the hard money we can \nraise, but I ask the Senator if he will answer this question: The \nSenator makes it clear in his amendment that all of the money we raise \nand spend must be accounted for, dollar for dollar, as to source and \nhow we are raising it, how we expend it. There is no mystery involved \nin this. Will the Senator agree with that statement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree 100 percent. I failed to mention that I have \nthis in the amendment. We take a lot of the caps off so the nonwealthy \ncandidate, the mere mortal, can have a chance at raising significant \nmoney to run against a multimillionaire candidate. But we say if that \ncandidate who had the caps raised so they can accommodate--if they have \nmoney left over from their campaign, they have to return it to the \npeople from whence they got it. In other words, they cannot raise more \nthan they need and hold it for another campaign. Whatever they use in \nthat campaign, fine; what they don't, they have to return.\n  The Senator from Illinois has just stated it as well as anyone. I \nhave told some people I had this amendment, and they said, ``Why are \nyou doing that? Senators don't have those caps on them, do they?'' See, \nthey don't know that for 26 years, since post-Watergate, we have been \nlimited--you in your campaign and the New Mexico Senator in his \ncampaign--to $1,000 per each individual from wherever, your State or my \nState. Then $1,000 in the primary and general. That is all--$2,000. \nAlong comes a wealthy candidate and plunks down $10 million. I should \nhave figured it up and put on a chart how much time it probably took to \nraise the equivalent of this $1,000 and $2,000 bracket.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may respond, I liken it to building a skyscraper a \nbrick at a time. Here we have a wealthy individual who decides his or \nher idea of a fundraiser is pouring a nice glass of wine, writing a \npersonal check for millions of dollars to his campaign, and declaring \nsuccess.\n  Meanwhile, mere mortals, other candidates trying to be involved have \nto raise money phone call after phone call, letter after letter, small \ncheck after small check, all disclosed, all accounted, trying to build \na skyscraper of equal height to the person who has written one check \nfor millions of dollars to their campaign.\n  I agree with the critics of this amendment who say isn't it sad it \nhas become competition for money. But as long as Buckley v. Valeo says \nwe cannot limit the amount being spent by an individual from their own \nwealth on a campaign, there is no other way to make certain we have a \nlevel playing field and, I guess, fairness in the basic election \ncampaigns.\n  Senator Domenici is a proud Republican. I am a proud Democrat. We \nboth view the system with alarm. If you do not deal with this \nphenomenon of people who have this much money to put into the campaign, \nhow can you attract candidates from either political party to get \ninterested?\n  It is bad enough that it is a pretty hectic life. I enjoy it, and I \nam glad I am in it. I am happy the people of Illinois gave me a chance. \nIt is tough when there are these invasions of your privacy. You give \nthat up. That is one of the first things to go, and people say: To \nreward you for running for office, we are going to personally let you \nraise $1 million; won't that be fun?\n  You can walk along the streets of your hometown and people race to \nthe other side of the street to avoid you because they are afraid you \nare going to ask for another contribution. That is a sad reality in \nthis business.\n  Sadder still is a person who is self-funding and has so much money \nthey do not even have to worry about this effort.\n  Frankly, I am so worried this system cannot survive if only those \npeople serving in the House and Senate are those who are independently \nwealthy and do not have to go through the process in any way \nwhatsoever.\n  Also, the Senator makes a good point about loans to the campaign \nbecause a lot of people who are very wealthy do not give money to their \ncampaign; they loan it and say they will be repaid later.\n  Will the Senator be good enough to explain the provision he has on \nloan repayment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be delighted. You cannot have it both ways. You \nare going to put up your own money and say to the electorate: Don't \nworry about special interests on this candidate's part; I'm not \nbothering anybody for any money; it's my own. So you spend $5 million \nor borrow $5 million.\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\n  Isn't it interesting, for the most part, you are not in office 1 \nmonth and you are interested in the special interests. Why? Because you \nwant to pay the loan off. So now you are out raising money. You \nadvocated: Nobody will touch me; it is my own money; I am entitled to \nspend it; I am entitled to borrow it.\n  That is all well and good, but my amendment says if that is the case, \nwhen you get elected, you cannot go asking people to contribute money \nto pay off your debt. That is a very simple and forthright proposal.\n\n  Incidentally, it does not apply retroactively. I am not trying to get \nanybody. I am saying in the future you put the money up and you know it \nis not coming back after you get elected. That is what the Senator is \ntalking about.\n  I think that is very fair. In fact, it should be a condition to your \nputting up your own money, knowing right up front you are not going to \nget it back from your constituents under fundraising events that you \nwould hold and then ask them: How would you like me to vote now that I \nam a Senator?\n  That is what we are talking about. I think you are absolutely right \non that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from New Mexico is right on that point. It is \na fiction sometimes. These loans are made to a campaign and perhaps \nthey will be paid back, but perhaps they will not. Your language makes \nit clear there will not be any effort after the election to raise money \nto repay those loans; you have made that contribution and have to live \nwith it. I think there is some reality.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is probably aware of this, but I want to \nmake sure it is on the record.\n  According to the Federal Election Commission, candidates gave or \nloaned their campaigns $194.7 million from personal and immediate \nfamily funds in the 2000 election cycle. This is up from $107 million \nin 1998 and $106 million in 1996. The $194.7 million in 2000 included \n$40 million from Presidential candidates, $102 million from Senate \ncandidates, and $52 million from House candidates.\n  Think about what we are saying about the men and women who run to \nserve in the Senate. Think about what this institution will become if \nthat is what one of the rules is to be part of the game: That you have \nto be loaning or contributing literally millions of dollars in order to \nbe a candidate for public office.\n  As I have said from the outset, I support McCain-Feingold. They are \ndoing the right thing, but there are two elements that need to be \naddressed. Senator Domenici has one amendment that addresses it, the \nso-called self-funding wealthy candidate. Senator DeWine and I are \nworking on an alternative if Senator Domenici's amendment is not \nadopted.\n  We also have to deal with the cost of media because, unless we deal \nwith that, frankly, all of the restrictions we put on how you raise \nmoney will not address the overarching concern about the cost of \ncampaigns.\n  If we have the cost of television and radio going up as dramatically \nas we have seen it--20 percent every 2 years--there is no way we can \nfashion a law to hold down campaign spending that will work. In a State \nas big and diverse as Illinois with 12 million people, a successful \nstatewide candidate has to be on television. I cannot shake enough \nhands and I cannot knock on enough doors in a State as large as mine. \nTo raise money to make sure I have a chance to deliver the message is \ngoing to be a daunting task unless we deal with how we raise money in \ncampaigns or what television might cost.\n  I note the Senator from California spoke a few minutes ago about \nrevelations that came to her during the course of her campaign.\n  There is one other aspect I wish to address before I yield the floor, \nand that is the independent expenditures, the groups that come on with \nads toward the end of the campaign that are not sponsored by candidates \nor political parties. These are groups that come out of nowhere with \nhigh sounding names and spend millions of dollars to defeat candidates \nor to elect candidates across America.\n\n  In my campaign for the Senate a few years ago, in the closing weekend \nof the campaign, Saturday night I sat down and thought: I am finally \ngoing to get to see ``Saturday Night Live'' on the last Saturday before \nthe election. As the NBC news went off, four ads went on the air. All \nfour ads were negative ads blasting me. Not a single one was paid for \nby my opponent or the Republican Party. They were from groups I never \nheard of. I heard of a couple of them. Some I never heard of.\n  I said: Who are these people? I have to disclose every dollar I raise \nand spend; that is proper; that is legal; that is right. Why should \nthese drive-by shooting artists come in with 30-second ads and never \ntell you from where the money is coming?\n  I will give an illustration. One group for term limits wants to limit \nthe time Members of the Senate and House serve. I disagree with them on \nthat position, and I have been open about it. But I disclose all the \nmoney I am raising and spending to tell my side of the story. The group \nthat sponsors term limits refuses to disclose from where their money \ncomes. I confronted one of their organizers and said: Why shouldn't you \nbe held to the same rules to which I am held if we are going to have a \nfair fight? He said: Oh, as soon as I have to disclose my sources, we \nknow there will be retribution against them.\n  Well, hogwash. In this system, people should be willing to disclose \nwhere their money comes from, whether they are on the right or on the \nleft. Let the American people know who is sponsoring the term limit \ncampaigns in their States, who is putting the money behind them, and \nthen if they want to raise legitimate questions about where this money \nis coming from, what the real motivation is, that gets to the heart of \nthe issue.\n  Time and again these groups come forward and get involved in \ncampaigns. They spend unlimited sums of money, and we never know who \nthey are or from where they are coming.\n  If we are going to end these paper transfers and bring real \ntransparency and honesty to this process, not only should we support \nthe McCain-Feingold basic legislation but we should deal with these \nissues as well. The self-funding wealthy candidates, the cost of media, \nand these groups that are making the independent expenditures, I think \nthey should be subject to the same form of disclosure. I support this \namendment. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join Senator \nDomenici in adding it to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nhas agreed the time of Senator Durbin will be charged to Senator \nDomenici and not to this side, and I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be charged accordingly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOhio, Mr. DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from New Mexico.\n  I rise this afternoon to congratulate my friend, Senator Domenici. He \nhas identified a real problem. Let me notify Members of the Senate, we \nhave received calls asking about our amendment. For the last several \nweeks, Senator Domenici and I have been engaged in discussions and \nnegotiations between the two of us to try to come up with an amendment \non which both he and I could agree. Let me notify my colleagues that we \nare getting closer at this late hour and we hope to have something \nresolved in the next few minutes. I will withhold any comments about \nthe specifics of that agreement.\n  The point is, Senator Domenici has identified a real problem. He has \nidentified a constitutional loophole. It is a constitutional loophole \nthat needs to be confronted. What am I talking about? I think it would \ncome as a surprise to the average American to know the current state of \nthe law is this: Every citizen in this country is limited to how much \nmoney he or she can contribute to a candidate for the Senate--every \nperson in this country, except one. That one person is a candidate \nhimself or herself. Based on the Supreme Court's Buckley case, and \nbased on their interpretation of the first amendment, Congress cannot \nlimit how much money an individual puts into his or her own campaign.\n  We have what for most people, the average person, would seem to be a \ncrazy situation. Everyone in this country is limited to only giving \n$1,000 or up to $1,000 to a candidate for the Senate or a candidate for \nthe House of\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nRepresentatives. However, an individual candidate, if he or she has the \nwealth to do it, can put an unlimited amount of money into his or her \ncampaign.\n  We have seen now in the last several election cycles this phenomenon. \nMost people find it obscene. Most people find it a ridiculous situation \nthat someone can spend $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $50 \nmillion, or $60 million of their own money. As a practical matter, a \nperson who has that much money spent against them has a very difficult \ntime competing, making it a level playing field or even close to being \na level playing field.\n  I congratulate my colleague for his concern about this problem. The \nsolution, quite candidly, is not to, of course, limit what a person can \nput into the campaign. We cannot do that. We cannot stop someone from \nputting an unlimited amount in their campaign. The only way to do that \nis to change the Constitution. What we can do is give the other person, \nthe person who is faced with doing battle with that person who is \nputting $10 million, $20 million, or $30 million of their own in the \ncampaign, we can give their opponent some ability to compete.\n  Senator Domenici does this in several different ways. The amendment I \nhave will also do so. The amendment I will be proposing raises the \ndollar amounts a person can give to an individual candidate. We raise \nit on a sliding scale based on two factors. One, the size of the State; \nthe other, based upon how much money that individual millionaire puts \ninto his or her own campaign. At one level, we raise the donor limits \nfor the other person to one amount, and we keep racheting it up.\n\n  I believe it fits the constitutional requirements of proportionality. \nWe have cases we can supply to any Members of the Senate who want to \nlook at that. We believe it therefore is, in fact, constitutional.\n  The reality is each Member who has gotten to the Senate knows how \nmuch they can raise in their individual State under the current limits. \nI will take the Chair's home State and my home State of Ohio. In the \npast election cycles, going back to 1988, no one has raised more than \n$8 million in the State of Ohio for any of those campaigns for the \nSenate. It stayed fairly constant over that period of time. Taking our \nState as an example, if someone was running against a millionaire in \nthe State of Ohio and they wanted to put in $20 million, that person \nwho put in their own $20 million would have a tremendous advantage over \nanother candidate who did not have his or her individual wealth. Based \non what we have seen in the last 12 years in Ohio, $8 million is about \nall you can raise. So you have one candidate with $20 million of their \nown, another candidate with $8 million maximum that he or she can \nraise.\n  The DeWine and Domenici amendments--and we do it in different ways--\nbegin to level the playing field, making it easier for that candidate \nrunning against the millionaire to raise money. You still have to get \nit from individuals, but it makes it easier to do it. It would not \nlevel the playing field. I don't think there is anything to do to level \nthe playing field, but it moves it a little closer and makes that race \na lot more competitive.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico for yielding me time, and I \ncongratulate him for identifying a real problem. I notify Members of \nthe Senate and those who have asked about the DeWine amendment we have \nshared with Members, Senator Domenici and I, as well as others, are \ninvolved in negotiations and we hope to work out those differences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding the Senator from New Mexico and \nthe Senator from Ohio are hoping to work out an amendment that is \nmutually agreeable.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is absolutely correct. We are working on it now. We \nhope to have something in the next half hour.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 23\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nminority has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding this vote occurs at 6:15, but \nif I added up the minutes correctly it carries past that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It goes beyond that time.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are some who made a request that it \nwould be very helpful if the vote would be at 6 o'clock rather than at \n6:15.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the distinguished assistant Democratic \nleader, we are checking on the 6 o'clock time and should know \nmomentarily whether or not that would be agreeable.\n  Mr. REID. We have a couple of Members over here who would like to \nhave the vote sooner if at all possible.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am told there is an objection on this side to moving \nthe vote up to 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection on the majority side to the \nvote at 6 o'clock.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 3 minutes to my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are facing a real crisis in campaign \nfinance in this country. We have effectively no limits on campaign \ncontributions, even though the law seems to provide that there be a \n$1,000 contribution limit from an individual, $5,000 from a PAC, and so \nforth. Because of the soft money expenditures, we in effect have no \nlimits on campaign contributions anymore despite the law. The law has \nbeen evaded, avoided, bypassed, mainly now financing television ads, \noften negative, called issue ads.\n  I think most of us who have seen these issue ads who have been in \nthis profession long enough recognize that there is no difference \nbetween the issue ad which does not name the candidate and says that \nyou should vote against him, and the issue ad which says this candidate \nis great or his opponent is awful but doesn't use the magic words \n``vote for'' or ``vote against'' and the candidate ad which uses the \nmagic words ``vote for'' or ``vote against.''\n  At hearings we have held at the Governmental Affairs Committee, we \nput these television ads on the screen right next to each other. There \nis no reasonable person who could reach the conclusion that the ad \nwhich is paid for with soft money is anything different, in 95 percent \nof the cases, from the ad which is paid for in hard money.\n  So we have now trashed the limits on contributions that exist in the \nlaw. Hopefully, McCain-Feingold is going to restore those limits. But \nthe first amendment which is offered to this, it seems to me, goes in \nthe wrong direction and opens up a number of loopholes, No. 1, but \nalso, it seems to me, is not workable the way it is written.\n  I can understand the frustration of running against somebody who is \neither partly self-financed or totally self-financed. It seems to me \nthere is a way in which we ought to try to address that. But we surely \nshould not try to address that by blowing the caps on party \ncontributions, which is what this amendment does.\n\n  I do not think we should do that by having a process here which is \nunworkable because it is not graduated from State to State. Somebody in \na State with 30 million people is given the opportunity to raise these \nfunds from all of the contributions from the people who contribute \ndirectly to the campaign in multiples, the same as somebody who comes \nfrom a small State, giving the person who comes from a larger State a \nmuch greater advantage over someone coming from a smaller State, \nalthough they are both running against the person who is putting in \ntheir own money.\n  I wonder if the Senator will yield 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the first amendment that comes before the Senate is an \namendment which is written in a way to eliminate any limit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Was consent just asked for something?\n  Mr. REID. Three more minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the first amendment that comes before us blows the caps \non\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nparty contributions altogether in the case that somebody partly self-\nfinances a campaign. Second, it has a procedure here which doesn't \nstrike me as being either fair or workable. It is unfair because it is \nnot graduated, giving candidates who run against somebody who is partly \nself-financing very different rights and opportunities, because the \nperson who has a large number of hard money contributors gets a much \ngreater opportunity to raise money than somebody who has a small number \nof hard money contributors, presumably somebody from a smaller State. \nSince there is no gradation in terms of the States, all the States are \nbeing treated the same, despite the fact that there are some very \nobvious differences.\n  Finally, it seems to me this is an impractical approach because of \nthe trigger, the trigger being the candidate has to file a declaration, \nwhen the declaration of candidacy is filed, to declare whether or not \nhe or she intends to spend personal funds of a certain amount. That \nintention can be honestly ``no'' at the beginning of a campaign, but \nnear the end of a campaign the temptation is great. If somebody near \nthe end decides to borrow a half million dollars, then that person has \na decided advantage which is not corrected by this amendment. Even \nthough you have to file a notice within 24 hours, it could come far too \nlate for the person who is disadvantaged by this large amount of money \nto do anything much about it.\n  So it seems to me, for all these reasons, this amendment is not the \nright approach to a problem. But it is a problem. I want to acknowledge \nthe Senator from New Mexico has identified, as have a number of people \non this floor, a problem which is a real one, which is what happens in \nthe case of somebody who is either partly self-financed or fully self-\nfinanced, as to what do you do about the person running against that \nindividual.\n  We have that problem now. I don't think this amendment solves it in a \npractical or a fair way or in an evenhanded way. But that does not mean \nthe problem does not exist. I hope we will continue to try to work on \nsome practical way, which doesn't blow caps, to address that problem.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Alabama 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nallowing me to speak on this amendment. It is something about which I \nhave felt strongly for a long time. I find absolutely nothing \nunreasonable or unfair about the Domenici proposal. I think it fits \nprecisely the circumstances in a very realistic way.\n  I remember when I was running for the Senate in 1995, a prominent \nleader was on television. He said: People are going out deliberately \nrecruiting millionaires to run for office. In fact, he said, we are \ncreating a millionaires club, particularly in the Senate.\n  Since I was running in a Republican primary, facing seven different \ncandidates, two of whom were spending over $1 million of their own \nmoney, I listened to that. It meant a lot to me at the time. Two others \nin that race I think spent approximately a half million dollars each in \nthe race. It was a total of $5 million spent by my opponents, and I was \nable to raise $1 million in that primary and was able to win that \nprimary.\n  I am not complaining about the Supreme Court ruling that says a \nmillionaire, multimillionaire, or billionaire can spend all he or she \nwants to spend. What I am saying is we have all these restrictions on \npeople who have to raise money. It limits their ability to raise money. \nThen a wealthy candidate can waltz in out of left field with hundreds \nand hundreds of millions of dollars in his account and can just \noverwhelm their opponent, and it creates, I believe, an unfair \nsituation.\n  I think it is very difficult for anyone to contend this is not an \nunfair situation. We can deal with it, in my view. Senator Domenici has \ngiven a lot of thought to it. He and I have talked for some time about \nthis. I believe he has moved in a direction that can deal with it. We \nare saying individual candidates in a primary, for example, can only \nraise $1,000 from a contributor to combat the money that was poured in \nit by a wealthy opponent. I believe we have an unfair situation. It \nmakes it difficult for candidates to run on a level playing field.\n\n  I was a former Federal prosecutor and attorney general of Alabama at \nthe time of my campaign. I had two children in college. I had some \npublic service experience. I wanted to take my record to the people of \nAlabama. We were able to raise enough money. I didn't have any problem \nasking people for money. I was able to raise enough money to get my \nmessage out and win in a runoff in that primary.\n  But it really creates an unlevel playing field if I am restricted to \nthese levels of contributions. What if my opponent had not spent $1 \nmillion? What if they spent $5 million, $7 million, or $40 million in \nthat primary in a State such as Alabama? Could they have gained enough \nvotes to tilt in their favor while a candidate who is a public servant \nis subject to limited funds? I think that is quite possible. That could \nhave occurred.\n  The Supreme Court, in my view, may not have been perfectly brilliant \nin the Buckley case in suggesting that an individual who has a lot of \nmoney has no potential for corruption. If their money is in one sector \nof the economy--health care, finance, high tech--if that is where their \nwealth is and maybe they have another billion dollars of investment, \nthey have a lot to lose. Who says they are more or less corrupt than \nsomebody such as the Senator from Alabama who worked as attorney \ngeneral and took a State salary every day? I don't know. But the \nSupreme Court has ruled that a wealthy person cannot be limited in the \namount of money they can put into a campaign. We are going to live with \nthat. That is what the law is.\n  Let me mention that there has been a trend in recent years of large \namounts of personal wealth going into campaigns. In 1996, 54 Senate \ncandidates and 91 House candidates each put $100,000 or more of their \nown personal money in the campaign through direct contributions or \nloans. In the 1998 general election campaign--that is a final election \ncampaign--Senate candidates gave about $28.4 million to their own \ncampaigns while House candidates gave close to $25 million to their own \ncampaigns. This is compared to 1988 when the Senate candidates used \nonly $9.7 million of their own money in Senate campaigns and House \ncandidates gave $12.5 million.\n  This means that the share of the total Senate donations from personal \nfunds more than doubled--from 5.4 percent to 11.4 percent in 1988. That \nis pretty significant.\n  In the Senate races alone, about 1 out of every 5 dollars raised in \n1994 came from the bank accounts of the candidates themselves. This is \nclearly significant, and I think under the present tight financial \nrules on people raising money it is an unfair advantage to people who \nhave access to unlimited funds.\n  Can there be any doubt why a candidate or recruitment committee for \nany party, Republican or Democrat, is going to look out for people who \ncan put in that kind of money? It gives them a clear advantage in the \ncandidate recruitment process if they can write that kind of check.\n  This amendment, I believe, deals with it quite fairly and justly. \nFirst, it talks about disclosure. Within 15 days after a candidate is \nrequired to file a declaration of candidacy under the Federal law, he \nor she must declare whether they intend to spend personal funds in \nexcess of $500,000, $750,000, or even $1 million of their own money. It \ndidn't say they can't do that. They can. They simply have to state an \nintention. I have to state and have to abide by the rule that I cannot \nraise more than $1,000. What is wrong with asking them to at least say \nhow much they intend to spend? I think that is reasonable. What could \nbe unfair about that?\n\n  Then this triggers the events that occur to give the opponent of the \nbillionaire candidate, or the one-hundred-millionaire candidate, a \nlittle advantage. It sort of balances the scales a little bit. It is \nnot a lot. It is still tough to compete against a candidate who will \nput in $40 million or $7 million. But they don't always win when they \ngo to the American people.\n  If a wealthy candidate declares his or her intent to spend in excess \nof $500,000,\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\nthe opponent of that candidate can increase individual and PAC \ncontribution limits threefold. In the present circumstance, instead of \nbeing able to ask people for only $1,000, it would be $3,000. Instead \nof a PAC giving $5,000, a PAC could give $15,000, to give you some \nchance to compete against that wealth.\n  If the candidate says in his declaration that he or she intends to \nspend more than $750,000, his or her opponent can increase individual \nand PAC contribution limits by five times. It would be $5,000 per \nindividual.\n  If some friends of mine say: Jeff Sessions is getting overwhelmed by \na multimillionaire candidate, they could all rally and try to go out \nthere and help me have a fair playing field. I think some people would. \nThey would rally under those circumstances. But under current law, they \ncannot help a candidate any more than the maximum contribution.\n  If the wealthy candidates exceed $1 million in personal expenditures, \nunder the Domenici amendment the direct party contribution limit and \nparty coordinated expenditure limits are eliminated. Why not? There is \na chance to buy an election by pouring $1 million-plus into a campaign, \nand the opponent can be left helpless. I think that is a good law.\n  It also has a give-back provision that any excess funds raised by the \nopponent of a wealthy candidate may be used only in the election cycle \nfor which they were raised. So they couldn't be used in the next \nelection. Excess contributions must be returned to the contributor, if \nthere is any left after that.\n  It also prohibits wealthy candidates, who incur personal loans in \nconnection with their campaign that exceed $250,000, from repaying \nthose loans from any contributions made to the candidate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the Senator an additional minute of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know there were large contributions in this last \nSenate campaign from candidates of $10 million, $60 million, and other \namounts of money that the winning candidates in this body contributed \nfrom their own funds. I tell you, I am glad I didn't face a person who \ncould write a check for $60 million, $10 million--or $5 million, for \nthat matter. If so, I would like to be able to have a level playing \nfield so I could stay in the ball game.\n  This is a fair and reasonable bill. I believe it is the right thing \nto do. I totally support the Domenici amendment.\n  I ask that I be allowed to be listed as a cosponsor to the Domenici \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have great affection for my colleague from New \nMexico. He is one of my best friends in the Senate. Even though we are \nof different political parties, we do a lot of work together. I admire \nhim immensely as a Senator, and, more importantly, I cherish his \nfriendship. But I disagree with him on this amendment.\n  I understand the arguments being made. In fact, I have been through a \ncampaign where I in fact faced an opponent who was going to spend--at \nleast he threatened to spend--a substantial part of his personal wealth \nto defeat me. So I am more than familiar with how this can work. It \nturned out he didn't spend all that money he said he was going to. But \nat least the threat was there. I know what it means to be sitting there \nin the campaign wondering whether or not you see a person who endlessly \nwrites personal checks in a campaign.\n  I understand the motivations behind this and the concerns about it. \nBut I think the amendment as crafted lacks some proportionality and \nbalance. I admire the effort to try to come up with various triggers \nthat kick in if a candidate relies upon his personal wealth for \ncampaign funds. But this amendment doesn't take into consideration the \nsize of various States. A $500,000 commitment of personal funds in \nRhode Island, or Delaware, or even Connecticut certainly might cause an \nopponent to pause.\n  In Texas, Illinois, Florida, and California, that amount of funding \nhardly represents a commitment of personal resources. Today, that is \nnothing more than a second mortgage on a home. And a trigger allowing \nthree times the allowable funds to be used, I think, is unnecessary at \nthat level of personal funds. If you are getting to $750,000 or $1 \nmillion, again, in a large State, where a $20 or $30 million race is \ngoing to occur, I do not think that amount necessarily is going to pose \na great threat.\n  Remember, we are talking, in many instances, about challengers. We \nare incumbents. As incumbents, we have a lot of advantages that do not \ncome out of our personal checkbooks. Obviously, if we are e-mailing our \nconstituents, responding to mail, having telephone services, and the \nlike, we have an advantage that obviously gives us the upper hand in \nmany instances when facing a challenger who may have personal wealth or \nmay decide they are going to put at risk their family resources to run \nfor public office.\n  I do not want to be in a position where we gut the McCain-Feingold \nbill because of a $500,000, or $750,000, commitment in a race that may \ncost, on average, today $15 or $20 million. That, it seems to me, is \nnot proportional. It does not rise to that level. And that would be the \nnet effect, if I understand the amendment correctly.\n  If a candidate commits $1 million of personal resources, then all the \nlimits on coordinated party contributions come off for the challenger. \nAnd the challenger is permitted to have five times the allowable \nindividual contribution limits. The result is a million-dollar personal \ncommitment by one candidate being met with a potential $10 million \nparty expenditure by the challenger. It seems to me that would defeat \nthe very purpose of what we are trying to achieve with the underlying \nMcCain-Feingold legislation.\n  In addition, obviously, PAC contributions rise to $25,000 per \nelection, above the $5,000 limitations right now, once that threshold \nof $750,000 has been met, as I understand it.\n  So I think there is a way, maybe, to address this issue, but I think \nthis amendment goes too far. It really does undo, at a very low \nthreshold level, a lot of what is trying to be achieved by the McCain-\nFeingold proposal.\n  Again, I understand those who object to the underlying McCain-\nFeingold legislation, the thrust of it. But if you basically agree with \nwhat John McCain and Russ Feingold are trying to achieve with this \nbill--reducing the amount of money in the system--if you think that is \nthe right track to be on, then adopting or supporting this amendment is \na direct contradiction, it seems to me.\n  I understand if you are opposed to McCain-Feingold, then this is one \nquick way to sort of gut it, to undercut it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for one additional minute, if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. So if you want to basically gut the bill, then this is the \namendment, it seems to me. The very first amendment we are dealing with \nhere on this bill, the very first effort out of the box, is to \nundermine what we are trying to achieve.\n  Again, I respect what my colleagues are trying to do, as someone who \nhas faced opponents in the past who have at least threatened to spend \nsignificant personal wealth in a campaign. That can be intimidating. \nBut what you do not want to have happen is the mere expenditure, or the \nannouncement of an expenditure, of equal or greater than $500,000, \n$750,000 or $1 million triggering off the contribution limits.\n\n  In Connecticut that would be a lot of money. But if you are going to \nget involved in a race that uses the New York media, for instance, a \nrace that in Connecticut would be $5 or $6 million, could quickly \nmushroom to $10 million. And $1 million of personal wealth, while it is \na lot of money, that certainly then could unleash $10 million or $15 \nmillion once the party limits are off. And the party limits would come \noff with that $1 million commitment. I think that would be a mistake.\n  So I urge my colleagues who are thinking about supporting this \namendment, who simultaneously want to see\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nMcCain-Feingold become the law of the land, to think twice about this \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question under his time?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, wouldn't it set a bad tone on the first \namendment on this very important legislation--no matter how well \nmeaning the proponents of this amendment might be--to, in effect, \naccording to the sponsors of this bill, McCain and Feingold, gut the \nbill? Wouldn't that set a bad tone?\n  Mr. DODD. I think it would. There may be some merit we can seek out \nat some point. We are going to be on this bill for the next 2 weeks. It \nseems to me, if there is value in trying to do something here, we ought \nto be willing to talk about it. If we come out of the box and adopt \nthis amendment, it seems to me then it would be a major setback in what \nwe are trying to achieve in the McCain-Feingold legislation. I urge \nthose who would be tempted to support this bill to resist doing so, and \nthose who are sponsoring this amendment, if the amendment is, in fact, \ndefeated or tabled, to go back to the drawing board and take another \nlook at how this might be achieved.\n  But this particular proposal, I think, eviscerates what Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold are trying to achieve and what those of us \nsupporting them would like to see accomplished.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield my colleague 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. There is no one I have greater respect for than the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, with whom I came to Washington in 1982. I \nhad the same feeling he had, I say to my friend from Illinois. I heard \nhis very eloquent speech. The fact is, I was of the understanding this \nwould help the bill. But I have been told by the proponents of this \nlegislation that it will not help the bill.\n  Does the Senator understand that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his kind words. In \nour conversations, I agree with what Senator Domenici is setting out to \ndo. I do not believe it is antagonistic to McCain-Feingold. I think it \nis complementary. It is an important element. But I do believe we need \nto take the concept Senator Domenici has brought to the floor and work \non it. We need to spend a little time working on this to bring it to \nwhere it ought to be.\n  I say to my friend from New Mexico, I hope--he, of course, can do \nwhat he would like with his amendment. I cannot support it at this \nmoment, but I want to work with him and work with Senator DeWine of \nOhio to try to find a bipartisan alternative that deals with this in a \nrealistic way.\n  So if Senator Domenici wants to go ahead with this amendment, I will \nhave to join those who are attempting to table it, but only with the \nunderstanding that once this amendment is completed, we will sit down \nin a good-faith effort, bipartisan effort, to address this issue. \nWithout his leadership, we might not even be at this point in the \ndebate.\n\n  I thank him for that leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Eleven. I am not sure I will use all of it. I am aware \nthat a Senator desires to get out of here quickly, and I will do my \nvery best to accommodate the Senator.\n  But what I want to say to the Senate is, I have been working with \nSenator DeWine and others on a modification to my amendment. Frankly, I \ncannot modify it unless there is a consent that I be permitted to \nmodify it. If we move to table it, and the tabling motion fails, then I \ncan amend it. So I would hope you would not table the Domenici \namendment. Because if it is not tabled, Senator DeWine and I, and \nothers, will offer an amendment, which we will then be permitted to do, \nwhich will, essentially, greatly simplify it.\n  It will essentially be that if somebody under this new law indicates \nthey are going to spend $500,000 or more of their own money, then only \nthe individual contributions are increased to three times what they are \nnow--$3,000 instead of $1,000--that if you are going to spend more than \n$1 million, it is 10 times, which is $10,000 contributions.\n  So if somebody was going to spend $20- or $30 million, then the \n$1,000 cap would be $10,000. That is the extent of the changes except \nwe have a loan payback provision which we have discussed on the floor \nthat says, if you use your own money, then after you are in office, you \ncannot pay yourself back by raising money as a sitting Senator.\n  Mr. President, I think that amendment I am going to offer with \nSenator DeWine, which he would speak to at a later date, is a \ncompromise amendment. I wanted to go a little further. But now what we \nare going to do in a few minutes is vote on whether or not to table the \nDomenici amendment. If we do not table it, then we will offer this \namendment. I am sure everybody is listening and at least these \nincreases in caps would pass in the Senate. Only the individual limits, \nthe individual contributions would be changed if we are permitted to \noffer the Domenici-DeWine amendment, which would be a substitute after \nthe tabling motion.\n  So there is no misunderstanding, the Domenici amendment has no soft \nmoney in it. The Domenici amendment is all hard money. Essentially, it \nsays, if you are going to spend a half million dollars of your money, \nthen you get to raise money in return for the candidate who was bound \nby the old laws, the 26-year-old laws. You can raise $3,000 in \nindividual money and PACs are increased threefold. If you are going to \nspend $750,000 or more, it is five times. And $1 million or more, it is \n10 times, as I have just indicated. In addition, we have the loan \npayback provisions in the bill that I have just described, and we have \na provision that the hard money that can come from campaigns is limited \nas it is under the McCain-Feingold.\n\n  Having said that, I would ask Senators who think the time has come to \nsend not a signal but to change the law so that the multimillionaire \ncannot essentially put the opponent at such odds that the opponent has \nno chance of raising sufficient money to run a campaign--we have seen \nmany examples of that of late. I think it is as serious a problem as \nthe underlying issues that are before us on McCain-Feingold. I choose \nto fix them. I ask Senators not to vote to table my amendment, thus \ngiving me a chance to present a modified one that has broader support \nthan the original Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't want to take the floor from the Senator from New \nMexico, but I have to tell the Senator from New Mexico, he has made \nsubstantial and probably significant and beneficial changes to his \namendment. He just articulated them. We haven't had a chance to digest \nthem to see what the impact would be. We have gone a long way from if \nthe candidate exceeds $1 million, the direct party contributions and \nparty coordinated expenditure limits are eliminated. We have to figure \nout exactly what all this means, I say to the Senator from New Mexico. \nThis is legislating on the fly here.\n  What we would like to do, if it is agreeable to the Senator from New \nMexico and the Senator from Ohio and all of us involved, is to have a \nchance to sit down and negotiate this with him. I agree with the \nSenator from New Mexico. I think he has some very good provisions, but \nat this time we would like to be able to examine those provisions, \ndetermine exactly what the impact is, have some negotiations, which \nhave been going on among our staffs. Hopefully, we could get something \non which we can all agree.\n  I am not sure in this very short time period where the Senator's \namendment has changed rather drastically, fundamentally, when we are \ntalking about if the candidate exceeds $1 million personal \nexpenditures, the direct party contribution limits and party \ncoordinated expenditure limits are eliminated--I don't frankly \nunderstand exactly the ramifications of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from New Mexico has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my friend, I am not choosing to amend my \namendment. My amendment stands as it was understood by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona. I am merely stating that I am \nasking, and I now ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to modify \nit.\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All I am saying is, if you don't table the Domenici \namendment, standing there, I will offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator DeWine, and others which will do what I described a \nwhile ago, and you can have all the time you want to look at that \namendment, debate it, and even modify it, if you would like. I ask that \nwe leave the amendment standing so I can modify it. Has the motion to \ntable been lodged against the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table can only be made at the \nexpiration of time. The Senator has a little over 4 minutes, and the \nother side has a little over 9 minutes.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Kentucky that we \nare prepared to yield back whatever time we have on this amendment. I \nask unanimous consent, if I don't have time, I may yield 1 minute to \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has time. The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to say again to my friend from New Mexico, we can \nwork this out. We can do that. By the way, it is my understanding if we \ntable your amendment, you can bring up another amendment anyway, \nwhether it is tabled or not. If we don't table the present amendment, \nthen that will signal that the Senate agrees with that amendment. \nObviously, I do not, nor do I believe does the majority. I emphasize \nagain to the Senator from New Mexico, I think we have made great \nprogress in these negotiations. We are in agreement in principle. All \nwe need to do is work out the details of it.\n  Frankly, I haven't been here nearly as long as the Senator from New \nMexico, but I haven't heard of a parliamentary procedure where you \nwould not table somebody's amendment that you oppose when there is \ngoing to be a follow-up amendment because we have unlimited amendments \non this bill, very soon that we hope we will have worked out together.\n  Again, I am optimistic that we will work out the differences we have \nand it will give us all a better understanding of the amendment so we \ncan make the best and most efficient use of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my good friend from Arizona, it is not a \nquestion of whether there is a procedure like this or not. We have \nestablished the procedure by the unanimous consent agreement we had \nentered into. We entered into a unanimous consent agreement that said \nthat this amendment can't be modified unless we vote on a motion to \ntable it and it is not tabled. We established that rule. I am asking \nthat since that was the rule, we go ahead and not table it and let me \noffer an amendment with my good friend from Ohio and that will be \nthoroughly debated and modified.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from New Mexico. Let me urge the \nMembers of the Senate not to vote in favor of tabling the Domenici \namendment. The Senator has outlined very clearly what modification he \nand I wanted to make. It is a modification that is very logical. It \nturns this into an amendment that improves the amendment. It deals with \nthe proportionality question.\n  If Members do look at it--and they have just had the opportunity a \nmoment ago to hear the Senator outline exactly what it is--they will \nfind it is very rational; it is very reasonable. It is going to be held \nto be constitutional, and it is going to begin to deal with this \ntremendous problem the Senator and I have been outlining, with others. \nI urge my colleagues not to vote in favor of tabling. Give us the \nopportunity to come right back and make the changes and get this \namendment passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just as a suggestion to my colleagues, under \nthis unanimous consent agreement, the only way the amendment could be \nset aside would be, I suppose, a motion asking unanimous consent to set \naside or withdraw the amendment. That is something on which the authors \nof the amendment must make a decision. It seems to me we are fairly \nclose to something that might be agreeable. I don't think it serves the \ninterests of the Senate to have a vote on something where it goes down \nand then comes back again.\n  It seems to me, if the authors of the amendment and the authors of \nthe principal legislation feel as though they are fairly close to \nsomething they might agree on, it would make some sense, rather than \nputting the Senate through a vote, to ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be withdrawn. We can go on to another matter and then come \nback to something we may agree on. We may not ultimately.\n  I don't see the value in having the Senate march down here and cast \n100 votes on something that is going to be changed or modified at some \nlater point anyway. I urge the authors to consider that for the minute \nthat we have before the vote must occur. It seems to me that is a more \nprudent way to proceed.\n  I yield 2 minutes, if I have them, to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I completely \nagree with his remarks, as well as the Senator from Arizona. I am \npleased that the Senator from New Mexico has recognized that his \noriginal amendment just goes too far and there needs to be some \nmodifications. We should try to get together and work this out.\n  There are a couple of items already in some of the modifications he \nis talking about that concern me. A tenfold increase seems to be an \nawfully high number. Perhaps there is another level that could work.\n  On the question of what the threshold would be, $500,000, many people \nhave said, is too low a trigger for these increases. In New York or \nCalifornia, there is a difference. I agree with the Senator from \nConnecticut that the way to do this is to table this amendment and then \nsee what kind of agreement or modification or new amendment can be \nagreed upon by the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Ohio, \nwho genuinely care about these issues.\n  I share the concerns, but we need to do this in a manner that doesn't \nsuddenly put together an act of modification that we don't completely \nunderstand. I ask that Members table this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me explain to everyone that if this \namendment is tabled, the next one comes from the Democratic side of the \naisle. The first opportunity to do something about one of the most \npervasive problems in American politics today, the purchasing of public \noffice by people of great wealth, will have been lost.\n  Yes, it is true we may get back to this later, but there are a lot of \namendments seeking to be offered on this side of the aisle. I don't \nknow about the other side. I hope Senator Domenici's amendment will not \nbe tabled, giving him an opportunity. Normally the courtesy of the \nSenate would give an offeror of an amendment an opportunity to modify \nhis own amendment. Here that is being denied.\n  In the beginning, we got off to a good start, and now people won't \neven let the offeror of an amendment modify his own amendment. Senator \nDomenici is trying to keep his amendment alive so he can offer a second \ndegree which, under the agreement, would be appropriate if the motion \nto table is not successful, which is something normally he would have \nan opportunity to do in the Senate, almost as a matter of right. So \nwhat the Senator is asking for is not inappropriate. It is the only way \nhe can modify his amendment under the circumstances.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call----\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will withhold on the quorum call, I would \nlike to be heard.\n  I hear my colleague from Kentucky. The reason we object to a \nmodification at this point is because of what the Senator from Arizona \nhad to say. This is a complicated amendment, with four different \ntriggers involved. It seems to me the size of States is relevant, where \n$500,000 in Idaho or Connecticut would provoke one response, whereas in \nCalifornia it is something entirely different.\n  The modification is being objected to for the reason that it is a \ncomplicated amendment and it is only fair that the\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\nauthors of the bill spend a little time to look at the implications.\n  My suggestion of asking unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment \nat this point--I don't know about the authors of the underlying bill, \nbut I am prepared to concede the next amendment to the Republican side \nand let them go first again. This is an important enough issue that we \nought to try to reach out to one another, and rather than having 100 \nvotes cast on this amendment as some bellwether of where we stand, and \nif there is an opportunity to reach a compromise, let's do that, and I \nwould concede that the next amendment be offered by the Republican side \nto avoid any conflict.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the motion to table is not agreed \nto, the next amendment will be the modified Domenici amendment because \nhe will be recognized at that point for an opportunity to offer the \nmodification that, normally, Senate comity would allow. So that will be \nthe next amendment if the motion to table is not agreed to.\n\n  Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine will offer the modification they \nhave been trying to get consent to offer and that will be the next \namendment presumably voted on in the morning, depending upon what the \ninstructions of the majority leader are.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A half minute to the sponsor and 4 minutes to \nthe opposition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that Senators not vote to table this amendment. \nGive me an opportunity tomorrow to work with people to modify it. It \nwill be an opportunity for me, as the principal sponsor, to get a \nmodification that I can offer. It will be recognized as the next order \nof business. I ask that in fairness. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am about to make a motion to table. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it. This amendment, if adopted, would gut the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance bill, in my opinion.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 37 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Dorgan\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Mexico, we are \nready now to sit down and negotiate so we can have an agreement on his \namendment in the morning.\n  I believe the Senator from Connecticut has said he could have the \nnext amendment. The only reason we objected to it is because we did not \nhave sufficient time to review the modifications and continue \nnegotiations.\n  I say to my friend from New Mexico, we are ready to sit down right \nnow and negotiate. I think we are very close to an agreement so we can \nget this done immediately and move on to other issues.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to thank the Senator from New Jersey \nand the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Again, before I yield the floor, I believe we are very close to an \nagreement. We were before the modification. I also believe that with \nthese negotiations, within an hour we can come up with an agreement \nthat will get a very substantial and majority vote.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. \nHowever, I would just like to reiterate for the Senators present, my \namendment was caught in a parliamentary bind where there was no way for \nme to amend it, other than to not let this table occur. That is rather \nunfair treatment. Had I figured that out in the unanimous consent \nagreement, I would have never agreed to it because most Senators can \nmodify their amendments.\n  I thank those who agreed to grant me that privilege. For those who \nwant to work with us to try to get an amendment, we will do that. I \ncan't do that tonight. We have other things to do around here also. But \nI thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his welcoming a \ncompromise. There will be one, I assure you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me just follow up on what my colleague \nand friend from New Mexico has said. I think it was a shame that we \nwere not given the opportunity to modify his amendment. The Senate has \nspoken. I think it is too bad. I think it is very unfortunate.\n  Having said that, I do believe we are fairly close in negotiations. \nThe Senator from New Mexico and I had reached an agreement that would \ndeal with this problem. It would have been, I think, very positive. I \nam confident, from talking to some of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, as well as friends on this side, that we still can, within a \nrelatively short period of time, reach agreement and come back to the \nSenate with an amendment to which we can in fact agree, and we intend \nto do that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The practical effect means the next amendment is to be \noffered by the Democratic side because Senator Domenici was, first, \ndenied the opportunity to modify his amendment; second, the opportunity \nto modify it after a motion to table failed was denied him by switching \na number of Members.\n  The practical effect of all this, I say to everyone in the Senate, is \nthat the next amendment is on the Democratic side under our agreement. \nI am curious as to what it might be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. In light of the events that just unfolded here, we don't \nhave a specific amendment ready to offer at this particular point. As I \nunderstand it, there will be no more votes this evening. We encourage \nMembers who have not made opening statements on this bill, who are here \non the floor, to do so tonight, and then with some consultation between \nthe two of us and others interested, we will try to come up with an \namendment this evening to go tomorrow. I don't know what the timeframe \nwill be tomorrow. The leader is here. I don't know what the agenda will \nbe, what time we will start, but\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\nwe will certainly give you ample notice ahead of time what the \namendment will be.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thought the idea behind this agreement we \npainstakingly entered into over a number of weeks of negotiations with \nthe Senator from Arizona was that there would be an opportunity for \nlots of amendments. Now here we are on a Monday night, getting ready--\nthe majority leader wants us to have a vote in the morning-- I am \nhearing that the other side doesn't want to lay down an amendment.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, we went through \nthis discussion on the Domenici proposal. It may very well may be that \nwe will offer something that would accommodate what the Senator from \nNew Mexico is proposing. If that could be worked out, that may be the \nnext amendment. I think we might be able to do that. If we are unable \nto do that, obviously we will have another amendment to offer right \naway. I know the leader indicated that on tomorrow he would like to \nhave a vote by 12:30. If we come in at 9:30, we will have an amendment \nto offer, and we will be right on the schedule that the leader laid out \nsome days ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just to respond to the last comment of \nSenator Dodd, that is the point. We want to make sure, if you are going \nto take advantage of the opportunity to offer an amendment tonight, \nfine, or we will have one the first thing in the morning. But we had an \nagreement that we would do these by regular order of 3 hours. So \nhopefully you will either have one in the morning or we will be \nprepared to go with one on this side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, since there seems to be so much \ninterest in accommodating Senator Domenici, might it not be possible \nfor everyone to agree that Senator Domenici's modified amendment would \nbe the first one up in the morning?\n  Mr. DODD. I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader and to my \nfriend from Kentucky that the Senator from Connecticut has been busy.\n  I think the amendment--and we will be happy to discuss it in more \ndetail with the Senator from Kentucky--will be offered by Senators \nCorzine, Kohl, and Torricelli. It will probably deal with the same \nsubject matter that was discussed all day today.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think we have done some good work today. \nWe had some good opening statements and considered an amendment. \nObviously, the people involved could do a little work this evening.\n  We will be prepared. At 9:30 tomorrow, we will have an amendment, and \nwe will be ready to vote on it by 12:30, before the respective \nconferences meet.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had prepared to offer a unanimous consent \nthat when we come in, at 9:45 in the morning the pending business would \nbe the modified Domenici amendment.\n  If they are going to work on this tonight, we will be glad to work \nwith you on that. But we have to keep this process going forward.\n  Just one thing on the substance. I think it is going to be a sad \ncommentary if we don't address this issue of candidates being able to \nput unlimited amounts of money in their races without the opponents \nhaving some way to at least be competitive.\n  I hope the Senate will find a way to come together on this issue. I \nknow it has the support of both sides of the aisle. It is going to be a \nbad start of getting to a proper conclusion to this legislation if we \ndon't address this issue. I would encourage both sides to work on this \novernight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I voted to table Senator Domenici's \namendment not because I was not sympathetic with the same. And I give \nhim great credit for bringing up a real problem in our campaign finance \nsystem of very wealthy candidates being able to self-finance their \nraces. That discourages a lot of otherwise very qualified people from \neven running for office in the first place.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico for bringing up an important \nissue. I did not support his amendment because I disagreed with some of \nthe provisions in it. I believe, however, that the amendment he is \nlikely to propose with Senator DeWine is a far superior amendment.\n  I think it was very unfortunate that the Senator from New Mexico was \nnot allowed unanimous consent to modify his amendment. That is very \nunusual. Members usually are allowed to modify their own amendments. I \nthink it is very unfortunate that did not occur in this case. It does \nnot bode well for the debate on this issue for us to start off like \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I can certainly understand the \nfrustration of some of our colleagues as we have attempted to work \nthrough the first day of what is an unusual unanimous consent \nagreement. We are used to a little more flexibility on amendments. I \nthink when we entered into this unanimous consent agreement, our entire \npurpose was to ensure that we could move amendments along. That was the \nwhole idea--that we would make sure that in the process of moving \namendments along, we would accommodate Senators.\n  I hope that unanimous consent agreements, to demonstrate a little \nmore practicality, could be agreed to in the future because I think we \nwill actually accommodate rather than impede our ability to take up and \naddress this bill in a meaningful way.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that I or my designee be \nrecognized tomorrow morning as debate on the legislation is again \nconvened in order to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield under his \nreservation, first of all, I appreciate what Senator Daschle had to say \nabout allowing Senators to modify their own amendments. We need to \ncontinue to honor that practice.\n  Second, I don't see any problem with his request. If he does not act \non his right, then we will be able to reclaim and move forward on our \nside. I don't see a problem with that under the circumstances.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, in \nconsultation with our ranking member, I suggest that our amendment will \ndeal with the millionaires amendment.\n  The Durbin approach I think is one with which many of us could be \ncomfortable. I understand they are talking now about ways in which to \naddress some of the differences between Senator Durbin and Senator \nDomenici. But that will be the subject of an amendment we will offer at \n9:30 in the morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2469-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have a few clarifying comments \nregarding the bankruptcy reform bill which the Senate passed last week, \nDuring the debate on the small business provisions in S. 420, Senator \nKerry erroneously characterized how the National Bankruptcy Review \nCommission voted on the small business changes that were contained in \nthe bill. Senator Kerry maintained that the provisions were \ncontroversial and passed by a narrow 5-4 vote. This was not true. In \nfact, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission voted for these \nprovisions by a vote of 8-1.\n  I also want to clarify another point in the bankruptcy legislation. \nSenator Schumer offered an amendment in committee and then on the floor \nthat changed a provision in the bill that prohibited corporate entities \nin Chapter 11 from discharging fraud debts in bankruptcy. I opposed \nthis amendment since I think that corporations should not be able to \ncommit fraud and get away with it by filing for bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nNevertheless, to accommodate Senator Schumer, I reached this compromise \nwhich prohibits corporations from discharging fraud debts owed to \nGovernment entities or to plaintiffs under the False Claims Act. I want \nto make clear for the Record that I oppose letting corporations defraud \nprivate businesses and individuals, and then discharging those debts in \nbankruptcy. Hopefully, I will revisit this issue in the near future to \nmake sure that corporate scam artists can't use bankruptcy as a safe \nhaven.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank a number of staff \nmembers that were especially helpful in getting this important bill \npassed: Rene Augustine, Makan Delrahim, and Sharon Prost of Senator \nHatch's staff; Ed Haden and Brad Harris of Senator Session's staff; Ed \nPagano and Bruce Cohen of Senator Leahy's staff; Jim Greene and Kristin \nCabral of Senator Biden's staff; Jennifer Leach of Senator Torricelli's \nstaff; and Rita Lari Jochum and Kolan Davis of my staff. I also want to \nacknowledge my former staffer John McMickle who worked on this bill for \nseveral years. In addition, I want to thank Laura Ayoud in the Office \nof Senate Legislative Counsel. This bill would not have passed if it \nwere not for the hard work and tremendous efforts of all these staff \nmembers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record three \nletters from former Bankruptcy Review Commissioners.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              Stephen H.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the people \nof Tunisia on the 45th anniversary of their nation's independence. \nThroughout our long friendship, the United States and Tunisia have \nshared a mutual commitment to freedom, democracy, and the peaceful \nresolution of conflict. Indeed, Tunisia was one of the first countries \nto sign a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the new United States of \nAmerica in 1797, and in turn, the U.S. was among the first to recognize \nTunisia's independence from France in 1956. Our nations have worked \ntogether on many issues of importance over the years, including the \nongoing efforts for a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  Tunisia and its citizens have many successful endeavors to celebrate, \nparticularly impressive strides in economic development and reform. \nTunisia's high standards of living and education, and advancement of \nopportunities for girls and women, stand as testament to its \nachievements. I hope that the growth of political freedoms for all \nTunisia's people will soon equal its economic success.\n  As we observe this important milestone in Tunisia's history, we look \nforward to continued cooperation and friendship between our Nations and \nour people for many years to come.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I extend my warmest congratulations to the \npeople of Tunisia as they commemorate their country's 45th anniversary \nof independence. Tunisians have much to celebrate and be proud of, and \ntheir firm resolve to fulfill their responsibilities as a republic and \nto govern themselves with integrity is most admirable. Tunisia has \nmanaged, in a relatively short period of time, to make significant \ngains on the political, economic, and social fronts.\n  I salute President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for his leadership in \ninitiating and supporting several reforms that paved the way for open \ngovernment. I commend leaders from the public and private sectors for \nbalancing the demands of economic development and social concerns. \nFinally, I wish to praise all the people of Tunisia for their peaceful \nparticipation in Tunisia's remarkable journey from colony to republic.\n  It is my hope that as Tunisians commemorate their country's 45 years \nof independence, they will also celebrate their ancient past and their \nunique cultural identity, which is an amalgam of Arab, Berber, African, \nand European influences. The country's long and rich history has made \nTunisians a resilient and resourceful people, and I am confident that \nthe future of the country will be bright and promising. I look forward \nto many more years of friendship and cooperation between Tunisia and \nthe United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2470-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2470-S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENDING THE INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation for holding today's hearing, as \nit concerns a topic of great importance to the future development of \nthe Internet--how to make sure that our Nation's tax policy keeps pace \nwith rapid technological change.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act recognized that uniformity and common \nsense must be brought to taxation policy on the Internet. The act \nplaced a 3-year year moratorium on State and local taxes that \ndiscriminate against online transactions. I strongly supported the bill \nand welcomed its passage by the Senate.\n  This hearing is particularly timely, as the moratorium on \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce expires on October 21. If \nthe moratorium is not extended, our small businesses across the country \nface the burden of having to comply with the requirements of over 7,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions.\n  I am more convinced than ever of the folly of imposing a devastating \npatchwork of taxes on Internet transactions. I agree with the \nrecommendation of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce that \nwe should extend the moratorium. I would like to add my name as a \ncosponsor to the Wyden bill, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, \nwhich will keep the Internet a ``tax-free'' zone until December 31, \n2006 and will help foster the growth of electronic commerce.\n  Both consumers and businesses will benefit from a reasoned Internet \ntax policy. Growth will create more revenue and an expanding tax base \nfor the future. The empowering aspects of the Internet for small \nbusiness--low barriers to entry and an immediate global reach--must not \nbe inhibited by a heavy-handed government approach to Internet \ntaxation. Extending the moratorium on discriminatory taxes on\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\nInternet transactions will help to ensure that the nearly limitless \npotential of electronic commerce is realized.\n  I would like to touch on another issue arising from this debate, the \nbroader question of whether Congress should allow the States to require \nall remote sellers--be they over the new medium of the Internet, or the \nmore traditional mediums of mail order or telephone to collect sales \ntax on deliveries into states where the seller has no physical presence \nor ``tax nexus.''\n\n  I believe the current rules on whether an out-of-state company should \ncollect sales tax are, in fact, fair and reasonable. Simply stated, a \ncompany is required to collect tax on deliveries into a State if it has \na presence in that State. This rule has served interstate commerce \nwell, and importantly, has not burdened small, entrepreneurial \ncompanies with having to hire lawyers and accounts to comply with 7,600 \ndifferent taxing jurisdictions, and worse still, liability to audit \nfrom States and localities throughout the country.\n  I'm not prepared at this point to support any new tax collecting \nrequirements on remote commerce. However, if this committee were to act \non this broader issue, the Wyden bill's approach, which requires full \ncongressional scrutiny and a mandatory up-or-down vote by Congress \nbefore there is any new tax collecting, seems to me to be the correct \ncourse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2471-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIRED PAY RESTORATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nRetired Pay Restoration Act of 2001, which corrects a long-standing \ninequity that has resulted in a major slap in the face of our dedicated \nservice men and women.\n  Current law bans so-called concurrent receipt of VA disability \ncompensation and military retired pay, so that the amount of any VA \ndisability payment to a military retiree is subtracted from the monthly \nretirement check. In operation, this rule seems to turn logic and \ncommon sense on its head, and its repeal is long overdue.\n  Let's be clear what we're talking about. This provision only applies \nto military retirees, those who have served their country in uniform \nfor at least 20 years. Such retirees receive a taxable monthly pension \nbased on their length of service and their final pay, which is \ndetermined primarily by their rank and length of service. In this \nregard, the military retirement pay system resembles the civil service \nretirement system with which we are all familiar.\n  VA disability compensation is completely different. VA disability \ncompensation consists of tax-free monthly payments to veterans who \nserved in uniform for any length of time and who, during their time in \nthe military, incurred a service-connected disability. These monthly \npayments are based only on the severity of the disability and nothing \nelse: not on the length of service, the person's rank, the active duty \npay, and so on.\n  So at first blush, it seems that there is no logical reason why VA \ndisability compensation should be offset against military retired pay: \nthey are disbursed for completely different reasons and are calculated \nby totally different methods.\n  But the incongruities of the present rules are nothing short of mind-\nboggling. Let us hypothesize that twins Jack and Jill sign up for the \nmilitary at age 18. After 1 year in the military, Jack and Jill both \nincur identical knee injuries after stepping into a hole while running \nthe obstacle course. The military disability system evaluates both Jack \nand Jill, confirms a mild disability in both due to intermittent \nswelling and locking of the knee, but determines that this disability \nis not severe enough to render them unfit for continued military \nservice.\n  At this point, Jack and Jill decide to pursue separate paths. Jack \ndecides to leave the military when his enlistment is up, at age 22, and \njoins the Federal civil service in the Defense Department as a \nprocurement specialist. Immediately after leaving the service, Jack \napplies to the VA for disability compensation, which is granted, and \nJack then receives monthly payments from the VA for the rest of his \nlife. At age 55, Jack retires from the Federal civil service and begins \nreceiving his full monthly civil service retirement check in addition \nto the VA disability compensation that he has been receiving all along.\n  Jill, on the other hand, decides to stay in the military after her \ninjury, working as a procurement specialist. Of course, while she \nremains in the military, she receives no VA disability compensation, \neven though her twin Jack is receiving VA disability payments for the \nsame injury all along. At age 55, Jill retires from the military, and \nstarts to receive monthly military retirement checks. Jill applies to \nthe VA for disability compensation based on her knee injury, and it is \ngranted. However, when she begins to receive her VA disability checks, \nthe amount of those checks is subtracted from her monthly military \nretirement pay.\n  How can we rationalize this disparate treatment of Jack and Jill? We \ncan't. It makes no sense that those in uniform who suffer a service-\nconnected disability end up being penalized for deciding to remain in \nthe military, while those who leave the military are amply rewarded.The \nlonger you serve in the military, the more you are penalized. Does this \nmake sense? I don't think so.\n  Or let's consider another option. Twins John and Jane both enter the \nmilitary at the same time, serve in the same position, and retire at \nthe same age. Both receive the same monthly retired pay. John has \nincurred a service-connected injury, and after retirement, he is \ngranted a disability compensation from the VA. Jane was never injured \nin the military. However, they both end up getting the same amount of \npay, since John's VA disability payment is subtracted from his military \nretired pay. Does it make sense that we have an elaborate system for \ndisability compensation that ends up treating the injured John and the \nuninjured Jane the same? I don't think so.\n  The logical inconsistencies of the present rules are overwhelming. It \nis time to repeal the provision in current law that prohibits military \nretirees from receiving concurrent receipt of full military retirement \npay along with VA disability compensation. Those who put their lives at \nrisk by putting on the uniform of this country, and who are then \ndisabled as a result of their military service, must be treated fairly \nand awarded all the benefits they have earned and which they deserve. \nTo do any less makes a mockery of the sacrifices of all our service men \nand women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2471-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2471-S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNITION OF MAJOR GENERAL J.

Craig \nLarson has devoted nearly thirty-three years to the U.S. Army and Army \nReserve. It is only fitting that we pay tribute to a magnificent \nsoldier and citizen who has done so much for his country and the great \nstate of Utah.\n  Major General Larson is the Commander of the U.S. Army 96th Regional \nSupport Command in Salt Lake City, UT. As such, he commands more than \n6,000 Army Reservists in the six-state area of Colorado, Montana, North \nand South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  He was drafted by the Army in 1966, and obtained the rank of \nSergeant. He then attended and completed Officer Candidate School at \nthe Ordnance Center and School in Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. He was \ncommissioned a Second Lieutenant in January 1968. He served nearly \nseven years on active duty with assignments as Assistant to the Depot \nCommander, Anniston Army Depot, Alabama; Commander, Company C, 702nd \nMaintenance Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division on the DMZ in Korea; and \nAssistant Director of Industrial Operations, Indiantown Gap, PA.\n  During his twenty-six years in the Army Reserve, he served as: \nCommander of the 259th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Terminal and \nPipeline) in Pleasant Grove, UT; Executive Officer and then Commander \nof the 162nd Support Group at Fort Douglas, UT, and Deputy Chief of \nStaff for Logistics, Headquarters, 96th U.S. Army Reserve Command, also \nat Fort Douglas, UT.\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\n  Just prior to his current assignment, Major General Larson was the \nAssistant Deputy Chief of VA Staff for Logistics and Operations, U.S. \nArmy Materiel Command in Alexandria, VA. As such he was activated in \nNovember 1996 to be Commander. Logistics Support element--Africa, HQ, \nArmy Materiel Command, in support of Operation guardian Assistance, a \nhumanitarian relief effort for refugees from Rwanda, Zaire, and Uganda.\n  Major General Larson is a native of Salt Lake City, UT and a graduate \nof Highland High School.

In his civilian life, Major \nGeneral Larson is owner and President of Wind River Petroleum. He also \nserves as Chief Executive Officer of Christensen and Larson Investment \nCompany, President of Wind River Trucking, and is currently serving on \nthe Salt Lake International Airport board of directors. He is married \nto the former Toni Eskelson of Salt Lake City--also a Highland High \nSchool graduate. They have five daughters, two sons, and eight \ngrandchildren.\n  General Larson is leaving command and the uniform on Saturday, the \n24th of March 2001. His uniformed service to the Nation will be greatly \nmissed. However, he will continue to serve his community and family as \na business and civic leader and as a father and grandfather. As a \nnation we should take this opportunity to recognize and honor Major \nGeneral J. Craig Larson, a true American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2472-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING MARY HICKEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nthe work of Ms. Mary Hickey of Aberdeen, SD, for her over twenty years \nof outstanding service on behalf of the taxpayers of South Dakota. As \nan employee of the Internal Revenue Service, Mary has been the absolute \nmodel of a public servant and an invaluable asset to my office during \nthe last several years. It is with regret that I announce that she will \nbe leaving South Dakota and moving to Nebraska, where I'm sure she will \ncontinue her exemplary service.\n  Mary began her career with the IRS in 1980 as a Contact Service \nRepresentative in Rapid City, SD. She became a Tax Auditor in 1986, and \nin 1996 she was promoted to Problem Resolution Officer in Aberdeen. \nDuring her many years of service to the citizens of South Dakota, she \nhas provided outstanding assistance, helping to make sense of what can \noften be a complicated federal bureaucracy. On more than one occasion, \nI've heard my staff raving about the amount of time, commitment, and \ncooperation Mary put forth to serve and represent the taxpayers of \nSouth Dakota.\n  Mary's accomplishments are numerous. During the last few years, Mary \ndeveloped new and innovative techniques to aid in the restructuring of \nthe Taxpayer Advocate Service, a project of the IRS' Problem Resolution \nOffice. For all of her outstanding work, Mary has received numerous, \nwell-deserved IRS awards and accolades. Mary also excels in her \ncommunity, and is active with the United Way of Northeastern South \nDakota, having served as the Board Secretary for the past four years. \nAs Board Secretary, Mary participates in oversight of the organization \nand has helped to raise over $600,000 annually to support 19 local \ncharities.\n  It is an honor for me to share Mary's accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and to publicly commend her for serving South Dakota so \nexcellently. Alas, South Dakota's loss is Nebraska's gain and I'm sure \nshe will provide that state with the same outstanding performance she \nhas demonstrated here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2472-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2472-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nwithdrawals and nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations and withdrawals received today are printed at the \nend of the Senate proceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2472-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HATCH:\n       S. 560.

A bill for the relief of Rita Mirembe Revell (a.k.a. Margaret \nRita Mirembe); to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private relief \nbill for Rita Mirembe Revell. Rita is a 15-year-old child from Uganda \nwho was brought to this country in 1994. When Rita was 18 months old \nshe was left with the Daughters of Charity Society, a Catholic \norganization in Kampala, Uganda. Rita was an orphan, abandoned with no \nknown family.\n  Rita has resided in the United States under a student visa since \n1994. As an orphan the only parents she has ever known are her American \nguardians, who have sponsored Rita since she was three years old. They \nwant very much to adopt Rita, but they have been unable to get around \nthe mess of international red tape. The Ugandan Government has very \nstrict policies concerning adoption by foreign nationals. Now as Rita \napproaches her 16th birthday she is in danger of being deported. Rita \nhas formed an intimate bond with her American parents, who hope to \ncomplete the adoption as soon as possible. Papers for adoption have \nalready been filed, while there are bureaucratic difficulties, the \nadoption is not contested by any party.\n  Understandably, the family is concerned that Rita will be deported \nbefore her adoption is finalized. This bill simply gives Rita permanent \nresidency so that she might remain with the only parents she has ever \nknown while her adoption becomes final. Other immigration scenarios \nwould require Rita to return to an unsafe country for an unknown period \nof time. She has no known family in Uganda. Her new life is in \nCalifornia where she was recently admitted to Loretto High School, an \noutstanding college preparatory high school.\n  This bill gives Rita permanent resident status, which will allow her \nto remain in the country while the adoption process continues. It \nallows Rita to stay with her American parents in the country that she \nnow calls home. The bill also offers the comfort of certainty for her \nparents.\n  I hope that we can move quickly to grant this relief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 561. A bill to provide that the same health insurance premium \nconversion arrangements afforded to Federal employees be made available \nto Federal annuitants and members and retired members of the uniformed \nservices; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nextend to Federal retirees and both active and retired military \npersonnel the same health insurance premium conversion benefits allowed \nto current civilian Federal employees. This legislation directs the \nOffice of Personnel Management to establish a system allowing those who \nparticipate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, to \npay their health insurance premiums from pre-tax income.\n  The practice of allowing health care participants to use pre-tax \nincome to pay their health insurance premiums is often used in the \nprivate sector as a way of recognizing the importance of adequate, \naffordable health insurance. This system is called premium conversion. \nLast year, the Office of Personnel Management recognized this concept \nby establishing a plan to allow most employees of the executive, \nlegislative and judicial branches to participate in premium conversion.\n  Many Federal retirees also participate in the FEHBP program and as a \nmatter of fairness should be extended the opportunity to participate in \npremium conversion. In addition, the military currently has a separate \nhealth care system, but it is exploring offering health benefits under \nFEHBP, and therefore military employees or retirees who do participate \nin FEHBP should also be allowed premium conversion.\n  I have heard from Federal retirees in Maine who have pointed out the \nunfairness of not including retired Federal employees in the premium \nconversion system. This legislation will address this inequity.\n  I urge my colleagues to review and support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 562. A bill to amend the immigration and Nationality Act with \nrespect to the record of admission for permanent residence in the case \nof certain aliens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REID, Mr. President, family reunification is the cornerstone of \nour immigration policy. It is truly one of the most visible areas in \ngovernment policy in which we support and strengthen family values.\n  Family unification translates into strong families and strong \nfamilies build strong communities. For that reason I am introducing the \nWorking Families Registry Act.\n  This bill would allow immigrants who have been working and raising \nfamilies in the country since and before 1986 to apply for permanent \nresidence.\n  In my home State of Nevada I have met with people who everyday fear \nbeing deported and separated from their families. They are married to \nAmericans, have American children and have worked and been paying taxes \nfor many years. They help and do not harm our industry and our economy.\n  A change in the date of registry would help these families. This bill \nwould solve the problem of immigrants who have been paying taxes, who \nhave feared being deported and separated from their families.\n  The Working Families Registry Act would update a provision of \nimmigration law known as ``registry.''\n  The registry provision originated in a 1929 law and in 1958 that law \nbecame available to foreigners who had entered the country illegally or \nwho had overstayed. This criteria remains today and sets a required \ndate for which continuous residence must be shown in order to qualify \nfor permanent U.S. residency. The date of registry currently sits at \n1972, and was last adjusted in 1986. My legislation would update the \ndate of registry from 1972 to 1986. A change in the date of registry is \nnecessary.\n  First, it would address the uncertainty of taxpaying immigrants who \nwould qualify for residence under this bill. Many of these immigrants \nlive in fear of being separated from their families, having their \nworker's permits stripped and their residency status revoked.\n  Secondly, the legislation would help strengthen the immigrant \ncontributions to our national economy, tax base, and social fabric. The \nguaranteed benefits of residence (e.g., access to basic health care and \neducation) provide for a more productive and effective workforce.\n  Third, we recognize today, as so many legislators did in the past \nthat immigrants who have remained in the country for an extended period \nof time are highly unlikely to leave.\n  Fourth, if an update of the registry is not achieved, the validity of \nthis concept will be meaningless when this issue emerges in the future.\n  Finally, Americans care about this issue.\n  A recent poll conducted by the National Immigration Forum found that \n55 percent of Americans strongly favor legalizing a limited number of \nundocumented immigrants. That is, those immigrants who have been \nraising their families and paying their taxes--and who can prove they \nhave been in the United States for more than 5 years.\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\n  I believe it is in America's interest to pass The Working Families \nRegistry Act.\n  Immigrants' relationships with the United States are predicated by \nthe recognition of America's greatness. And, keeping families together, \nkeeps America great.\n  Please join my efforts to make this bill law, as we continue to seek \nways to keep America's working families together.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 564. A bill to amend section 1713 of title 38, United States Code, \nto provide continuing eligibility for medical care under that section \nfor individuals who become eligible for hospital insurance benefit \nunder part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act by turning 65; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Commission Voting Rights and \nProcedures to study and make recommendations regarding election \ntechnology, voting, election administration, to establish a grant \nprogram under which the Office of Justice Programs and the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice shall provide assistance to \nStates and localities in improving election technology and the \nadministration of Federal elections, to require States to meet uniform \nand nondiscriminatory election technology and administration \nrequirements for the 2004 Federal elections, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress some of the glaring problems that occurred in the 2000 \nelections with regard to technology and election administration. The \nEqual Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001, and companion \nlegislation introduced in the House by Congressman John Conyers, will \nprovided much needed guidance, and funds, to state and local election \nofficials to ensure that Federal elections are conducted in a manner \nthat encourages participation and facilitates voting by all Americans \nin a nondiscriminatory manner.\n  The right to vote is the cornerstone right in a Democracy. In the \nwords of Thomas Paine, it is ``the primary right by which other rights \nare protected.'' Thirty-six years ago last week, on March 15, 1965, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson convened a Joint Session of Congress to call \nfor passage of what ultimately became the Voting Rights Act. President \nJohnson spoke plainly and forcefully that evening. ``All Americans,'' \nhe said, ``must have the right to vote. And we are going to give them \nthat right. All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship \nregardless of race. And they are going to have those privileges of \ncitizenship regardless of race.''\n  Yet the sad message of this last election is that the privileges of \ncitizenship have yet to be fully guaranteed to all Americans. Nor are \nthe barriers to exercising this fundamental right limited to race. \nInaccessible polling places and visual ballots disenfranchised the \ndisabled and blind across this country. Complicated instructions and a \nlack of trained personnel discouraged language minorities and the \nelderly from fully exercising their right to vote. And even if voters \nwee able to get to the polling place, read the ballot and cast it, \nantiquated technology and insufficient machinery denied Americans of \nall races, languages, and physical abilities the right to have their \nvote counted. In short, what happened last November set off alarms \nacross this Nation that threaten to undermine the integrity of our \nsystem of Democracy.\n  The fact is, there is a fundamental flaw in our Federal elections \nsystem--and that flaw is the lack of federal direction, leadership, and \nresources provided to the States and localities to meet their \nresponsibility as the administrators of Federal elections. What we \nlearned last November is that it is not good enough to guarantee the \nright to vote, if procedures and technology prevent individuals from \nexercising that right. And it will take more than just the latest \ntechnology, or a new ``mouse-trap'' to fix the problem.\n  The legislation Congressman Conyers and I are introducing--The Equal \nProtection of Voting Rights Act of 2001--is intended to secure the \nrights of all Americans to participate in our Democracy, by \nestablishing 3 simple national requirements for Federal elections: (1) \nthat voting systems and technology meet national standards; (2) that \nstates provide for provisional voting; and (3) that states provide \nsample ballots and voting instructions to voters prior to election day. \nThese requirements must be implemented by the 2004 federal elections, \nand this legislation provides funding to States and localities to fund \nthe costs of implementing these requirements.\n  This legislation also creates a temporary Commission to study \nnumerous electin reform issues such election systems and ballot \ndesigns, access for the disabled, voter intimidation, access for absent \nmilitary and overseas voters, the feasibility of a national holiday, \nand alternative methods of voting to facilitate participation. Within 1 \nyear of enactment, the Commission will adopt a final report, along with \nrecommendations for best practices in the areas of convenient, \naccessible, nondiscriminatory election systems that accommodate voters \nwith disabilities, the blind, and the limited-English speaking. The \nCommission will also make recommendations for how the Federal \ngovernment, on an ongoing basis, can best provide assistance to State \nand local governments. Finally, the Commission will issue \nrecommendations for best practices which will increase voter \nregistration, the accuracy of voter rolls, and will improve voter \neducation and the training of election personnel and volunteers.\n  Finally, my legislation provides grant money, administered by the \nDepartment of Justice, to states and localities to implement the 3 \nnational requirements for the 2004 and subsequent elections. In order \nto encourage the States and localities to act to improve voting systems \nand election administration procedures prior to the 2004 elections, the \nbill allows States and localities to apply for grants to replace voting \nequipment and technology and make it accessible to those with \ndisabilities, the blind, and those with limited-English proficiency, to \nimplement new administrative procedures to increase participation and \nreduce disenfranchisement of minorities; to educate voters and train \nelection personnel and volunteers; and to implement recommendations of \nthe Commission. To be eligible for grant funds, a State must submit a \nplan providing for uniform, nondiscriminatory voting systems that \nensure accessibility for all voters; provides for the accuracy of \nvoting records; and provides for voter education and personnel \ntraining.\n  The Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001 is endorsed by the \nfollowing organizations: The National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People (NAACP); the AFL-CIO; The National Federation of the \nBlind; the National Council of La Raza; the American Civil Liberties \nUnion; and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n  The issues highlighted in the last election are not a Democratic or a \nRepublican problem. They are an American problem and the solutions to \nthese problems must be, appropriately, nonpartisan to succeed.\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n  The Committee on Rules and Administration, on which I serve as \nRanking Member, has already held one day of hearings on the topic of \nElection Reform. What became clear from those hearings is that there is \na bipartisan recognition that States and localities need assistance to \nenable them to efficiently, and effectively, administer Federal \nelections on a nondiscriminatory basis. I would submit that such \nassistance needs to take the form of both Federal election requirements \nfor nondiscriminatory, inclusive voting systems, provisional voting, \nand sample ballot and voting instructions, as well as the financial \nresources to implement such requirements.\n  I stand ready to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nfashion bipartisan legislation to ensure that all citizens can \nparticipate in this Democracy. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation and look forward to additional hearings in the Rules \nCommittee on this and other election reform proposals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nbill be included in the Record following my written remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of \n                                  2001\n\n\n   title i--establishment of commission on voting rights & procedures\n\n       Sec. 101.--Establishment of the Commission.\n       Sec. 102.--Membership of the Commission.\n       Number and Appointment.--the Commission is composed of 12 \n     members, appointed for the life of the Commission, with 6 \n     appointed by the President and 3 appointed by the Senate \n     Minority Member (unless of the same party as the President, \n     and then by the Senate Majority Leader), and 3 appointed by \n     the House Minority Leader (unless of the same party as the \n     President, and then by the House Majority Leader);

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 10 percent individual income tax rate for taxable years beginning in \n2001 and a payroll tax credit for those taxpayers who have no income \ntax liability in 2001; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I recently introduced, S. Con. Res. 20, \na one-year budget proposal which included instructions for a tax cut if \neither: (1) a true surplus materializes, or (2) we enter a recession. \nIt is now apparent the economy is on a downturn and there is no good \nreason to await action. That is why I am introducing a one-year tax cut \nof approximately $95 billion to stimulate the economy. Any tax cut \ndesigned for economic stimulus should be about one percent of GDP. The \ntax cut will reduce income taxes and payroll taxes as follows:\n  The 15 percent tax rate will be reduced to 10 percent for the \nfollowing brackets:\n  $0-20,000 for couples;\n  $0-16,000 for heads of households;\n  $0-10,000 for singles or married filing separately.\n  The 25 million taxpayers who pay payroll taxes but do not qualify for \nincome tax cuts will receive up to $500 in payroll tax cuts.\n  This plan reaches approximately 120 million taxpayers, thus providing \nrelief to more people than any other proposal to date. If passed, this \nproposal will provide immediate relief by sending a check to these 120 \nmillion taxpayers by July 1, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS:\n  S. 567. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncapital gain treatment under section 631(b) of such Code for outright \nsales of timber by landowners; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will simplify and update a provision of the tax code that affects \nthe sale of timber. It is both a simplification measure and a fairness \nmeasure. I call it the Timber Tax Simplification Act.\n  Under current law, landowners that are occasional sellers of timber \nare often classified by the Internal Revenue Service as ``dealers.'' As \na result, the small landowner is forced to choose, because of the tax \ncode, between two different methods of selling their timber. The first \nmethod, ``lump sum'' sales, provides for good business practice but is \nsubject to a high income tax. The second method, ``pay-as-cut'' sales, \nallows for lower capital gains tax treatment, but often results in an \nunder-realization of the fair value of the contract. Why, one might \nask, do these conflicting incentives exist for our nation's timber \ngrowers?\n  Earlier in this century, outright, or ``lump sum'', sales on a cash \nin advance, sealed basis, were associated with a ``cut and run'' \nmentality that did not promote good forest management. ``Pay-as-cut \nsales'', however, in which a timber owner is only paid for timber that \nis actually harvested, were associated with ``enlightened'' resource\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\nmanagement. Consequently, in 1943, Congress, in an effort to provide an \nincentive for improved forest management, passed legislation that \nallowed capital gains treatment under 631(b) of the IRS Code for pay-\nas-cut sales, leaving lump-sum sales to pay the much higher rate of \nincome tax. It is said that President Roosevelt opposed the bill and \nalmost vetoed it.\n  Today, however, Section 631(b), like so many provisions in the IRS \nCode, is outdated. Forest management practices are much different from \nwhat they were in 1943 and lump-sum sales are no longer associated with \npoor forest management. And, while there are occasional special \nsituations where other methods may be more appropriate, most timber \nowners prefer this method over the ``pay-as-cut'' method. The reasons \nare simple: title to the timber is transferred upon the closing of the \nsale and the buyer assumes the risk of any physical loss of timber to \nfire, insects, disease, storms, etc. Furthermore, the price to be paid \nfor the timber is determined and received at the time of the sale.\n  Unfortunately, in order for timber owners to qualify for the \nfavorable capital gains treatment, they must market their timber on a \n``pay-as-cut'' basis under Section 631(b) which requires timber owners \nto sell their timber with a ``retained economic interest.'' This means \nthat the timber owner, not the buyer, must bear the risk of any \nphysical loss during the timber sale contract period and must be paid \nonly for the timber that is actually harvested. As a result, this type \nof sale can be subject to fraud and abuse by the timber buyer. Since \nthe buyer pays only for the timber that is removed and scaled, there is \nan incentive to waste poor quality timber by breaking the tree during \nthe logging process, underscaling the timber, or removing the timber \nwithout scaling. But because 631(b) provides for the favorable tax \ntreatment, many timber owners are forced into exposing themselves to \nunnecessary risk of loss by having to market their timber in this \ndisadvantageous way instead of the more preferable lump-sum method.\n  Like many of the provisions in the tax code, Section 631(b) is \noutdated and prevents good forestry business management. Timber \nfarmers, who have usually spent decades producing their timber \n``crop'', should be able to receive equal tax treatment regardless of \nthe method used for marketing their timber.\n  In the past, the Joint Committee on Taxation has studied this \nlegislation to consider what impact it might have on the Treasury and \nfound that it would have no real cost--only a ``negligible change'' \naccording to their analysis.\n  The IRS has no business stepping in and dictating the kind of sales \ncontract a landowner must choose. My legislation will provide greater \nconsistency by removing the exclusive ``retained economic interest'' \nrequirement in the IRC Section 631(b). Reform of 631(b) is important to \nour nation's non-industrial, private landowners because it will improve \nthe economic viability of their forestry investments and protect the \ntaxpayer from unnecessary exposure to risk of loss. This in turn will \nbenefit the entire forest products industry, the U.S. economy and \nespecially small landowners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2478-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 26--AUTHORIZING THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL \n TO BE USED ON JULY 18, 2001, FOR A CEREMONY TO PRESENT CONGRESSIONAL \n           GOLD MEDALS TO THE ORIGINAL 29 NAVAJO CODE TALKERS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Domenici \namendment.\n  As chairman of the Rules Committee during the 105th Congress, I had \nthe honor of presiding over numerous hearings on campaign finance \nreform. As a result of these two years of hearings, discussions with \nnumerous experts and colleagues, and the result of over two decades of \nparticipating in campaigns and campaign finance debates, I have \ndeveloped some strong opinions on the issue of campaign finance reform. \nIn fact, during the 105th and 106th Congresses, I introduced my own \ncampaign finance reform bills. One aspect of both bills was a provision \ndesigned to level the playing field for candidates running against \nself-financed candidates.\n  Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage because of \ntheir constitutional right to spend their own funds. The prospect of \nfacing a self-financed candidate can be daunting and may prevent many \ntalented potential candidates from entering a political contest. My \nbill contained provisions similar to Senator Domenici's amendment \nbefore use now that raise contribution limits for candidates running \nagainst self-financed candidates. Just as my bill raised contribution \nlimits incrementally according to how much the self-financed candidate \nspends on his or her campaign, Senator Domenici's amendment does the \nsame.\n  Mr first criteria when analyzing issues of campaign finance reform is \nthat the legislation must be consistent with first amendment. The \nCongress must respect and protect the constitutional right of \nindividuals, groups, and organizations to participate in advocacy \nconcerning political issues, and this includes self-financed \ncandidates. This amendment does not constrain the first amendment \nrights of the self-financed candidate, it merely levels the playing \nfield and opens up the political process to those of more modest means.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n       Beginning on page 22, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 24, line 2 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 212.

The court will \n     notify you of the hearing on your reaffirmation agreement. \n     You must attend this hearing in bankruptcy court where the \n     judge will review your agreement.

Otherwise, your obligations will be determined by the \n     reaffirmation agreement which may have changed the terms of \n     the original agreement. For example, if you are reaffirming \n     an open end credit agreement, the creditor may be permitted \n     by that agreement or applicable law to change the terms of \n     the agreement in the future under certain conditions.\n       `` `Are you required to enter into a reaffirmation \n     agreement by any law?

A ``lien'' is often referred to as a security \n     interest, deed of trust, mortgage or security deed. Even if \n     you do not reaffirm and your personal liability on the debt \n     is discharged, because of the lien your creditor may still \n     have the right to take the security property if you do not \n     pay the debt or default on it. If the lien is on an item of \n     personal property that is exempt under your State's law or \n     that the trustee has abandoned, you may be able to redeem the \n     item rather than reaffirm the debt. To redeem, you make a \n     single payment to the creditor equal to the current value of \n     the security property, as agreed by the parties or determined \n     by the court.'.\n       ``(ii) In the case of a reaffirmation under subsection \n     (m)(2), numbered paragraph 6 in the disclosures required by \n     clause (i) of this subparagraph shall read as follows:\n       `` `6.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 27, the so-\ncalled McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform proposal, of which I am \nhonored to be a cosponsor.\n  In taking up this proposal today, the Senate is embarking on a \nhistoric journey. Over the next couple of weeks, we will have an \nopportunity to do something that is really quite rare around here; that \nis, to debate, consider, and ultimately vote on the essential nature of \nour political system. That vote I believe will have a significant \neffect on the vitality and, indeed, on the viability long term of our \nDemocrat democracy.\n  No less than our forefathers who drafted the Constitution, we will be \nasked in the days ahead to take a stand on how we believe our \nGovernment should work and to whom its leaders should be held \naccountable.\n  These are the questions we will be considering and debating in this \nproposal:\n  Do we want a government in which power comes from the people, and \nthose who are privileged to exercise that power are ultimately \naccountable to the people?\n  Will we uphold the ideal of our democracy so that the passion and \nforce with which people articulate their views and the votes that they \ncast on election day are the means through which they influence our \nGovernment's direction, or do we want a system where the size of a \nperson's wallet or the depth of an interest group's bank account count \nmore than a person's views or votes?\n\n  I do not believe that anyone in this body would embrace the latter \nvision of our Republic. But that is precisely, I believe, where our \nGovernment is headed if we do not enact the bill we are debating today. \nFor too many years, we have allowed money and the never ending chase \nfor it to undermine our political system, to breed cynicism among our \ncitizens, and to compromise the essential principle of our democracy. \nFor, after all, America is supposed to be a country where every citizen \nhas an equal say in the Government's decisions, and every citizen has \nan equal ability, in the words of the Constitution, to petition the \nGovernment for a redress of grievances.\n  As that great observer of America's Democratic genius Alexis de \nTocqueville put it when he analyzed our Nation's political system \nduring the 19th century:\n\n       The people reign in the American political world as the \n     Deity does in the universe. They are the cause and the aim of \n     all things; everything comes from them, and everything is \n     absorbed in them.\n\n  How far we have come. I question whether any current observer of \nAmerican politics could repeat de Tocqueville's statement with a \nstraight face.\n  Look at what has become of our system. Virtually every day in this \ncity an event is held where the price of admission far exceeds what the \noverwhelming majority of Americans can ever dream of giving to a \ncandidate or a political party. For $1-, $5-, $10-, $50- or $100,000, \nwealthy individuals or interest groups can buy the time of candidates \nand elected officials, gaining access and thereby influence that is far \nbeyond the grasp of those who have only their voice and their votes to \noffer.\n  Our national political parties publicly tout the access and influence \nbig donor donations can buy. One even advertises on its web site that a \n$100,000 donation will bring meetings and contacts with Congressional \nleadership throughout the year, and tells us it is ``designed \nspecifically for the Washington-based corporate or PAC representative'' \na donor group whose entry price is $15,000.\n  For that amount, the party's web site tells us, donors get into a \nclub whose agenda ``is simple--bringing the best of our party's \nsupporters together with our congressional leadership for a continuing, \ncollegial dialogue on current policy issues.''\n  Needless to say, the political parties selling these tickets to \naccess and influence have found buyers aplenty. In 1997, I spent the \nbetter part of a year participating in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's investigation into campaign finance abuses during the 1996 \ncampaign. Our attention was riveted by marginal hustlers such as Johnny \nChung who compared the White House to a subway, saying, ``You have to \nput in coins to open the gates,'' and Roger Tamraz, who told us that he \ndid not even bother to register to vote because he knew that his \ndonations would get him so much more.\n  Appalling as these stories were, they, in the end, obscured a far \ngreater scandal; that is, the far more prevalent collection of big soft \ndollar donations comes not from opportunistic hangers on but from \nmainstream corporations, unions and individuals.\n  Staggering amounts have gone to both political parties. During the \nelection cycle that just ended, the parties collectively raised $1.2 \nbillion, almost double the amount raised in 1998, and 37 percent more \nthan in the last Presidential cycle.\n\n  The bulk of those increases came in the form of soft money--the \nunlimited large dollar donations from individuals and interest groups. \nRepublicans raised $244.4 million in soft money while Democrats raised \n$243 million. For Republicans, it was a 73-percent increase over the \nlast cycle, and for Democrats\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\nit nearly doubled what they raised during the last cycle.\n  When compared to election cycles further back, the numbers become all \nthe more jolting. The 1996 soft money record that was blown away by \nthis cycle's fundraising was itself 242 percent higher than the 1992 \nsoft money fundraising in the case of Democrats and in the case of \nRepublicans 178 percent higher. The roughly $262 million in party soft \nmoney raised in 1992, itself, dwarfed the approximately $19 million \nraised in the 1980 cycle, and the $21.6 million raised in the 1984 \ncycle was also dwarfed by those numbers.\n  The bottom line is that since soft money, and the loophole that \nallowed it into our political system, entered the system some 20 years \nago, it has grown exponentially in each cycle, from barely $20 million \nin total in 1980 to nearly $500 million--a half a billion dollars--last \nyear. And it is difficult to see any end in sight to this exponential \ngrowth of soft money except S. 27, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform proposal.\n  Is it any wonder, with these numbers, that the American people--they \nwho are supposed to be the true source of our Government's authority--\nhave been so turned off by politics that many of them no longer trust \nour Government or even bother to vote?\n  This must end or our noble journey in self-government will veer \nfurther and further from its principled course. When the price of entry \nto our democracy's discussions starts to approach the average \nAmerican's annual salary, something is terribly wrong. When we have a \ntwo-tiered system of access and influence--one for the average \nvolunteer and one for the big contributor--something is terribly wrong. \nAnd when the big contributor's ticket is for a front-row seat, while \nthe voter's is for standing room only, something is most definitely \nterribly wrong.\n  Our opponents will continue, I understand, to see the situation \ndifferently. Money, they tell us, is just speech in another form. And \nthe outlandish increases we have seen in political giving, they say, \nare actually signs of the vibrancy of our marketplace of ideas. It is a \nmarket place all right, but what is for sale is most certainly not \nideas, and what is threatened most certainly is not free speech.\n  Free speech is a principle we all hold dear. But free speech is about \nthe inalienable right every American has to express his or her views \nwithout Government interference. It is about the vision the framers of \nour Constitution enshrined in that great document, a vision that \nensures both we in Congress and those outside--every citizen--will \nnever be forced to compromise our American birth right to offer \nopinions, even and particularly when those are unpopular or \ndiscomforting to those in power.\n  That simply is not at issue in this debate, not at issue as a result \nof the McCain-Feingold proposal. Absolutely nothing in this bill will \ndo anything to diminish or threaten any American's right to express his \nor her views about candidates running for office or about any problem \nor any issue in American life. Indeed, if more money in the system were \na sign of more Americans speaking and more Americans being better \ninformed, then we would have significantly more vibrant elections, \ndramatically more informative campaigns, increasingly larger voter \nturnout, and better and better public debates than we had 20 years ago \nbefore soft money exploded onto the scene.\n  I challenge anyone in this body or outside to say that is the case. \nIt most certainly is not. To the contrary, this campaign finance reform \nproposal would actually enhance our polity's free speech rights. Under \nthe current system, the voice of monied interests drowns out the voice \nof average Americans, often preventing them from being truly heard in \nour public policy debates. In that sense, it is the current system, \nwith its addiction to soft money and all its maleffects, that limits \nfree speech, and it is this bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, that will \nrestore Americans' true ability to exercise their rights of expression \nwithout limit and with full effect.\n  In short, Mr. President, what would be threatened by this bill is not \nspeech but something entirely different, the ever increasing and \ndisproportionate power that those with money have in our political \nsystem. That is threatening a principle that I would guess all of us \nhold just as dearly--perhaps more dearly--as the principle of free \nspeech, and that is the principle of democracy, that literally sacred \nideal that shaped our Republic and still does, which promises that each \nperson has one vote and that each and every one of us, to paraphrase \nthe words from the Bible, from the heads of the tribes to the priests \nof the temple to the hewers of wood and the bearers of water, each of \nus has an equal right and an equal ability to influence the workings of \nour government.\n  As it stands now, it is that sacred principle--I use that adjective \nintentionally--that is under attack. It is that sacred principle that \nwill remain under attack until we do something to protect it. That \nsomething, I submit, is campaign finance reform.\n  Unless we act to reform our campaign finance system, people with \nmoney will continue, as they give it, to have a disproportionate \ninfluence in our system. The American people will continue to lose \nfaith in our government's institutions and their independence, and the \ngenius of our Republic, that it is our citizenship, not our status, \nthat gives each of us equal power to play a role in our country's \ngovernment, will be lost.\n  Before yielding the floor, I will say a couple of words about some of \nthe alternative plans that have been proposed. As do Senators McCain \nand Feingold, I welcome any sincere effort at reform. None of us would \never presume to say that our way is the only way. What we will \nabsolutely reject is any suggestion that something is reformed just \nbecause a person who proposes it says it is reformed.\n  The problem we are dealing with, as I have said this evening, is that \nthere is too much money in the system coming from sources such as \ncorporations and unions that under our laws are not supposed to be \ncontributing to these national elections at all and coming from \nindividuals who, since the post-Watergate reforms, were supposed to \ngive a limited amount, no more than $2,000 to any one campaign. Anyone \nwith a proposal that does not address this critical problem, which is \nthe problem of soft money and the loophole that has invited it, is not \nproposing reform. That is the essence of what this is about. It is that \nsimple, ultimately.\n\n  For example, I have heard some say that true campaign finance reform \nrequires so-called paycheck protection. I oppose that principle on its \nmerits. It is a bad idea under any circumstances. There are others who \nsupport McCain-Feingold who disagree with me and support paycheck \nprotection who think it is a good idea. All of us should be able to \nagree that whatever we think of paycheck protection on its own, it is \nnot campaign finance reform. It won't get a single dollar that should \nnot be in our political system out of the system. It won't do a single \nthing to stop the most malignant aspect of our campaign finance system \ntoday, which is unlimited soft money.\n  The bottom line is this: For too long we have watched as our Nation's \ngreatest treasure, its commitment to democracy, has been pillaged by \nthe ever escalating chase for money. It is time for this Senate to say \nthat enough is enough, to remove the disproportionate power of some \nover our political system, and to restore the political influence and \nconfidence to where our Nation's founding principles say it should be--\nwith the people, with the voters.\n  Over the next couple of weeks, important weeks in the history of this \nSenate and Nation, that is what we can do. I pray that we will.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/19/senate-section/article/S2531-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2531-S2532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 420\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.
