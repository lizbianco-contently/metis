In Your providential care, You choose \nthem, nurture their characters, hone their minds, and sharpen their \nconvictions. You give them opportunities to serve You by caring for the \nneeds of society. You allow their hearts to be broken by what breaks \nYour heart so that they can heal wounds, right wrongs, and lead others \nto grasp their full potential.\n  Today, we thank You for such a leader. You have placed Your hand of \nblessing on Senator Barbara Mikulski. With Your endowed gifts of \nleadership, she has become a lodestar leader in her state and in her \nparty, in the Senate, and in the Nation. Thank You for her intellectual \nacumen, her ability to get to the point, her loyal faithfulness, and \nher lively sense of humor. The Senator has the courage of her \nconvictions and says what she means and means what she says. She is a \npatriotic American who is proud of her Polish heritage. We rejoice with \nSenator Mikulski today as she is given one of the highest honors ever \nbestowed by the Polish Government, the Commanders' Cross with Star of \nthe Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. May this be a truly \nmemorable day for her, her family, all Polish-Americans, and all of us \nhere in the Senate family who are privileged to be her friends.

Madam President, may I inquire what is the pending \nbusiness?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's amendment is the \npending question.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Last night I laid down an amendment which I think enhances this farm \nbill and focuses on what is important for agriculture. We have had a \nlot of discussion about how we have to help farm families. Clearly, \nthey are struggling.\n  This country has been in a recession for about 15 months. We have \nbeen under attack by terrorists for about 3 months. But farmers across \nthis country and their families and those with whom they work closely \nknow they have been in recession for 4 or 5 years.\n  The collapse of the overseas agricultural markets has driven prices \ndown. That is why, among other things, it is vitally important that \nthis body pass trade promotion legislation because we must get those \nmarkets back.\n  In the meantime, we look for things we can do to assist farmers. We \nare going to send them financial assistance. In the last several years \nas they have suffered from low prices, we have provided very \nsignificant amounts of money to help fill in the void left by low \nmarket prices.\n  We can do research for them. Research in new ways of doing business \nmade our farmers continually more productive.\n  We must be sure adequate transportation exists. In the heartland that \nmeans keeping the vital waterways of the Missouri and Mississippi \nRivers open to transportation so we can have economical and efficient \nways of getting our farm products to market.\n  But there is one thing farmers tell me they are concerned about, \nperhaps more than anything else. While they are concerned about the \nweather, they understand you cannot change that. They are concerned \nabout crops and pests and their interaction. They are concerned about \nmarkets. As I said, markets have been down.\n  But the one thing that really frustrates them is that too often our \nGovernment seems to have farmers in their sights. They want to \naccomplish all kinds of good purposes, but they want the farmers to do \nit. The farmers who control much of the land of the United States are \nthe ones to whom the Federal Government says: We would like to see this \ndone, and we will have you, the farmers, who are trying to earn your \nliving off the land, make the changes that we think are good policy \nwhether it be environmental policy, whether it be economic or income \ndistribution policy, or whether it be food policy. Some farmers tell me \nthat they spend more time preparing for public hearings than they spend \non their combines.\n  The amendment before us today says farmers are going to get a chance \nto have an advocate at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  We all know that regulatory requirements are necessary. They often \ncarry out the purposes that have been approved by the Congress. They \nare authorized by law, but the problem is sometimes the regulatory \nagencies that are trying to carry out those purposes know nothing about \nagriculture or farming or how the individual farmer trying to earn a \nliving for himself or herself and their families is affected by it.\n  We are trying through this amendment to give the USDA the \nresponsibility and the tools to help farmers who are being oppressed.\n  This is a life preserver thrown to farmers whose livelihood or safety \nis threatened by bad Federal regulations.\n  I introduced last night two letters with lengthy endorsements from \nfarm and agricultural organizations, nationally and from my home State \nof Missouri.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Grassley, Enzi, Hagel, and \nMiller as cosponsors. I hope we will have more who will come to the \nfloor and be willing to speak on behalf of this legislation once they \nunderstand its importance.\n  Let me go through the legislation very briefly. It is unlike the rest \nof the farm bill. A lot of people are still trying to read through the \n900 pages of the original farm bill and 900-plus pages of the amendment \nthat was dropped on us. This one is easy.\n  It says the Secretary may review any agency action proposed by a \nFederal agency to determine whether the action would likely have a \nsignificant adverse economic impact on or jeopardize the personal \nsafety of agricultural producers--farmers. If the Secretary determines \nthat it is likely to have such a significant adverse impact, the \nSecretary, No. 1, shall consult with the agency head, call him up on \nthe phone, and talk with him; No. 2, advise the agency head on \nalteratives to the agency action which would be least likely to have a \nsignificant economic impact or jeopardize personal safety.\n  Then, if after a proposed agency action is finalized the Secretary \nthinks it would have a significant adverse impact described above, the \nSecretary may defer to the President, who not later than 60 days after \nthe date on which the action is finalized reviews the determination of \nthe Secretary. The President can reverse, preclude, or amend the agency \naction if the President determines that overturning that action is \nnecessary to prevent the adverse economic impact and is in the public \ninterest.\n  In considering this, the President takes into account the public \nrecord, competing economic interests, and the purposes of agency \naction.\n  The President may not overturn an agency action that is necessary to \nprotect human health, safety, or national security, significantly \nlimiting his options. If the President chooses to overturn an agency \naction, the President has to notify Congress of the decision and submit \na detailed justification.\n  Congress then has the opportunity to review the action under the \nexpedited procedures set forth in the bill which I was very pleased to \nsponsor back in 1996, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act, which provides for expedited review in the Senate without \nthe chance of filibuster. By majority vote in both Houses, the \nPresident's action overturning any of these adverse impact agency \nregulations could be reviewed.\n  That seems to me to give the President the power to step in.\n  It is my intention to provide, first, the Secretary of Agriculture \nwith the responsibility of looking for these agency actions that may \nhave an adverse impact, calling them to the attention of that agency \nhead, and working to resolve the problems so the objectives of the \nproposed regulation can be achieved without imposing the burdens that \nthe Secretary believes would be unnecessarily inflicted on farmers.\n\n[[Page S13081]]\n\n  If that does not work, then the President has the discretion to \nresolve disputes and say in this instance the public would better be \nserved if we overturned this regulation and issued a new one.\n  This amendment should force USDA to be more aggressive in protecting \nand fighting for farmers. It should help make other agencies more \nresponsive to the needs of farmers.\n  We can help families with $170 billion in spending that we are \ntalking about here today. But if we really care about them, and if we \nreally care about their economic contributions, the social value of \nfarm families, and certainly their contribution to feeding our Nation, \nprotecting our food security, and our national security, then we ought \nto provide that the agency designed to serve farmers has the power and \nthe responsibility to speak up for farmers to ensure that they are not \noverrun by an unthinking, ill-considered undertaking and ill-considered \naction.\n  We protect the blind mussels or other endangered species. We ought to \nbe concerned about a farm community being threatened or endangered. I \nthink this gives the farmers some limited leverage in assuring that \nthey are protected.\n  It will not be necessary very often for the President to intervene \nonce people know he has that power because agencies should, with this \nmandate to the Secretary of Agriculture, work out the problems in \nadvance. This Presidential discretion which can be reviewed on an \nexpedited basis by the President is a fail-safe mechanism.\n  This country has been in a recession for 15 months. We have given the \nPresident broad discretionary power since September 11 to conduct war \nand fight crime. We have appropriated tens of billions of dollars to \nhelp restore the strength of this country. We tried to help the \nairlines, and we are pursuing an economic stimulus package.\n  Parenthetically, we absolutely must pass legislation to shore up the \ninsurance agencies to provide assurance that terrorism insurance will \nbe available. We will have a major shutdown in our economy if we don't \nget that done.\n  I urge the majority leader to take this up immediately because we may \nbe finding ourselves without insurance as of January 1 if we don't. I \nurge him to go back to the bipartisan measure worked out by the leaders \nof the banking committee and to pursue that legislation.\n  To go back to the farmers, as part of the stimulus we are going to \nprovide assistance to the unemployed. We should recognize that farm \nfamilies in rural America have been in a recession for 4 years. One of \nthe things we can do in addition to providing dollars is to give them \nsome protection from their Government. That is something they told me. \nIf you ask the farmers in your State, I assure you that you will be \ntold it is vitally important.\n  There is a challenge, limited as it is, that when resource issues \naffect farms and their families, it is OK for the Government to fight \nfor the farmers. In the past, the fight has always been one-sided \nagainst the farmers.\n  In this instance, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and \nsend a message to farmers that we believe farmers are worthy of \nprotection. We want the Government to make every sensible attempt to \nact as an advocate. We believe the USDA should be active and visible in \nfighting for farmers. We believe that the President and the Congress \nare capable of this and can be trusted with the public interest. This \nsays to the administration that farmers don't always have to be at the \nbottom of the food chain.\n  I urge support of the amendment. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa controls 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  I yield the Senator as much time as he needs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond. This amendment gives \nbroad authority to the Secretary of Agriculture and the President to \noverturn the legal responsibilities of Government agencies if they \ndetermine that an agency action might --might--have adverse economic \nimpacts on or jeopardize the personal safety of a farmer or rancher.\n  While I know the Senator is concerned about the economic well-being \nof farmers and ranchers--and we all are--this amendment would waive \nmany of the protections that our Federal agencies are charged with \nproviding.\n  Under this amendment, if the Environmental Protection Agency sets a \nwater quality standard to prevent degradation of a stream, and the \nSecretary and the President think meeting that standard may have an \nadverse economic impact on a farmer or a rancher, the President can \nreverse the agency action. Or, if the Secretary of the Department of \nthe Interior adds a species to the list of threatened or endangered \nspecies, and the Secretary of Agriculture and the President determine \nthat recovering that species may have an adverse--may have an adverse--\neconomic impact on a farmer or a rancher, the President can reverse \nthat action.\n  When Federal agencies are considering the actions they are required \nto take under the law, the agencies consider the cost, and weigh the \ncost with the benefits the actions will have before proposing them.\n  Finally, the amendment does not consider the necessity of protecting \nour environment when considering reversing an agency action; therefore, \nI oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, the time will be charged equally to each \nside.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the quorum call be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield to no one, including my good \nfriend from Missouri, in fighting for our farmers and people who live \nin small towns in rural America to ensure that they are not set upon by \nthe powers of the Federal Government in any way that would act to their \ndetriment, their safety, their security, their well-being, their \nability to make a living, or their ability to live as free and \nindependent citizens of this country.\n  But I have looked over this amendment. At first I thought it might be \nOK. I looked it over. Then it hit me that the Senator's amendment says \nbasically that the Secretary of Agriculture may review any action \nproposed by any Federal agency. That is what it says here. It says: \nAny. It says: The Secretary may review any agency action proposed by \nany Federal agency. . ..\n  And then it says: If the Secretary determines that a proposed agency \naction is going to do certain things with adverse effects on \nagricultural producers, then the Secretary can give it to the President \nfor review. And then the President can reverse the agency action, just \nlike that. He can reverse it, preclude it from going into effect, or he \ncan amend it.\n  Well now, I don't know. I would like to ask: Why don't we include \nsmall businesses? I know my friend from Missouri is a strong defender \nof small business. Why don't we include small businesses in this? Why \ndon't we let the head of SBA review any agency action by any Federal \nagency to determine whether or not it is going to have an adverse \neffect on small business, and let the President then reverse or amend \nthe agency action?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, may I respond?\n\n[[Page S13082]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure, I yield for a question or a response to my \nquestion.\n  Mr. BOND. My question is, Are you familiar with the role of the \nCounsel for Advocacy in Small Business? That is his job. Are you \nfamiliar with the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \nthat we have adopted in the Small Business Committee to provide teeth \nfor that act?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Having served on the Small Business Committee of the \nSenate now for 17 years, I am fully aware of all of the acts adopted in \nthat Committee. But there is nothing in the Small Business \nAdministration Act that allows the SBA Administrator to review all \nthese agencies' actions and then give them to the President for further \nreview, and that lets the President amend an action or reverse an \naction by himself, with only a notification to Congress.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri: Is there anything in the Small \nBusiness Administration Act, or any law passed by Congress, that gives \nthe President that power?\n  Mr. BOND. The answer to that is not yet, but if the manager of the \nbill would like to come to the committee and offer that, I would \ncertainly be interested in supporting it.\n  We are working on the farm bill here. I think most of us agree that \nfarmers need some additional protection. They do not have a counsel for \nadvocacy in USDA. We have not seen the Secretary of Agriculture take \nthat role. This says specifically they should.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Missouri, we do have a counsel at \nthe Department of Agriculture who has every ability to do exactly what \nthe Senator is talking about.\n  The Senator says, take it to committee. I say to the Senator, take \nthis to the committee. Let's have the committee take a look at this and \nnot do it on the floor. Just as the Senator says we ought to take it to \nthe Small Business Committee, that is my suggestion.\n  And why stop with small business? Why don't we do veterans? Why don't \nwe do the same thing for our veterans in this country, who, time and \ntime and time again, are affected by agency decisions in other parts of \nthe Government?\n  Why don't we have the Secretary of Veterans Affairs have the same \npower that the Senator from Missouri wants to give to the Secretary of \nAgriculture? Why not do the same thing for our veterans and give them \nthat kind of protection that they need, so that the President, without \neven consulting Congress, could overturn, amend, reverse any agency \ndecision if he believes it adversely affects veterans in this country? \nWhy don't we give that power to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs?\n  Why stop there? Why not give the same power to the Secretary of the \nInterior to review any agency action that might adversely affect a \npublic park or interfere with the enjoyment I might have in going to a \npublic park? And then let the President amend it, reverse it, without \never consulting with Congress?\n  Why stop there? Why don't we do the same thing for the Secretary of \nLabor? Let the Secretary of Labor have the power to review any agency \naction by any Federal agency? And if the Secretary of Labor thinks the \naction will adversely affect a working person in this country, the \nSecretary of Labor could give it to the President and let the President \nreverse it, do away with it, and then just let Congress know. That is \nwhat the amendment of the Senator from Missouri says. It says the \nPresident can do all this. He can reverse it, preclude it, amend it. \nAll he has to do is notify Congress of the decision to reverse, \npreclude, or amend the action and submit to Congress a detailed \njustification for the decision. We don't have any power. The President \ncan do the whole thing.\n  Why stop there? Let's think about other things. On the face of it, it \nmight sound good. Then you start thinking about it and you say: Wait a \nsecond; we do could this for everything. What it means is that we would \ngive the President of the United States the power to reverse, amend, \npreclude any agency decision without ever having to come to Congress.\n  We have an Administrative Procedure Act, a law passed by this \nCongress to provide the President and the Federal agencies--the \nexecutive branch of Government--with the guidelines under which it can \noperate. We amend it from time to time. This is where this amendment \nought to go, on the Administrative Procedure Act. But there are in the \nAdministrative Procedure Act certain things that have to be done. One \nof the things that is most important of all is to insist that Congress \nplay its constitutional role and exercises its constitutional right. \nThe President can't just do these things without letting Congress have \nthe power to say whether he can do it or not. Otherwise, we might as \nwell shut our doors and go home; let the White House run everything in \nthis country.\n  This amendment on its face kind of sounds good. It sounds good. But I \nwonder if supporters of this amendment have really thought through all \nthe implications of it and what it may mean. The farmers I talk to \ndon't want another layer of bureaucracy from Washington. This would be \nyet another layer of regulatory burden when agencies are carrying out \nthe law.\n  And keep in mind, it could be something that maybe a farm group or a \nfarm organization might want but the Secretary of Agriculture or the \nPresident may not like it. This is a two-edged sword.\n  My friend from Missouri would say: Well, but it has to have an \nadverse economic impact on, or jeopardize the personal safety of, \nagricultural producers. That is pretty broad. I am sure any smart \nSecretary of Agriculture or President could say: We have this agency \naction out there, and we can interpret it so that it has an adverse \neconomic impact on farmers. Therefore, we are going to reverse it \nwilly-nilly because we, the President and the Secretary of Agriculture, \nhave decided that it has an adverse economic impact on farmers. But the \nagency action may be in the best interest of farmers according to what \nsome of us may think. Maybe some of us here may think that agency \naction may actually benefit farmers. Others may not think so. Maybe the \nPresident of whatever party may not think so. He can just reverse it. \nWhat power do we have?\n\n  I guess we have to go through the legislative process of having a \nbill and getting it through committee. We have no say-so whatsoever in \nthe President's decision to reverse, preclude or amend the agency \naction.\n  I always say at this time of the year, when people come around with \nnice presents for you, that you had better unwrap the present and take \na good look at it. Just because it has a fancy bow and fancy paper \ndoesn't necessarily mean it is a gift. I say to my farmers and my \nfriends in rural America, the amendment offered by my friend from \nMissouri is not a gift. This is a two-edged sword. It may help \nsometimes, but it may hurt. It may also open the floodgates for a lot \nof mischief in other Federal agencies that may adversely affect our \nfarmers.\n  Unwrap this package and take a look at it. You will see it is not \nwhat it is touted to be.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. LINCOLN). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  I certainly accept the manager's invitation to unwrap this package. I \nonly wish we could do this on the southern border of Iowa and the \nnorthern border of Missouri, out where farmers live, away from the \nrarified atmosphere of this Chamber, and ask the farmers of Iowa and \nMissouri, the farmers of any other State, is this really a two-edged \nsword? Are you as a farmer really worried that the Fish and Wildlife \nService is going to put out a regulation that would help farmers and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture would oppose it and try to overturn it and \nget the President to overturn it?\n  That one won't meet the laugh test. That dog won't hunt in farm \ncountry. People know what is going on out there. It is not a danger to \nfarmers that we have too much regulation. Actually, when regulations \nare overturned, it is usually when a regulation affects a large \nmetropolitan area--building a bridge, something like that. Maybe if \nthere are a lot of people around who are affected, then they can get \nsome relief. When it is just a few farmers, when they need some \nirrigation water, then other things come to the fore.\n  Ask the farmers on the Klamath River about the sucker fish. Ask the\n\n[[Page S13083]]\n\nfarmers in Texas about the Arkansas shiner. Who is being protected \nthere? The Fish and Wildlife Service has the power, overwhelming power, \nto jump in and protect endangered species. Some people think it is time \nsomebody had the power to jump in and protect endangered farmers. That \nis the difference.\n  It is time we turn around the balance of the Federal regulatory \njuggernaut that has been running over farmers in the name of all kinds \nof other interests and give the farmers some protection, give the \nfarmers a chance to be heard.\n  The President has to weigh these issues carefully and find out if \nthey protect public health or safety or the national interest before he \nturns it around. The Senator from Vermont said the Secretary could \noverturn it. That is not what this bill proposes. Only the President \ncan issue such an order, only under the most unusual circumstances. And \nmy friend from Iowa is not correct; the Congress does have power. The \nCongress does have power to overturn that action.\n  I can tell my colleagues with that threatened action facing a \nPresident, a President is not going to do this lightly. That is why we \nsay it ought to be elevated to the highest level because it would only \nbe used in the most serious of circumstances.\n  My friend from Iowa says there are all kinds of protections. The \nAdministrative Procedure Act is a great protection for farmers. That is \nlaugh line No. 2. You go to the elevators or the livestock market \naround my State or your State or anybody else's State and ask: How much \nprotection are you getting from the Administrative Procedure Act? If \nyou are lucky, they will give you a smile. They know that doesn't work \nfor the individual farmers. If there are all these protections working \nfor farmers, how come the farmers are not being protected?\n  Just ask. I urge my colleagues, if you are undecided, get on the \nphone and call a couple of farmers back in your home State and see how \nsafe they feel with all these protections that my friend from Iowa says \nare on the books. They are not there, Madam President. They are not \nthere.\n  When you unwrap it, you see that this is a very important measure to \nmove the Secretary of Agriculture into an active advocacy role which, \nfrankly, USDA has not provided. They may have the power, but they \nhaven't used it. This tells the Secretary she must use that power. And \nI believe she will. It gives the President power in unusual \ncircumstances--the highest level of circumstances--to make an order \nwhich has to be in the public interest and which is immediately \nreviewable by Congress. I think that is a protection we need.\n  Again, I urge the support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This is a good debate. I enjoy my friend from Missouri, south of the \nIowa border. I would be glad to meet on the dividing line with Missouri \nand Iowa and have a debate. We will invite the farmers in and talk to \nthem about this because this is a double-edged sword. What happens if \nthis power goes to the Secretary of Agriculture? This is a dangerous \nroad--say this is extended to all agencies. Then the Secretary of the \nInterior gets the same power. Let's say USDA makes some decision that \nwe think is beneficial for farmers and helps farmers, and then the \nSecretary of the Interior says that decision affects fish and wildlife. \nThe Secretary of Interior can just go to the President and reverse that \ndecision. That would not be good for the farmers. He overturns it, \namends it, or precludes it--those three words that the Senator has in \nhis bill. That is the double-edged sword. We just can't chance that.\n  The best protection our farmers have out there right now is those of \nus sitting on this floor today, including my friend from Missouri and \nthe occupant of the chair. I don't care if they are Democrats or \nRepublicans. The best protection for our farmers and our people in \nrural America is the Congress of the United States, the House and \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats alike--not the administration. The \nadministrations--I don't care who they are, Republican or Democrat, at \nthe White House--and I have seen it in my 27 years here--give scant \nattention to rural America.\n  I know this amendment by my friend from Missouri is well intentioned. \nI know what he is trying to do. But I have to tell you, the other edge \nof that sword can be mightier than the edge of the sword he is trying \nto give to the Secretary of Agriculture. Just look at the history of \npast administrations and then ask: How often do they come down on the \nside of farmers? How often do they come down on the side of other \ninterests? That ought to tell the tale right there.\n  No, this is not in the best interest of farmers. The best interest of \nfarmers is to keep the power here in Congress and in committees, where \nwe can fight for our rural people and our farmers and not give that \npower to the President of the United States.\n  Mr. BOND. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask my colleague this: He said maybe the Secretary of the \nInterior would want to come in. Does my friend know that, under the \nEndangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service doesn't even have \nto go to the President? The Fish and Wildlife Service can shut down an \nagricultural operation, a road-building operation. The Fish and \nWildlife Service has already, in the current law, the power we would \nseek to give the President, only there is no congressional review.\n\n  So would the Senator explain to us the difference between the power \nof the Fish and Wildlife Service and what we hope to give the President \non a congressionally reviewable basis.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend that the Fish and Wildlife Service has \nto abide by the Administrative Procedure Act and the laws passed by \nCongress. The Congress has every power to review and to keep the Fish \nand Wildlife Service--as the Senator knows, because we have done it--\nfrom doing what they want to do. We have that power. I don't see that \nin the amendment here. We have the power now. I don't see it in this \namendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, this doesn't change in any way the powers \nof Congress. As a matter of fact, it gives Congress a new power for \nexpedited congressional review.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, I don't see that. The President can \ndo all this and notify Congress. We don't have any power to do \nanything, according to this.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask my colleague to read the provisions in the amendment \nthat describe the congressional notification and congressional review, \nbeginning on line 19 of page 4, ``Reversal preclusion, or amendment of \nany agency action . . . shall be subject to section 802 of title 5, \nUnited States Code.''\n  We did not spell it out there, but that is the expedited \ncongressional review procedure. Again, I apologize for the way this is \ndrafted. Legislative counsel has said to get to expedited congressional \nreview on page 4, lines 19 through 22, do that job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged to each side equally.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I have been listening to the \nconversation and debate here. Although I am, frankly, not as familiar \nwith the details of it as I might be, I am sympathetic to what the \nSenator from Missouri is seeking to do. I deal, of course, as most of \nus do, with agriculture at all time in my State, where agriculture, \npublic lands, and grazing are very much an integral part of our economy \nand indeed our society.\n  So regulations have a great deal to do with the opportunities we \nhave, for instance, for multiple use of public lands. They have had a \ngreat deal of impact on what we have done with clean water and nonpoint \nsource water propositions, and so on. Regulations are put out there, \nquite often, without a real evaluation of what impact they have. We \nhave been dealing with one for a long time on the endangered species. I \nthink this species was nominated, but if someone looked at it before it \nwas implemented, I think the conclusion was that this was not a \nlegitimate listing.\n\n[[Page S13084]]\n\n  But work as we try, we can't seem to do much about that. So it does \nseem to me that the congressional oversight is certainly there, but we \ndon't get into the details of every application of every regulation. \nThat is not the role of Congress but, rather, to deal more broadly with \nthe authorities.\n  I think it is so interesting sometimes to see how different people in \ndifferent agencies, under the same statutes, can come up with quite \ndifferent ideas. So it seems to me it would make sense to have some \nkind of oversight on agriculture and take a look at what is done and \npromoted by some of these other agencies. The lack of having that \nopportunity generally causes us to end up in a myriad of lawsuits. And \nwe are more governed by lawsuits or the threat of lawsuits than we are \nby analysis of the impacts.\n\n  The proposal by the Senator from Missouri has a great deal of value. \nI suggest my colleagues favorably support his amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not control time. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I was sitting here thinking about this \namendment my friend from Missouri has offered. I thought of another \ninstance of how it might affect farmers. I forgot about the Secretary \nof Transportation. There are safety rules that the Department of \nTransportation promulgates for farm equipment on highways. There are \nweight limits, headlights, taillights, and other safety regulations \nthat the Department of Transportation has mandated for farm equipment \non highways.\n  Some may argue that those requirements are burdensome. I sympathize \nwith you, but you understand it is for the public good that the \nDepartment of Transportation says you have to have certain \nrestrictions, certain lights, certain warning signs on farm equipment \non highways.\n  Taking this example of what the Senator has said, if we give this \npower to the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Agriculture \nwill say: That is burdensome, that is an economic hardship on our \nfarmers that they have may have to change some practices; therefore, \nthe President can reverse it.\n  The Secretary would find it would have a significant adverse economic \nimpact.\n  Mr. BOND. May I inquire----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask my good friend from Iowa if he has read on page 4, \nline 13:\n\n       Limitation.--The President shall not reverse, preclude, or \n     amend an agency action that is necessary to protect--\n       (A) human health;\n       (B) safety; or\n       (C) national security.\n\n  The manager has raised an excellent question. I believe we have \ntotally addressed it in this bill.\n  Further, the President, before he takes action, must find that it is \nin the public interest. I believe the protection is built in.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate what my friend has said. To a certain \ndegree, again, like the rest of this, when one reads it, it sounds OK, \nbut that is pretty vague--human health or safety or national security. \nIt is vague. Who decides what that is?\n  Now I think we get to the nub of what is wrong with this amendment. \nUnder the Administrative Procedure Act, any agency, if the agency is \npromulgating a rule, has to allow time and opportunity for public \ncomment on the proposed rule. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, \nthe public must be involved, the public must be heard on the record, \nand the agencies have to take the public's input into account when they \nare promulgating the rule.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Missouri does not allow for that. \nThis says the Secretary makes these decisions, there is no public \ncomment, and then it goes to the President. Did I miss a part of it?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, may I call the attention of my friend and \ncolleague to the top of page 4 which says that before the President \ntakes any action in conducting a review, ``the President shall consider \n(A) the determination of the Secretary under subsection (c)(1)--this is \non page 4--``(B) the public record.''\n  The public record is there. The President has to consider the public \nrecord that was developed by the agency in the process of issuing the \nregulation. The public record must have in it all the information, and \nthe President can only act after consideration of that public record.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My friend said the President ought to consider the public \nrecord, but there will be no public record of what the Secretary of \nAgriculture and President do under this amendment. There is nothing in \nhere that I can find that requires the Secretary, in reviewing an \nagency action and determining whether to send it to the President, to \ndo all of this in a manner consistent with the requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. In other words, nothing in this amendment \nrequires that these activities by the Secretary must become part of the \npublic record, with hearings and an opportunity for members of the \npublic to participate. Usually, with any agency action, there is a 60- \nor 90-day period for the public to be heard on matters before a final \ndecision is made, and those public comments go on the public record. \nThat is not included in the amendment. Did I miss it?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, if I may inquire, my colleague is \ncertainly well versed in the Administrative Procedure Act. Prior to the \nadoption of a regulation by some other agency that would be under \nreview, the Administrative Procedure Act has to be followed; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. BOND. The agency has to establish a public record under the APA \nbefore a regulation is issued; is that correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right.\n  Mr. BOND. The President, under this law, can only act after an agency \naction has become final and the President is directed to take into \naccount the public record because the agency action could not be taken \nunder the APA without a public record. That is why we specify it must \ntake into account the public record, the one that was developed in the \nissuance of the regulation which is subject to the President's \ndiscretionary review.\n  Mr. HARKIN. True. But, the President can still act to change a \ndecision of the agency even if doing so goes against the underlying law \nthat Congress passed, and the President can do this without consulting \nCongress. And the President will have taken this action after the \nagency has promulgated a rule and gone through the notice and public \ncomment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  Years later, the Secretary of Agriculture can say: That action that \nwas taken by that agency 5 years ago is an economic hardship, it has an \nadverse economic impact on farmers; therefore, I am going to recommend \nto the President that he reverse it and do away with it.\n  Five years have gone by and now this action taken by the Secretary is \nevery bit as important and vital in overturning the regulation as it \nwas in promulgating it. Yet in overturning it under this amendment, \nthere is no need for any public record, no need for any public hearing.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand my colleague's concern about action taken 5 \nyears later. Will my friend look at page 3 and read lines 8 through 10?\n  Does that language not say:\n\n       If, after a proposed agency action is finalized, the \n     Secretary determines that the agency action would be likely \n     to have a significant adverse economic impact on or \n     jeopardize the safety of agricultural producers, the \n     President may, not later than 60 days after the date on which \n     the agency action is finalized, review the determination of \n     the Secretary; reverse, preclude.\n\n  I believe the language is specific, and I appreciate my colleague \ndirecting his attention to that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will consult on that because I was told the way it was \nwritten it may not, but I will check on it and see whether or not he \ncan do it after 60 days.\n\n[[Page S13085]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Is the language not clear?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not know. We are going to find out.\n  Mr. BOND. Not later than 60 days.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We will find out whether or not the determination by the \nSecretary has to take place within that 60 days. I am not certain that \nit does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged to each side \nequally.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Senator from Missouri is right, and \nI misspoke. He is absolutely right that it is 60 days. So it cannot be \n5 years. He does have to do it in 60 days. But my point is still valid \nthat there is a hearing record for an agency decision, but then this \nsets up a whole new layer of bureaucracy and layer of decisionmaking, \nand there does not have to be a hearing on the President's reversal, \npreclusion or amendment of the agency action under this amendment.\n  So, therefore, the President can wipe out whatever was done, and they \ndo not have to have a hearing based upon what he wants to do. But the \nSenator from Missouri is right, it has to be done within 60 days. Five \nyears, no. I misspoke. I was wrong on that, and I am glad to correct \nmyself on that.\n  Lastly, I would like to know if the Senator from Missouri could \nenlighten us as to the definition of agricultural producer.\n  For the Record, if we could, exactly what is an agricultural \nproducer?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged to each side \nequally.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask again my friend from Missouri, \nwhat is the definition of an agricultural producer? What is an \nagricultural producer? I wish the Senator from Missouri could enlighten \nus as to what an agricultural producer is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. The definition of agricultural producer on page 2 is the \nowner or operator of a small or medium-sized farm or ranch.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What is medium-sized? Does the Senator have a definition \nfor what a medium-sized farm might be, or ranch?\n  Mr. BOND. That would be up to the Secretary of Agriculture or the \nPresident to decide. It is not large. There are large corporate farms \nin the State of the Senator from Iowa, my State, and the State of the \nChair.\n  I think the Supreme Court said it well in describing obscenity: You \nknow one when you see one, and it is not going to be a specific farmer \nor rancher who comes in. This is going to have to be a judgment made by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture who has to defend his or her judgment \nbased on how generally it affects small and medium-sized farms and \nranches, not the large ranches, and I think that test is adequate. I do \nnot think one needs to have the technical definition of so many acres \nor so many hundreds of thousand dollars.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, another vagueness in this bill. For example, an \nagricultural producer could be Scottie Pippin who owns a horse farm of \nmaybe 120 acres or 100 acres and he is an agricultural producer. So, \nagain, very vague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged to each side equally.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 9 minutes and the \nSenator from Missouri has 16\\3/4\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 1 minute as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCAIN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \nindulgence.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this amendment is too broad, too general. \nIt violates the canon of law that exists in this country. From a \nconstitutional perspective, it grants the President authority to \noverturn action by any Federal action that the Secretary of Agriculture \ndetermines may harm producers. It allows the President to ignore any \nlaw passed by Congress. This is a significant transfer of power to the \nPresident.\n  As I discussed yesterday, the Endangered Species Act is in existence; \nwe have acknowledged for many years there should be action taken to \nchange it. There was a bipartisan effort a few years ago by Senators \nChafee, Baucus, Kempthorne, and Reid to change this. We entered into an \nagreement in the Environment and Public Works Committee to introduce \nlegislation that we would not accept any amendments on the floor; we \nwould vote against any of them. It was a tremendous revision of the \nEndangered Species Act. We had widespread support of a significant \nnumber of people in the environmental community and many people in the \ndevelopment community. It had the support of mayors and Governors. \nHowever, it was not brought to the floor because people were certain \nthey could do better. Of course, the perfect got in the way of the good \nand nothing has happened since then.\n  In spite of that, the Endangered Species Act has done a great deal to \nsalvage species and prevent the wiping out of species. Threatened and \nendangered species are now protected.\n  This amendment is certainly an assault on the environmental laws of \nthe country. It allows the President to waive the Endangered Species \nAct, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act in one fell swoop. It \nwould not be one of them; he could, in fact, waive any of the three. It \nwould set the country back at least 30 years in environmental \nprotection.\n  This amendment goes far beyond environmental laws. The definition of \nthis legislation being proposed is so vague that virtually any action \ncan be overturned by the President, including an effort to improve the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture civil rights procedures, and the \nPresident can overturn laws protecting farm workers, actions to \nimplement free trade agreements.\n  This is an amendment that is too broad and too general and tries to \naccomplish things that are so harmful from a constitutional perspective \nand from an environmental perspective. There should be other action \ntaken.\n  I hope the activities now by staff of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and others will come up with an amendment to this \nsecond-degree amendment that will more directly affect the problems \nthat are trying to be addressed in this amendment. I hope this \namendment will not become part of this bill. It would be a blow to this \nfine piece of legislation.\n  This amendment would elevate the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nauthorities of that agency over every other Federal agency and every \nother law passed by Congress. That is pretty broad. It allows the \nSecretary to stop any agency action to protect the environment, to \nprotect food safety, to protect workplace safety if the Secretary \ndecides action would have a negative impact on farmers. If another \nagency moves forward with the action to protect the environment, to \nprotect workers or our food supply, the Secretary of Agriculture simply \nwill ask the President to override these procedures and it will \nbe complete.\n\n  This is not fair. It is wrong. I hope we can come up with something \nthat better addresses what I think the Senator is trying to do. I hope \nhe is not trying in one fell swoop to take out of existence the \nEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  I welcome the distinguished majority assistant leader. He came in \nafter we had the discussions. We have clarified the issue of whether \nany safety regulations can be waived. Explicitly, this law says he may \nnot waive where safety regulations are imposed. It also includes human \nhealth or national security.\n  Now, the distinguished majority whip has pointed out this somehow \noverrides\n\n[[Page S13086]]\n\nthe power of agencies. We don't elect agencies, we elect a President \nand we elect a Congress. The power exercised in the agencies is \ndelegated by the President to the agencies. This is Presidential power. \nWe are seeking in this law simply to say when one of these agents of \nthe President does something that is really stupid, that is really bad, \nthat hurts farmers, the Secretary of Agriculture can say: Mr. \nPresident, you must look at this action. And he only has 60 day to do \nit. There are limitations. He cannot overturn where human health, \nsafety, or the national security interests are involved. Then he can go \nback and tell the person to whom he delegated the power to make the \nregulation, to carry out the law in the first place: You have to do it \ndifferently.\n  Not only is he limited, but this law says Congress can use expedited \ncongressional review to overturn his decision. This is strictly \nlimited. The President does not even have the power in this provision \nthat the Director of Fish and Wildlife has to stop things that farmers \nwant to do or that transportation officials want to do.\n  Incidentally, we checked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nThere is no advocacy counsel in Agriculture as there is in SBA, for \nsmall businesses. So this is giving the Secretary of Agriculture the \nresponsibility we think should have been there in the first place, \nnarrowly circumscribing the powers the President has to overturn it.\n  As my good friend from Nevada is leaving, I might say if he wishes to \noffer a second-degree amendment, obviously we would vote on that. But \nwe intend to keep coming back to get a vote on this one as well. I will \nbe happy to work with him. If he has other ideas he wants to put up as \na second-degree amendment, that is fine. But we will do our best to \nmake sure we have an up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Missouri. This amendment gives the Secretary of \nAgriculture the authority to review any proposed Federal agency action \nto determine whether the action is likely to have a ``significant \nadverse economic impact on or [could] jeopardize the personal safety of \nagricultural producers.''\n  Federal actions and regulations seriously impact the way the Wyoming \nagricultural producers operate. The regulations are proffered by \nagencies that do not often consider how their actions could harm small \nand medium sized agricultural operations. These are the operations that \nare facing the most risk in the marketplace. These are the operations \nthat need more protection. This amendment is important because it \nforces accountability before the fact. The Secretary of Agriculture \nwould have the option of consulting with the head of the agency \nproposing an action and could offer advice on how to make the action \nless onerous to producers.\n  Agencies realize that their actions will be scrutinized for their \nimpact on agriculture. Actions that could have a significant adverse \neconomic impact on or jeopardize the personal safety of agricultural \nproducers could be overturned or amended by the President. This \namendment does not place the needs of agriculture above human health, \nsafety or national security. It merely gives agricultural producers an \nadvocate to represent their interests. I ask that my colleagues support \nthis most important advocacy for agricultural producers and support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Bond \namendment.\n  This amendment would allow the Secretary of Agriculture to review the \nproposed actions of other Federal agencies to determine if those \nactions are likely to adversely impact agriculture producers. Should \nthe Secretary find that such an action would jeopardize a producer's \nsafety or economic well-being, the Secretary could work with other \nagencies to identify the alternatives least likely to cause harm.\n  This authority is long overdue.\n  For the first time, the government would be forced to determine in \nadvance how its actions might impact America's farmers and ranchers. \nThat is only fair. And no one within the government is better qualified \nto make that determination that the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  For too long, Federal regulators have made farmers and livestock \nproducers bear the burden and cost of government decisions. The result \nhas been that real people suffer. That is unfair. That is wrong.\n\n  This amendment will put some justice back into the system by reining \nin regulatory agencies, and giving agriculture a voice in the \nregulatory process.\n  In my State of Nebraska, we have seen the disastrous impact that \nFederal regulations have had on our farmers and livestock producers.\n  This amendment pursues some of the goals of legislation that I \nintroduced earlier this year. My bill, the ``Private Property Rights \nAct'', would require the Federal Government to conduct an economic \nimpact analysis before taking any action that would inhibit or restrict \nthe use of private property.\n  The amendment before us today is more narrow in scope. But it will \nmake government agencies think through the consequences before they act \non rules that hinder those who work America's fields, feedlots and \npastures.\n  It will put some balance back into the system by reining in over-\nreaching regulatory agencies. And most importantly, it will give \nagriculture producers a seat at the table when it comes to make and \nreviewing new regulations.\n  I appreciate the work done by the senior Senator from Missouri on \nthis issue, and support his efforts to bring some common sense and \nreality to the system. I urge my colleagues to support the Bond \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged equally.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I conferred with Senator Bond who offered \nthis amendment and he indicated he wants a vote on his amendment. We \nhave indicated we have something that would be a side-by-side vote on \nthis matter. We are going to work on that.\n  In the meantime, we are going to a quorum call or do some other \nbusiness that will not affect the Senator's amendment. In the near \nfuture, we will try to come up to something that allows maybe a side-\nby-side vote or something such as that. If we can figure out some way \nto second-degree his amendment, we will do that, or whatever.\n  Mr. BOND. My friend from Nevada makes a very reasonable request. I \nwill be happy to have side-by-side votes. I have no objection to \nsetting this aside.\n  I need to check with the ranking member. But personally I have no \nobjection so long as we can have side-by-side votes. I will defer to \nthe ranking member.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to make sure my friend understood \neverything I said. Side-by-side would be the preferable way. We may \nhave to do a second-degree amendment. But whatever it is, we will give \nthe Senator plenty of notice.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we intend to get a vote on this one way or \nthe other. We would like to do it. I think we can save everybody a lot \nof trouble if the majority side has an amendment on which they wish to \nvote. They can get that up first. I would have no objection to doing \nthat if they will then give us an up-or-down vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Whatever happens, you won't be in any worse position than \nyou are right now. We are not preventing you from going forward. Our \nonly other alternative would be to go into a quorum if anything \nhappened. Neither of us thinks that would accomplish anything. We will \nmake sure you have the opportunity to be in no worse position than you \nwould be 5 minutes from now when the time expires on your amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Being in no worse position than I am now makes me think of \nthe eighth place Cardinal hitter who was facing Kurt Schilling. It is \nnot a very attractive spot. But we will take our swings in any event.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13087]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri still controls 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining, if \nI have any remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. When all time has expired on this amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent to lay the amendment aside for the purpose of taking \nup the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  On the disposition of this amendment, we will set it aside for \nanother amendment.\n  But this amendment will be the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. We have held \ndiscussions. I believe the majority side will propound a second-degree \namendment. I have personally no objection to that. But there will be a \nvote up or down on the amendment I have provided. Perhaps at that time, \nif less than 60 days have elapsed, we will ask for 2 minutes on each \nside so the distinguished manager from Iowa may reiterate his \nobjection.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2522 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 2522 \n     to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To reform certain mandatory arbitration clauses)\n\n       Strike the period at the end of section 1021 and insert a \n     period and the following:\n\n     SEC. 10____. ARBITRATION CLAUSES.\n\n       Title IV of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, is \n     amended by inserting after section 413 (7 U.S.C. 228b-4) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 413A. ARBITRATION CLAUSES.\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case \n     of a contract for the sale or production of livestock or \n     poultry under this Act that is entered into or renewed after \n     the date of enactment of this section and that includes a \n     provision that requires arbitration of a dispute arising from \n     the contract, a person that seeks to resolve a dispute under \n     the contract may, notwithstanding the terms of the contract, \n     elect--\n       ``(1) to arbitrate the dispute in accordance with the \n     contract; or\n       ``(2) to resolve the dispute in accordance with any other \n     lawful method of dispute resolution, including mediation and \n     civil action.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an amendment that \nwill give farmers some options in identifying the forum to resolve \ndisputes with agribusinesses. I, along with a number of other Members \nof this body, am deeply concerned that the concentration of power in \nthe hands of a few large agribusiness firms--firms that can raise $1 \nbillion on Wall Street at the drop of a hat--is forcing farmers and \nranchers to be placed at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. \nThese large corporations are using their market power to force \nindependent producers into what is really a position of weakness \nthrough unfair concentration and other uses of market leverage.\n  In some cases, the domestic marketplace has become almost \nnoncompetitive for family farmers. Farmers have few buyers and \nsuppliers than ever before.\n  One indication of their dominance is the one-sided contracts that \nfavor agribusinesses at the expense of farmers and ranchers. It is of \nparamount importance that we help restore competition in rural America.\n  I was very disappointed when I learned that the Agriculture Committee \ndid not approve Senator Harkin's proposal to add a competition title to \nthis bill.\n  I commend the work of the chairman, Chairman Harkin, of the \nAgriculture Committee for his leadership on this issue.\n  When I testified at a hearing on the packers, stockyards, and \nprocessors last year, I thought a number of important reforms outlined \nshould have been addressed in the farm bill.\n  Senator Harkin's competition title would have done a lot. It would \nhave provided a measure of fairness and transparency and equity in \nAmerica's agricultural markets. I believe this proposal would have \ntaken a huge step toward ensuring the future prosperity of our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  One important aspect of the competition title would have provided \nfarmers with options to resolve disputes with agribusinesses by \nproviding farmers with a choice as to the forum for resolving disputes \nwith agribusinesses.\n  I want to be clear about this. I think that alternative methods of \ndispute resolution such as arbitration can and often do serve a useful \npurpose in resolving disputes between parties.\n  I am extremely concerned about the increasing trend of stronger \nparties to a contract forcing weaker parties to waive their rights in \nadvance and agree to arbitrate any future disputes that may arise.\n  It has recently come to my attention that large agribusiness \ncompanies often present producers with what is basically take-it-or-\nleave-it contracts which increasingly include mandatory and binding \narbitration clauses as a condition of initially entering into the \ncontract. This practice forces farmers to submit their disputes with \npackers and processors to arbitration.\n  As a result, farmers are required to waive access completely to \njudicial or administrative forums, substantive contract rights, and to \nstatutorily provided protection.\n  In short, this practice works and deprives dealers of their \nfundamental due process rights and runs directly counter to basic \nprinciples of fairness.\n  Arbitration is also billed as an inexpensive alternative to civil \naction, but this is often not actually the case. Filing fees and other \nexpenses often can result in much higher fees than actually being in a \ncivil action. Attorney's fees, whether hourly or contingency, can be \nsimilar regardless of the forum.\n  For example, in a recent Mississippi case filing, fees for a poultry \ngrower to begin an arbitration proceeding were $11,000. This is far \nmore than the $150 or $250 cost of filing a civil suit.\n  It makes no sense for a farmer to seek payment for wrongdoing when he \nor she has lost $1,000 when it costs $11,000 up front just to get the \ncase into an arbitration proceeding.\n  The result of those mandatory arbitration clauses is that farmers \noften have no forum in which to bring their dispute against the \ncompany. Arbitration clauses often require farmers to waive their right \nto a jury trial. Since the arbitration itself is extremely costly, the \nfarmer, who likely has a substantial debt due to low prices and a large \nmortgage on his farm, is basically left unable to access this costly \narbitration process.\n  Since the litigation option is taken away by contract, and the \narbitration forum can be taken away by its high cost, the grower has no \nforum in which to bring his dispute against the company.\n  If a poultry farmer suffers losses as a result of mis-weighed \nanimals, the farmer should have the right to hold the company \naccountable. If farmers are hurt because they received bad feed, we \nmust ensure that farmers have options to choose the forum through which \nthey can resolve their concerns about this product they received.\n  If a farmer believes he or she has been provided a diseased animal \nfrom an agribusiness, the farmer should have at least a forum to \naddress his or her concerns.\n  In short, we must give farmers a fair choice that both parties to an \nagricultural contract may willingly and knowingly select. This \namendment, again, does not prohibit arbitration. It would ensure simply \nthat the decision to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that\n\n[[Page S13088]]\n\nthe rights and remedies provided by our judicial system are not waived \nunder coercion.\n  Let me add that I believe two of the lead cosponsors of this \namendment are the chairman of the committee, Senator Harkin, and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. I am also pleased \nto inform the Chair and my colleagues that both the Farm Bureau and the \nFarmers Union support that. I am sure the Senator from Indiana knows \nthat does not always happen. It is a good sign we are on the right \ntrack for America's farmers with this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and give farmers \noptions to resolve disputes in the agricultural marketplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am wondering if I could ask for the \nyeas and nays on my amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that the \nvote on it follow the vote on the Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I was unaware that the Senator from \nWisconsin still had steps he needed to take relative to his amendment.\n  I withhold, at this point, my amendment and will allow the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin to proceed with his unanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I then be in a position to offer my \namendment upon the conclusion of the amendment by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take about 10 seconds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the Johnson \namendment I be allowed to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, might I say to the two \nmanagers of the bill, I think we are now in a position to go to the \noriginal proposal to move to table the Bond amendment. So we would like \nto do that now.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, my \nobjection immediately to the Senator from Minnesota was that perhaps, \nas opposed to having a stacking of amendments, all on the Democratic \nside--and admittedly yesterday we debated Republican amendments all \nday--is that there are a number of Republican amendments. Could we get \nperhaps some alternation?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, our amendments are very quick. \nYours are very long. We can complete a number of ours very quickly. \nDuring the time of the vote, we will talk about that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Very well. We would like to hear the Senator from \nMinnesota speaking on his amendment, of course, but I, on behalf of our \nside, thought I ought to interject this comment at this point.\n  Mr. REID. We will be happy to work with the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My reservation is managed and I will support the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment from the Senator from Wisconsin \nis pending.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as the debate is complete on that amendment, would \nwe return to the Bond amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We would go to the Senator from South Dakota \nfor an amendment under the previous order.\n  Mr. REID. Is there a unanimous consent agreement to that effect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. REID. I say, we would ask, then, that that be changed because \nthere are Senators waiting around. We believe we should get to the vote \non the underlying amendment. We were back watching Osama bin Laden's \ntape and were not in the Chamber, as we probably should have been. So I \nask unanimous consent--if those in the Chamber will allow us--to \nproceed to a vote on a motion to table the Bond amendment as soon as \nthe debate is completed on the Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, could I raise the question: Would, then, \nthe leader anticipate a vote on or in relation to the Feingold \namendment following the rollcall vote on the Bond amendment, if it \nreached a conclusion at that point?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I may inquire, previously it was agreed to that the \nJohnson amendment would follow the Feingold amendment. Is that still \nthe case? I assure my colleague from Indiana this is not a lengthy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding is, following the conclusion of the \nFeingold debate, there will be a vote on the Bond amendment, followed \nby a vote on the Feingold amendment, and then the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Johnson, would be recognized to offer an amendment at that \ntime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Am I going to have an opportunity to speak on the \nFeingold amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding of the Senator from Indiana \nis correct, with the qualification that the votes will be with respect \nto the Bond amendment, not necessarily on the Bond amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding is there is still time to debate the \nFeingold amendment. The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, \nwants to be heard on that amendment.\n  Mr. REID. When we go to the Bond amendment, which we are going to do, \nit is going to be a vote on that first. If the motion to table, of \ncourse, is not successful, then the Bond amendment is there naturally. \nAll right. Everyone agrees to that. That is the parliamentary place we \nwould be. And then we could not dispose of Feingold until we dispose of \nBond.\n  Mr. LUGAR. May I ask a question of the distinguished Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. We would continue with debate on the Feingold amendment at \nthis point, as I understand it, so the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin can be heard but, likewise, the Senator from Iowa could be \nheard, and others who may wish to debate that amendment.\n  Mr. REID. With respect to Feingold, that is true. And it is my \nunderstanding that debate is not going to take a long period of time. \nThat is my understanding.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am delighted the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is \nin the Chamber and is supportive of our amendment. I hope he will offer \nhis remarks in support of our amendment at this point.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our Nation's farmers and independent \nlivestock producers are becoming increasingly subjected to vertical \nintegration in their industry. I recall years past when family farmers \nhad complete control over their livestock, from farrowing until \nmarketing. Today, however, more than 80 percent of the hogs are either \nmarketed under contract or are owned by the packer.\n  In my home State of Iowa, vertical integration has led to a situation \nin\n\n[[Page S13089]]\n\nwhich many farmers can't even get a bid on their livestock from \npackers. Instead, they are simply forced to accept a slot when they can \ndeliver their livestock to packers at the packer's price. That kind of \nmakes them a residual supplier of livestock, kind of puts them in the \nposition of being last in line. It also puts them in a position \neconomically, I believe, of getting a lower price.\n  When I was farming and raising pigs, it was as simple as calling up \nmaybe an hour before you wanted to deliver your pigs, calling up the \npacking company in Waterloo, IA, and asking: What are you paying today \nfor hogs? You might dicker a little bit, but you eventually reached \nagreement. When you wanted to sell a lot, you said: Well, I want to \nsell some. So you loaded up, backed up the pickup to the hog house, \nloaded a few pigs, and drove 15, 20 miles to deliver them. It was that \nsimple. Today it is even worse for cattle in the sense that you might \nbe able to have a half hour within a whole week of time to be able to \nsell something.\n  We have a terrible situation where the family farmer is kind of stuck \nin the sense of being a residual supplier. You can say that farmer has \nthe option of contracting those sorts of things of which he can take \nadvantage. There are some people who ought to have the same opportunity \nto get the same price other people get. We are in a position now where \nthings are somewhat different.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course, I will yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The parliamentary circumstance under which we were \ntaking up these amendments was a bit convoluted up until the moment the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa came onto the floor. I would observe \nthat the amendment pending is the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is the one I am speaking about, the Feingold \namendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The nature and the thrust of the comments, I thought, \nrelated to packer ownership of livestock.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is applicable to your amendment. I will speak also \nto your amendment at another time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Very good. I look forward to the observations of my \nfriend and colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Maybe my own personal experiences in the way of family \nfarming compound this problem. I will just get to the issue and leave \nthe personal experiences I have had out of this issue.\n  In the year 2001, there are farmers who are in the same situation of \nwanting to market the same way I did the years I had livestock, from \n1959 to 1974, and again from 1984 to about 1987, even since I have been \nin the Senate. We have a situation where you can't deliver whenever you \nwant to deliver. You become a residual supplier.\n  This is a problem Senator Feingold is trying to correct. I hope I can \nhelp him. Many packers have arbitration clauses in their contracts with \nfarmers. Arbitration clauses significantly reduce the small family \nfarmer's ability to get a fair shot when a dispute with packers arises, \nsuch as misweighing of animals, bad feed cases, or wrongful termination \nof contracts.\n\n  When a dispute between a packer and a family farmer arises and the \ncontract between the two includes an arbitration clause, the family \nfarmer has no alternative but to accept arbitration to resolve the \ndispute.\n  I certainly recognize that arbitration has its benefits. I have \npromoted that as an alternative dispute resolution as a member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and we have laws as a result of that. In \ncertain cases, regardless of the advantage of arbitration, it can be \nless costly than other dispute settlement means. In certain other \ncases, it can remove some of the workload from our Nation's \noverburdened court system. For these reasons, arbitration must be an \noption, but it should be no more than an option.\n  In some cases, however, mandatory arbitration clauses create another \nlevel of litigation. State courts provide the ability for a party to \nchallenge an arbitration clause on the basis of fraud, \nmisrepresentation, or lack of knowing and voluntary waiver.\n  Farmers often must file civil actions seeking to invalidate the \narbitration clauses after a dispute arises when they realize they would \nbe placed at extreme disadvantage in arbitration in a particular case \nand because the arbitration fees are too high. We can learn from the \nexperience of the poultry industry. Today nearly 100 percent of the \nNation's poultry is captive. In recent years, poultry producers have \nbeen especially affected by mandatory arbitration clauses.\n  When one chooses arbitration, he then waives rights to access to the \ncourts and the constitutional right to a jury trial. Certain \nstandardized court rules are also waived, such as the right to \ndiscovery. This is important because a farmer must prove his case, the \ncompany has the relative information, and the farmer cannot prevail \nunless we can compel disclosure of relevant information.\n  Moreover, longstanding law states that a waiver of rights by a party \nmust be knowing and voluntary. A farmer cannot waive such rights in a \nknowing and voluntary way when he is only bargaining about a processor-\ndrafted contract about price and volume terms. He cannot make a knowing \nand voluntary waiver in a vacuum when a dispute does not exist and has \nnot been contemplated.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Feingold in support of this amendment to \nprohibit mandatory arbitration clauses from being included in contracts \nbetween packers and livestock producers. Our amendment will amend the \nPackers and Stockyards Act to provide that mandatory arbitration \nclauses in contracts between packers and livestock producers are not \nenforceable unless parties agree to binding arbitration after the \ndispute arises.\n  Our amendment will give farmers the opportunity to choose the best \nform of dispute settlement mechanism. Instead of binding arbitration, \nmediation or civil action may give family farmers a fighting chance to \nsucceed in a dispute with a packer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin is a thoughtful amendment, trying to bring \nequity between farmers who may be fairly small, quite apart from those \nwho have substantial herds, in dealing with packers.\n  It is a close call as to where the best interests of farmers may lie. \nLet me suggest that it occurs, at least to this Senator, that it is \nusually to the advantage of a farmer, particularly a small farmer, to \nhave an arbitration clause that at least settles the framework in which \nsome justice might occur.\n  I make this point because, unfortunately, litigation tends to be \nexpensive. There are possibilities in a court of law for discovery, for \nthe mandating of information the distinguished Senator from Iowa has \nmentioned, that would be very helpful perhaps and illuminate the total \nfield, but likewise, it is mostly the case that the company involved, \nthe packer or whoever is the corporate dispute in this situation, is \nlikely to have more resources, just as sometimes occurs when the \nresources are vastly unequal. Nevertheless, it is not something, it \nseems to me, the Senate ought to weigh in on.\n\n  In essence, my understanding of the Feingold amendment is that it \nwould prohibit the use of mandatory, binding arbitrary clauses in \nagricultural contracts. But to adopt the language of the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, this ought to be the option of the farmer or the \nrancher as he enters the type of contract he or she may find most \ndesirable. In other words, the individual and the smaller entity ought \nnot to be precluded from a means--in the event of a dispute, or if \nthere has been a history of dispute--that could be less expensive and \nperhaps, therefore, more certain of a day in court.\n  Therefore, I won't belabor the issue because the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin and the distinguished Senator from Iowa have \ndescribed the fact that arbitration is a frequently used means of \nresolving these disputes and, in fact, the amendment would not arise if \nthis were not the case, and the belief on the part of the two previous \nspeakers is that arbitration should not be a possibility in the \ncontract.\n  I will argue that it ought to be a possibility, ought to be an option \nfor the\n\n[[Page S13090]]\n\nfarmer or rancher, and therefore, respectfully, I oppose the Feingold \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Indiana. I have always admired his manner, and specifically his \ncandor when he indicated this was a close call. I will respond quickly \nbecause the keyword we have been using is we want to provide farmers \nwith options. The problem is, under the mandatory arbitration regime, \nthis is basically all the farmers are offered. That is the deal. You \neither agree to the mandatory arbitration provision of the contract, or \nyou are not going to be part of the system.\n  We are suggesting that banning the mandatory arbitration provision is \na genuine option. The farmer can still agree, of course, to a valid \narbitration system--that can be in the contract--and he can go to \nalternative dispute resolution. And many times, as you suggested, that \nmight be preferable. But what we are trying to do is preserve the right \nto also have the option, if necessary, to go to the court proceeding or \nadministrative proceeding.\n  I accept the premise, which is that the farmer needs options, but the \nreality is that under the mandatory arbitration system that has grown \nso tremendously and has become so much a part of contracts, they \neffectively don't get any choice.\n  That is the spirit of the amendment. Rather than interfering, I \nbelieve it returns to us where we were a few years ago, where farmers \nactually had choices in these matters.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Indiana, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Feingold-Grassley amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues. I am a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. I join my colleagues from Wisconsin and Iowa in \nsupporting this amendment. This was part of the competition title we \nhad offered in committee, which was not accepted in committee in its \ntotality. The only part that was accepted was the country of origin \nlabeling. So this is a part of the competition title. There will be \nanother amendment by Senator Johnson, also, that will fill in the \npicture on competition.\n\n  This is a good amendment. In a nutshell, I think the Senator from \nIndiana kind of put his finger on it. Right now, more and more \ncontracts between growers and producers have an arbitration clause in \nthem. The grower is basically forced to accept that. Well, we had a \nrecent case--to show how onerous this is--in Mississippi where a \npoultry grower, in order to file for arbitration, had to plunk down \n$11,000; that was his cost of the arbitration side. To take that case \nto civil court would cost him $150 to $250. If the amount in contest or \nin question is $10,000, it makes no sense for the producer to pay \n$11,000 to recover $10,000, so you just lose it.\n  The amendment really gives the grower the absolute right to choose. \nHe can go to arbitration or to civil court, notwithstanding what the \ncontract may say, and it gives that grower the right to do that. In a \nway, it levels the field a little between the grower and the retailer, \nor the processor, for example.\n  With that, I urge adoption of the amendment. I hope all time has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that debate on the \nFeingold amendment has ceased.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, I would like to make one \nadditional comment, if I may.\n  Mr. President, this may not be a definitive situation, but this \nSenator simply notes that all 50 States of the Union have adopted \ncontract arbitration statutes that allow a provision to be placed in a \nwritten contract. I have no idea if the occupant of the chair would \nhave a better idea from his experience as Governor of our State as to \nhow legislatures have dealt with this problem. But it is interesting \nthat all 50 have, and we are on the threshold of displacing whatever \njudgments might have occurred in those situations. I think this is \nsomething that many Senators do not approach without some thought as to \nwhy such contract clauses may have been made an option.\n  I appreciate the point of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin \nthat he believes, as a practical matter, farmers or ranchers dealing in \nthese contracts have no choice; that in order to sign up at least in \nsomething that appears to be favorable, because they really would not \nmove in that direction otherwise, they must, of necessity, accept an \narbitration clause. Perhaps that is so but not necessarily.\n  It would be the experience of this Senator, in at least a modest \nmanagement of the family farm that I often describe in these debates, \nthat I have approached or been approached by those who have offered \ncontractual arrangements for purchase of my corn, for example. Now, I \nwas free to either accept or reject the contract, and in most cases I \nhave rejected the contracts. In some cases, I have accepted. I was \nstill a free person to do this. I am not certain I see the mandatory \naspects of the company that was dealing with me as having some \npredatory function here or ability to coerce me into this arrangement.\n\n  I get back once again to my options. We are doing this from the \nstandpoint of the individual farmer and rancher. I accept the fact that \nperhaps in some markets, in some counties, and in some States this \ndegree of freedom of choice may not, as a practical effect, be the same \nas it is in our State of Indiana. I caution Senators, before moving too \nstoutly in this direction, to examine this and think about it.\n  It is for these reasons I will vote against the Feingold amendment, \neven as I have admitted and acknowledged that it is a close call and \nthat the arguments are reasonable on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want our colleagues to know that what \nthis amendment does is exactly the same as we are doing in the case of \ncar dealerships. We have a bill, S. 1140, which has 47 cosponsors. I am \nnot going to read the names of the cosponsors, but it is a very \nbipartisan group of people, Democrats and Republicans. I hope that \nstaff listening to this debate or Members listening to this debate will \nlook at S. 1140 and remind their Members, or the Members themselves \nwill be reminded, that they are cosponsoring legislation that does away \nwith arbitration in car dealership contracts with major manufacturers. \nIf it is OK for nonagricultural businesses, it even has to be better \nfor the family farmer that we don't have these sorts of requirements in \nthese contracts. I ask my colleagues to take a look at S. 1140.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I know we want to wrap it up. I want to make two quick \npoints. I strongly agree with the comments of the Senator from Iowa. He \nand I worked closely together on this same problem in the area of car \ndealerships. An overwhelming number of this body sees this kind of \nrelationship between the car dealer and the manufacturer as unfair.\n  Even more importantly, I wish to respond to the remarks of the \nSenator from Indiana. He raised a new argument which is 50 States have \nlaws about these kinds of arbitration agreements. That is true, but we \nare not today invading this area. This area has already been preempted \nby the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). It is already the case that the \nStates cannot under Federal law prohibit these agreements or make the \nrules for these agreements. It is already up to us.\n  This amendment does not enter a new field. This is already a field \nthat is clearly Federal in nature, and we are merely setting the rules, \nas we must, under Federal law. I do not want anyone to think we are \nsuddenly invading a new area of State authority. I have strong feelings \nabout avoiding that wherever possible.\n  This is already preempted by Federal law. We need to make a decision. \nI think the right decision is to give the individual farmers the option \nthey need and not be forced into a mandatory arbitration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been reluctant to put the Federal \nGovernment in the position of judging the appropriateness of a binding \narbitration clause in a private contract. However, I will support the \namendment because I believe that in the case, the relative ability of \nparties to negotiate contract provisions are particularly uneven. My \nvote should not be interpreted as an indication of my position\n\n[[Page S13091]]\n\non future legislation that may be offered on the subject of the Federal \nGovernment overriding binding arbitration clauses.\n  I would like to ask the sponsor of the amendment, my colleague from \nWisconsin, whether, under this amendment, either party to a contract \nthat contains a binding arbitration clause can choose alternatively to \ngo to court to resolve the dispute.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes. Under my amendment, either party would have that \noption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my understanding is all debate on the \nFeingold amendment has been completed; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nHearing none, the Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2513\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now on the \nBond amendment; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, we vote in relation to the \nBond amendment at this time.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the Chair inform us, are we under a \ntime agreement at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes to \nspeak to the Bond amendment. As I understand it, we are going to be \nvoting on it shortly.\n  I heard Senator Bond describe his amendment a little while ago. My \nimmediate reaction was that I was very supportive. I thought it sounded \nlike a reasonable amendment. Certainly we have to be concerned about \nthe frustrations that many of our farmers have experienced with regard \nto the regulatory problems they face, the frustrations they experience \nin attempting to participate in agriculture today, as complicated as it \nis. I am very sympathetic. I hear many of these complaints when I go \nhome as well.\n  I think to whatever extent we can moderate their frustration by \nfinding ways to reduce the regulatory anxiety, reduce the tremendous \namount of paperwork they have to endure, we ought to do it. There have \nbeen efforts over the years to attempt to do it, and I think we have to \ncontinue to try to do it.\n  Looking carefully at the Bond amendment, what I have come to realize \nis this amendment really makes the President not just a friend of the \nfarmer but king. I do not know if there is any other word for it. This \nwould provide powers we do not give the President under any \ncircumstances today. Only a monarch has the powers that the Senator \nintends to provide the President in situations such as this.\n\n  Basically, the Bond amendment grants the President authority to \noverturn any action by any Federal agency that he simply determines may \nharm producers. He can wipe out virtually any law of the land without \nquestion, without challenge. This is an extraordinary delegation of \npower, not only to a President but to anybody. This would make a \nmonarch of the President.\n  This amendment, needless to say, is a real assault on the \nenvironmental laws of this country. It would allow the President to \nwaive the Endangered Species Act completely, the Clean Air Act \ncompletely, and the Clean Water Act completely. Frankly, it would set \nthis country back at least 30 years in environmental protection, but it \ngoes way beyond environmental laws.\n  The definition of harm written into the Bond amendment is so vague \nthat virtually any action by any Federal agency--it could even be a \nforeign action, for that matter--could be overturned by the President, \nbut certainly efforts involving the USDA civil rights procedures, \nefforts involving laws protecting farm workers, actions to implement \nfree trade agreements--all of those--without any consultation with \nCongress, without any respect for due process, without any appreciation \nof the protections we have built in for an appreciation of the real \nsensitivity we must show in regulatory and statutory frameworks, all \nare thrown out the window with this amendment.\n  As I said a moment ago, should we be sensitive to the needs of \nfarmers and ranchers as we consider their frustration in dealing with \nthe regulatory headaches they must address? The answer is absolutely \nyes. Absolutely we have to find ways of doing that. We have to continue \nto work with the President and with the Department of Agriculture to \nmake sure this happens. But do we want, really, to give the President \nunbelievable constitutional and statutory authority in this context? Do \nwe want to say to the President: Look, if you do not like a law, just \nrepeal it unilaterally, no votes in the Congress, no consideration, no \npublic comment. You just go do it. That is what the Bond amendment says \nwe can do.\n  Frankly, we do not want to go that far. I hope people will think very \ncarefully, as well intended as the Bond amendment is, about whether we \nare willing to make a President a monarch in this case, to give him the \nauthority of fiat. Not in this democracy, not in this Republic, not in \nthis Senate, not now, not ever. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the Bond amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have been in consultation this \nmorning with the distinguished Republican leader, and we have reached \nan agreement with regard to how the Senate may proceed over the course \nof the next several days. I appreciate as always his cooperation and \nhis interest in accommodating Senators. I would like to propound a \nunanimous consent request, but let me explain the request briefly to \nSenators and then I will specifically read the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Basically, what I am about to propose is that we have a cloture vote \nthis afternoon at 4 o'clock. While it is not in this particular \nunanimous consent request, we will also attempt to take up the defense \nauthorization conference report sometime later today. That is the \nsubject of a separate request. We would then be in session on Friday, \nbut we would not entertain any rollcall votes.\n  It would be my expectation that regardless of how the cloture vote \nturns out this afternoon, we would remain on agriculture.\n  On Monday, if we can, if our colleagues will agree, we will take up \nthe conference report on education for the entire day and evening, \nwhatever length of time it takes. We would have a vote on the \nconference report on education on Tuesday morning. There would be \nadditional nominations to consider on Tuesday morning, and we would \nalso have a cloture vote if it were required on the farm bill Tuesday \nmorning as well.\n  That is the essence of the request I am about to read. I will do so \nat this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if Senator Daschle would yield before he \npropounds the request, I don't intend to object. I want to make the \nrecord clear, if he would yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. So Senators understand what has happened here and that we \nhave had a consultation, I have discussed this schedule with Senator \nLugar, the ranking member on Agriculture, and Senators Cochran and \nRoberts and others, to make sure there is agreement that we could and \nshould go ahead and go forward with this vote on cloture at 4 o'clock. \nWe could object and insist that it occur on Friday. We don't believe \nanything positive would be achieved by that. This would make it \npossible for us to go forward and deal with other issues, hopefully the \ndefense authorization and intelligence authorization, and then next \nMonday do the education conference report. That is very important.\n  There is a time agreement included here about how we would get to a \nvote on that conference report with a vote scheduled at 11.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are obviously still very concerned about this bill. We \nwant to have the opportunity to offer additional amendments and \nsubstitutes. We saw no reason not to have the cloture vote at this \ntime. I wanted to get that in the Record before the UC was propounded.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Under the agreement you are about to propound, we will \nhave a cloture vote at 4 o'clock. I am assuming we will still consider \nagriculture-related amendments until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. May we have an agreement that we will alternate? We only \nhave 3 hours to do amendments. I don't know if cloture will be invoked, \nbut if it is invoked, that will preclude a great number of amendments. \nMay we have an understanding that we will alternate between Democrats \nand Republicans?\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just say to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, I have no reservations about suggesting that we alternate \nRepublican and Democratic amendments.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. That was the decision made earlier--not the decision, but \nSenator Lugar and Harkin and I entered into a dialog. That would be the \ncase. The next amendment will be offered by the Senator from South \nDakota. Then we would wait for someone on your side to offer an \namendment, and then we would go back and forth. That was talked about \nearlier today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Fair enough.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would also note that if cloture is invoked, this \nagreement also will provide that the Cochran-Roberts amendment still \nwill be in order. It accommodates the germaneness question regarding \nCochran-Roberts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Before the majority leader propounds a request, would \nyou also amend that to include the Dorgan amendment to make sure it \nwould be available, if cloture is invoked?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Dorgan is not on the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am concerned if we get cloture, there are a lot of \namendments that will fall. The Dorgan amendment happens to deal with \npayment limitations. I am concerned that it might fall. I have an \namendment dealing with payment limitations. That is my concern. I am \nnot a big fan of cloture, as I am sure the majority leader knows. But \nthere may be others. I make mention of the Dorgan amendment because I \nam interested in that subject. If you include that, I would appreciate \nit.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to include that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote on the pending substitute amendment occur at 4 p.m. today; \nthat Members have until 11 a.m. tomorrow to file second-degree \namendments; that notwithstanding rule XXII, the alternate amendment by \nSenators Cochran and Roberts, and the amendment offered by Senator \nDorgan regarding payment limits, still be in order if cloture is \ninvoked on the substitute amendment; that following the cloture vote, \nregardless of the outcome, the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider executive Calendar Nos. 589, 590, and 592; that upon the \ndisposition\n\n[[Page S13093]]\n\nof those nominations, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; that any statements thereon appear in the Record, and \nthe Senate return to legislative session.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that on Monday, December 17, at 1 \np.m. the Senate proceed to the conference report on H.R. 1 for debate \nonly, and that on Tuesday, December 18, there be 90 minutes remaining \nfor debate, 60 minutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Health, Education, and Labor Committee, or their \ndesignees, and 15 minutes each for Senators Wellstone and Jeffords; \nthat the Senate vote on the conference report at 11 o'clock on that \nday, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, reserving the right to object, \nI don't intend to object, but I wonder if I may be included on two \namendments that are very important in my State with respect to crop \ninsurance and the Klamath Falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will accommodate the Senator from \nOregon on his request and ask that they be included in the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator restate the subject matter \nof the amendments?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I have two amendments. One deals with a change \nin crop insurance to include farmers for coverage under crop insurance \nwhen the disaster is not natural, but Government-made.\n  The second one is just simply as to policy with respect to a long-\nterm plan that Senator Wyden and I are working on that includes as one \nof its goals the economic viability of the agricultural community of \nKlamath Falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2534\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself, \n     Mr. Grassley, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2534.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make it unlawful for a packer to own, feed, or control \n                   livestock intended for slaughter)\n\n       On page 886, strike line 5 and insert the following:\n\n                     Subtitle C--General Provisions\n\n     SEC. 1021. PROHIBITION ON PACKERS OWNING, FEEDING, OR \n                   CONTROLLING LIVESTOCK.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards \n     Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 192), is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n     (g) and (h), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following:\n       ``(f) Own, feed, or control livestock intended for \n     slaughter (for more than 14 days prior to slaughter and \n     acting through the packer or a person that directly or \n     indirectly controls, or is controlled by or under common \n     control with, the packer), except that this subsection shall \n     not apply to--\n       ``(1) a cooperative or entity owned by a cooperative, if a \n     majority of the ownership interest in the cooperative is held \n     by active cooperative members that--\n       ``(A) own, feed, or control livestock; and\n       ``(B) provide the livestock to the cooperative for \n     slaughter; or\n       ``(2) a packer that is owned or controlled by producers of \n     a type of livestock, if during a calendar year the packer \n     slaughters less than 2 percent of the head of that type of \n     livestock slaughtered in the United States; or''; and\n       (3) in subsection (h) (as so redesignated), by striking \n     ``or (e)'' and inserting ``(e), or (f)''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amendments \n     made by subsection (a) take effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (2) Transition rules.--In the case of a packer that on the \n     date of enactment of this Act owns, feeds, or controls \n     livestock intended for slaughter in violation of section \n     202(f) of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (as amended by \n     subsection (a)), the amendments made by subsection (a) apply \n     to the packer--\n       (A) in the case of a packer of swine, beginning on the date \n     that is 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (B) in the case of a packer of any other type of livestock, \n     beginning as soon as practicable, but not later than 180 \n     days, after the date of enactment of this Act, as determined \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, the amendment pending aims to protect \nAmerica's livestock producers from the overwhelming market domination \nof a few meatpackers.\n  My amendment is based upon bipartisan legislation I introduced \nearlier this year, S. 142, which strengthens the Packers and Stockyards \nAct of 1921, by prohibiting large meatpackers from owning livestock \nprior to slaughter.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by my friend Senator Grassley, as well \nas Senator Wellstone, the Agriculture Committee chairman, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Thomas, Senator Daschle, and Senator Dorgan. All of \nthese Senators have cosponsored my bill, which enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. I applaud my colleagues for their leadership on this issue, \nand especially thank Senator Wellstone for offering this amendment in \nthe Agriculture Committee. Unfortunately, it was defeated, but with \nmore information about what our amendment does, and doesn't do, I \nbelieve we'll gain much more support here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, let me address specifically what our amendment does; \nFirst, it bans large meatpackers from owning slaughter cattle, hogs, \nand lambs for more than 14 days prior to the time in which these \nlivestock are slaughtered. Second, it exempts producer-owned \ncooperatives engaged in slaughter and meatpacking. Therefore, many of \nthe innovative, start-up projects operating and being formed to give \nproducers greater bargaining power in the market will not be affected \nby our amendment. There are a number of these cooperative projects Mr. \nPresident, that I would like to highlight as examples;\n  For instance, our amendment would exempt the United States Premium \nBeef packing plant. U.S. Premium Beef is located in Kansas and is the \nfirst value-added meatpacking plant owned by a farmer-controlled \ncooperative in the nation. U.S. Premium Beef works with Farmland \nIndustries in this project. The facility processes cattle owned by \nranchers. In a value-added-twist, the ranchers also own the processing \nfacility itself, in conjunction with Farmland Industries, a \ncooperative. This is the kind of innovative project that our amendment \ndoes not impact.\n  The amendment also looks forward to many similar projects breaking \nground in the future, and exempts any farmer-owned co-op aiming to \nprocess cattle in South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, and other portions \nof the country. Our amendment also exempts the ``Pork America'' \ncooperative working to finalize plans for the Nation's first major pork \npacking cooperative, and the amendment exempts a number of modest-sized \nco-op lamb slaughtering projects in the Northern Plains and West. But \nco-ops are not the only businesses exempt from the ownership ban. \nSmall, producer owned packing and processing facilities handling less \nthan 2 percent of the national, annual slaughter are also exempt under \nour amendment, whether or not they are a co-op.\n  Therefore, if a farmer rancher owned facility slaughters less than \n1,960,000 hogs, 724,000 beef cattle, or 69,200 lambs, they are exempt \nfrom the ownership ban under our amendment. For instance, ``Harris \nRanch'' in California is a producer-owned beef packing plant, not \nformed as a cooperative, which handles less than 724,000 head of beef \ncattle per year. As a partnership of cattlemen who own a packing plant, \nthis facility will be exempt according to my amendment. We don't want \nto stifle or inhibit these new ventures from making a real, bottom-line \ndifference for American livestock producers, so my amendment exempts \n``Harris Ranch'' and all other non-cooperative, producer owned \nprocessing and packing plants that slaughter less than 2 percent of the \noverall domestic slaughter of beef cattle, lamb, and hogs.\n\n[[Page S13094]]\n\n  That's the substance of our amendment. Here is why we need our \namendment. Our amendment would take on a growing problem in livestock \nmarketing--that of packer ownership of livestock and captive supplies \nof livestock that allow packers to manipulate cash prices paid to \nproducers. This amendment would strengthen the 80 year-old Packers and \nStockyards Act, to make it unlawful for a packer to own, feed, or \ncontrol livestock intended for slaughter.\n  Our amendment also addresses a glaring deficiency in the Packers and \nStockyards Act of 1921, because it has failed to prevent packers from \nsqueezing independent producers out of the market.\n  Here are a few cases in point where current law--written 80 some \nyears ago--has failed to promote competition in livestock markets. The \npoultry industry has been almost entirely vertically integrated for \nmany years, and the pork industry is becoming more so. The hog industry \nespecially has been consolidating rapidly in recent years. At the \npacker level, the 4 largest firms' share of hog slaughter reached 56 \npercent in 1999, compared with 40 percent in 1990. In 1997, 64 percent \nof all hogs were marketed through some form of forward sales \narrangement between producers and packers, and approximately 10 percent \nof all market hogs involved entire or partial packer ownership.\n  According to USDA's Economic Research Service, larger producers--\n5,000+ head--most often aligned with large integrators and meatpackers \ncurrently account for nearly three-fourths of the hog production, \ncompared with just over one-fourth in 1994. In the cattle sector, the 4 \nlargest beef packers accounted for 80 percent of all steers and \nheifers--beef cattle--slaughtered in 1999, compared with 36 percent in \n1980. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the number \nof U.S. packing houses for beef cattle and hogs has declined by two-\nthirds since 1980.\n  Smithfield Foods has made 17 acquisitions during this time, giving \nSmithfield 20 percent of the domestic processing market for pork. A \nrecent column in the ``Economist'' stated Smithfield would like to \nincrease that share to 30 percent, and hopes its hiring of former \nClinton administration DOJ Anti-Trust Chief Joel Klein as a Smithfield \nattorney may help them in that process. These are the facts about \nconsolidation land market power. These are the hard cold facts that \nfrustrate every independent farmer and rancher in the United States. \nThe frustration grows when one considers recent profits made by \nagribusinesses:\n  Cargill increased profits by 67 percent in the last quarter, Hormel \nincreased profits by 57 percent, and Smithfield increased profits \nnearly 30 percent. Finally, Tyson, now the single largest meat \nprocessor in the world with its purchase of IBP, tripled profits in its \nmost recent quarter. Conversely, crop prices took a nose dive so severe \nin September that it marked the worst one-month drop in crop prices \nsince USDA has been keeping records over the past 90 years. We must \ninject some real competition, access, transparency, and fairness into \nthe marketplace if we are to see these tragic circumstances change. \nInstead, agribusiness is vigorously lobbying Congress to ensure the \nmarket is noncompetitive, closed off, veiled, and unfair.\n  Packer ownership of livestock is a function of captive supplies. \nCaptive supplies are livestock that are controlled by packers either \nthrough contractual arrangements with producers or outright \nownership. In other words, captive supplies are all cattle and swine \nthat are not negotiated and priced within seven days of slaughter. The \ntrend towards captive supplies and packer ownership has dramatically \nincreased the market power of meat packers far beyond the control they \npreviously had in the marketplace even 10 years ago.\n\n  Banning major meatpackers from owning livestock prior to slaughter is \nnot a radical idea, there is a basis for what we are trying to do. The \nPackers and Stockyards Act, and its regulations, currently prohibit \nsale barns or auction markets from vertically integrating. \nSpecifically, stockyards may not own or control buying stations, \npacking plants, or livestock feeding operations. The rationale is that \nsuch ownership or control creates conflicts of interest, access \nproblems for other producers, and opportunities for self-dealing which \ndistort the market.\n  Because meatpackers are similarly situated to stockyards as a market \ncreator and market forum, the same rules should apply to them, but, \nunfortunately, the rules do not apply to the packers. Moreover, similar \nmarketplace protections exist in other industries. For example, film \nproduction and movie companies cannot own local movie theaters by law. \nBroadcasting companies are prohibited from owning local television and \nradio stations. Why can't similar protections apply to the family \nfarmers and ranchers raising livestock in the United States?\n  Here are some of the harmful effects of the packer ownership/captive \nsupply trend: A stark increase of packer market power by allowing \npackers to stay out of the cash market for extended periods of time, \nthus reducing farm gate demand and driving down price; a severe \nreduction, or even elimination, of the ability of small and medium-\nsized producers to even access the market. An increase of packer market \npower by allowing packers to go to the cash market only during narrow \n``bid windows'' or time periods each week rather than bidding all week, \nthus resulting in panic selling by producers; a distortion of public \nmarkets because captive supply livestock are not priced at the time of \nthe commitment to deliver them. Rather they are priced after delivery.\n  This means that transactions concerning these packer-owned livestock \nare not part of the publicly reported daily cash market. Narrowing the \nvolume in the market makes it more subject to manipulation. Less cash \nmarket volume also increases the likelihood for reduced competition, \nfewer competitors, and a lower price.\n  In conclusion, not only must we strengthen the law, but we must also \ncall on USDA and the Department of Justice to better enforce it. \nEnforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act has been dismal, no \nmatter who sits at the Secretary of Agriculture's desk. We must call \nupon USDA and DOJ to better enforce our laws. Yet, ensuring free and \nfair markets is not a one-way street. The fault is not solely with \nUSDA. We must pass stronger laws in Congress as well. Therefore, while \nCongress has not been successful in trying to urge our Cabinet leaders, \nregardless of party, to protect the market, I believe we must enact \nstronger laws to prevent further erosion of competition in livestock \nmarkets.\n  Our amendment would essentially update and strengthen the Packers and \nStockyards Act, which is supposed to prevent any preference and \nStockyards Act, which is supposed to prevent any preference in packer \nprocurements of livestock. The 80-year-old act was also supposed to \nguarantee a well functioning marketplace on fair terms for all farmers \nand all ranchers. Packer ownership of livestock is inherently \npreferential and anticompetitive. But with USDA either asleep or in the \npackers' pockets, this bill is desperately needed. Considering where \nthe industry currently stands, with the world's largest poultry \nprocessor buying the world's largest beef packer, as well as a number \nof other proposed mergers in the last year, I believe this amendment is \ncritically important to halt what is an unfair move toward vertical \nintegration.\n  A ban on packer ownership of livestock would not drive packers out of \nbusiness because most of their earnings are generated from branded \nproducts and companies marketing directly to consumers. Conversely, \nlivestock ownership by packers and further concentration in the \nlivestock industry could drive independent livestock producers out of \nbusiness because they are at the mercy of these large corporations.\n  Our Nation's farmers and ranchers want competition in the \nmarketplace, but when a meatpacker owns livestock, that actually \nreduces competition. If allowed to grow unchecked, packer ownership of \nlivestock will put a stranglehold on the Nation's family farmers and \nranchers and eventually will drive those operations out of business. \nThis farm bill needs to combat marketplace concentration so that \nfamily-size farmers and ranchers are not squeezed out of business by \nmultinational corporations.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important amendment \nthat will preserve family farmers and ranchers by putting a stop to \nconcentration\n\n[[Page S13095]]\n\nin the livestock industry and preserve the level of competition that \nhas made our free market economy over the years the greatest success \nstory economically in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support my colleague from \nSouth Dakota. Before I continue, it is my understanding that after this \namendment, we will go to the Smith amendment on the Republican side. \nSenators Wyden and Brownback have an amendment they say will be \naccepted. I ask unanimous consent I then be allowed to offer my \namendment after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from South \nDakota, I so appreciate his work. What we are saying with this \namendment--and it is hard for people not in farm country to understand. \nThe truth is, this is vitally important to consumers. We are saying a \npacker cannot own a supply of livestock during the 14 days prior to \nslaughter. Why? Because what is happening is these big packers are \nbuying when prices are low, and then they hold on to the livestock \nwhich is ready for slaughter for the purpose of dumping it on the \nmarket when prices start to go up.\n  The IBPs or Tysons of this world are basically controlling the \nmarket. Frankly, they are jacking the independent producers around. \nThat is exactly what is happening, I say to Senator Johnson. I am very \nproud to join him with this amendment.\n  Minnesota family farmers tell me the issue they are most in agreement \non--whether it is Farm Bureau or Farmers Union--is this whole problem \nof concentration, these conglomerates that have muscled their way to \nthe dinner table and are shoving family farmers off the land.\n  There was a recent poll done by the Nebraska Institute of \nAgriculture: 72 percent of farm households agree that packer ownership \nshould be prohibited.\n  To save time, because there are other Senators who want to offer \namendments and they are worried about this cloture vote, although I \ncertainly hope we will get cloture, I will not go through the \nstatistics on concentration. Whether it is pork, whether it is beef \npackers, whether it is turkey processors, chicken broilers, over and \nover, Economics 101, we have at best an oligopoly--three or four firms \nthat dominate 50 percent of the market--and at worst we have a \nmonopoly.\n  Everywhere farmers work, whether they buy from or sell to, they are \nup against large conglomerates. It is like an auction: If you have a \nlot of buyers, you are going to get a decent price. If you have just \ntwo people you can bid to, you are not likely to do very well.\n  So what this amendment is all about is trying to give some \nopportunities to our independent producers. These packers practice \nacquiring captive supplies through contracts, and then they use their \nownership to reduce the number of opportunities for the small and \nmedium-sized farmers to sell their hogs. With fewer buyers and more \ncaptive supply, there is less competition for independent farmers' \nhogs, and, frankly, it is a scam. This is all about lower prices.\n  My colleague from South Dakota already said this, but what we are \nseeing is a breathtaking amount of consolidation taking place in the \nfood industry. We learned this summer that Tyson's Foods has finalized \nits agreement to purchase IBP. The deal has merged the country's \nlargest poultry producer with the country's largest processor of red \nmeat.\n  We asked the Department of Justice to investigate, but I do not think \nthe laws are strong enough, and I do not expect this Department of \nJustice to really take this on.\n  We can at least say: Look, we do not want to have these packers \nacting to stifle competition, and that is exactly what this amendment \nis all about. Some are saying we are trying to stifle competition. This \namendment does precisely the opposite. We want to restore competition \nin the livestock markets, and we want to put some freedom back into the \nfree market system. We want to put free enterprise back into the free \nenterprise system. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Some say this concentration leads to cheaper prices for consumers, \nbut, frankly, the farm retail spread grows wider and wider. That is the \ndifference between what our producers make and what consumers actually \npay at the grocery store.\n  This amendment has the support of a broad base of family farm \norganizations. This amendment sides with family farmers and ranchers \nover these agriculture conglomerates, and it boils down to whether or \nnot we want to have independent livestock producers in agriculture or \nwe are going to yield to concentration and see farmers and ranchers \nbecome low-wage employees on their own land.\n  That is the trend. That is where we are going. This amendment is an \neffort to try to fight that. If we continue to stand idle and watch \ncontrol of the world's food supply fall into the hands of the few, \nconsumers are going to be the real losers. So I say to my colleague \nfrom Indiana, I really could talk for hours on this, but I am trying to \nbe brief because I know other Senators have amendments.\n  I will simply say two things: No. 1, this is all about assuring \ncompetition. This is an amendment for our independent livestock \nproducers. It is a question of whether we side with them or whether we \nside with these huge conglomerates who have a tremendous amount of \npower. This whole manipulation of the market is, from my point of view, \noutrageous. These conglomerates buy when prices are low and then they \ndump--basically they keep the prices low by going back to the \nslaughterhouse and dumping it on the market. It is absolutely \noutrageous, and I think that is why there is so much support for this \namendment in the countryside.\n  Let me say one final thing. Since so many Senators are trying to \nbring amendments before cloture, I certainly hope we will vote cloture. \nI do not think this farm bill ought to be stopped. We are talking about \na $3 billion increase of net income for our producers in this country. \nTime is not neutral. I think the Freedom to Farm bill became the \n``freedom to fail'' bill. It is time to change this farm policy, and I \nhope Senators will vote for cloture and we will not see a \nfilibuster and a blocking of this bill.\n\n  People in the countryside are pretty impatient about this. Time is \nnot on their side. They would like to see a change in agriculture \npolicy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I inquire of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota, I understand the Senator asked unanimous consent that \nhis amendment might be debated immediately following the Johnson \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No, not at all. I heard the Senator from Indiana \nearlier. I said my understanding was that following the Johnson \namendment, we would move to the Republican side and that Senator Smith \nwould then submit an amendment. I was trying to accommodate the Senator \nfrom Oregon. My understanding is Senator Wyden and Senator Brownback \nhad an amendment that was going to be taken up and they needed just a \nfew minutes, and then I asked to follow that. That is all.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator, and I apologize for my \nmisunderstanding because I recall we had a colloquy in which the \nSenator was involved earlier on.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Indiana, would I ever do \nthat?\n  Mr. LUGAR. No, and the Senator has not. I appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent that the Johnson \namendment be set aside for the purpose of offering an additional \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Reserving the right to object, if there is no further \ndebate on the Johnson amendment, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment and that we proceed to the Smith amendment.\n\n[[Page S13096]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I did not realize there \nwere Members who wished to speak in opposition to the Johnson \namendment, so I will withdraw my request at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to do that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, what was the request from \nthe distinguished Senator from South Dakota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota called for the \nyeas and nays to be in order prior to setting aside the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I withdraw that request if there is additional debate \npro or con on the amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, there is a request for further debate.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I was simply suggesting we take care of the Johnson \namendment before we moved on to the Smith amendment. That was my only \ngoal.\n  Mr. LUGAR. In response to the distinguished Senator, we have \nadditional debaters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Are we on the \nJohnson amendment now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is there a time limit on the Johnson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how long have we debated the Johnson \namendment to this point? I ask that there be one half-hour remaining on \nthe Johnson amendment divided evenly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is there any time limit the Senator will agree on?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Not until Senator Burns, who wishes to be heard, comes to \nthe Chamber to speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think it is becoming clear what is going on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Johnson \namendment. There may be some understandable sympathy with respect to \nthe amendment of Senator Johnson and Senator Grassley. We all claim \nconcern for the small farm and for reducing consumer prices. We are in \nthe process of voting on numerous amendments to protect the viability \nof the family farm and the farmer's ability to provide for his or her \nfamily.\n  Personally, Virginians have been working on a peanut provision to \nprotect small Virginia peanut farmers from the untenable, devastating, \nand radical changes proposed in this farm bill. I have heard the \nstatistics that have been quoted by the Agriculture Committee ranking \nmember, Senator Lugar, in which Senator Lugar pointed out that a large \npercentage of Federal farm subsidies go to a relatively small \npercentage of our farms. These are oftentimes larger farms, and I \ncertainly understand his concern.\n  The situation being addressed by this amendment is not the same type \nof issue. The Johnson amendment will actually harm the small farm it \nintends to protect.\n  This amendment will prevent entrepreneurial and creative companies \nfrom achieving operational quality, efficiency, and economies of scale. \nThis amendment will drive up consumer prices. This amendment will make \nthe U.S. products less competitive in world markets. This amendment \nwill drive small farmers out of the market. Here is how.\n  If packers are prohibited from growing their own livestock, they will \nsee an immediate decline in futures prices. Packers who currently run \nboth operations will have to sell their livestock, thereby, of course, \ndriving down market prices. When prices for hogs or cattle go down, we \nknow what the return will be. It will shrink, making it--especially for \nthe farmer--much tougher or difficult for especially the smaller \nfarmers with less profitmaking room to continue in business.\n  Now, this is obviously not the way to protect the small family farm. \nWhen prices go down, it will be too late in the longer run--say, the \nseason or two after. The small farms will not have been able to \nwithstand an immediate and drastic fall in prices, and they will \nalready have been shut down and will hardly be in a position to buy \nmore livestock.\n  Excessive Federal Government regulations already threaten our farming \ncommunity's declining profit margins due to more Federal interference \nin the marketplace, and that will hurt our hard-working farmers.\n  Now, the long-term effect of this amendment would be to drive up \ncosts for the processors and packers and ultimately drive up the costs \nfor consumers. Our American farmers and packers would lose market share \nto international competition that isn't restricted by their foreign \ngovernments. Indeed, many foreign governments greatly subsidize and \nprotect their agricultural interests.\n  In the economic wealth of Virginia, we hold an inventory in the \nprivate sector of about 500,000 heads of hogs and pigs, making it a \nsignificant producer. We are also a large producer of cattle and \ncalves. We enjoy a great mix of traditional farms that sell their \nlivestock to processors and packers who also grow their own livestock. \nThe predictability of supply experienced by these multifaceted packers \nresults in an efficiency that is achieved by larger operations. These \nwell-managed pork processing companies are able to offer high-quality, \nspecialized items, quality, low-priced products to consumers as a \nresult of this efficiency, as well as quality assurance of the methods \nof raising the hogs and cattle. We understand that in some of the \nspecialized parts of the marketplace, in the way cattle are fed, they \nwill then be able to label that as kosher or some other method of \nproduct that some consumers may desire.\n  We are eager to finish the business of the Senate and go home to \nvisit our families for the holiday season. Many will get a Virginia \nham. They may get pork loin. They may get some beef roast or who knows \nwhat. But this amendment, unfortunately, will limit the ability of the \nefficient companies to offer these high-quality, competitively priced \nproducts.\n  While I applaud the intent of this amendment to protect both the \nfamily farm and the consumer, I disagree with the methods of achieving \nthis goal. Efficient companies that offer high-quality and low-priced \nproducts to consumers ought to be applauded and encouraged in their \nefforts. Congress should be saying yes to high-quality, U.S.-produced \nconsumer goods. We ought to be saying yes to enabling long-term \nviability of family farms, and we ought to be saying yes to allowing \nstrong and efficient businesses to succeed in the United States as well \nas internationally.\n  I will conclude by saying I cannot see the logic of the Federal \nGovernment telling a legitimate company in this country or even a \nhometown butcher shop that you can't own a pig or you can't own a hog \nor you can't own a cow. I don't think it is the business of the Federal \nGovernment to tell someone who can own a pig, a cow, or a calf. \nTherefore, I oppose this amendment and hope my colleagues will as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, simply stated, this amendment would curtail \nthe ability of packers to ensure a continuous supply of meat products. \nWithout a certain supply, packers cannot operate, as the Senator from \nVirginia has pointed out, in a most efficient way. Margins for packers \nare already tight. They would be forced to run fewer shifts and close \nprocessing lines. This would force meat prices for consumers to rise, \nadversely affecting the poorest Americans who spend a higher percentage \nof income on food.\n  We could amplify each of these points, but they are, I believe, \nessential to the debate. The reason that packers attempt to make \ncertain they have a certain supply through control of that supply is to \nmake certain that a continuous flow of production occurs.\n  I appreciate the point being made by the sponsor of this amendment \nbecause, clearly, in years gone by competition in the stockyards of \nAmerica made for a very lively market.\n  My family was involved in that business. My dad was a livestock \ncommission man at the Indianapolis stockyards, handling the hogs while \nmy\n\n[[Page S13097]]\n\ngrandfather handled the cattle. At 4:30 in the morning he went to the \nyards and did the best he could for the farmers he represented. Those \nstockyards long since have left our city, as they have left almost all \ncities of my State. It is in large part because those who are hog \nfarmers and cattle farmers arrive at contractual arrangements that are \nfavorable to them.\n  The intent of this amendment, well meaning as it may be, is to roll \nback two decades of history in the business. The rollback will not \nnecessarily be helpful to most Americans. It certainly will not be \nhelpful for the price of meat or jobs of those employed by the \nmeatpackers. These considerations have to be weighed as we evaluate the \nJohnson amendment.\n  It is for these reasons, recognizing the point my colleague is \nmaking, that I oppose his amendment. I am hopeful Senators will \ncarefully consider each of these factors as they come to a vote on this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary procedure at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Johnson amendment \nNo. 2534.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Are there amendments made in order following the \ndisposition of the Johnson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. In order are the Smith amendment, a \nWyden-Brownback amendment, and a Wellstone amendment --in that order at \nthe present time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the McCain amendment be made \nin order after the last amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in offering \nthis amendment to help increase smart competition in the livestock \nsector. I think for a number of years we have observed changes that \nhave taken place in agriculture.\n  In my State, agriculture is largely livestock, beef, and we feel \nstrongly about that. We have more producers and fewer processing. This \ncan cause problems. Increasingly apparent is the difference between the \ncost the producers receive and the retail costs. There is a great \ndifferential. One wonders if some of the prices that go to producers \nfrom processors are where they ought to be.\n  Additional regulation becomes necessary because of a loophole that \nhas been there for some time. My colleagues and I have been concerned \nabout that. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 does not clearly \ndefine or address packers owning livestock for slaughter.\n  This amendment would prohibit packers, meatpacking companies, from \nowning and feeding livestock--with the exception of producer-owned \ncooperatives and small meatpacking companies. An exemption for \ncooperatives is included as recognition and reward to producers who \nhave invested their resources to enhance their own market niche. I \nthink we will see more of this--I hope that, indeed, we do--where \nproducers are more involved in processing and moving their products on \nto the retail area.\n  By placing a prohibition on meatpacking companies, our efforts today \nwill be branded as anticompetitive, in support of big Government versus \nfree market. The intentions are obviously just the opposite. Our goal \nis to restore competition in livestock markets. Reform, I believe, is \nlong overdue.\n  Livestock markets have become increasingly concentrated. Producers \nhave fewer options for selling their products. Four top meatpacking \nfirms control roughly 80 percent of today's slaughter market. Less than \n20 years ago, four top firms controlled only 36 percent of the market. \nSo times have changed. Some of the rules need to change. This is an \nopportunity to look at that.\n  We saw examples where the on-farm price of commodities goes down at \nthe same time retail prices go up or remain constant. The problem of \nprice disparity, I believe, is somewhat, at least, attributable to \nmarket concentration and that is what this amendment addresses. This \namendment should be our first step toward making fair markets for our \nproducers.\n  I certainly urge support for this amendment and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my ranking member on the \nAgriculture Committee for protecting me for just a little time here. I \nwill not take too much time on this particular issue. I do have a \ncouple of questions, though, for the Senator from South Dakota.\n  How does this deal with contracts? In other words, there are some \npeople who forward-contract, under a pricing system, on a grid or \nwhatever. How does this affect that?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I appreciate the inquiry from my friend from Montana. \nThis legislation does not prohibit forward contracts at all. There are \nsome who suggest maybe we should, but we chose not to go down that \nroad. So forward-contracting remains an option for both the producers \nand the livestock packers.\n  Mr. BURNS. Do you deal with futures and options?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. This legislation does not deal with futures and options.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am supportive of what the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is trying to do. I associate myself with the remarks made \nby my good friend from Wyoming. Unless we deal with contracts, this \nmatters not because, in other words, they will just contract the \ncattle. They will contract the cattle right from the cow/calf producer \nbefore they even go into the feedlot.\n  I don't want to get caught in the same quagmire we have had with \nmarket reporting. That has turned out to be a beast. I do not know if \nit has helped out in any way. But what our intent was on market \nreporting was that the infrastructure of the USDA Market Reporting \nService was already there and sales had to be reported. But OMB got in \nthe middle of it and said, if only one guy was bidding on the \nlivestock, then they can't report that because that is a violation of \nprivacy in business or--I don't know, lawyers have some fancy word for \nit. I am not a lawyer. I have never been hinged with that title. So the \nOMB got in the middle of it, and they had a working sheet on why we \ncould not have true transparency in the livestock marketing business. \nIt was that thick. It was just--it would just blind you.\n\n  I have nothing against cooperatives either, but I have yet to see one \nthat is managed all that well. What they are trying to do with prime \nbeef is a venture--and we have producers in Montana who have cattle on \nfeed in that program. But we must not take away a producer's right to \ndo business with whomever he wants to do business, if he wants to do it \non a private party basis. So I have some reservations about this \namendment.\n  I appreciate the work that has been done. I don't know of any other \nway. We have not been able to attract any kind of sympathy or notice \nfrom the Justice Department when it comes to antitrust in the \nagricultural markets, other than ADM. That is about the only one, over \nin soybeans.\n  So if we do not do anything about contracts nor the use of futures to \nhedge your cattle or hogs--the same is not true in sheep. I have been \nlooking at the sheep industry. I am still very much interested in it \nbecause we have a situation there that is completely intolerable to the \nlamb industry in this country. The excuses they give for a market that \ndips so fast--I mean it went down something like $20, $30 per \nhundredweight on lambs in less than 2 weeks, and there was no reason \nfor it other than the principal processor and slaughterer and importer \nin this country has that big lever and they can do it.\n  So I haven't made up my mind on this, but I did want to say if there \nis no treatment of contracts or futures or options, then I don't know \nhow we close all the loopholes of packer-owned cattle. Right now \npackers can't own stockyards, and there was a good reason for that. \nThat law is being enforced. But one of these days I think those of us \nwho have a interest in the livestock industry--and there are a lot of \nus in this body who do and some probably know more about it than I\n\n[[Page S13098]]\n\ndo--we are going to have to take a look at packers and stockyards and \nmaybe do some reforms in that respect. I think the total law will \nprobably need redoing.\n  I just wanted to bring that to the attention of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and to the attention of others in this body. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so Members understand, we are going to \narrange a vote on this at about 1:50, so everyone should be advised. \nWhen the Senator completes his statement, I will be back and propound a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I think we have had a good debate on this legislation. I \nthink Senator Burns, my colleague from Montana, is correct on our \nissues about foreign contracting and markets that need examination. You \ncan only do so much at one time, however. This addresses the most \negregious of the concentration issues. That is the outright ownership \nof livestock on the part of the packers. That is our attempt here.\n  There are some who say this bill goes too far. There are some who say \nthe bill doesn't go far enough. I appreciate that. But I think it is a \nvery solid piece of legislation. I hope it will go forward.\n  The only other observation I have is it was noted we should not be in \nthe business of telling someone whether or not they can own a pig. This \nlegislation doesn't tell anybody whether or not they can own a pig. It \ndoes place some limitations on some kinds of packing companies that \nwish to own 2 million pigs. But it does not tell anybody whether or not \nthey can own a pig. I think it is solid, bipartisan legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  I will ask, consistent with the request made by the Senator from \nNevada, the ayes and nays at the appropriate time. I believe he \nindicated at about 10 minutes until 2. I will ask at that time for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to raise a question with the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada. As I understand it, the debate is \nconcluded. My question to the Senator is, as we do not have a vote \nordered, what can we do between now and 10 minutes until 2?\n  Mr. REID. We have 10 minutes. I am sure you and Senator Harkin can \ntalk about the bill. I am sure we can do a little more talking.\n  We are going to vote on the Johnson amendment at 10 until 2.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Smith has an amendment. \nMaybe we could take up his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. We now have less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been requested by the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. They have not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will that vote begin at 10 until 2 o'clock \ntoday?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have before the Senate today the \nSenate farm bill. It is certainly my hope that a cloture vote will be \nreached at 4 o'clock so that we may wind down the debate and go to \nfinal passage. I think this is an incredible urgency that the Senate \npass the farm bill during these closing days of the first session of \nthe 107th Congress for a number of reasons.\n  One is the abject failure of the existing underlying farm bill. It \nneeds replacement.\n  Second, our farmers, our lenders, and our rural communities all want \nto know what the underlying rules are going to be in this coming crop-\nyear.\n  Third, there is concern about whether there will be an erosion of the \nbudget baseline currently afforded for agriculture.\n  I applaud my colleague, Senator Harkin, for his extraordinary \nleadership on this farm bill. It was taken up during the tumultuous \ntimes of the 107th Congress when we had a change of power midyear from \none party to the other--a change of all the chairmen and a change of \nleadership. Under those circumstances, Senator Harkin took up this \nissue. I think he has put together an excellent bill. I think there is \na need to go forward.\n  The bill contains several provisions that are of particular \nimportance to me. One is that unlike the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, and the bill on the other side, this legislation \ncontains a bioenergy title. I think that is essential.\n  As a member of the Energy Committee, I want to do all that I can in \nthe coming year to move energy legislation which would incorporate \nincentives for greater utilization of agriculturally based renewable \nfuels. But it is also important that the farm bill, as well, contain \nefforts in that direction.\n  I am pleased that Senator Harkin's farm bill, unlike the House bill, \ncontains incentives for ethanol, for soybean-based biodiesel, and \nplaces agriculture at the center of our energy debate that this Nation \nneeds to have.\n  Second, the bill contains my legislation on country of origin \nlabeling of meat, as well as fruit and vegetables.\n  I think for too long the American consumers have been denied the \nability to know the origins of the products they feed their families. I \nbelieve it is an outrage at a time when consumers have the opportunity \nto know the origins of most items they buy that for some reason they \nhave been denied the ability to know the origin of the meat, fruit, and \nvegetables they serve their families.\n  This is not a trade limitation. If people choose to buy foreign meat \nproducts or food products, it is certainly their prerogative. But this \nwould make those decisions a knowing decision.\n  I think this is helpful to a lot of American agricultural producers \nbecause I happen to believe a lot of Americans, if they have the \nchoice, will choose an American product. It is more of a consumer issue \nthan a producer issue because the consumers ultimately are the greatest \nin need of this additional information.\n  I applaud Senator Harkin for including the competition title in the \nfarm bill. Although that title was stricken in committee, it is my hope \nthat at least components of it will find its way back into the farm \nbill as we engage in these debates today and this week.\n  This bill provides significant benefits for producers. It is not \nperfect legislation. No legislation we ever consider on this floor is \nperfect. There are amendments that I would add. There is going to be \none coming up not long from now having to do with the targeting of farm \nprogram payments--one that I will support, with Senator Dorgan and \nothers--that I think is bipartisan; that I think will allow us to \nbetter utilize and more carefully target the benefits that flow from \nthe farm legislation.\n  But I think the biggest error of all would be for us to be allowed to \nbe bogged down to the point where we cannot reach a final conclusion of \nthis farm bill. I know there are those who want to delay this debate \ninto next year. It would be well into the springtime before we would be \nable to get back and finish this, no doubt. I think that would be a \nmistake. I think there is a real urgency.\n  I applaud Senator Harkin for his extraordinary leadership and for \nbringing this along as quickly as he has.\n  But it is certainly my hope that later on today we will be able to \nreach cloture so that an adequate number of amendments are allowed to \nbe considered, but that the bill is not, frankly, talked to death to \nthe point where we are unable to give our producers, our rural \ncommunities, our lenders, or anyone else reliable knowledge about the \nshape of next year's agricultural economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in behalf of the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, I request unanimous consent that in the event \ncloture is invoked and Senator McCain has not\n\n[[Page S13099]]\n\nbeen able to offer his amendment before that time, he be allowed to go \nahead and offer his amendment, and that it be considered germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Senator McCain wants an \nexemption from the cloture in case cloture is invoked?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. Senator McCain has requested essentially the same \nprivilege that was accorded to Senators Roberts and Cochran and to \nSenator Gordon Smith by the majority leader when he made his original \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I am going to object for \nright now. I may OK it later. But for right now, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in the moments before our rollcall vote, \nlet me respond briefly to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota.\n  I observed during the past 48 hours that Senators have had an \nopportunity to offer amendments to the farm bill. I believe all \nwitnesses to the debate would understand it has been spirited and \nvigorous. As a matter of fact, all of the amendments offered have been \nvery relevant to agriculture. There were obviously many more amendments \nthat Senators wished to offer that would be relevant to agriculture. We \nhave compiled a list of 44 such amendments.\n\n  In relation to the colloquy I just enjoyed with the distinguished \nchairman, two of those amendments--one to be offered by Senators \nCochran and Roberts, and one to be offered by Senator Gordon Smith--\nhave been deemed germane by the majority leader's unanimous consent \nrequest, even if cloture is invoked. Those Senators have asked for this \nprivilege simply because cloture would mean the possibility that very \nrelevant amendments would be deemed nongermane.\n  The problem for many Senators is that the agriculture bill has gone \nthrough several rewritings, including the bill offered by the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Harkin, but then supplanted by a \ncomplete substitute offered by the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, with over 1,000 pages. Many Senators have found this \nsituation difficult, although they are researching precisely where \ntheir amendments are, in a parliamentary situation, in order. In any \nevent, they would like to have the opportunity to offer them.\n  Very clearly, the invoking of cloture today would limit those \nSenators' ability to offer the pertinent amendments and, in some cases, \ncompletely eliminate it. Therefore, knowing there are many Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle who have those amendments that we believe would \nperfect this bill, I am very hopeful that cloture will not be invoked \nwhen that time of vote comes at about 4 o'clock this afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 1:50 having arrived, the question \nnow is on agreeing to the Johnson amendment No. 2534. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry), would each vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici), is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand now under a previous \nunanimous consent agreement we will proceed to a Smith of New Hampshire \namendment, then a Wyden-Brownback amendment, a Wellstone amendment, and \na McCain amendment that have all been agreed to in that order; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I inquire if we can get time agreements so we can move \nthis along. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire and whoever else is \ninterested in the amendment if he would be interested in entering into \na time agreement.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, \nthere are at least four Senators who wish to speak in favor of the \namendment. I can list them if the Senator would like. That is my only \nconcern with a time agreement. I am only going to need 3, 4 minutes \nmaximum, but I cannot speak for other Senators as to how long they \nwould want to speak. Maybe we will know in a few minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator from Iowa yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Forty-five minutes may be reasonable.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope we can enter into some time agreement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I and Senator Brownback will be next with an amendment on \ncarbon sequestration. I want the chairman to know I will be very brief \nand I will yield my time to Senator Brownback.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to Senator Brownback for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be happy to enter into a time agreement on the \ncarbon sequestration amendment. It can be a short time period. I do not \nthink it is a particularly controversial amendment. We will be happy to \nenter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator have any idea about how long?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The comments I want to make will take about 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the chairman will yield, I will take 5 minutes and \nyield my time to Senator Brownback.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We can probably do it in 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we can get agreement on 15 minutes on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for a request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I yield for a question or a request without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Iowa probably knows, in the last 2 days \nI have been in the queue for an amendment. Unfortunately, for a variety \nof reasons which are not worth going through now, I am still in the \nqueue. I am afraid it might not be completed by 4.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa allowed under unanimous consent other \namendments whether they were germane or not. I am not sure if my \namendment is germane or not. I believe it is, but I still ask he \ninclude that amendment in case it is not able to be considered until \nafter 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If my friend from Arizona will give us a copy of the \namendment, I will be glad to take a look at it and see if it is in the \ngenre of things agreed. I will be glad to take a look.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think it makes sense to reach a time agreement on the \nSmith amendment. I intend to speak against the Smith amendment and want \nto do so for a minute or so. It seems to me we have debated this over \nthe years as a general subject. If we can reach a time agreement and \nthen let the Senate vote makes sense to me.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am amenable to that. I know Senator \nAllen, Senator Torricelli, Senator Dorgan--I do not know of anyone else \nhere right now who wishes to speak on either side of the amendment.N O \nT I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2002, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $422 per year or $211 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $5.00 per copy.

DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S13102]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, how about 40 \nminutes?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Is there a unanimous consent request now before the \nSenate?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have the floor and ask if we can get a time agreement \non this amendment. The Senator from New Hampshire has been willing to \nwork this out. I am trying to see if we can get a time agreement. I \nasked if we can have a 40-minute time agreement. I do not know if that \nis acceptable or not.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. In my estimation, there are too many Senators to be \ncommenting in 45 minutes. There are four on our side and three or four \non the other side. We may be able to accommodate that in an hour, but \n40 minutes is unlikely. I say to the Senator from Iowa, if he does \noffer a unanimous consent request, I have to ask him to include a \nsecondary amendment that Senator Smith wants to offer, as long as that \nis in order in the time period as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we can reach a time agreement. How about 50 minutes?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is acceptable to this Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is that acceptable to this side?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It is acceptable to me, but that Senator Smith before \nthe close be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Hampshire said he wants to speak for 5 \nminutes. That will give us a time to call some Senators. We may have \none Senator who may want to speak 20 minutes himself. Give us time to \nwork on that. We cannot agree to a time right now until we talk to some \nSenators.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not know why we cannot agree to a time limit. We \nhave people in the Chamber who are interested in the amendment. We can \nreach a time agreement, and everybody will have their time. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire said he wants to take 5 minutes. He is honest and \nforthright.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The problem is, we have a number of Senators who all \nwant to be heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I do not think the question is \nwhether people want to be heard. The question is how long they want to \nbe heard on the amendment. I will oppose it, but I am perfectly willing \nto accept 45 minutes. Are there people who want to comment 20, 30 \nminutes in opposition? If so, we will have difficulty getting a time \nagreement. My hope is, given the hour and difficulty of moving this \nbill along, that we can get a time agreement on this amendment on both \nsides.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope we can get a time agreement now. I do not want to \ncut off anybody speaking on this, but the proponent of the amendment \nhimself told me he only wanted to take 5 minutes. I assume the others \nin 5, 7 minutes can have their say.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. My suggestion is, if there are four or five Democrats \nand four or five Republicans who are for it, there are people in \nopposition, at 5 minutes we have to have an hour at a minimum to \naccommodate them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How about 1 hour on the Smith amendment?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. One hour, at which point there will be secondary \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we are not going to agree to \na time limitation. There are Senators I have to contact. People may not \nlike it, but that is the way it is.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I suggest we begin the debate and, during the course, \nsee if we can work it out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is no time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2596 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Graham, Mr. Allen, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. \n     Helms, proposes an amendment numbered 2596 to amendment No. \n     2471.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for Presidential certification that the government \n   of Cuba is not involved in the support for acts of international \n  terrorism as a condition precedent to agricultural trade with Cuba)\n\n       At the end of section 335, insert the following:\n       ``(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall not take effect until the President certifies to \n     Congress that Cuba is not a state sponsor of international \n     terrorism.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senators Torricelli, Graham, Allen, Ensign, and Helms be added as \noriginal cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I don't believe I will use \nthe 5 minutes I have asked for.\n  As some have said, this issue has been debated in the past. Everyone \nis familiar with it. It is not necessary to take a lot of the Senate's \ntime. Given the fact we are trying to finish the Senate's business, I \nwill be considerate of that.\n  I simply say in a few words what the gist of this amendment is. The \nunderlying farm bill contains language that strikes the current \nstatutory restriction against private financing of food and medicine \nsales to Cuba. The administration opposes that language, I think with \ngood reason.\n  My amendment conditions--it does not substitute the language--the \nfinancing of food and medicine sales to Cuba on the President \ncertifying to Congress that Cuba is not a state sponsor of \ninternational terrorism. That is all. It conditions it; it does not \nsubstitute it. I would have liked to have substituted it. However, I \ncame in with a milder version to try to gain support in what I think \nwould be the fairer thing to do. We would condition the financing of \nfood and medicine sales to Cuba on the President certifying to Congress \nthat Cuba is not a state sponsor of international terrorism.\n  I don't know if my colleagues have been following very closely what \nis happening in Central America, but there is a lot of terrorist \nactivity in Central and South America with Cuba and other nations. Our \nPresident has declared war on terrorism. I remind my colleagues of the \nexact language that President Bush used:\n\n       Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. \n     Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. And \n     from this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor \n     or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States \n     as a hostile regime.\n  Now, surely if Cuba--and I emphasize the word ``if''--if Cuba is in \nany way harboring terrorists, supporting terrorism, participating in \nany way, helping the international terrorist community, why should we \nbe providing anything to them to help do that? If Cuba is a state \nsponsor of terrorism, the question should be: Should we allow for \nprivate financing of agricultural sales to Cuba? I don't think we \nshould be making a profit while we are supporting international \nterrorism. I don't think that is what my colleagues would want to see \nhappen.\n  We shouldn't even be trading with Cuba, in my view, if they harbor \nterrorists. That hardly goes back and supports what the President said \nwhen he said: Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists, \nand any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be \nregarded by the United States as a hostile regime.\n  If a country is harboring terrorists, the President said we will go \nafter them one way or the other. It is hardly going after them if we \ntrade with them and make a profit while doing so.\n  I think the answer is no, no we should not allow private financing of \nagricultural sales to Cuba. And no, if Cuba is a state sponsor of \nterrorism, we should not be trading with them. It is that simple. That \nis the amendment before the Senate. I don't consider this amendment to \nbe a referendum on U.S. policy toward Cuba. I don't even consider this \nto be an amendment on a referendum on trade policy. I simply say\n\n[[Page S13103]]\n\nthis amendment is a referendum on nations that support and sponsor \ninternational terrorism.\n  I remind my colleagues that the State Department lists the following \nseven States, as of 1999, as state sponsors of terrorism: Iran, Iraq, \nSyria, Libya, North Korea, Cuba, and the Sudan. Cuba is with pretty \nheavy company. Let me repeat the countries in their company out of all \nthe nations in the world: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea, and \nSudan join with Cuba as seven states listed as state sponsors of \nterrorism.\n  My amendment does not say they cannot trade; it doesn't say you can. \nIt says let the President certify it, and we will be fine.\n  I rest my case and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the most extraordinary thing about \nthis debate is we are having it at all. The President of the United \nStates has declared war on terrorism. American soldiers are fighting \nterrorist organizations, and the Senate is about to approve \nlegislation, but for this amendment, which would allow the financing of \nAmerican products in some instances from American institutions--insured \nby the American taxpayer--to governments that we have established are \nharboring terrorists. If I didn't hear it myself, I would not believe \nit. And the American people are not going to believe it.\n  Countries on this terrorist list are not broad. They are well \ndefined. It is specific: Libya, Iran, Iraq, and in this instance, in \nthis legislation for our purposes, Cuba.\n  Is it a fair designation? It is from the State Department. It was \ndesignated in the Clinton administration, and it is designated in the \nBush administration with the following language from the State \nDepartment:\n\n       A number of Basque terrorists gained sanctuary in Cuba some \n     years ago. They continue to live on the island, as do several \n     American terrorist fugitives.\n\n  I continue:\n\n       Havana has maintained ties to other state sponsors of \n     terrorism and Latin American insurgents. Colombia's two \n     largest terrorist organizations, the FARQ and the ELN, \n     maintain a permanent presence on the island.\n\n  In addition to our national policy against terrorism, we have a \nnational policy against states that are involved in bioterrorism. Cuba \nhas the greatest bioterrorist capability in the Western Hemisphere. \nCuba prohibits international inspection of its biological facilities. \nIn 1998, Secretary of Defense Cohen, a former member of this \ninstitution, wrote to the Armed Services Committee:\n\n       I remain concerned about Cuba's potential to develop and \n     produce biological agents, given its biotechnology \n     infrastructure.\n\n  The Defense Department, in 1998, in a report entitled ``Cuba's Threat \nto American National Securities,'' said:\n\n       Cuba's current scientific facilities and expertise could \n     support an offensive bioweapons program. In at least the \n     research and development stage, Cuba's biotechnology industry \n     is among the most advanced in all developing countries.\n\n  There needs to be one message from this Government. We are fighting \nterrorism, but now we are going to finance exports to countries that \nharbor terrorists. We are attempting to undermine the capability of \nnations that develop bioterrorism, but now we are going to finance \nproducts by our institutions to those very countries. It doesn't make \nsense. No one could defend this vote to their constituents. I don't \ncare if every person who lives in your State is a farmer. I don't \nbelieve there is a farmer in America who wants to make a buck by having \nthis country finance exports to Governments such as that.\n  President Bush has stated it very plainly. In this war against \nterrorism, you are for us or you are against us. Where is this \nGovernment now that we want to subsidize by financing exports to them? \nIn May 2001 in Tehran, Fidel Castro proclaimed:\n\n       Iran and Cuba, in cooperation with each other, can bring \n     America to its knees.\n  Mr. Castro has decided whether he is with us or he is against us.\n  The Canadian security intelligence service, which investigates \nterrorist threats, said in a 1996 report:\n\n       Cuba has been a supply source [to terrorist groups] for \n     toxin and chemical weapons.\n\n  In a 1999 book ``Biohazard,'' a former KGB colonel, Ken Alibek, \nsecond in command of the Soviet offensive biological warfare program \nuntil 1992, wrote that he was convinced the Castro government was \ndeeply involved in biological warfare research programs.\n  In each of these ways, if you do not want to take the testimony of \nthe U.S. State Department, if you do not want to follow President \nBush's command about which governments chose sides, recognize that the \nconclusions I bring to the Senate are not American alone. On Castro's \ninvolvement in terrorism, his involvement in bioterrorism, we have the \ntestimony not simply of Americans but of our Canadian allies, and even \nour former Soviet adversaries.\n  I do not rest my case on the support of terrorism by Castro alone or \nhis biochemical warfare. There is another aspect to the amendment that \nSenator Smith and I offer with Senator Nelson and Senator Graham, \nSenator Allen, and others of our colleagues, and that is the question \nof harboring fugitives from justice in the United States. Under our \namendment, if Fidel Castro wants to get the advantage of the financing \nof American agricultural exports, he can get that financing. He has to \nget himself off the terrorism list by stopping harboring terrorists. He \nhas to allow the inspection of his biochemical warfare facilities. If \nhe does those things, he can get our exports financed by institutions \nsupported by this Government.\n  But he has to do one more thing under the secondary amendment we are \ngoing to offer: Stop harboring fugitives from American justice. Cuba \ncurrently is giving safe haven to 77 American citizens who have been \nindicted or convicted of committing felonies against the United States. \nThese include fugitives who have been convicted of murder, kidnapping, \nand possession of explosives. They have escaped American justice \nbecause Fidel Castro allows them to live safely and freely, in most \ninstances, in Cuba.\n  Most on this list--60 of the 77--were convicted of what is a \nterrorist act now in the minds of most Americans: Hijacking an \nairplane.\n  Is there a Member of this Senate who will explain to citizens of \ntheir State that we are about to change a bipartisan American foreign \npolicy restricting the financing of exports to Cuba and will not accept \na condition that first the people who have engaged in the terrorist act \nof hijacking an airplane--that those fugitives not be returned to the \nUnited States? If ever I have heard an explanation difficult to give to \nthe American people, particularly since the events of September 11, \nthis would rank as the most difficult. This may be hard for people in \nmost States, but in my State it would be impossible.\n  In 1973, Joanne Chesimard was riding on the New Jersey turnpike, the \n``thruway'' to most, along with some accomplices. She was stopped and \nopened fire on the officers involved. A New Jersey State trooper, \nWerner Foerster, was murdered. She was convicted. She was sent to jail \nfor having taken his own weapon and shooting him twice in the head, \nkilling him instantly.\n  In spite of the fact she was given life in jail, she escaped, in \n1979, from the Reformatory for Women in Clinton, NJ. She fled to Cuba \nwhere, since 1984, she has been granted asylum and has lived for 17 \nyears.\n\n  Castro gives asylum to the murderer of a State trooper, a woman who \ncommitted terrorist acts against the United States. This is the \nGovernment whose exports we would now finance from institutions \nsupported by the American taxpayer. Fidel Castro knows how to end the \nprohibition on the financing of exports.\n  Members of the Senate will hear we are using food and medicine as a \nweapon against the poor people of Cuba. It is not so. It has not been \nso for nearly 10 years. I know. Legislation that I sponsored in the \nHouse of Representatives, the Cuban Democracy Act, lifted prohibition \non the sale of American agricultural products and medicine 10 years \nago. Fidel Castro can buy anything he wants to buy, any food, any \nmedicine. But he has to pay for it. That is the law. And that is the \nissue because under the provisions of this bill, now we are not \nallowing him just to buy, but we are going to finance the sale.\n  Fidel Castro knows how to end that prohibition: Get terrorists out of \nyour\n\n[[Page S13104]]\n\ncountry, open up for biological weapons inspection, and send these 77 \nfugitives from justice back to the United States.\n  Yet I know because I have been through this debate before, we will be \ntold we are using food as a weapon. No, we are using the leverage of \nfinance as a weapon for justice--for justice. Yet in moments you will \nhear, in a false argument to the American farmer, that if only we could \nend this embargo, if only we could finance these exports, the problems \nof American agriculture would be ended.\n  Let's address that part of the argument. Let's assume we did not care \nabout using this leverage to stop terrorism. Let's assume we did not \nwant to use it for biological warfare leverage. Let's assume we didn't \ncare about the 77 fugitives. Let's just take the argument on its merits \nwith all that aside. Is it a fair argument to make to the American \nfarmer that somehow, 90 miles off our shores, there is a market? We \nshould compromise our principles because there is a market that will \nease the financial burden of the American farmer?\n  As this chart indicates, looking at markets around the world, there \nis a reason, in these 10 years, Fidel Castro has not bought American \nagricultural products in spite of the fact we changed the law to allow \nhim to do so. It is the oldest reason in the world: He doesn't have any \nmoney. The purchasing power, by comparison, of a Cuban consumer is \n$1,700--below Honduras and Egypt. The per capita income of a Cuban is \n$500. There is no money. It provides no opportunity to the American \nfarmer. That is why Castro has not taken advantage of our lifting of \nthe prohibition of the sale of American products.\n  Then they will argue maybe the consumer doesn't have any money in \nCuba but we will sell to the Cuban Government. Oh, if it were so. Fidel \nCastro currently owes $11 billion to international financial \ninstitutions, among the highest per capita debt ever recorded by any \nnation in history. He owes another $20 billion to the former Soviet \nUnion and other socialist countries. They all stand in line before any \nAmerican financial institution would ever receive the first dollar.\n  He owes more money for recent purchases. South Africa extended him \n$13 million in credit for diesel engines in 1997. It has never been \npaid. There was $20 million loaned for fish imports from Chile. It has \nnever been paid.\n  This gives you an indication of Cuba's outstanding foreign debt: $6 \nbillion to governments; $2.7 billion to banks; and, $1.7 billion to \nprivate companies--all in arrears.\n\n  I ask the authors of the farm bill exactly which American financial \ninstitution would like to ask their depositors--no less the regulatory \ninstitutions of the U.S. Government that insure--would you like a piece \nof this debt? Who would like to get in this line behind all of these \nother people?\n  The simple truth is Fidel Castro cannot borrow from international \ninstitutions. He cannot borrow from other governments. He is certainly \nnot in a position to borrow from American financial institutions. Since \nwe insure those institutions, even putting aside the policy reasons I \nhave argued, we shouldn't allow it.\n  Finally, what will at this point be a crumbling argument, some of my \ncolleagues may argue: Well, maybe he doesn't have money, maybe he \ndoesn't have credit, but he can certainly bargain with our banks with \nCuba's cane sugar.\n  What sugar? Cuba is now producing less sugar than it produced in \n1959. Every year's crop is less. He has already tried to barter for oil \nand manufactured products. He has been unable to deliver the sugar to \nmeet the contracted price. There is no sugar.\n  I end on this note: I think the case is compelling as far as the war \non terrorism. I think the President has challenged this Congress as he \nhas challenged every other government: You are with us or against us. \nCastro chose sides. He chose sides. It would be indefensible in the \nmidst of this policy and this war on terrorism while he remains on that \nterrorist list to now finance these exports. But yet I know because we \nare a good and a generous people that some of my colleagues will be \ninclined to say maybe his government did these things. Maybe he can't \nfinance the exports. Maybe it is a hollow promise to American farmers. \nMaybe it isn't responsible as part of the war on terrorism. But let us \njust show who we are. Let us do it anyway. Let us go the extra mile.\n  We have gone the extra mile. Since 1992, the United States has \napproved $3 billion worth of food and medicine and humanitarian aid to \nCuba. Today, we send more food and medicine to Cuba free--free--despite \nour relationship with their government which is more adversarial than \nany relationship between any other two countries on Earth. We are a \ngenerous people. We are helping the Cuban people. We have kept them \nalive with massive aid efforts.\n  I rest my case. This makes no sense, and it is wrong. Senator Smith \nhas offered an amendment that will remove provisions from this bill of \nallowing agricultural finance unless and until Fidel Castro gets \nhimself removed from the terrorist list.\n  I have an amendment at the desk that will expand this to provide that \nunless and until he returns fugitives from justice to the United \nStates, he also will not be allowed to get the advantage of financing \nof American exports.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2597 to Amendment No. 2596\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2597 to amendment No. 2596.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for Presidential certification that all convicted \n felons who are living as fugitives in Cuba have been returned to the \n United States prior to the amendments relating to agricultural trade \n                     with Cuba becoming effective)\n\n       At the end, strike ``.'' and insert ``and until the \n     President certifies to Congress that all convicted felons \n     wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation who are \n     currently living as fugitives in Cuba have been returned to \n     the United States for incarceration.''.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I offer the amendment as a secondary \namendment to Senator Smith's amendment. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I will continue to hold the amendment. \nI assure Members of the Senate that unless and until I am assured that \nfugitives who have killed people in my State are returned as a \ncondition of this bill that this bill will not proceed. I will continue \nto hold the floor.\n  At this point, since I am not allowed to offer this amendment and it \nis not agreed to, I will continue on this floor if I have to read a \nphone book on this floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to substantiate the \nseriousness of the 77 people who are fugitives from justice now living \nin Cuba and the crimes they have committed.\n  The Senator from New Jersey told us about a crime that was committed \nin his State. A highway patrol trooper was shot in the face twice by \nsomeone who was subsequently convicted, imprisoned, and escaped from \nprison, and is now a fugitive from justice being harbored by the \nGovernment of Cuba.\n  If you look at the crimes that have been committed by these 77 \nfugitives, they include air piracy, hijacking an aircraft, crime aboard \nan aircraft, crime of escape, aiding and abetting, crime of kidnapping, \nand the crime of solicitation to commit murder.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for yielding for me to underscore \nthe gravity and the seriousness of these fugitives.\n  I also think it is quite symbolic that on this day so many of us in \nthis Nation have been riveted to our television sets to see a tape of \nOsama bin Laden mocking the United States, laughing and enjoying it as \nhe is telling the stories of the World Trade Center being hit by \naircraft and the Pentagon in Washington hit by aircraft.\n  I think it is somewhat ironic that then we bring to the floor, on the \nvery same day that we have once again focused on terrorism and \nterrorist acts and our war against terrorism, an example of the U.S. \nState Department\n\n[[Page S13105]]\n\nhaving on a list published in 1999 seven states that sponsor terrorism. \nOne of those seven states is Cuba. We have a bill before us that would \nallow the export of our bounty and the amber waves of grain and other \nproducts that come from the beneficent bounty of this Nation's \nagricultural produce internationally financed and financed by banks \nwithout Cuba being removed from the official U.S. State Department list \nas state sponsors of terrorism.\n  It is just another reminder to us that if we are going to be serious \nabout the war against terrorists--I think America is as a result of \nwhat happened on September 11--then we had better get serious that once \nwe mop up in Afghanistan, we have to start mopping up these cells in \nother places.\n  What does the U.S. State Department say is one of those states that \nsponsors terrorism?\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from New \nHampshire for bringing this to the attention of the Senate. This Senate \ncould easily adopt, in this time of a war against terrorism, these \namendments by a voice vote, and we could proceed with what is otherwise \na very fine farm bill, a bill that is for the benefit of this Nation.\n\n  I want to lend my voice to the Senator from New Jersey and the \nSenator from New Hampshire to tell them that I believe that these \namendments ought to be adopted.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it is my understanding now that the \nsecond-degree amendment that I have offered to Senator Smith's \namendment is now incorporated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment is pending. It is \nnot incorporated.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I would like to, if I could, continue to amplify the \nissue that my good friend and colleague from Florida has just \ndiscussed; and that is to attempt to put a human face on this issue \nwhich we are dealing with at the present time.\n  The question is, under Senator Smith's amendment, should there be a \nrequirement that Cuba reform itself so that it is no longer one of the \nseven nations in the world to be listed as a sponsor of state terrorism \nin order to get the benefit of U.S. financing of agricultural sales to \nCuba, and now the amendment that is pending from the Senator from New \nJersey, which would also require that there be a return to the United \nStates of those fugitives from justice who have found sanctuary in \nCuba?\n  Who are some of these fugitives from justice? Let me just talk about \nthree of them.\n  First, Victor Manuel Gerena. Mr. Gerena is on the FBI's Ten Most \nWanted list. He belongs to a Puerto Rican independence group, the FLAN. \nThis group is responsible for numerous acts of terrorism, terrorism in \nthe United States of America, including a 1975 bombing in New York City \nthat killed 4 and injured 63. He is also sought in connection with the \narmed robbery of $7 million from a security company.\n  How was he able to get himself in a position to rob a security \ncompany of $7 million? He got there because the Cuban Government aided \nGerena and his group in preparing the robbery and allegedly funneled \nthem $55,000 to pay for the operation.\n  Does that sound a little eerily reminiscent of what was happening \nbefore September 11?\n  Gerena and a part of the stolen $7 million were smuggled into Cuba by \ndiplomats stationed at Cuba's Embassy in Mexico City. That is one of \nthe fugitives from justice that we believe should be returned to face \njustice as a precondition of the United States providing financing for \nagricultural sales to Cuba.\n  Let's talk about Charles Hill and Michael Finney.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call for regular order under rule XIX. \nThe Senator has yielded for more than a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I asked the Senator from New Jersey if he \nwould yield. He yielded. And I am speaking on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that it is the \ncustom of the Senate, with reference to Senators yielding in debate, to \nconstrue the rules liberally unless prior notice has been given that \nthey shall not be so construed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I wonder if the Senator from \nNew Jersey----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let me add to the Senator from Virginia, that \ngiven the notice we have now received from you, the rules will be \nstrictly construed from this point forward.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wonder if the Senator from New Jersey is familiar with \nCharles Hill and Michael Finney?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I say to the Senator from Florida, I am indeed \nfamiliar with them.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Maybe you might be further illuminated, and our \ncolleagues informed, about these two people who are also part of that \nlarge pool of those who are fleeing American justice in Cuba.\n  Mr. Hill and Mr. Finney are accused of murder and airplane hijacking. \nIn 1971, the two were driving a car filled with guns and explosives \nfrom California to Louisiana in an operation for the militant Republic \nof New Afrika, a small organization that seeks a black separatist \nnation within the United States.\n  As Hill and Finney crossed into New Mexico, they were stopped by a \n28-year-old State trooper, Robert Rosenbloom. There was a standoff. Mr. \nRosenbloom was tragically shot dead.\n  Nineteen days later, the fugitives scrambled aboard a TWA plane in \nAlbuquerque and hijacked a flight which was bound for Chicago.\n  Interviewed in Havana last year by a U.S. journalist, Hill said when \nhe arrived in Cuba he ``was accepted by Fidel Castro's government as a \nsoldier of the people's revolution.''\n  Senator Torricelli, were you aware this is the kind of person but for \nthe amendment you are proposing would continue to be harbored in Cuba \nand would be sheltered from U.S. justice, and for which the family of \nRobert Rosenbloom, shot dead, would receive no sense of finality in \nterms of the loss of their loved one?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I say to the Senator from Florida, it would leave \nAmerican law enforcement with no leverage to get the return of these \nfugitives to the United States. You can imagine the pain of an American \nfamily whose loved one was murdered by one of these fugitives now \nknowing that our country's institutions are lending money to this \ngovernment, and those very institutions being, in some cases, insured \nby the U.S. Government. I think it would be extremely painful and \ndifficult to explain.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  We have been talking about individual terrorists who are being \nsheltered in Cuba. But beyond individual terrorists, there are \norganizations of terrorists. There are cartels of terrorists which are \nbeing sheltered in Cuba.\n  I wonder if the Senator from New Jersey is aware of the fact that \nafter a long history of Cuba providing direct support, including direct \nmilitary support for terrorists and other revolutionaries in the \nWestern Hemisphere, now Cuba is becoming the center of the hemispheric \norganizations for terrorists.\n  Was the Senator from New Jersey aware of that latest contribution of \nFidel Castro to the terrorization of the world?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Indeed, I was not, I say to Senator Graham, but I am \nappreciative of the fact that the Senator is bringing it to the \nattention of our colleagues, if they are, indeed, serious about their \nintentions of now financing exports to this government.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to the Senator, I am sorry to have to report that \nnot at some distant point in the past, and not under the administration \nof a member of our party, but under the current administration, as \nrecently as April of this year, 2001, the State Department, in its \nreport ``Patterns of Global Terrorism'' has this to say about Cuba and\n\n[[Page S13106]]\n\nterrorism: That Cuba maintains ties with other state sponsors of \nterrorism. As an example, the two most notorious Colombian insurgent \ngroups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, typically referred \nto as the FARC, and the National Liberation Army, the ELN, maintain a \npermanent presence in Cuba.\n  However, Havana is not limited to just providing a shelter for \nColombian groups. We found, within the last 18 months, that the Irish \nRepublican Army has its western hemispheric branch located in Havana. \nWe found that from branch relationships that were being developed, \nparticularly with the FARC in Colombia, through which it was alleged \nthat the IRA would receive funding for its terrorist activities through \nthe large drug resources of the FARC, and the FARC would get the IRA's \nexpertise in urban guerrilla terrorism tactics so that they could move \nfrom the hinterlands of Colombia into the major cities of Colombia with \ntheir acts of terrorism and civil disorder.\n  Was the Senator from New Jersey aware that this is one of the current \nphases of Fidel Castro's support for terrorism?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am. Indeed, it is because of not only allowing them \nto operate but a permanent presence for these terrorist organizations \nin Havana that the State Department, under both the Clinton \nadministration and now the Bush administration, has cited Fidel \nCastro's government as being complicit with terrorism on what remains a \nvery small list of rogue nations. This is not conduct where terrorists \nsimply pass through the country. It requires a continuous, outrageous \nnational policy of actually harboring these organizations that the \nSenator cited.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To go even further, that Cuba, under this same report of \nthe State Department in April of 2001, regularly conducts political, \nsocial, and economic interactions with other countries listed on the \nState Department list of terrorists, such as Libya, Iran, Iraq, and \nthrough these relationships, Cuba has access to those countries' \nillegal supplies of weapons and biotech products, what is the reaction \nof the Senator from New Jersey to this current grip of terrorism that \nFidel Castro has placed on his country and is exporting around the \nworld?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. As I have noted previously, it is important for our \ncolleagues to know that the fact that Fidel Castro is involved in \nbioterrorism and has these facilities that he refuses to allow \ninternational inspectors to visit is cited not only by the U.S. \nGovernment but cited by the Canadian Government as a source of concern. \nWe have information from former Soviet officials that, indeed, they \nwere aware of it and concerned of it themselves.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And well they should be. The U.S. Office of Technical \nAssessment has included Cuba among the 17 countries in the world which \nare believed to possess biological weapons.\n\n  As I believe the Senator said a few moments ago in his statement, the \nformer deputy director of the Soviet Union's biological weapons \nprogram, Mr. Ken Alibek, revealed that the Soviet Union had been \nproviding assistance to Castro and that Cuba now has one of the most \nsophisticated genetic engineering labs in the entire world. Was the \nSenator from New Jersey aware of that history of preparation for \nviolence through terrorism?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am. I hope our colleagues understand this. When we \ntalk about Fidel Castro's dictatorship today, this isn't some old, \nunsettled grudge. This is a continuing security problem. Ninety miles \noff our shore we have now established there are fugitives from American \njustice, including people who have hijacked airplanes and committed \nmurder. There are now established bases for terrorist organizations on \nan ongoing basis, and an international concern for bioterrorism--not 40 \nyears ago, not 30 years ago, right now, while the United States is \nengaged in a war against terrorism.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Sad to say, we have out of the mouth of Fidel Castro and \nhis minions the most current statement of his attitude toward terrorism \nand his attitude toward the United States, the Nation which now is \nbeing asked to provide U.S. financing for agricultural sales to Cuba.\n  Would the Senator be surprised that when the tragedy of September 11 \nwas made known to Fidel Castro, while he initially offered some words \nof support to the United States, he also urged United States \npolicymakers to be calm and stated that the attacks against the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon and the failed attack that ended up in \nthe fields of western Pennsylvania were a consequence of the United \nStates having applied ``terrorist methods'' for years? He is \nessentially saying that the United States and Osama bin Laden are \nmirror images of one another. Those were the statements on the day of \nthe attack.\n  Subsequent statements relative to the attack of September 11 have \nbecome even more hostile. A recent press report quoted Cuba's mission \nto the United Nations as describing the United States' response to the \nattacks as ``fascist and terrorist,'' so we not only are Osama bin \nLaden, we have now become Adolf Hitler, and that the United States was \nusing the attack as an excuse to establish ``unrestricted tyranny over \nall people on Earth.'' Castro himself has said that the U.S. Government \nis run by extremists and hawks whose response to the attack could \nresult in ``the killing of innocent people.'' Would the Senator believe \nthat?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Let me respond to Senator Graham, if I could. I hope \nevery Senator thinks about the incongruity of this situation. Fidel \nCastro is blaming the attacks of September 11 on the policies of the \nUnited States.\n  He is now stating his opposition to our military campaign abroad, and \nwe are about to engage in finance of our products to his country and \nhis government. Imagine explaining that to the parents of an American \nsoldier now in Afghanistan or coming to New York, New Jersey, or \nVirginia or explaining that to the widow of a victim of the September \n11 attacks. Talk about choosing whether you are for us or against us, \nand then trying to explain away what happened to our country.\n  I am happy to yield for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it wasn't clear to me who had the floor. I \nbelieve the Senator from New Jersey has the floor, and the Senator from \nFlorida is sort of asking questions. In terms of time here, I am \nwondering if we could get some notion. Is the Senator from Florida \nintending to seek recognition on his own when he finishes these series \nof questions so we might have some sense of whether others might be \nrecognized in this debate?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from New Jersey has certainly clarified some \nquestions of uncertainty in my mind. I still have some policy comments \nI think bear on the question of whether, in the face of the actions of \nFidel Castro relative to those who have used his country as a safe \nhaven for murderers, airplane hijackers, and others, and as a \ncontinuing caldron for the support of terrorism in the western \nhemisphere throughout the world, it is in the United States' national \ninterest to be providing financing for the food that he will control \nand distribute as he wishes to his people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Jersey will yield \nfurther, I respect that, and I understand the rules of the floor. The \nSenator is making a long statement and then asking, ``are you aware of \nthat.'' He has the right to do that in the form of a question. The \nSenator from Virginia would like to speak. I would like to speak. Could \nwe get some sense of time here, how long this inquiry will go on? Does \nthe Senator intend to seek recognition on his own behalf, or the \nSenator from Virginia expect to seek recognition next so we could have \nsome sense of whether or when we could actually have a debate about \nthis policy?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. First, the Senator from New Jersey has been so lucid and \ncandid and expansive in his knowledge of these issues that he has \nresponded to most of the questions that I have, I am certain, to the \ngreat benefit, certainly, of this Senator and all of our colleagues. My \nfurther questioning will be very brief. Yes, I do have some policy \nstatements that would be inappropriate to attempt to deliver in the \ncontext of asking questions of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Perhaps if I can answer what I suspect the question \nis going to be, it was my intention that\n\n[[Page S13107]]\n\nwhen Senator Graham finished, we would yield the floor. We had settled \nthe matter of the secondary amendment. I assumed Senator Allen would be \nrecognized next and, at that point, I will have yielded the floor. \nSenator Graham will be recognized again to make a statement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is actually interesting that the Senator from New \nJersey seems to be well aware of that about which you are inquiring. \nThe Senator indicated he is well informed and, observing that, I would \nconcur. All I am interested in doing is to see if we can have a debate \nspring out and when that might occur.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I can't tell you how helpful it is to be reminded of \nthese things by the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It also appears you are intimately familiar with all of \nthat which is being delivered to you by my colleague from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is a testimonial to the wisdom and range of \nknowledge of our colleague from New Jersey. He has certainly earned all \nof those accolades, and the Senator from North Dakota has reinforced \nthat. I appreciate the Senator yielding and for his response to the \nquestions.\n  As I indicated, it is my intention, at an appropriate time, to seek \nrecognition to make a statement of policy relative to the ill wisdom of \nthe United States under these circumstances providing financing for the \nsale of agricultural products to Fidel Castro that he can then use for \nwhatever sources of intimidation and control he would put them to, as \nhe has to so many other aspects of the life of the Cuban people over \nthe last 40-plus years. So I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nyielding and for the thoughtfulness of his responses and the solid \npolicy of his amendment.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Florida for being an ally \nthrough the years on this issue and for so much leadership as all of us \nhave tried to regain the freedom of the Cuban people. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendments of my \ncolleagues, Senators Torricelli and Smith of New Hampshire. These \namendments, of which I am a cosponsor, are very good amendments. I have \nnot had the opportunity in years past to hear the argument and debates \non these issues. I consider these amendments to be very well founded. \nWhat they do is they have conditions for lifting restrictions on the \nfinancing of agricultural sales to Cuba, and two findings have to be \nmade. The first condition is that the President must certify to \nCongress that convicted felons wanted by the FBI who are currently \nliving as fugitives in Cuba have been returned to the United States for \nincarceration. I will not repeat all of the evidence in this regard \nthat was previously cited by Senator Torricelli, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, and Senator Graham of Florida, concerning the return of \ncriminals to the United States.\n  The second condition is that the President must certify to Congress \nthat Cuba is not a state sponsor of international terrorism. That is \nthe amendment of Senator Bob Smith.\n  Mr. President, I support fair and free trade and increased \nopportunities for U.S. workers and businesses, including our \nagricultural sector, to trade with other countries. However, prudence \nwould lead us to seek to finance trade with countries that are not \nterrorist states. The Secretary of State maintains a list of countries \nthat have repeatedly provided support for acts of international \nterrorism. Currently, there are seven countries on that State \nDepartment terrorism list. They are, in alphabetical order: Cuba, Iran, \nIraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. It is appropriate that Cuba \nis on that list.\n\n  Fidel Castro's regime has a long history of providing arms and \ntraining to terrorist organizations, many of which were articulated \npreviously by Senator Graham. Our State Department notes that Havana \nremains a safe haven to several international terrorists and U.S. \nfugitives as well.\n  As we have seen since September 11, terrorists operate in an \nenvironment largely dominated by legally and geographically defined \nnation states. Terrorists sometimes rely on state-provided funding, \nbases, equipment, technical advice, logistical and support services.\n  In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade \nCenter and Pentagon, President Bush, in addressing our Nation, stressed \nthat the United States, in responding to these attacks, will make no \ndistinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those \nwho harbor them. As we heard, the President characterized these \nterrorist acts as ``acts of war.''\n  An ongoing issue for our Congress and administration is how do we \nrespond to state-sponsored or state-sanctioned terrorists and \nterrorism? There is no question that we need to respond. In my view, \nthis country has dawdled along too many years not being worried about \ninternational terrorism, thinking that it would never affect us here at \nhome. We have come to recognize that we must wage warfare against \nterrorists and those who aid, support, and comfort them.\n  An important part of that warfare is to oppose the terrorist states \nwith every reasonable weapon at hand. That may be financial intercepts, \nsurveillance, enhanced scrutiny of entrants into our country, \ninfiltrating some of these terrorist organizations, greater \nintelligence here as well as abroad, military action when necessary, \nlaw enforcement abroad as well as here at home. All are components of \nour multifaceted war on terrorism.\n  Now, trade is also an important component of our current struggle \nagainst countries that are on the terrorism list.\n  Let's get into another aspect of Cuba. In February of this year, the \nState Department reported several salient facts about Cuba and life in \nCuba for the people of Cuba, who we are purportedly trying to help. I \ndo want to help the people of Cuba, but here is how we help them: \nFirst, let's recognize what they are facing.\n  Cuba's human rights record remains poor. It continues to violate \nsystematically the fundamental civil and political rights of its \ncitizens. The State Department pointed out that the citizens of Cuba--\nas if we didn't know it already--do not have the right to change their \ngovernment peacefully.\n  The Government of Cuba does not allow criticism of the revolution \nfour decades ago or its repressive, tyrannical leaders.\n  Cuba's laws against antigovernment statements and expressions of \ndisrespect of Government officials carry penalties of between 3 months \nand 1 year in prison.\n  If Fidel Castro or members of the National Assembly or the Council of \nStates are the objects of this criticism, the sentence for such \nexpressions can be extended to 3 years in prison.\n  Recently, Fidel Castro was asked by Robert McNeill:\n\n       Do you have political prisoners still in jail in Cuba?\n\n  Castro responded:\n\n       Yes, we have them. We have a few hundred political \n     prisoners. Is that a violation of human rights?\n\n  Well, I will answer Castro's rhetorical question. Yes, it is; darn \nright it is a violation of human rights. Castro's human rights \npractices are arbitrary and repressive. Hundreds of peaceful opponents \nof the Government remain imprisoned. Many thousands more are subject to \nshort-term detentions, house arrest, surveillance, arbitrary searches, \nevictions, travel restrictions, politically motivated dismissals from \nemployment, threats to them or their families, and other forms of \nharassment by the Cuban Government authorities.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat what our State Department said. Citizens \nof Cuba do not have the right to change their Government peacefully. \nLet us recall the words written 225 years ago by Thomas Jefferson in \nour Declaration of Independence:\n\n       When a long train of abuses and usurpations . . . evinces a \n     design to reduce (people) under absolute Despotism, it is \n     their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, \n     and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\n  Just as it was important for our ancestors to have the right to throw \noff the chains of the tyrannical monarchy 225 years ago, it must be the \nright of the Cuban people to free themselves of the chains of the \ntyrannical Castro regime.\n  Let us support the opportunities of the Cuban people to enjoy their\n\n[[Page S13108]]\n\nunalienable rights to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. Let us not retreat in our opposition to terrorism nor flinch \nfrom the advocacy of liberty.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support these \namendments by Senator Smith and Senator Torricelli. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my remarks seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for me to make a \nunanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is very courteous. I have been waiting some \nwhile to speak. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak \nfollowing the remarks of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think I may be the only Senator now a \nMember of this body, or maybe one or two or three, who remembers when \nEdward R. Murrow and Herbert Matthews portrayed a young man out in the \nboondocks of Cuba as being a humanitarian who was ready to come into \nCuba and save the Cuban people. That young man's name was Fidel Castro. \nNight after night, CBS repeated that fiction. Morning after morning, \nthe New York Times repeated that fiction. And finally, Fidel Castro \ncame in after Batista left.\n  The first thing he did was to take up all the guns of the people who \nwere politically opposed to him.\n  The second thing he did was jail most of them.\n  The third thing he did was to back the rest of them up against a wall \nand end their lives before a firing squad.\n  I say all this because so much fiction has been circulated about \nFidel Castro, and so much cruelty is being heaped upon the farmers of \nNorth Carolina, giving them hope that they can get financial gain from \nmaking their crops available to the people of Cuba.\n  I wish it were so, but it is not so. The Cuban Government, as has \nalready been discussed this afternoon, is not prepared to pay for \nanything. It is bankrupt.\n  As has been said here this afternoon by two or three of the \ndistinguished speakers, Cuba has been identified on the State \nDepartment's so-called State Sponsors of Terrorism List for very good \nreason. Not only has the State Department documented evidence that \nFidel Castro provides aid and comfort to the terrorists, but there is \nalso clear evidence that Castro has close ties to insurgent groups and \nother government sponsors of terrorism all around the world.\n  Fidel Castro maintains connections with guerrillas in Colombia, \nSpain's Basque separatists, the Irish Republican Army, and so on.\n  Today nearly 100 terrorists and fugitives from United States justice \nenjoy safe haven in Cuba. Most of these fugitives are airline pirates \nand airline hijackers. Among the terrorists being shielded by Castro \nare members of Puerto Rican terrorists, which includes terrorists on \nthe FBI's most wanted list. One of the fugitives was the lead bombmaker \nresponsible for several terrorist attacks, including a New York bombing \nthat killed 1 and maimed 60 others.\n  I am sure Senators recall that in 1996 it was Fidel Castro who \nordered that two unarmed civilian U.S. aircraft be shot down, and they \nwere. They were shot down over international waters. I know Senators \nhave not forgotten that it was this savage act of terrorism that united \nthe Congress of the United States and the White House in opposition to \nthe terrorist state of Havana.\n\n  The Cuban regime trades in information it collects on United States \nactivities through a deeply entrenched spy network in the United \nStates. Just after the September 11 attacks, for example, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation arrested a high ranking U.S. Defense \nIntelligence Agency official who was passing sensitive national \nsecurity information to Castro's government. There should be no doubt \nthat this traitor would have continued to funnel information to Cuba \nand, therefore, our enemies in the war against terrorism around the \nworld. The FBI acted quickly to shut down this dangerous leak, even as \nU.S. troops headed into battle as a result of the episodes on September \n11.\n  Despite all of this evidence, there are still some Senators who are \nattempting to help the terrorist state of Havana to fill its coffers \nwith U.S. dollars. If financing restrictions are lifted, it is an \nabsolute certainty that a great many additional American dollars will \ngive Castro's regime the means to enhance cooperation with our \nterrorist enemies and fuel its cruel repression of the Cuban people.\n  If we had the time, I would outline facts that are known and are part \nof the Foreign Relations Committee books. Women, doctors, and lawyers \nare having most of their income taken from them by Castro's government, \nand a lot of these women have no choice that they can see in order to \nfeed their families but to subject themselves to prostitution. This is \nthe kind of man Fidel Castro is.\n  Senators who seek United States financing for United States \nbusinesses which hope to do business with Havana do not seem to want to \ndiscuss the fact that Cuba could not be more hostile to private \nbusiness interests or more unreliable in paying its bills.\n  The Cuban Government has without compensation expropriated more \nUnited States property from United States citizens than any other \ngovernment in the world. No other government is even close to Cuba.\n  The Cuban economy is one of the most repressed economies in the world \nand features an appalling lack of workers' rights, no protection for \nprivate property rights, no provision for international arbitration of \ndisputes, and no enforcement of contracts.\n  This point needs to be underscored. The Cuban Government does not pay \nits bills. The Cuban Government has more than $12 billion in hard \ncurrency debt. Earlier this summer, France froze $175 million in short-\nterm trade cover for Cuba after the Castro government defaulted on a \nsimilar agreement in the year 2000. When the record is reviewed \nregarding this year alone, it will be clear that governments and \ncompanies from South Africa to Panama to Chile and Spain are \ncomplaining that the Cuban Government is not paying its bills. Now, how \nwould any Senator be eager for their home State businesses, including \nespecially their farmers, to assume the risk of doing business with the \nCastro regime?\n\n  I don't need to remind this Senate that our country is at war with \nterrorism. This is not the time for the Senate to make unilateral \ndiscussions and concessions to a faltering dictatorship and a known \nidentifiable terrorist state. That is the most foolish kind of \nappeasement.\n  President Bush's administration has stated its strong opposition to \nrepealing the financing restrictions on sales to Cuba: ``Because of \nCuba's continued denial of basic civil rights to its citizens as well \nas its egregious rejection of the global coalition's efforts against \nterrorism . . .''\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with President Bush in the fight \nagainst terrorism. Support the Torricelli amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for an \ninquiry, without losing the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator yields for an \ninquiry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized following the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a generous amount of debate \nabout this subject, and an interesting debate it is. However, let me \nput in a word on behalf of family farmers in our country who would say \nto you ``don't\n\n[[Page S13109]]\n\nuse food to punish people; don't use food as a weapon.''\n  That is what this issue is about. Let me stipulate to all what has \nbeen said about Cuba or Castro or terrorism. Let me stipulate to all of \nit, and then ask you the question: When you use food and medicine as a \nweapon against a country, any country, what on Earth have you \naccomplished when the day is done? What have you accomplished?\n  We have had a vote in the Senate on this subject before. Over 70 \nMembers of the Senate said we ought not use food and medicine as a \nweapon. We ought not, in the conduct of foreign policy, trying to \npunish some other country, use food and medicine. It is unseemly. It is \nwrong. It is not the moral thing to do. Over 70 Members of the Senate \nhave already voted on that.\n  Did we get it done? No, because it got hijacked in a conference with \nthe House of Representatives on two occasions. So we opened up a small \ncrevice, that some food can go to Cuba under certain conditions \nprovided there is no public financing and no US private financing. So \nyou have no public financing, no capability of getting private \nfinancing, and some food can go to Cuba if someone goes to Europe and \ngets financing, gets a license and has to wait on a ship for 2 weeks, \nand in the event of a hurricane, we send some corn to Cuba, as we \nfinally did yesterday.\n  Because 70 Members of the Senate have already expressed themselves on \nthis issue, someone listening to this debate earlier would believe \nbecause four or five people have spoken about it in passionate terms, \nthis issue is about stopping terrorism in its tracks, about punishing \nthe Castro government, punishing the government of Cuba. I have no \ntruck for Fidel Castro and his government. What I do care about is the \nability of our family farmers to be able to move food around the world \nto hungry people. That is what this is about.\n  How often do we continue to use food as a weapon? It is one thing to \nshoot yourself in the foot. It is quite another thing to take aim \nbefore you shoot. That is exactly what has happened here, time and time \nand time again. Maybe we ought to have a little clear thinking about \nwhat we are doing.\n  Restrictions on food sales to Cuba are not going to punish Fidel \nCastro. What they do is punish poor people, sick people, hungry people, \nand kids. Everyone knows it. That is why 70 percent of the Senate has \nalready voted to say this is a policy that doesn't work.\n  I was in Cuba. Many Members have been to Cuba. I was in a hospital in \nCuba, in an intensive care ward where a little boy was in a coma. He \nhad been in a bicycle accident. He was severely injured and was in a \ncoma, lying in the intensive care unit, without one piece of equipment, \nwithout one machine attached to him. Why? Because they didn't have any. \nIn that particular hospital, they told me they were out of 240 \ndifferent kinds of medicine.\n  Yet the policy advocated by those that push this amendment is we \nshould continue to use medicine as an instrument of punishment against \nFidel Castro or the Cuban Government. This is not about Fidel Castro or \nthe Cuban Government. It is about kids in hospitals. It is about kids \nwho are hungry. It is about family farmers in North Dakota who are told \ntime and time again: ``By the way, we intend to use your wheat fields \nas an instrument of foreign policy, and we are not going to pay for \nit.''\n\n  It is easy to put on a blue suit in the morning and come to the \nSenate and decide you want to use a field of wheat in Nebraska as an \ninstrument of your foreign policy and say you can't sell that wheat to \nthis country or that country. We are familiar with embargoes. We have \nhad too many. We ought never have an embargo on food. Hubert Humphrey, \nmany years ago, said: ``Sell them anything they can't shoot back.''\n  So they are going to shoot corn back at us, are they? All these \nrestrictions do is hurt kids and hungry people. Does anybody in this \nChamber want to stand up and tell me because we had a 40-year embargo \nand we have decided we will cut Cuba off from being able to purchase or \nachieve a food shipment from the United States, that Fidel Castro has \never missed a meal? Does anybody believe he has missed a meal? If so, \nwhich one? Breakfast? What day? Dinner? Lunch? I don't think so. We \nknow better than that. Those who govern in Cuba have never missed a \nmeal because we decided to use food as a weapon. It is the hungry, the \nsick, and poor people that get hurt with embargoes. And America's \nfamily farmers get hurt with embargoes.\n  We get all the agents of change that come to the Senate on virtually \nevery issue except this: 40 years of a policy that doesn't work. We \nknow it doesn't work. The biggest excuse Castro has for the total \ncollapse of the Cuban economy is that he says the American Government \nhas its fist around the Cuban economy's neck. That is what causes these \nproblems. That, of course, is pure nonsense. But that is what he uses.\n  The quickest way to get Castro out of power is to open that country \nup, eliminate this embargo, see the investments go into Cuba. They are \ngoing in now from Europe. If we stop this embargo, Castro would have an \nawful tough time holding on to power.\n  Aside from that, there is a narrower question. Should part of the \nembargo be food shipments and medicine shipments to Cuba? The answer \nis, no.\n  Let me ask a question: Are we able to ship food to Communist China? I \nsay Communist China because China is a wonderful, big country, a big \ntrading partner of ours. I say ``wonderful'' because we have spent a \nlot of time negotiating with them. We have treaties with them. But it \nis a Communist country, isn't it? Has anybody come to the floor of the \nSenate talking about cutting off food to China, a Communist country?\n  Let me ask the question, when China was selling missile technology to \nIran, did anybody rush down to the floor of the Senate talking about \ncutting off food to China? No. No, you won't hear about that. Nobody \nwill do that.\n  How about North Korea? Is there anybody rushing to the floor to talk \nabout cutting off food to North Korea, a Communist country? Is anybody \nrushing around with their Vietnam amendment to cut off food to \nCommunist Vietnam, a country that is a wonderful country, coming out \nfrom behind the curtain with a market system, but still a Communist \ngovernment? Is anybody rushing to see if we can cut off food to a \ncountry that is run by a Communist government?\n  No, the only country in the world in which we prohibit by law private \nfinancing--not public, private financing--to ship food, the only \ncountry in which we prohibit private financing to ship food is Cuba. We \ncan do private financing and ship food to China. We can do it to North \nKorea and Vietnam. I can go down a long list of countries that are \ndepicted as terrorist countries, but nobody is on the floor saying we \nhave to stop this. We have to start using food and medicine as a weapon \nto stop this. No one is saying anything about that.\n\n  Why? This is about Cuba only. Let me stipulate again to all that \nwhich has been said before me. I don't know how much of it is true. I \nsuspect a fair amount of it is true. It is a repressive government. It \nis not a government chosen by the people of Cuba. It jails dissidents. \nBut it is interesting, if you go to Cuba and talk to the dissidents in \nCuba, they will tell you the embargo is counterproductive. A good many \ndissidents believe a good way to get rid of Fidel Castro is to get rid \nof the embargo.\n  Those who believe we ought not be able to ship food to Cuba, even \nfinanced privately, ought to explain to us why we ought to be able to \nship food to China, North Korea, Libya, and the rest of the world, \nthrough private financing. Why? Is it all right to ship food through \nprivate financing to the country of Iran? Yes, with a license. But not \nCuba. Why?\n  It is interesting to me. It seems to me we are so blinded we cannot \nthink our way out of this fog. I have spoken on the floor a number of \ntimes about the restrictions on travel to Cuba. We are not debating \nthat today, but those restrictions are absurd also, just absurd. You \ncan travel anywhere else in the world, but you can't travel to Cuba.\n  Let me tell you about a little old lady in the State of Illinois, \nretired, responding to an advertisement in a Canadian travel magazine, \na biking magazine. She decided she wanted to bike. The Canadian bicycle \nclub was sponsoring a bicycle tour of Cuba for 8 days. She signed up. \nShe is retired, living in Illinois, loves to bike, and wanted see Cuba. \nShe went to Cuba, had a wonderful bicycle trip, and came back.\n\n[[Page S13110]]\n\n  Eighteen months later, from the U.S. Treasury Department, she got a \n$9,600 fine for traveling in Cuba. So we have the Office of Financial \nAssets Control in Treasury tracking little old ladies in Illinois \nriding bicycles in Cuba while we have terrorists plotting to fly \nairplanes into the World Trade Center. Obsessive? I think so.\n  Maybe we can find our way out of this public policy mess if we just \nthink through it clearly. It seems to me we ought to decide, every one \nof us, that we should not use food or medicine as a weapon.\n  I understand the Senator from Arizona wishes consent to be \nrecognized. I ask unanimous consent he be recognized following my \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one final point. We have been stuck in \nreverse with respect to policy for decades. The Senate has spoken on \nthis issue; 70 Senators said using food and medicine as a weapon is \nabsurd. Let's change the policy. So we are going to have a vote today. \nI hope the vote today will reflect what the Senate has previously \nreflected on this issue. This is not about Fidel Castro. It is not \nabout the Cuban Government. It is about being able to ship food as we \ndo to every other country in the world with private financing: Iran, \nLibya, North Korea, China, and on and on and on. Except this absurd \nproposition that with private financing we cannot ship food to the \ncountry of Cuba. It makes no sense. Everyone in this room understands \nit and knows it and it is time to change it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of \nboth Senator Bob Smith's and Senator Torricelli's amendments regarding \nthe Cuban Government. These amendments are simple and straight-forward \nSenator Smith's amendment provides for Presidential certification that \nCuba is not involved in acts of international terrorism as a condition \nprecedent to agricultural trade with Cuba. Senator Torricelli's \namendment would provide similar certification that all convicted felons \nliving as fugitives in Cuba be returned to the United States prior to \nthe amendments relating to agricultural trade with Cuba.\n  The pattern of refuge and support that Cuba provides for fugitives \nwanted in other countries is quite troubling--many of these fugitives \nare members of outlawed terrorist groups. History is quite clear \nregarding Castro's links to international terrorist groups--these \ninclude Colombian and Salvadoran guerilla groups, the Chilean MIR and \neven the PLO. Our own State Department has presented irrefutable \nevidence that Castro has been involved in drug trafficking to provide \narms and cash to support guerilla movements.\n  Due to the closed and repressive nature of Castro's Cuba, the transit \nof international criminals and terrorists is difficult to track. I \nstrongly believe that this Nation needs to have some certification \nregarding terrorists in Cuba and the harboring of fugitives in Cuba.\n  As we advance our Nation's war on terrorism, it is interesting to \nnote Fidel Castro's speech in Tehran, Iran, recently. Castro told \nIranian students that the United States was an imperialist king that \nwould fall just as the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran fell in the 1979 \nrevolution. He said:\n\n     you destroyed the strongest gendarme of the region . . . and \n     the people of the region should thank you for that . . . \n     However this Imperialist King will finally fall, just as your \n     King was overthrown.\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to support these amendments and look forward \nto a day when democratic values reign in a free and democratic Cuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2598\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the underlying bill \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 2598.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To provide for the market name for catfish)\n\n       At the end of the underlying bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . MARKET NAME FOR CATFISH.\n\n       The term ``catfish'' shall be considered to be a common or \n     usual name (or part thereof) for any fish in keeping with \n     Food and Drug Administration procedures that follow \n     scientific standards and market practices for establishing \n     such names for the purposes of section 403 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including with respect to the \n     importation of such fish pursuant to section 801 of such Act.\n\n     SEC.   . LABELING OF FISH AS CATFISH.\n\n       Section 755 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2002, as repealed.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we will have additional time, I am sure, \nafter the cloture vote and perhaps I may even make a tabling motion, \ndepending upon the parliamentary situation on this issue. But it is \nvery simple. The amendment was an amendment slipped into the 2002 \nAgriculture appropriations bill as part of a managers' amendment.\n  I still remember very clearly, it was in the evening. We were about \nto vote final passage. I said: Wait a minute; has anybody seen the \nmanagers' amendment? There was dead silence. There were maybe 50 or 60 \nMembers here. So I said: We really should look at the managers' \npackage. Everybody grumbled, so I relented.\n  It turned out there were 35 amendments, 15 of them specific to \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee. One bans catfish, basically \nbans catfish from being imported into the United States of America, \nwithout debate, without discussion, without knowledge until the next \nday after the bill was passed.\n  Again, the remarkable degeneration of the parliamentary system that \nis taking place as we address appropriations bills is remarkable. Think \nof it: 35 amendments, no one knowing what they are. We all voted aye. \nOne of them fundamentally affected a trade agreement that had just been \ncompleted between the United States of America and Vietnam.\n  This is happening all the time. We find amendments slipped in which \naffect national policy, which affect, in the case of the North American \nFree Trade Agreement, commerce as far as Mexican trucks are concerned. \nThere was legitimate debate on both sides but--what? It was put into an \nappropriations bill. Time after time after time. This is another \ndramatic example of it.\n  It is entertaining. We will get to talk about it a lot. But this is a \nprovision, as I say, which was added without debate, discussion, or \nknowledge of the Members that basically calls catfish from this country \ncatfish and catfish from any other part of the world not catfish. \nRemarkable.\n  According to the Food and Drug Administration and the American \nFisheries Society, the Pangasius species of catfish is imported from \nVietnam and other countries as ``freshwater catfishes of Africa and \nsouthern Asia.'' Existing regulations required imported catfish to be \nlabeled differently from catfish grown domestically so consumers can \nmake informed choice about what they are eating. Yet the Agriculture \nappropriations language overturns these regulations by allowing only \nNorth American catfish growers to call their catfish ``catfish'' and \nprohibits catfish from any other country being labeled as such. \nRemarkable.\n  This was commented on by several newspapers and magazines. Also, by \nthe way, there was an advertising campaign mounted against catfish. \nAccording to the Far Eastern Economic Review, in its feature article on \nthis issue:\n\n       For a bunch of profit-starved fisherfolk, the U.S. Catfish \n     lobby had deep enough pockets to wage a highly xenophobic \n     advertising campaign against their Vietnamese competitors.\n\n  This protectionist campaign against catfish imports has global \nrepercussions. Peru has brought a case against the European Union and \nWorld Trade Organization because the Europeans have claimed exclusive \nrights to the use of the word ``sardine\" for trade purposes.\n  As a direct consequence of the passage of this restrictive catfish \nlabeling language in the Agriculture appropriations bill, USTR has \nwithdrawn its\n\n[[Page S13111]]\n\nbrief supporting the Peruvian position in the sardine case against the \nEuropean Union because the catfish provision written into United States \nlaw makes the United States guilty of the same type of protectionist \nlabeling scheme for which we have brought suit against the Europeans in \nthe WTO.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to have to stop legislating on \nappropriations bills. Sooner or later, we are going to have to stop \ngiving away to special interests, and we are going to have to have \ncampaign finance reform.\n  I would be very interested in hearing the campaign contributions made \nby this catfish lobby in past and present political campaigns.\n  We have to stop the kind of protectionism which will destroy free \ntrade on which America's economy is built and maintained. We are seeing \nexample after example and case after case of protectionism creeping in \nbut not through open and honest debate. If the supporters of this \namendment thought it was a good amendment, why couldn't we have brought \nit up and had open and honest debate and amendments? No. It was snuck \nin a managers' package, the most disgraceful practice--the most \ndisgraceful is putting it in the conference report. That is the worst. \nThe second worst is putting it in the so-called managers' package. \nUsually, it is late at night.\n  I stray from the subject a bit, but if you think we have had fun, \nwait until you see the DOD appropriations bill. Wait until next Friday \nwhen everybody is going to want to get out of town because Christmas is \ncoming and the last train is leaving. It is going to have more \nChristmas trees on it than the North Pole. It will be a remarkable \ndocument. But I intend to be here and make sure that at least the \nAmerican people know what is in it.\n  Putting an amendment that affects trade relations, trade agreements, \nand fundamental issues of free trade into a managers' package is the \nkind of conduct that causes the American people to lose confidence in \ntheir elected representatives.\n  I don't mind open and honest debate. I wouldn't mind losing an open \nand honest debate. I do mind on the part of my constituents and the \nAmerican people that this kind of amendment gets the attention it has \nreceived.\n  I know it is almost time, according to the unanimous consent \nagreement, for the cloture vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me explain very briefly to our \ncolleagues what we hope to do.\n  The Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Oregon have an amendment \nthat has been agreed to. They would like 2 minutes on a side to present \nit. Immediately following that, I will make a unanimous consent request \nthat would allow us the opportunity to consider and debate the defense \nauthorization conference report between now and 5:30. At that time, we \nwill have the cloture vote, then the Department of Defense \nauthorization conference report vote, and then a vote on a judge, all \nstacked, from 5:30 to whatever time following that.\n  Following those votes, if Senators wish to offer additional \namendments on the farm bill, they are certainly entitled to do so.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is the majority leader propounding that unanimous consent \nrequest at this time or are you going to wait until after this?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Actually, I now have the text.\n  Mr. LOTT. If you would be willing to do it now, we would get on to \nthis issue quicker.\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate, \nimmediately following the disposition of the amendment to be offered, \nturn to the consideration of the conference report to accompany S. \n1438, the Department of Defense authorization bill; that when the \nreport is considered, it be considered under the following limitations; \nthat there be 75 minutes for debate, with time controlled as follows: \n45 minutes for the chair and ranking member or their designees; and 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Byrd; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, without further intervening action, the Senate \nproceed to vote on adoption of the conference report following a vote \non the motion to invoke cloture on the Harkin substitute amendment to \nS. 1731; that upon adoption of the conference report, the Senate then \nturn to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2883, the intelligence \nauthorization; that the conference report be considered agreed to, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate; provided further that H. Con. Res. 288, a concurrent \nresolution providing for a technical correction in the enrollment of S. \n1438, be considered and agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, without any intervening action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just say that I will not object. I \nthink this is a reasonable arrangement. I want to explain, though, why \nwe are doing this. We were scheduled to have a vote at 4 o'clock on the \ncloture motion. We had at least a couple Senators who were unavoidably \ndelayed, and we would want to accommodate that under these conditions. \nThis allows us to move forward on the Defense authorization bill, which \nwe need to do, and that we would have the vote on the cloture motion \nthat was scheduled for 4 o'clock at 5:30, as I understand it, followed \nby the vote on the defense authorization conference report, followed by \na vote on a judge--stacked votes.\n  For those of you who are worried about agriculture, as I understand \nit, don't worry, because everything will be at this point when we, if \nand when, come back to it. But this is to accommodate as many Senators \nas possible while getting a vote on the very important defense \nauthorization bill and a vote on the cloture motion on the agriculture \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a good thing this is the Defense authorization \nconference report or I would object. I do not intend to permit anything \nelse to interrupt this farm bill until we finish it. It is defense. It \nis important for our country, so I will not object. I just want to put \neveryone on notice, that is it. Once we get back on the farm bill, we \nwill be on it. I will object to going off this farm bill for anything \nelse other than the defense of this country. I just want to make it \nclear.\n  Secondly, I want to ask my leader about tonight. We are going to have \nthese three votes. We have had some amendments. We have some amendments \nready to go tonight. I want to know if it is the intention to have the \nSenate stay in session tonight and to have votes, to debate amendments \nand have votes tonight to move this farm bill forward. I would just \nlike to know if that is what we are going to do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to respond to the Senator from Iowa.\n  This does not preclude additional consideration of amendments or \nvotes tonight.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So there will be votes tonight, if, again, Senators offer \namendments and we debate them? We can have votes tonight on further \namendments to the farm bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n\n[[Page S13112]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just to clarify what was said, Senator Harkin said that \nthere will be more votes tonight. That is not what Senator Daschle \nsaid. He said this does not preclude that. We have our normal rights \nfor full debate, and we have to work out agreements to when we would \nvote, ordinarily. So I am not saying there will not be votes, but I \njust do not want to leave the wrong impression.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So I guess what I read into that, if the Senator will \nyield, is that it is the Senator's intention not to have any votes \ntonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't want to make any more profound statement on this \nsubject than Senator Daschle did. I would want to consult with him. No \nfinal decision or announcement has been made on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I reserve the right to object. Because of intentional and \nunintentional parliamentary procedures, I have not been allowed to \npropose my amendment before the vote on cloture. If cloture is invoked, \nthen I may not be able to have this amendment be germane.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that that unanimous consent agreement be \namended that my amendment be made in order to the Daschle substitute, \nas several other amendments have been made in order, in the event of \nthe invocation of cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I object to the unanimous consent request. I think I \nshould be allowed to propose and have debate on an amendment to the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle for \n     Harkin substitute amendment No. 2471 for Calendar No. 237, S. \n     1731, the farm bill:\n       Tim Johnson, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Tom Carper, Zell \n     Miller, Max Baucus, Byron Dorgan, Ben Nelson, Daniel Inouye, \n     Tom Harkin, Kent Conrad, Mark Dayton, Debbie Stabenow, \n     Richard Durbin, Jim Jeffords, Tom Daschle, and Blanche \n     Lincoln.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nsubstitute amendment No. 2471 to S. 1731, a bill to strengthen the \nsafety net for agricultural producers, to enhance resource conservation \nand rural development, to provide for farm credit, agricultural \nresearch, nutrition, and related programs, to ensure consumers abundant \nfood and fiber, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think we may have reached an agreement, a \nconsensus on how to complete the agreement that would be in most \npeople's interests and accommodating most schedules; that is, if we \nvoted on the defense authorization conference report right now.\n  As I understand it, the chair of the committee, the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee, as well as the chair of the defense \nauthorizing committee and ranking member are prepared to speak about \nthe conference report for the record and share with Members its many \ncomponent parts immediately following the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the defense authorization conference \nreport be brought before the Senate and the Senate vote on its final \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object--I do not intend to object--I \nwant Senators to know I intend to vote against this conference report, \nand I will explain why because I understand the problems that confront \nthe leader and I am very willing to wait until after the vote to make \nthat statement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, is it the intention of the \nmajority leader to return to consideration of the agriculture bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Arizona is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask that, following the Wyden-Brownback amendment, the \nMcCain-Gramm amendment be considered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. For clarification, we will have the discussion about the \ndefense authorization conference report. Immediately following that, it \nwill be my intention to go back to the farm bill. I think there was \nsome understanding that we recognize the Senator from Kansas and the \nSenator from Oregon for a brief period of time for an amendment that I \nthink has been agreed to, and then it would be our intention to move to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, if I could, just for one \nclarification, if Senator Daschle would clarify, will we have the vote \non the judge that had been scheduled in this back-to-back vote?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That would be my intention, that we would.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask, in addition to the current unanimous consent \nrequest, that immediately after debate on the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, we then turn to the debate on the amendment as offered by \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire and Senator Torricelli of New Jersey.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That will be made part of the request.\n\n[[Page S13113]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to be clear as to what the Senator \nfrom Florida is asking. Senator Brownback and I intend to be very \nbrief. Is it the understanding of the Senator from Florida that we can \ndispose of that very quickly and then go back?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As I understand it, if this unanimous consent agreement \nis accepted relative to the farm bill, the Senator from Oregon would be \nfirst, the Senator from Arizona would be second, and then consideration \nof the Smith-Torricelli amendment would be third.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the defense \nauthorization conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report has not yet been put \nbefore the Senate. The yeas and nays are not in order at this point.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, prior to the time we move to the \nconference report, there is one other housekeeping matter. It is always \nin keeping with our practice that the intelligence authorization and \nthe defense authorization are considered jointly. I am told that I need \nto make the following request: That the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2883, the intelligence authorization, be considered agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate, provided that H. Con. Res. 288, the concurrent resolution \nproviding for a technical correction in the enrollment of S. 1438, be \nconsidered agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable without intervening action or debate.\n  I would just say, for the information of all my colleagues, this is \ndone as we take up the Defense authorization bill. I made this request \nearlier, and I am simply repeating it now for the colloquy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the Senate considers the \nExecutive Calendar nominations, the first vote occur on Calendar No. \n590, to be followed by Calendar No. 589 and Calendar No. 592, and that \ntheir consideration occur following this next vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13113-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER under the previous order, the clerk will report \nthe conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     1438) ``to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2002 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes,'' having met, have agreed that the Senate recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the House, and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to \n     the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nDecember 12, 2001.)\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Senate will now go into executive session \nand proceed to the nomination of Frederick J. Martone, of Arizona, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Frederick J. Martone, of \nArizona, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this nominee has the support of both \nSenators from his home State. Blue slips have been returned by both of \nthem. We have had the hearing. He did very well.\n  The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, is a valued member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and I would like to yield to him, as he is one of \nthose who has proposed and supported this nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, the \nchairman of the committee, and thank him for having Justice Fred \nMartone as one of the judicial nominees we will be voting on this \nevening. I understand the only rollcall vote will be on Justice Fred \nMartone.\n  Why do I call him Justice Fred Martone, when we are going to be \nvoting on his confirmation to become a\n\n[[Page S13114]]\n\nFederal district judge? The answer is, because he currently is one of \nthe five justices on the Arizona Supreme Court, the highest court in \nthe State of Arizona. He is a graduate of Holy Cross, Notre Dame Law \nSchool, and has an advanced degree from Harvard, and is an \nexceptionally fine jurist.\n  I thank the chairman and members of the committee who unanimously \napproved him for consideration by the full Senate. I would appreciate \nthe support of the full Senate for his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nthis afternoon three extremely well-qualified nominees for important \npositions in the Federal judiciary. I have no doubt that they will do \ngreat service for the citizens of this country upon confirmation.\n  The Honorable William Johnson has been nominated to be a Federal \njudge in the District of New Mexico. Born and raised in Roanoke, VA, \nJudge Johnson attended Virginia Military Institute and law school at \nWashington and Lee University. He began his career practicing law in \nHouston, TX, and then moved to Roswell, NM, where his practice included \ncommercial litigation, bankruptcy cases, and oil and gas litigation. \nSince 1995, he has served as a State district judge hearing domestic \nrelations, child support enforcement, civil, criminal, and \nadministrative agency cases. With such wide-ranging judicial experience \nunder his belt, Judge Johnson comes to the Federal bench ready to hit \nthe ground running.\n  Like Judge Johnson, the Honorable Frederick J. Martone is no stranger \nto the bench. Justice Martone currently serves on the Supreme Court of \nArizona. Before then, he served as a judge on the Superior Court in \nMaricopa County. Although he has spent his professional life in \nArizona, Justice Martone was educated further east: He graduated from \nHoly Cross College, from Notre Dame Law School, and earned an LL.M. \nfrom Harvard Law School. His demonstrated experience and judgment will \nmake him a fine addition to the Federal district court for the District \nof Arizona.\n  Clay D. Land, our nominee for the Middle District of Georgia, has had \nan impressive career blending private practice and public service. Upon \ngraduating cum laude from the University of Georgia law school, Mr. \nLand returned to his home town of Columbus, GA, where he has maintained \na successful general civil practice ever since. His legal practice has \nnot dampened his commitment to public service, however. In 1993, he \nserved as chairman of the Georgia Indigent Defense Council, which is \nresponsible for oversight of the funding and implementation of the \nState's indigent criminal defense programs. From 1993 to 1994, he \nserved on the Columbus City Council. And from 1995 to 2000, he served \nas a Georgia State senator.\n  I want to commend President Bush on his selection of such outstanding \ncandidates for the Federal judiciary. Each of these nominees was \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee, and I expect that they \nwill receive similar treatment from the full Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting their nominations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the nominee is supported by both the \nSenator from Utah and myself; and we had a unanimous rollcall vote in \nsupport of the nominee in the committee. And I strongly urge a \nunanimous rollcall vote in support of the nominee here.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Frederick J. Martone, of Arizona, to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of Arizona.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

JOHNSON, OF NEW MEXICO, TO BE UNITED STATES \n             DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report Calendar No. 599.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of William P. Johnson, of \nNew Mexico, to be United States District Judge for the District of New \nMexico.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader, Mr. \nDaschle, and the distinguished deputy majority leader, Mr. Reid, who \nhave worked so hard to get these nominations on the calendar so we can \nvote on them.\n  William Johnson is the third Federal judge confirmed from New Mexico \nin just the past few weeks. We expedited the consideration of Christina \nArmijo in October, who was confirmed last month; likewise, Harris \nHartz, President Bush's nominee to the Tenth Circuit from New Mexico. I \nhad a hearing at the end of October, and he was confirmed last week. \nAll three of these nominees came to us with the strong support of both \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman.\n  I mention this because it is so helpful to our committee when the \nWhite House takes time to consult with both Senators from the home \nState and get their support. We got this kind of consensus: When we \nconfirm Mr. Johnson, we are going to fill another judicial emergency \nvacancy. After that, we are going to another nominee, Clay Land, who \nhas been supported by Senators Cleland and Miller. I mention this \nbecause if we confirm both these next 2, we will have confirmed 27 \nFederal judges since July, when I took over the chairmanship, and 6 \ncourt of appeals judges.\n  To put that in perspective, since July, in those 5 months, we have \nconfirmed as many as we confirmed all of the first year of the last \nPresident's administration--actually, a lot more judges in the courts \nof appeals.\n  Everybody has been working very hard. I also mention to my \ncolleagues, this morning we were finally able to get a quorum in the \nJudiciary Committee. We had 10 nominations go through, 5 of them \njudges, 5 other nominations from the Department of Justice, all of \nwhich will go now on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. When did the Senator take over as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I had a fully constituted committee I think it was in late \nJuly.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that following September 11, the \nSenator and his staff literally worked night and day for how long \nbefore the\n\n[[Page S13115]]\n\ncommittee came up with an antiterrorism bill?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We worked several weeks. It really was night and day. We \nhad people going home at 2 o'clock in the morning and coming back at 5 \no'clock in the morning to do that. I was getting e-mails at home at \n3:30 in the morning from members of my staff and continued to do that \nuntil we got that bill out.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also answer this question: It is my \nunderstanding the committee's work was hampered as a result of the \nanthrax problem that occurred in Senator Daschle's office and in the \nSenator's office; is that true?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Nevada is right. We actually had to move \nmuch of the Judiciary staff out of the Dirksen Building. Some had been \nin the Hart Building in the proximity of the distinguished leader's \noffice when the anthrax letter was opened. We were hampered by that \nbecause of medical treatment and still came to work.\n  In fact, we went so far, as the Senator probably knows, as to hold \nhearings during the recesses to keep this going.\n  Mr. REID. I was going to ask the Senator if he remembers another time \nwhen hearings were held regarding judges and other judicial matters \nduring recess periods?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have only been on the committee 25 years, but I cannot \nremember a time during those 25 years--in fact, the Senator from Nevada \nmay be interested in this. Maybe he was involved in this. Does the \nSenator recall the day that part of the Capitol Building was evacuated \nbecause of the anthrax scare and all the other buildings were \nevacuated? The distinguished Senator from West Virginia made available \nhis conference room in the Appropriations Committee. We held hearings \nin that conference room on more judges as the building was being \nevacuated and held a markup in executive session with 150 of us crowded \ninto one room in the back, the President's Room, to get even more \njudges out which then the distinguished majority leader put on the \ncalendar within, I think, 24 hours of that time and we were voting on \nthem a couple days after that.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader is in the Chamber, and I will not \nengage the Senator in any more dialog. Speaking for the people of \nNevada and I think this country, when books are written over what \ntranspired in this critical period of history, there is going to be a \nchapter on Pat Leahy and the tremendous job he did. It is precedent \nsetting, and he has set a mark to which others will have to try to \nadhere.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That means a great deal to me, and I appreciate that. I \nappreciate the help of Senators on both sides of the aisle in helping \nto move this forward.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I also commend the distinguished chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee along the lines the assistant Democratic leader has noted. It \nis important at a time such as this that we recall for the record just \nwhat has transpired. The distinguished chairperson has been chairperson \nnow for about 5 months, almost 6 months, and in one-half year's time, \nhe has compiled a record that may at the end of this period actually \nexceed the number of judiciary appointments confirmed during the \nClinton administration in an entire 12-month period of time in 1993. \nThat is quite a remarkable accomplishment to exceed perhaps the number \nof judicial nominations in 6 months over and above what was confirmed \nin 1993 under a Democratic administration with, I might add, a \nDemocratic Senate.\n\n  Also, as the Senator from Nevada has noted, this has been an \nextraordinarily difficult time, filled with adversity. September 11, \nthe anthrax attack, not only on the Senate and my office, but on the \nSenator's office itself--all of the disruption, the need for \naccelerated efforts on appropriations, and yet through all of that, \nwith all of the work he had to do with counterterrorism, this Senator \nhas very diligently, persistently, and with remarkable leadership \nbrought us to this point.\n  I publicly commend him, thank him, and tell him how proud I am for \nhis effort and the work he has done to get us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I will.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to add to some of the statements that \nwere made, I compliment my friend. He has assisted this Senator, and he \nhas assisted other Senators, particularly on district court judges.\n  If my numbers are correct, I believe we are now at 27 judges \nconfirmed, which equals the number of judges that were confirmed in \nPresident Clinton's first year. President Clinton, nominated 47 \nindividuals for judicial positions, and the Senate confirmed 27 of \nthose in his first year.\n  President Bush has made 64 judicial nominations at a time when there \nare a great number of vacancies. We have now confirmed 27, and I hope \nwe will confirm some more.\n  I say to my friend and colleague from Vermont, we have done pretty \nwell on district court judges. However, we are way behind on circuit \njudges. President Bush nominated eleven circuit court judges in May. Of \nthose eleven, eight have not even had a hearing. One of these nominees \nis Miguel Estrada, who is a Honduras immigrant who graduated with \nhonors from Columbia and graduated at the top of his law school class \nfrom Harvard.\n  Another is John Roberts, again a Harvard Law School grad. Among his \nmany accomplishments, Mr. Roberts has argued 34 cases before the \nSupreme Court. I might also mention that Mr. Estrada has argued 14 \ncases before the Supreme Court. Both nominees are eminently qualified.\n  I wonder if my friend and colleague from Vermont can tell us when we \nwill begin considering or having hearings on some of these \nexceptionally qualified individuals, both rated unanimously well \nqualified by the ABA and who have bipartisan support, who were \nnominated in May of this year?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma, my friend, has \ntalked to me about this on several occasions. We are trying to get \nthrough these calendars as quickly as we can. As I say, I have only \nbeen here as chairman for 5 months. Actually, there were a number of \nnominees prior to my becoming chairman who never got a hearing at the \nbeginning of this year.\n\n  We will have had far more courts of appeals judges than I think have \never been, or I can remember going through in a President's first year \nin office. We are going way beyond what the Senate usually does. It is \ncertainly a much faster pace than the Senate has had in the last 4, 5, \n6 years.\n  If we can slow down a little bit the things that are happening around \nhere--anthrax, September 11, all the things we wish we did not have--if \nthe chairman of the committee could deal with just a few less death \nthreats--not from my friend from Oklahoma. The anthrax letter did not \nhave an Oklahoma return address, nor would I expect it to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are moving through them. We have done Fifth Circuit \nJudge Clement, Second Circuit Judge Parker, Fourth Circuit Judge \nGregory. I mentioned from New Mexico a circuit judge.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, we have confirmed six circuit \ncourt judges, but in this particular instance, the President has made \nmany more circuit court nominees during his first year in office than \nany recent time in history. In fact, 28 have been nominated. I urge my \ncolleague--and I will stop here--to have more hearings, especially for \nsome of these individuals nominated in May. They are outstanding \nindividuals.\n  I am more than certain that once they have their hearings, they will \nbe confirmed by an overwhelming majority, both in the committee and on \nthe floor of the Senate. I urge the chairman to have hearings on those \nindividuals as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Oklahoma asks an appropriate question. I \ncan assure him we are trying to move through as many as we can. I hope, \nfor example, the President will nominate more district judges, too. \nThere are about 77 percent district court vacancies; about 77 percent \ndo not even have a nominee. There is a real problem and we will work \nwith the administration.\n\n[[Page S13116]]\n\n  Some of the slowdowns have been taken care of, as the Senator from \nOklahoma knows. We had a number of judges who were held up because the \nWhite House did not directly answer the question whether they had been \narrested or convicted in the last 10 years. We thought that was at \nleast a worthwhile thing to know for someone getting a lifetime \nappointment. I think the White House might have realized it made sense \nand allowed them to answer the question, and it broke a logjam. We had \n10 nominations, 5 judges, that went through this morning. My intention \nis to keep moving as rapidly as we can.\n  I ask the distinguished acting Republican leader, we could have \nrollcalls on the next two judges, or if he has no objection, I would \nask we do them by voice vote. If he would like rollcalls, that is his \nright.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Senators want to get to the Defense authorization bill. \nThere is no reason we cannot. I am sure it is not necessary to have a \nrecorded vote. A voice vote is more than acceptable for the other two \njudges. I thank my friend and colleague and look forward to having a \nhearing on Mr. Estrada. Forty-nine Senators have requested a hearing on \nMr. Estrada and on Mr. Roberts and other nominees for the circuit \ncourt. As soon as we get hearings, it would be much appreciated.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since the topic of the Judiciary \nCommittee's record on judicial confirmations was raised, I would like \nto take just a minute to make an observation.\n  As everyone here knows, I do not like to engage in the typical \nstatistics judo that seems to be intrinsic to this issue. But I do want \neveryone to understand that, despite the progress that was just \nmentioned, we really have a lot more work to do.\n  Look at the percentages: The Senate has exercised its advice and \nconsent duty on only 21 percent of President Bush's circuit nominees \nthis year. The other 79 percent of our work remains unfinished. And our \noverall record is not much better: the Senate has confirmed only 37.5 \npercent of all judicial nominations we received from President Bush. We \nwill conclude our work by leaving nearly 100 vacancies in the judicial \nbranch.\n  Now, these facts are not escaping wider attention outside the \nJudiciary Committee. Last week, Vice President Cheney sent a letter \nnoting that ``vacancies on the Federal bench are occurring at a faster \npace than the confirmations of new judges, and barely one in four of \nPresident Bush's nominees has received a hearing and a vote.'' The \nWashington Post editorialized on November 30 that the committee should \nhold more judicial nominations hearings, concluding that, ``[f]ailing \nto hold them in a timely fashion damages the judiciary, disrespects the \nPresident's power to name judges and is grossly unfair to often well-\nqualified nominees.'' And the Wall Street Journal observed on November \n27 that there is a ``pattern of judicial obstruction that has left 108 \ncurrent vacancies on the Federal bench. . . . With only days to go \nbefore the Senate adjourns for the year, only 28 percent of George W. \nBush's nominees have been confirmed.''\n  Of course, the reason why people are taking notice is that the \nprocess of advice and consent on the President's judicial nominations \nis not a game. This is not football or baseball, and the goal here is \nnot a particular set of numbers. These are nominations for very \nimportant positions in the Federal Government, and it is the Senate's \nconstitutional obligation to review them. Despite the work that we have \ndone, there is simply no escaping the fact that we are about to stop \nwork for the year with a judicial vacancy rate of 11.3 percent, which I \nbelieve is unacceptable by any measure. And, by the way, there is \nabsolutely no point in accusing the administration of not sending more \nnominations to us, when we have made it clear that we will not devote \nany effort at all to reviewing 30 of the nominations the President did \nsend.\n  All this being said, however, I have reason to look forward to \nhitting the ground running next year. The Judiciary Committee's obvious \nfocus on confirming nearly the same number of judges as we did \nPresident Clinton's first year, reassures me. After all, during \nPresident Clinton's second year in office, the Senate confirmed 100 of \nhis judicial nominees. I fully expect that we will do the same for \nPresident George W. Bush, in fact, I take it as a pledge that we will \nconfirm 100 Bush nominees in 2002.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not request a rollcall vote. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The question is, Will the \nSenate advise and consent to the nomination of William P. Johnson to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of New Mexico?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13116-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF CLAY D.

The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S13117]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 2546 to amendment \n     No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief. I express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia.\n  One of the most serious environmental problems in our country and in \nthe world is the excessive emissions of carbons into the atmosphere. \nSenator Brownback and I have worked for a number of years together on a \nbipartisan basis because we believe it is time for the U.S. Congress to \nbegin moving together on a bipartisan basis to deal with this serious \nenvironmental problem. Therefore, the amendment we worked out with \nSenator Harkin and Senator Lugar sets up what is known as a carbon \nsequestration program, a program that allows us to store these carbons \nin trees, in agricultural products, and in the land.\n  Our legislation specifically does two things: It allows the research \ndollars in the legislation to be used by State forestry programs for \ncarbon sequestration. This allows mobilization of various State \nforestry programs such as we have in Oregon and other States in this \ncountry to seriously attack this carbon problem.\n  Second, our legislation sets up a carbon sequestration demonstration \neffort which allows private parties to pay farmers and foresters a \nmarket-based fee to store carbon and to otherwise reduce net emissions \nof greenhouse gasses. It would be the first effort to set up a \nmarketplace-oriented system of reducing these carbons.\n  We are not saying tonight, Senator Brownback and I, that carbon \nsequestration is the be-all and end-all of dealing with the climate \nchange problem. But it can be a significant tool in our toolbox to \nreduce global warming. I happen to think that carbon sequestration can \nbe a very significant jackhammer for those who are fighting the climate \nchange issue.\n  I conclude by thanking Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar. This is a \nchance to bring Americans together--businesses, environmental leaders. \nIt will not cost jobs, it will save money. Look at the costs. It takes \nbetween $2 and $20 per ton to store carbon in trees and soil. Emissions \nreductions can cost as much as $100 per ton. That is why Senator \nBrownback and I have worked for several years. I believe this \nlegislation can reduce a third of the problems we are having with \nexcessive emissions in our country.\n  With that, and with thanks to Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar, I ask \nthat the amendment be agreed to on a voice vote at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I join with Senator Wyden to \nbring an amendment to the floor on the farm bill which will establish a \npilot program for farmer owned cooperatives to measure, verify and \ntrade sequestered soil carbon through agriculture conservation \npractices. This amendment will authorize $5 million over 5 years to \nestablish a program that will allow our nation's farmers to implement \nthe promise offered by carbon sequestration--a process where crops and \ntrees convert carbon dioxide into stored carbon in the soil. At the \nsame time, this project will provide the Congress with important \ninformation about how effective soil carbon sequestration will be in \naddressing the issue of climate change.\n  As we set farm policy for the next five years, there are several \nimportant areas we have an opportunity to expand. One promising example \nis in a potential environmental market for farmers--where producers are \npaid by utilities and other greenhouse gas producers to offset carbon \ndioxide emissions to ease into CO2 reductions more cost \neffectively. Such a market is already being looked at in many sectors, \nbut more information and applied research is needed to answer policy \nquestions surrounding the effectiveness and permanence of carbon \nsequestration as part of the global climate change solution.\n  I have introduced 3 bills involving carbon sequestration in this last \nyear. I am pleased that many of these ideas have been embraced by the \nnew farm bill currently on the Senate floor. Many farm conservation \npractices have been sequestering carbon for years--but we have not \nadequately been able to measure and capitalize on this promising \nprocess.\n  The new farm bill will contain $225 million over 5 years for carbon \nsequestration grants to producers and research uninversities to do \npilot projects to measure and verify carbon gains. In addition, USDA \nwill become more engaged in measuring and verifying which farm \nconservation practices store carbon. There will also be continued \nfunding for research through land grant universities--being led \nprominently by Kansas State University.\n  In addition, the farm bill contains a grant program of $500 million \nover 5 years for private enterprise conservation--which includes carbon \nsequestration activities.\n  Despite my concerns about many provisions in this farm bill--I am \nvery pleased to see these provisions included. This will build a new \nmarket for farmers--one that pays for how they produce, not just what \nthey produce.\n  The Wyden-Brownback amendment builds on this promise and expands it \nto help us explore how carbon trading might work by using one of the \nmost trusted friends of the farmer--cooperatives.\n  Carbon sequestration is a largely untapped resource that can buy us \nthe one thing we need most in the climate debate time. The Department \nof Energy estimates that over the next 50 to 100 years, agricultural \nlands alone could have the potential to remove anywhere from 40 to 80 \nbillion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere. If we expand this to \ninclude forests, the number will be far greater--indicating there is a \nreal difference that could be made by encouraging a carbon sink \napproach.\n  Carbon sequestration alone can not solve the climate change dilemma, \nbut as we search for technological advancement that allow us to create \nenergy with less pollution, and as we continue to research the cause \nand potential effects of climate change, it only makes sense that we \nenhance a natural process we already know has the benefit of reducing \nexisting concentrations of greenhouse gases--particularly when this \nprocess also improves water quality, soil fertility and wildlife \nhabitat. This is a no-regrets policy--much like taking out insurance on \nyour house or car. We should do no less for the protection of the \nPlanet.\n  Carbon sequestration can only be one tool in the fight to reduce \ngreenhouse gases in a cost effective way, but it is something we can be \ndoing right now for the benefit of our atmosphere, our water, our soil \nand our farmers and foresters. There is no downside to supporting this \namendment. We advance important conservation goals and begin taking \nconcrete action on one of o ur toughtest environmental challenges.\n  Not only does this amendment help the environment, it also helps to \nflesh out the details behind a very promising and potentially lucrative \nmarket for farmers and foresters--a market where they would be paid for \nhow they produce, in addition to what they produce.\n  Early estimates from the Consortium for Agricultural Soils Mitigation \nof Greenhouse Gases indicate that the potential for a carbon market for \nU.S. agriculture could reach $5 billion per year for the next 30-40 \nyears.\n  Mr. President--this is a common sense amendment--which is good for \nour farmers, good for the environment and could provide a bridge to \nbegin dealing with one of our most challenging environmental problems \nby applying the market principles to reduce climate change. This is an \nimportant first step--which opens the door to a new bi-partisan \nalliance that will help make real progress on the issue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Wyden-Brownback amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Oregon, amendment No. 2546.\n  The amendment (No. 2546) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S13118]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13118-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13118-S13138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFERENCE REPORT ACCOMPANYING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT \n                    FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe under the unanimous consent agreement that has \nbeen entered into, we will have a period of, I believe, 2 hours for \ndebate which I hope perhaps will be reduced. In any event, the first \nhalf hour was to be under the control of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Madam President, I was troubled by President Bush's announcement this \nmorning to withdraw the United States from the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty of 1972. This development has earth-shaking implications for our \nnational security, especially in considering the potential range of \nreactions from Russia and other nuclear powers, including China. Arms \ncontrol is bound to become more difficult as these countries work to \nmake sure that their nuclear deterrent can still work when--or if--we \nsuccessfully deploy an anti-missile system. While bringing us no closer \nto realizing a workable national missile defense system, withdrawal \nfrom the ABM Treaty signals to the world that the United States seeks a \ndominant, not a stable, strategic nuclear position.\n  I am not an expert on the technology used in nuclear weapons or \nballistic missiles. But I do know that China has twenty missiles \ncapable of delivering nuclear weapons to our shores. China has been \nsatisfied that these twenty missiles provided it a nuclear deterrence \nagainst other nuclear powers, including the United States. As a result \nof this move by the President against the ABM Treaty, I have no doubt \nthat China will seek a larger, more sophisticated nuclear arsenal. Does \nthat make the United States more or less secure? What about our allies \nand friends overseas?\n  Does a larger Chinese nuclear arsenal help the President of South \nKorea sleep at night? What about the Prime Minister of Japan, or even \nthe Prime Minister of Britain? Clearly, our friends have good cause to \nbe concerned about U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. I do not \nbelieve it is an overstatement to say that withdrawing from the ABM \nTreaty will have serious consequences for our allies, and by extension, \non our national security interests.\n  I also know that many experts on missile technology have grave \nconcerns about how easy it would be to build missiles that can fool a \nnational missile defense system, rendering it useless. Russia has \nalready developed a missile that could pierce our planned missile \ndefense system, even if it worked. And I think that one can bet that \nChina is working on similar technology. If China and Russia, two \ncountries with past records of sending missile technology to the likes \nof Iran and North Korea, have the technology to fool our missile \ndefense radars, how long do you think it will take for that technology \nto end up in the hands of rogue states? I understand the President's \ndesire to develop a national missile defense system for the United \nStates. I support that goal, as long as it produces a system that is \nfeasible, affordable, and effective. However, we have no assurances at \nthis point that an effective missile shield can be developed. We are \noperating on little more than conjecture and speculation. Can a \nreliable, workable missile shield be developed? We're not sure. How \nmany missiles can a missile shield deflect? Good question. What will it \nultimately cost? No idea.\n  To jettison the ABM Treaty with no replacement agreement in hand and \nno better understanding of how or whether a missile defense system will \nwork--and that is where we are right now--to bring additional turmoil \nto a world that is already reeling from the terrorist attacks on \nAmerica is, in my opinion, a rash and ill-considered course of action.\n  The United States has been engaged in intensive arms control talks \nwith Russia over the past several months. These talks have focused on \ntwo key issues: first, altering the ABM Treaty to allow the United \nStates to increase its missile defense testing, and second, negotiating \nreductions in the nuclear arsenals of both the United States and \nRussia. Russia has repeatedly expressed its belief that the ABM Treaty \nis the ``cornerstone of strategic stability.'' By limiting the \ndevelopment of missiles that could shoot down an opponent's nuclear \nmissiles, the argument goes, both the United States and Russia \nunderstood the strategic capabilities of the other--of each other. \nIndeed, progress in first limiting the nuclear arms of the United \nStates and the Soviet Union was concurrent to progress in limiting the \ndevelopment of anti-ballistic missiles. In the three decades since the \nABM Treaty and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty were ratified, the \nUnited States has been able to reach consensus with the Soviet Union--\nand later Russia--on the principles of the Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaties, commonly known as START, to steadily reduce the nuclear \narsenals of both countries.\n  These arms reduction treaties have slashed the nuclear arsenals of \nour two countries by over half over the last decade. All the while, the \nABM Treaty provided the strategic stability to allow these cuts to \noccur without threatening the strategic balance between the two nuclear \ngiants.\n  Senator Biden, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, spoke \nvery clearly yesterday on his concerns over a precipitous withdrawal \nfrom the ABM Treaty. I thank the Senator for his remarks, and for his \nvaluable insight into this very troubling subject. The Constitution of \nthis Nation deliberately established a clear separation of powers among \nthe executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Government. \nArticle II, Section 2, gives the President the power to make treaties \n``by and with the consent of the Senate.'' There is a reason for that \ncaveat, and the reason is that treaties among nations are enormously \nimportant instruments of power. The framers of the Constitution \nrecognized the importance of treaties, and saw the potential danger of \nallowing any individual to enter into a treaty with another nation. The \nrequired acquiescence to any treaty by two-thirds of the Senate is a \nfundamental part of the checks and balances of our Government.\n  This is what disturbs me so greatly about the President's \nannouncement of withdrawal from the ABM Treaty without seeking the \nadvice or consent of Congress. And this announcement comes on the heels \nof the President's declaration a few weeks ago that he is willing to \nfurther reduce America's nuclear arsenal on the strength of a handshake \nfrom his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, instead of pursuing the \nSTART process. Again, the decision was made without seeking the advice \nor consent of Congress. To me, shutting Congress out of the decision-\nmaking process involving agreements among nations is a dangerous--a \ndangerous and corrosive course of action. It effectively undermines, I \nthink, the intent of the framers of our Constitution. Monarchs make \ntreaties. American Presidents propose treaties. They make treaties by \nand with the consent of the Senate. There is a tremendous difference \nbetween the two, and defining such differences is the essence of our \nConstitution.\n  I recognize that under the terms of the treaty, the President has the \nlegal right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty with six months notice. I \nrecognize that, upon adoption of the Defense authorization conference \nreport, which strikes an existing prohibition, he will have the legal \nauthority to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal without the consent of \nCongress. But I also believe that it would be a violation of the spirit \nof our Constitution to take either course of action without seeking the \nendorsement of the Senate. I think that the President's contention that \nthe ABM Treaty is a cold war relic merits some consideration. His \nbelief that it is time to move onto a new framework for missile defense \nreflecting the new realities of a world with multiple nuclear powers \nand would-be nuclear powers, makes a great deal of sense.\n  The President's ABM and weapons reductions proposals merit debate and\n\n[[Page S13119]]\n\nconsideration in the Senate. I know there are some in this body who \nagree with him wholeheartedly and others who disagree just as \npassionately. I would like to hear their views on both sides. The \nAmerican people should have the opportunity to hear the views of each \nside. But by the President deciding unilaterally to withdraw from the \nABM Treaty and to reduce America's nuclear stockpile on the strength of \na wink and a nod, the American people are denied a voice in the \ndecision--a voice by the Senate--a decision, by the way, that will \naffect the security of the American people and the stability of the \nworld for years to come.\n\n  Our hands are effectively tied at this point. The Defense \nauthorization bill, in which we could have dealt with both of these \nissues, is for all intents and purposes signed, sealed and ready for \ndelivery to the Senate for a vote in the Senate. A statutory \nprohibition preventing the President from reducing the U.S. nuclear \narsenal below the levels established in START I is eliminated in that \nbill. A well-reasoned provision that would have conditioned the \nexpenditure of FY 2002 missile defense funds on U.S. compliance with \nthe ABM Treaty was thrown overboard before the Senate even took up \ndebate on the Defense authorization bill.\n  We are advancing headlong into committing our nation and our treasure \nto an untried and unproven missile defense system, which we may or may \nnot need and which may or may not protect us, while at the same time we \nare in full retreat from arms control treaties and policies that have \nhelped stabilize the world for decades. We are looking to expand our \nmilitary might from the land, seas, and skies into the heavens. The \nDepartment of Defense is investigating ways to use space as the \n``ultimate high ground'' in military operations, expanding upon the \npeaceful use of satellites for intelligence and surveillance. No one is \nsure exactly where this research is leading, but we ought to have a \nfull debate on the weaponization of space before these types of \ntechnologies are realized. We are taking these major, major steps \nwithout the nearest scrap of debate, discussion, or decision in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  You can be assured that I am as eager as anyone to reduce the number \nof unnecessary weapons in our country. But I am decidedly less than \neager to pursue such a course of action without ensuring that Russia is \non the same glidepath. Without a written agreement, without a treaty, \nsuch assurances cannot be made. We cannot verify intentions without a \nverification regime. We cannot measure progress without a formal system \nof monitoring. We cannot be assured of compliance without written \nguidelines spelling out what compliance means. A handshake, no matter \nhow sincere or well-intentioned, is no substitute for a signature.\n  A President may be here today and may be gone tomorrow. A President \nof Russia may be here today and may be gone tomorrow.\n  A handshake was all right back in the old days when the Senator from \nVirginia and I decided that we would like to trade cows, or a couple of \nhorses we would like to trade, or I would like to buy his crop of cane \nmolasses. But when dealing between nations, we can't be content with a \nhandshake or just looking into the other person's eyes and reading his \nsoul. Things have to be put in writing. A handshake, no matter how \nsincere or well intentioned, is no substitute for a signature.\n  As Ronald Reagan so famously exhorted, ``Trust, but verify.''\n  It may have been W.C. Fields who said something to the effect: Trust, \nbut always cut the deck. It was something like that. Always cut the \ndeck.\n  Similarly, there is no vehicle before us for debate or a vote on the \nmerits of withdrawing from the ABM Treaty. We gave away the opportunity \nto discuss this matter in the context of the Defense authorization bill \nin the interests of comity. We relinquished our right to even debate \nwhether to condition missile defene funding on compliance with the ABM \nTreaty. Now, we are at the mercy of the President. He has to be aware \nthat this is a contentious issue. He has to be aware that many members \nof this body have grave concerns over his decision. He has to be aware \nthat a decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty will have global \nramifications.\n  As of this morning, it appears that withdrawal of the United States \nfrom the ABM Treaty is a done deal. I would have strongly preferred to \nhave the President give more consideration to the role of Congress in \nforeign and defense affairs. He could have chosen to consult with \nCongress, and submitted to the Senate a formal resolution of withdrawal \non which we could debate and have a vote. It appears that we are now \npast that point. But I would urge the President to put any agreement to \nreduce our nuclear arsenal in writing, as President Putin has \nrequested, and to submit that agreement to the Senate so that the \nlegislative branch, as intended by the framers, will have voice in the \nexecution of such an important agreement between nations.\n  The issue of missile defense, the future of the ABM Treaty, and the \nfuture of the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal are matters of the gravest \nimportance. These are matters that deserve the full and undivided \nattention of the President, the Congress, and the Nation. These are not \ndecisions that should be sprung on the nation in a speech or at press \nconference. I hope that the President will make the effort to include \nthe legislative branch--the people's branch--in making any future, \nfinal decisions relating to these matters.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will our distinguished colleague yield for \na question on the speech he has just given?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it was very interesting. I followed it \nvery closely. The Senator from West Virginia is a valued member of our \ncommittee. I fully admit that I advanced in the course of our hearings \nin markup, and likewise the various provisions, which give rise to the \nSenator's concern.\n  I strongly support the President's action of exercising article 15 \nand giving notice. But I must say I am intrigued by the comments of the \nSenator from West Virginia. He obviously has done a good deal of \nresearch.\n  What are the precedents by which a President feels that a treaty is \nno longer of value to our Nation? Have they heretofore formally \nconsulted and notified particularly the Senate which has to give the \nadvice and consent? I will research that. But I was interested to the \nextent that the Senator might have some knowledge of it. We have had, I \nguess, minimal consultation.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, my colleague--I have \nbeen here 23 years; my colleague has been here many more years than I. \nI recall that many times we would sit down with Presidents and discuss \nmomentous decisions regarding foreign policy informally. Then we had \nextensive hearings on the ABM Treaty. In each one, I advocated that we \nbasically take the action our President was taking. But I am trying to \nthink of the consultative process.\n  At this particular time, the best that I know is there were telephone \ncalls with the Secretary of Defense and discussions with me about it. I \npresume that occurred with my chairman and perhaps the Senator from \nWest Virginia. But what are the precedents for Presidents in a more \nformal way advising the Senate about the fact that he has reached a \ndecision that a treaty is no longer of value to this country, and, \ntherefore, he is going to exercise such a provision as the treaty may \nprovide for the withdrawal?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, as I have stated, I don't question the \nPresident's legal right to do that. That is not the question.\n  I think the question is, as I have tried to pose it, that the Senate, \na body which, under the Constitution, approves or disapproves the \nratification of treaties, should have an opportunity, in the case of \nthe ABM Treaty--a treaty of such significance as this one has been and \nis--the Senate should have an opportunity to debate this. As I have \nindicated, I think the President should have asked for some advice from \nthe Senate. He does not have to take the advice, but I have seen no \nevidence of the President seeking advice on this matter. He simply made \nup his mind to do it and did it.\n  Mr. WARNER. But he did forewarn the Nation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our Nation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Congress, President Putin, and others that that was \nhis intention. He did have a series of\n\n[[Page S13120]]\n\nconsultations with President Putin, his key aides, his Secretary of \nState, his Secretary of Defense, and, likewise, the National Security \nAdviser. But I guess we come back to the problem that you feel it was a \nmatter of comity, not of law, that he----\n  Mr. BYRD. I say that he had the legal right.\n  Mr. WARNER. To do what he did.\n  Mr. BYRD. But if the Senator will recall, let's go back to the time \nwhen we were considering the INF Treaty. Mr. Dole was the leader on \nthat side of the aisle. I was the leader on this side. And the Reagan \nadministration sought to reinterpret the ABM Treaty to its own way of \nthinking at that time. There was a big dispute about this. There was a \nlot of pressure on me, as the majority leader at that time--the Senator \nprobably didn't realize that, but I have not forgotten--to bring up the \nINF Treaty.\n  I said: Well, let's see what Mr. Nunn, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, has to say about that. And let's see what Mr. \nBoren, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has to say. And \nlet's see what Mr. Pell has to say. Now, when they all come back to me \nand give a report to me that they are satisfied with this, then we will \ncall it up.\n  There was great pressure on me to bring up that treaty because \nPresident Reagan wanted to go to Moscow and sit down with Mr. Gorbachev \nand have an exchange of ratification papers on the INF. Mr. Baker, at \nthe White House, was going to be there also. But I waited until those \nthree chairmen of the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign \nRelations Committees, respectively, were satisfied about the treaty.\n  As the Senator will recall, out of that delay Mr. Shultz went to \nParis, I guess it was, and met with Mr. Schevardnadze and brought back \nsomething in writing, and we all reached an agreement that any \nreinterpretation of the treaty had to be agreed upon and approved by \nthe Senate. And we are talking about the ABM Treaty.\n  I believe it was agreed that the interpretation of the treaty would \nbe based on the testimony of witnesses, the actual language within the \nfour corners of the treaty, and the interpretation by the then \nadministration expressed through its witnesses in Senate hearings, and \nthat any subsequent administration could not change that \nreinterpretation without going through this process and having the \napproval of the Senate.\n  Now, I say all of that, and my memory may not be exactly accurate on \nevery point. That was back in 1987 or 1988, somewhere along that line, \na long time ago.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I remember. I was here.\n  Mr. BYRD. At that time we were very concerned about a subsequent \nreinterpretation of the ABM Treaty, the ratification of which the \nSenate had approved, by a subsequent administration. Otherwise, a \ntreaty would be without any value if a subsequent administration could \ncome along and reinterpret a given treaty based on the way it saw \nthings at that later time.\n  I say all that to my good friend from Virginia because I have been \ninvolved in the ABM Treaty for a long time. At that time we saw it as a \nmatter of grave importance that an administration be allowed to \nreinterpret that ABM Treaty without subsequent hearings and without \nsubsequent approval by the Senate as to the interpretation.\n  But here we are today, and we are walking away from that same treaty, \nand the administration--the President did announce this in the \nnewspaper, but I saw nothing that was ever sent up. I do not remember \never seeing any letter from the President to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee or the Appropriations Committee or the Foreign \nRelations Committee or the Intelligence Committee.\n  Now, there may have been such, but I was not aware of it. The \nPresident said, some time ago, he was thinking about doing this. He did \nnot feel that anything needed to be put in writing. That, to me, is \nenough to keep me awake at night. When a President says he does not \nthink something of this nature has to be put in writing, that a mere \nhandshake is good enough, that is a rather scary way of looking at it \nas far as I am concerned.\n  So this is why I say, I am sorry--I am not sorry we are reducing our \narsenal. We ought to do that. It is costing too much, and we do not \nneed it. But for the President just to walk away from the treaty, and \nthe Senate not to have had any expression from the President in \nwriting, or any formal expression at all--the Senate, as far as I am \nconcerned, was ignored in this matter. This is what puzzles me. I am \nsorry that the Senate apparently is willing to just lie down, be quiet, \nand not ask any questions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I do \nnot feel that he just walked away.\n  In deference to your observations, he did, through a series of \nhearings with his key advisers, through public statements, clearly \nindicate his strong dissatisfaction with a treaty which has served its \npurpose, in my judgment, and now, given the turn of events--\nparticularly those on September 11, when our Nation was shocked at the \ndevastation brought on by terrorists--he feels it imperative, that it \nis his duty to now begin to proceed to explore technology and options \nwhich could lead to an effective system that hopefully will be \ndeployed.\n  But I just wanted to see----\n  Mr. BYRD. See, I do not see that nexus. I do not see that connection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just wanted to see if there were precedents. Perhaps \nhenceforth the Senate, in the advice and consent process, should put \na--what do we call it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Condition.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, into a treaty requiring the President, before any \namendment or reinterpretation, to come back and seek the advice and \nconsent of the Senate on his proposal. There we state very clearly. But \nso far as I know, I do not know of a requirement or a precedent which \nour President has broken, nor did he do anything that was not in \naccordance with the law and/or the terms of the treaty.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have already said the President did not do anything that \nis not in accordance with the law. He has not done anything that is \nillegal.\n  But let's see if your imagination and mine might be stretched to the \nfarthest limit. Let's imagine I became President. And that taxes the \nimagination.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I think you would do quite well.\n  Mr. BYRD. In the farthest stretches of the imagination, if I were \nPresident, I would not think of walking away from a treaty--the ABM \nTreaty--one that has served the Nation well, without at least having \nthe Senate in on the action. I would find some way to get some \nexpression and view from the Senate.\n  As it is, no Senator here has pointed out to me, tonight at least, \nthat that effort was made. I think the administration would be much \nwiser if it took the Senate into consideration and had some expression \nof support; let the American people hear some debate in the Senate. I \nthink the administration would be much wiser if it let the Senate in on \nthe matter and sought its advice.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I remember the many debates we have \nhad in the past on the War Powers Act. Although that act is observed in \nspirit by Presidents, Republican and Democrat, they certainly have \nnever accepted it really as the letter of the law. It does explicitly \nset out the need for consultation with the Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. It does.\n  Mr. WARNER. And we have had various forms of consultation heretofore.\n  Mr. BYRD. It also requires reports from the President.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Madam President, the conference report to the fiscal year 2002 \nDefense authorization bill before the Senate today contains many \nprovisions that will help the men and women who serve our country in \nuniform. The bill provides for pay raises, increased educational \nbenefits, and better housing for our military personnel. It authorizes \nimportant funds for the military services' counter-terrorism programs, \nand enhances efforts to improve the serious accounting problems of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Unfortunately, as developments unfolded in our strategic relationship \nwith Russia on nuclear weapons and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, \nit became clear to me that the conference report before us does not \nmove us in the right direction on those two critical issues. It is the \nimportance of our strategic relationship with Russia, and\n\n[[Page S13121]]\n\nthe rest of the world, that compelled me to oppose this conference \nreport. The conference report eliminates a provision of law that \nforbids the President from reducing our nuclear stockpile below the \nlevels laid out in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991, which \ntotal about 6,000 warheads. Assuming that this conference report is \nenacted into law--and I assume it will be on its way to the President--\nthe President will then be accountable to no one on how much he would \nlike to reduce our nuclear arsenal. The President could call for these \ncuts without so much as one minute of debate in Congress.\n  Let me be perfectly clear for the third time: I do not oppose \nreductions in our nuclear arsenal. The cold war has passed into \nhistory, and to a great degree, so has the logic of maintaining \nthousands of nuclear weapons pointed at a country that no longer \nadvocates the destruction of our way of life.\n  In the next fiscal year, the Department of Energy will spend $5.4 \nbillion on our nuclear stockpile. That is serious money. I do not know \nexactly how many nuclear warheads we need to maintain, but I cannot \nthink of one good reason to continue spending that much to maintain far \nmore nuclear warheads than what almost all experts believe to be \nappropriate to meet our national security requirements. However, we \nmust consider the role of Congress in our national defense, as spelled \nout in the Constitution. To me that is the bedrock of the Republic, \nCongress, the people's plans, the control over the purse. Article I, \nSection 8, Clause 12 reads: ``The Congress shall have the power to \nraise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use \nshall be for a longer term than two years.'' The Constitution does not \ngive the executive branch the power to raise armies. That is \ncongressional power. The Constitution gives that power to the \nlegislative branch, the Congress. The document that establishes our \nrepublic says that Congress, not the President, shall have the power to \nsupport armies, to maintain navies.\n  Clearly, the Founding Fathers did not want the chief executive to \nhave the sole power to determine the size and shape of our military. By \neliminating the one statutory restriction on the President's action \nwith regard to the size of our nuclear forces, we in Congress have \nturned our back on that responsibility. I have already spoken today on \nthe President's announcement to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. I believe \nthat it is an ill-timed move that should have been subject to \nconsideration and debate in the Senate. I supported a provision that \nwas included in the original version of the Defense authorization bill \nas passed by the Armed Services Committee to limit our missile defense \ntesting for the next 9 months to those tests that are allowable under \nthe ABM Treaty. Those restrictions could have been waived under two \ncircumstances: first, if the United States and Russia reached a new \nagreement on missile defense testing, or if there was an affirmative \nvote in both houses of Congress to authorize the tests. This was a \nreasonable provision. It protected the constitutional duty of Congress \nin national defense and foreign affairs.\n  I regret that, following the tragic events of September 11, this \nprovision was dropped from the bill without so much as a vote. I can \nunderstand the great desire on the part of all of us to support the \nPresident in a moment like this. Considering the President's \nannouncement this morning on withdrawal of the United States from the \ntreaty, we should have had a fuller debate on the ABM Treaty \nprovisions. What is history going to read? Where is history going to \ngo? Where are the Senators of tomorrow going to look in the record for \na debate on this very important matter? While I voted against this \nconference report, I appreciate the work that the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner, have put in on this bill. They have few peers in their \nknowledge of the challenges facing the armed services. For the 7 weeks \nthat this bill was in conference, they have had an exhausting schedule \nof meetings with their House counterparts, often meeting several times \neach day. They have continued the tradition of bipartisanship on the \nArmed Services Committee, and their staffs likewise have labored day \nand night, hour after hour to bring forth this legislation.\n  The issues of nuclear arms reductions and national missile defense \nshould not disappear from our consciousness because of the President's \nannouncement on the ABM Treaty. I hope that it will focus the attention \nof other Members of the Senate to the need to safeguard the role of \nCongress in defense and foreign affairs. While I look forward to future \ndebates on these vital issues, I deeply regret that this Defense \nauthorization bill did not tackle them head-on, have a debate, votes \nthereon, and for that reason I voted against its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this morning, President Bush announced \nthat he had given Russian President Putin formal notice that the United \nStates--pursuant to article 15 of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty--was exercising its right to withdraw from that Treaty. That \narticle provides that ``each Party shall . . . have the right to \nwithdraw from this Treaty'' with six months notice. I support the \nPresident's action.\n  The ABM Treaty has served the cause of peace well for many years, but \nthe Treaty has completed its mission. It was negotiated and signed in \nan era when the United States and the Soviet Union were implacable \nenemies. I, as Secretary of the Navy, was in Moscow in May 1972, where \nPresident Nixon signed the ABM Treaty for the United States. Each \nnation sustained large nuclear forces aimed at the other. The Treaty \nwas seen as a means of controlling the arms competition between our two \nnations and as a building block to other arms control agreements. It \nhas served its purpose. But the cold war, as President Bush noted in \nhis remarks today, is long over. The Soviet Union has fallen, and \nRussia is, in the words of President Bush, no longer an enemy. Our \nPresident is pursuing with Russia a new strategic relationship. As \nPresident Bush has said, ``We're moving to replace mutually assured \ndestruction with mutual cooperation.'' President Putin has accepted \nthis new challenge and we can expect the two Presidents to make further \nprogress. Now our President must explore new technologies and provide a \nsystem to protect our people from attacks by a limited number of \nmissiles.\n  The events of September 11 dramatically illustrate that this nation \nhas enemies willing to go to extraordinary lengths to attack our \nhomeland and indiscriminately kill thousands of innocent civilians. \nWhere some doubted such devastation to our nation could ever occur, all \ndoubts are now gone. We know that terrorists are seeking to acquire \nweapons of mass destruction, and we know that many of the nations that \nsupport the terrorists either have, or are seeking to acquire, both \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.\n  It is the first obligation of any U.S. President to provide for the \ndefense of our citizens and our vital national interests. President \nBush is committed to protecting our nation--from all known threats. His \ncommitment to provide defenses against attack from a limited number of \nballistic missiles, and his determination to move beyond the ABM Treaty \nare motivated by this solem obligation.\n  From the inception of the new administration, President Bush and his \nkey advisors have persistently pursued with Russia, through a series of \nconsultations, a framework of understandings that would enable the \nUnited States to perform testing of new options and other steps leading \nto the eventual deployment of a ballistic missile defense system. These \ndiscussions will continue, but it is timely for the United States to \ngive notice under article 15. Some have claimed that exercising this \noption to withdraw is a ``violation'' of the Treaty. It is not. It is \nnot a ``violation'' to exercise our rights under article 15.\n  The Russian Government certainly recognizes and accepts this. Indeed, \nthe statements coming from Russian leaders indicate that President \nBush, and his key aids:, have carefully laid the groundwork for U.S. \nwithdrawal from the treaty. The U.S. action was preceded by U.S. and \nRussian commitments to accomplish the most dramatic reductions in \noffensive nuclear forces in the history of arms control. This was a \nhigh priority for Russia.\n\n[[Page S13122]]\n\nThere is no sense that U.S. withdrawal will result in a new arms race. \nThere is, instead, a sense of acceptance and a recognition that our \nclose relationship will continue to grow.\n  The President has an obligation to defend this nation--from all known \nthreats. Deliberately leaving our nation vulnerable to missile threats \nin a world so unpredictable and dangerous is not the wise course of \naction. We cannot, and must not, allow another nation to have a veto \nover our right to defend our homeland and our people. The President has \nacted courageously. He has my full support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me thank our good friend from \nWest Virginia for his kind remarks about myself and my ranking member.\n  I yield myself 10 minutes. I would like to comment on a few things \nwhich the good Senator from West Virginia said.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator yield so that I could join him simply \nin thanking the Senator for his reference to the two of us and our \nstaffs. We very much value his work as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank both Senators. Concerning the work, the diligence, \nthe dedication, and the loyalty to our country that is constantly being \ndemonstrated and exhibited by these two leaders of the Armed Services \nCommittee, my words fall pitifully short in expressing my true respect \nfor these two Senators.\n  They leave nothing undone when it comes to the expenditure of hours, \nlabor, toil, and sweat. I also say the same with regard to the staffs \nof both Senators. As a Member, I have been treated very fairly on both \nsides. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank our dear friend. Madam President, I totally agree \nwith the Senator relative to the unilateral decision made by the \nPresident today to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. I think it is a \nserious mistake.\n  I made a statement earlier today going into great detail as to why I \nthink it was a mistake. I don't think any subject has taken more time \nof our committee than the national missile defense program and its \nrelationship to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. I will read from the \nlong statement that I made today relative to this subject:\n\n       Ensuring the security and safety of the American people, \n     especially from weapons of mass destruction, must remain our \n     first defense priority. If I believed that withdrawing \n     unilaterally from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty would \n     enhance our national security, I would support doing so. \n     However, the President's announcement that the United States \n     will unilaterally withdraw from the ABM Treaty is a serious \n     mistake for our national security. It is not necessary and it \n     is not wise.\n       Unilateral withdrawal is not necessary because the ABM \n     Treaty is not a significant constraint on testing at this \n     time. Indeed, until a few months ago, the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Organization, BMDO, was proceeding with research, \n     development and testing that was entirely consistent with the \n     treaty. This approach recognized that the United States can \n     develop and test national missile defenses and stay in the \n     treaty. However, the administration then added new tests that \n     would conflict with the treaty--even though these tests are \n     of marginal value.\n       Unilateral withdrawal is not wise because it focuses on the \n     least likely threats to our security rather than the most \n     likely threats. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that \n     ballistic missiles are the least likely means of delivering a \n     weapon of mass destruction to the United States. The more \n     likely threat comes from a nuclear, biological or chemical \n     weapon being delivered to the United States in a plane, \n     truck, ship or a suitcase, which would be more reliable, less \n     costly, harder to detect and have no ``return address'' \n     against which to easily retaliate. We need to focus on the \n     most likely threats to our security before accelerating the \n     spending of billions of dollars for defenses against the \n     least likely threats.\n       Unilateral withdrawal is not wise because it needlessly \n     strains our growing relationship with Russia, a partner in \n     the new war on terrorism. The President's decision also seems \n     to be a violation of his campaign pledge at the Citadel in \n     September 1999, that, if elected, he would ``offer Russia the \n     necessary amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.'' \n     From newspaper accounts it appears that the administration \n     did not offer amendments to the Russians that would allow us \n     to proceed with the new tests that the administration added. \n     Instead, something much broader was proposed by the \n     administration and not necessarily in the form of amendments. \n     In other words, rather than proceeding with tests permissible \n     under the ABM Treaty or reaching agreement with Russia on \n     amendments to allow for further testing and maintaining the \n     right to withdraw at a later time, the administration has \n     decided at this time to unilaterally withdraw. This is not \n     the way to treat an important nation with which we seek a new \n     relationship based on mutual cooperation. It is fair to ask: \n     What specific amendments to the ABM Treaty were proposed to \n     the Russians by the President as he promised?\n       Unilateral withdrawal is not wise because it risks \n     upsetting strategic stability. It risks a dangerous action-\n     reaction cycle in offensive and defensive technologies that \n     would leave America less secure. Even though the missile \n     defense system being pursued by the administration is \n     limited, the technologies that would be created as part of \n     this limited system could quickly lead to a much larger \n     program that could--in Russian eyes--undermine their nuclear \n     deterrent. This could prompt Russia to take the destabilizing \n     step of putting multiple warheads on missiles, so-called \n     MIRVed missiles. this could lead China to rapidly increase \n     their nuclear program. It could also lead China or other \n     countries to devise countermeasures and decoys that they \n     could then sell.\n       Finally, the President's decision to withdraw unilaterally \n     from the ABM Treaty is not wise because it risks undermining \n     our relationships with allies, partners and other nations \n     just when the world is united in a common fight against \n     terrorism. As this multilateral effort clearly demonstrates, \n     our security is enhanced when we make common cause with other \n     nations in pursuit of common goals. In both the short-term \n     and the long-term, our security is diminished when we forge \n     ahead unilaterally regardless of the impact on the security \n     of other nations.\n       The Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on the \n     administration's decision in the weeks and months ahead.\n\n  Madam President, I start with a very strong ``Amen'' to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia on his comments relative to the decision of the \nPresident to unilaterally withdraw from an arms control treaty, with no \nnew structure in its place. He has decided to tear down the old \nstructure, which has produced significant stability when the cold war \nwas on and after it was over. Unilateral withdrawal could unleash some \nvery negative forces in this world. It could unleash an arms race in \noffensive measures, countermeasures, ways to defeat limited defenses, \ndecoys, and ways to overcome those countermeasures. The marginal gain \nthat will be achieved in terms of the proposed additional testing is so \nmarginal it doesn't come close to outweighing the negative forces that \nnow are likely to be unleashed.\n  The likelihood that we would be attacked by a state with a ballistic \nmissile--we have been told by our top military people --is very slim. \nThe greater likelihood is that a weapon of mass destruction would be \ndelivered by a truck, a ship, a suitcase, or by an airplane, which have \nno return address the way a missile does. You don't know from where \nthat suitcase or truck comes. They make it harder to find the source. \nBut with a missile, you know the source. Whoever launched a missile, if \nthey could get their hands on one, would be immediately destroyed. The \nidea that a North Korean regime would attack us with a missile, which \nwould lead to their immediate destruction, runs counter to what the \nintelligence community has told us: Their first goal in life is their \nown survival.\n  So in tearing down this security structure, this source of stability, \nwithout having anything in its place, to address the least likely means \nof delivery, means that we will be spending a huge amount of resources \nagainst the least likely threat, instead of putting those resources on \nthe most likely threat, which are the terrorist threats, delivering a \nweapon of mass destruction with a truck, or a ship, or an airplane.\n  We have, by this action of the President today, removed a structure \nthat made it possible for us to have a stable relationship and allow us \nto be much more, it seems to me, rational in the use of our resources.\n  So I agree with the Senator from West Virginia on that point. I want \nto reassure him of a couple things, if I can. First of all, the \nlanguage I had offered in the committee requiring a vote before any of \nthe funds that are authorized or appropriated would be used for any \ntest in conflict with the ABM Treaty was language which, by its own \nterms, did not affect the power of the President to withdraw from the \nABM Treaty. Subsection (d) of that language, which I had offered, and \nwe were able to pass with the help of the Senator from West Virginia--\nby one vote in the Armed Services Committee--explicitly said: Nothing \nin this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the United \nStates to withdraw\n\n[[Page S13123]]\n\nfrom the ABM Treaty at any time upon a decision of the United States \nthat extraordinary events relating to the subject matter of the treaty \njeopardized the supreme interest in accordance with article XV of the \ntreaty.\n  To the extent that that is reassuring, the language that was removed, \nfor reasons which I gave at the time, did not prevent the President \nfrom withdrawing from the treaty. In fact, if it had prevented the \nPresident from withdrawing from the treaty, we would not have been able \nto get the majority vote in the Armed Services Committee. Some \ncolleagues would not have voted for it if it had limited the \nPresident's right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty.\n  The second thing I want to say to our good friend from West Virginia \nis this: The language that prohibited the executive branch from going \nto a lower level of nuclear weapon delivery systems, below the START I \nlevel, has been in the law for a number of years. We have tried to \nremove that language for many years. Indeed, I think the Senator from \nWest Virginia may have supported that effort at times to remove that \nlanguage. The uniformed military has urged us to repeal that language. \nThe top defense civilian leadership has urged us to repeal that \nlanguage.\n  But I want to assure the chairman of the Appropriations Committee of \nsomething that he knows better than any Member of this body, so I am \neven a little reluctant to give him this assurance, because if anybody \nstands for what I am going to say, it is the Senator from West \nVirginia: Nobody can take away from the Congress the power of the \npurse. Nobody. Nobody can take away from the Congress the power to tell \nthe President of the United States you must have whatever level of \nnuclear forces we determine you must have.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Supreme Court ruled within the last couple of years \nthat Congress could not give away its constitutional power.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Indeed, we cannot.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Michigan, together with the then-\ndistinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, and the then-Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, and I sought to bring that case before the \nCourt. The Court said we didn't have standing. But subsequent to that, \nother parties that did have standing, and were recognized as having \nstanding by the Court, pursued that case. The Court, throughout that--I \nam trying to think of a word I can safely say here in the Senate about \nthe line-item veto.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would suggest the word ``abomination.''\n  Mr. BYRD. The Supreme Court, throughout that miserable piece of \nlegislation, upheld the fact that, as the Senator said, the Congress \ncannot give away its powers as set forth under the Constitution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that is what I just want to reassure my good friend \nfrom West Virginia that he has been the most steadfast, the most \nvalorous, and the most determined representative of that point of view. \nI was proud to join him in the Supreme Court.\n  The Appropriations Committee, of which our good friend is the \nchairman, has determined there will be funds in fiscal year 2002 for \n500 minutemen ICBMs--it is in your bill--and for 50 peacekeeper ICBMs. \nThere will be 17 to 18 Trident subs. There will be 94 B-52Hs. That is \nthe power of the purse. So we have done nothing to diminish that power. \nThe President cannot take that away. We could not give it away. We \nshould never try. But if anyone ever tried, we can't give it away. The \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and the appropriators, and \nthen ultimately this Congress, determines what level of weaponry we are \ngoing to fund and what must be maintained. We determine that.\n  Nothing in this bill changes that. That continues to exist. But what \nwe did do is remove a prohibition in permanent law that said--not the \nannual appropriation, which continues to be ours, and ours alone, but a \npermanent law--we had what I considered to be an artificial prohibition \nthat they had to stay at the START I level instead of leaving that to \nthe annual appropriations process; it was something in permanent law.\n  There are a number of us who have been trying to remove that \nprohibition for years. We thought it was no longer appropriate. The \nmilitary and defense officials were saying we were spending a lot of \nmoney we should not spend, and our conference successfully repealed \nthat prohibition this year. It does not in any way diminish the power \nof this Congress, which was just exercised on the appropriations bill \nagain this year to determine the level of nuclear forces or any other \nweapons we have in our inventory.\n  That remains, should remain, and always must remain the power of the \nCongress, the power of the purse.\n  Madam President, this is no ordinary time. Two days ago, the Nation \nobserved the 3-month anniversary of the most deadly attack ever against \nthe United States. For more than 2 months, U.S. forces have been \nengaged in a military campaign on the ground and in the skies of \nAfghanistan. Their success has been remarkable: after just 9 weeks, the \nAl Qaeda terrorist network is on the run, and the Taliban regime that \nharbored them is no more. Our brave men and women in uniform embody \nAmerica's determination to protect our citizens from more terror and \nour resolve to track down and relentlessly pursue terrorists and those \nwho would shelter them. And even as we continue to remove flag-draped \ncoffins from the ruins in New York, flag-draped coffins have returned \nfrom Afghanistan with the bodies of heroes who have given their lives \nfor our freedom, including our freedom from fear.\n  Against this background, I am pleased to bring to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2002. The conferees have produced a good, balanced bill that will \nstrengthen our national security. The U.S. military is the most capable \nfighting force in the world today, and this bill ensures it will remain \nso, especially as it is engaged in a war against terrorism.\n  This bill reflects the contributions and hard work of many, many \npeople over many, many months. I am grateful to Senator Warner for \nworking with me every step of the way in producing this bill. We have \nserved together on this committee for more than two decades. We agree \non most things. When we disagree, we trust one another. No chairman \ncould ask for a better partner. I want to take this occasion to express \nmy gratitude for his invaluable support, which made this a better bill.\n  I also want to thank the chairmen and ranking members of the \nsubcommittees for their help in the conference and throughout the year \nin completing action on this important bill.\n  Finally, I want to thank Representatives Stump and Skelton. Like \nChairman Stump, this was my first year as chairman. He was also \nchairman of the conference. As conferees, we faced many difficult \ndecisions. This was a very challenging conference. But Representatives \nStump and Skelton made a major contribution to produce a bill that is \nin the national interest. Madam President, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 authorizes $343.3 billion for \nnational defense programs, the full amount requested by the President \nand in the budget resolution. This bill addresses a number of important \npriorities.\n  This bill builds on Congressional efforts in recent years to improve \nthe compensation and quality of life for our forces and their families. \nIt authorizes a pay raise of at least 5 percent for all military \npersonnel, effective January 1, 2002, and targeted pay raises between 6 \nand 10 percent for mid- and senior-level enlisted personnel and junior \nofficers. It extends critical bonuses and special pay authorities by 1 \nyear. It authorizes personnel with critical skills to transfer up to 18 \nmonths of unused benefits under the Montgomery G.I. bill to family \nmembers in return for a commitment to serve 4 more years, an important \nprovision Senator Cleland has been fighting for for some time. It \nauthorizes a plan to provide U.S. savings bonds to personnel who commit \nto serve at least 6 additional years of active-duty service in a \ncritical specialty. It authorizes $10.5 billion for military \nconstruction and family housing, an increase of more than $500 million \nabove the budget request. It includes a series of provisions to enhance \nthe ability of military voters and their families to vote.\n  One of the most difficult issues for the conference was whether \ndisabled military veterans would receive their\n\n[[Page S13124]]\n\nretired pay and veterans disability compensation concurrently. This is \na popular and meritorious benefit that Senator Harry Reid has \nchampioned. I was disappointed that the House was unwilling to accept \nthis benefit because it would have required a vote on the budget point \nof order. The conference agreement authorizes disabled military \nveterans to receive their retired pay and veterans disability \ncompensation concurrently, but make this contingent on the enactment of \nlegislation offsetting the cost of this benefit. The conference \nagreement also includes an extremely modest enhancement to special pay \nfor retirees with service-connected disabilities. It is my hope that in \nthe future Congress will allow our military veterans to receive the \nretired pay and veterans disability compensation that they earned and \ndeserve.\n  This conference report improves the ability of U.S. forces to combat \nterrorism, and it improves the ability of the United States to combat \nthe proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. To help \ncombat terrorism, it adds to the budget request: $47 million for \nscience and technology to help confront asymmetric threats such as \nchemical and biological warfare; $17.4 million to procure additional \nprotective equipment for chemical and biological agents; and, $10 \nmillion to help fund our combatant commanders around the world fund \nhigh-priority projects to defend U.S. forces against terrorism.\n  This bill also authorizes the full $403 million requested by the \nadministration for the Cooperative Threat Reduction program to continue \ndestroying and dismantling nuclear warheads and missiles in the former \nSoviet Union. The bill also adds nearly $60 million for Energy \nDepartment programs and research to combat proliferation of such \nweapons. With this funding, the Congress gives additional tangible \nsupport to the continuing effort to reduce the threats posed by \noffensive nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and related \nmaterials.\n\n  On missile defense, we followed the funding formula in the Senate \nbill, making a reduction of $1.3 billion in the request and authorizing \nthe President to use the $1.3 billion for whichever he determines is in \nour national security interest: one, research and development of \nmissile defense programs as previously requested; and two, DOD \nactivities to combat terrorism. I sincerely hope the President will \nwisely choose to use these funds to combat the more likely threats to \nthe United States from terrorism, rather than the least likely threat \nof a ballistic missile attack on our Nation.\n  The bill contains important language requiring the Department to \nprovide additional information and program reviews to ensure adequate \ncongressional oversight and transparency of the program. I would add \nthat the Senate owes a great debt to Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who \nworked on this issue tirelessly over many months to reach this point.\n  The House bill contained language that could have been interpreted to \nauthorize the use of Fort Greely, AK, as an operational ballistic \nmissile defense site. A number of us in the Senate felt very strongly \nthat we should not authorize an operational site in violation of the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. So this language was modified in \nconference to clarify that Congress has authorized the construction of \nonly those facilities that are necessary to establish a test bed, not \nan operational missile defense site.\n  As I already mentioned, the national missile defense testing program \nis not constrained at this time by the ABM Treaty. The President's \ndecision to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty is a serious mistake \nfor our national security. It is not necessary and it is not wise.\n  As I also mentioned, I am pleased that the conference report contains \na provision from the Senate bill that would eliminate statutory \nrestrictions on the President's ability to retire unneeded U.S. nuclear \nforces. We have been fighting for this flexibility for years, and I was \ndisappointed that we had to drop a similar provision in the conference \non last year's defense bill. This conference agreement allows the \nadministration to move the United States toward lower nuclear force \nlevels contemplated under START III and below, and toward levels being \nsought by the administration.\n  This bill allows for significant savings through improved management \nin several important areas of the Defense Department. This bill \nincludes a major victory for good government and for the readiness and \ntransformation our military forces, it authorizes another round of base \nrealignment and closure. The civilian and military leadership of the \nDepartment of Defense have told us over and over again, through two \nadministrations, that DOD has excess infrastructure and needs a new \nround of base closures to free up billions in savings for higher \npriority defense needs. Senator McCain and I have been fighting for a \nnew BRAC for more than 5 years, and I am very pleased it is included in \nthis bill.\n  This bill makes several minor changes to the previous BRAC process \nand to the Senate bill. Instead of occurring in 2003 as proposed in the \nSenate bill, the new round of BRAC will, in order to obtain approval by \nthe House, occur in 2005. Even with this delay, the House held out \nuntil the last minute.\n  We also have tightened the provisions by which the base closure \ncommission can add additional facilities for closure not already \nincluded in the list proposed by the Secretary of Defense. I want to be \nvery clear about this second change. As in the past, the Secretary will \npropose to the commission for their consideration a list of \ninstallations he suggests for closure or realignment. If the commission \nwishes to add to the Secretary's list more installations for its \nconsideration, at least 7 of the 9 commissioners, a super-majority, \nmust vote to do so. However, once an additional installation is added \nfor consideration, the final recommendation on whether to close or \nrealign it will be by a simple majority vote, 5 votes, of the \ncommission, just the same as the original list. In other words, we have \nraised the preliminary hurdle for the commission to add to the \nSecretary's list installations for consideration, but the final hurdle, \nwhether to actually include that installation in the commission's \nrecommendation to Congress, will be the same for all installations and \nthe same as in previous BRACs, that is, a simple majority.\n  BRAC was by far the most difficult issue in conference, and I want to \nespecially thank Senator McCain for his leadership and Senator Warner \nfor his support on this issue. Personally, I would have preferred BRAC \nin 2003 over 2005. But I also prefer 2005 over no BRAC at all. In the \nend, those were the options. This bill is clear, there will be another \nround of base closure in 2005. This is a major victory for those who \nwant to give the Defense Department the ability to realize the \nsignificant savings that can only come from more base closures.\n\n  The bill provides for improved contract management and greater \ncompetition for the $50 billion of service contracts awarded by the \nDepartment of Defense each year. Secretary Rumsfeld has testified that \nthe Department should be able to achieve 5 percent savings across the \nboard through management improvements. We have identified a number of \nmanagement tools and strategies already in wide use in the private \nsector that should enable the Department to save billions of dollars on \nits service contracts over the next several years.\n  This bill makes the Defense Department, rather than Federal Prison \nIndustries, FPI, responsible for determining whether FPI products meet \nthe Department's needs. This means that private sector companies will \nhave an opportunity to compete with FPI for Department of Defense \ncontracts that are paid for with their tax dollars. It is fundamentally \nunfair that these companies have been denied this opportunity in the \npast, and I am delighted that we have finally been able to address this \nproblem.\n  This bill makes significant contributions to the readiness of our \nmilitary. It authorizes funding to improve the readiness of Army \naviation, including: funding for 22 Black Hawk helicopters, 10 more \nthan the administration requested; upgrades to Apache helicopters; and \nadditional TH-67 training helicopters. It authorizes $62.5 million for \nupgrades to the B-2 bomber and an additional $100 million to maintain \nthe B-1 bombers, which continue to demonstrate their effectiveness \nagainst\n\n[[Page S13125]]\n\nterrorist targets in Afghanistan. It authorizes $55 million to upgrade \nengines and reduce maintenance costs for the F-15 and F-16 aircraft.\n  The bill also adds money to increase full-time manning in the Army \nNational Guard; upgrade the Navy's electronic warfare aircraft; improve \nthe operational safety and capabilities of our test ranges and space \nlaunch facilities; and continue modernizing the training aircraft used \nby the Air Force and Navy for the training of new pilots.\n  This bill also supports the transformation of our military to a \nlighter, more lethal, more flexible force. It authorizes the request of \n$3.9 billion for the F-22, including funding to procure 13 aircraft. It \napproves the requested funding of $3.0 billion for three Arleigh Burke-\nclass destroyers, $2.3 billion for one Virginia-class attack submarine, \nand $370.8 million for one T-AKE auxiliary cargo and ammunition ship. \nIt provides the full request of more than $1.5 billion for the Joint \nStrike Fighter program. It authorizes nearly $200 million for Navy \ntransformation, including an increase of $178 million for converting \nfour excess Trident strategic missile submarines to carry Tomahawk \ncruise missiles, instead of two as requested in the budget. It \nauthorizes more than $561.3 million for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAVs, \nincluding an increase of $26 million for procurement of Predator UAVs, \nwhich have been used successfully in Afghanistan in the war on \nterrorism.\n  The conference agreement modifies the provisions that we adopted last \nyear regarding the status of training exercises by the Navy and Marine \nCorps on the Island of Vieques. It cancels the referendum on live-fire \ntraining that was required in last year's authorization bill. It also \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Navy to close the Vieques training \nrange only if the Secretary certifies to the President and Congress, \nafter reviewing the recommendations of the Chief of Naval Operations \nand the Commandant of the Marine Corps, that an alternative facility or \nfacilities will provide equivalent or superior training.\n  In view of the importance of this issue to the people of Puerto Rico, \nI would have preferred a solution that placed the decision on whether \nto close the range in the hands of the President. I believe that this \napproach would have been more likely to ensure peaceful access to the \nisland for training purposes in the long run. However, the House \nrejected this approach, and this compromise is the best outcome we \ncould achieve.\n  Included in the Conference Report Statement of Managers is an excerpt \nof a letter dated November 29, 2001, from Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz \nmaking it clear that the President prefers the approach we have taken \nin this bill. It reads:\n\n       Consistent with the commitments made by both the President \n     and Secretary England, the Navy remains committed to \n     identifying a suitable alternative and is planning to \n     discontinue training operations on the island of Vieques in \n     May of 2003, contingent upon the identification and \n     establishment of a suitable alternative. However, until a \n     suitable alternative is established, Vieques remains an \n     important element in the training of our forces deploying to \n     fight the war.\n\n  This is a strong, balanced bill. It fully funds the $343.3 billion \nfor national defense requested by the administration. It improves the \ncompensation and quality of life of our forces and their families. It \nimproves the readiness of the military services. It advances the \ntransformation of the military to lighter, more lethal and more capable \nforces. It improves the capability of the armed forces to meet \nnontraditional threats, including terrorism and unconventional means of \ndelivering weapons of mass destruction. It improves the efficiency of \nDOD programs and operations.\n  Once again, I want to thank Senator Warner, all the Members of the \nSenate and House Armed Services Committees, and the staffs of both \ncommittees for their long hours of hard work on this legislation. I \nhope the Senate will join us in passing this bill, sending it to the \nPresident for signature, and sending a strong message of support to our \nmilitary men and women now engaged in a war to defend our freedom and \nway of life.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this time. After the Senator from \nVirginia speaks, perhaps the Senator Akaka, who has been here a while, \ncan be recognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to start by thanking Chairman \nLevin, and his staff under the fine leadership of David Lyles, for the \nmanner in which they conducted this conference. It was a team effort \nfrom start to finish, and we have a good product to present to the \nSenate as a result.\n  We were all sent here by our constituents to do the people's \nbusiness, and that we have done. The conference report now before the \nSenate strengthens the President's hand in the on-going way on \nterrorism. This legislation sends a clear signal to all of the men and \nwomen in the military--from the newest private to the four-star \ngeneral--that we are clearly behind them.\n  With this legislation, we are providing critical funding and \nlegislative authorities to support the men and women defending freedom \nin Afghanistan and those on station around the world who are \nsafeguarding our liberties and who are prepared to answer the call on a \nmoments notice.\n  The conference report we are presenting to the Senate today contains \n$343.3 billion for defense--an increase of almost 11 percent over last \nyear's level. In addition, this legislation authorizes the defense \nportion of the $40 billion emergency supplemental that was proposed by \nthe President to respond to the events of September 11. Of that $40 \nbillion the Defense Department has received $13.7 billion from the \nfirst $20 billion increment, and will receive several billion more from \nthe second $20 billion--the exact amount is still the subject of an \nongoing appropriations conference.\n  As our military is engaged in an all out war against terrorism, the \nCongress is fulfilling its duty with this legislation by providing the \nfunding needed to successfully conduct that war.\n  Just 3 weeks ago, I joined Chairman Levin in visiting our military \nmen and women who are participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. We \nvisited with forces in Uzbekistan, were privileged to share \nThanksgiving dinner with some of our troops in Pakistan and with \nsailors aboard the USS Carl Vinson, from which planes are flying in \nsupport of forces in Afghanistan.\n  Our Nation can be proud of the men and women serving in our Armed \nForces. The dedication, professionalism and bravery that is being \ndisplayed at any hour of the day or night is extraordinary.\n  During our trip to the region, we spent time with a Special Forces \nteam of 11 men preparing to deeply into Afghanistan. I was struck by \nthe professionalism, courage and dedication of these soldiers. With \nimminent danger ahead, their thoughts were of mission, home, family and \ntheir uncompromising love of country. They knew they were embarking on \na critical mission, and they were ready to go.\n\n  I have had the privilege of being associated with the United States \nmilitary for over a half a century, beginning as a young sailor in the \nclosing days of World War II. I have never seen greater bravery or \ndedication or commitment in the faces of our soldiers, sailors, airmen \nand Marines. The support of the Congress and the American people is the \nonly modest recognition they hope for. That, we owe them; that they \nhave, not since the days of world War II has the nation been so united \nbehind the men and women in uniform.\n  I commend President Bush for his inspiration and leadership. During \nthe nearly 10 weeks of military operations, he has communicated his \nclear intent, and he has not wavered. The American people are united \nbehind him and behind our military.\n  It is interesting to note that, less than a year ago, the Bush \nAdministration inherited a proud armed force but one that was showing \nthe effects of a decade of underfunding and over commitment abroad. \nWhile U.S. servicemen and women performed their military missions with \ngreat dedication and professionalism, military personnel, equipment and \ninfrastructure were increasingly stressed by the effects of the \nunprecedented number of military deployments over the past decade, \ncombined with years of declining defense spending. This contributed to \nwhat General Hugh Shelton, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nreferred to as the ``strategy-resource mismatch.''\n\n[[Page S13126]]\n\n  President Bush is to be commended for the increases he has proposed \nin defense spending. Prior to September 11, the President recommended \nincreases for Defense for fiscal year 2002 totaling $38.2 billion. \nThese increases represent an almost 11 percent increases in Defense \nspending above the fiscal year 2001 amount. The amount for Defense \nrequested by the President in the emergency supplemental totals over \n$20 billion. Hopefully that additional amount will be provided as well.\n  Building on the President's solid proposal for fiscal year 2002, \nSenator Levin and I were able to conclude a conference agreement that \nis much needed by the military, particularly at this time of conflict \nwhen those in uniform and their families are facing all the dangers and \nunknowns of war. The conferees have stepped up to meet the challenges \nand to provide our Commander-in-Chief, President Bush, what is needed \nat this critical time in America's efforts in leading the world against \na common enemy--terrorism.\n  A few days ago, the President returned to the Citadel to address the \nCorp of Cadets. In his remarks, the President reaffirmed his vision for \nthe armed forces and his plan for defending the blessings of liberty \nand freedom against those who would seek to destroy them.\n  The President noted at the Citadel, ``If America wavers, the world \nwill lose heart. If America leads, the world will show its courage. \nAmerica will never waver. America will lead the world to peace.''\n  In this time of war, we must show our support for our military, our \nPresident. I thank all Senators who supported the conference report.\n  Madam President, I will remain on the floor indefinitely. We do wish \nto accommodate other colleagues. The distinguished Senator from Arizona \nis present, and at the appropriate time, we will try to accommodate our \ncolleague from Arizona.\n  I see our colleague from Hawaii. This Senator will be very happy at \nthis time to yield the floor, if he so desires to seek recognition.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Hawaii will yield for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before I leave for a moment, I beg the \nindulgence of my good friend from Virginia. I have a lot I want to say \nin a very heartfelt way about my friend from Virginia. We could not \nhave a bill without the partnership we have on that committee. The \nSenator from West Virginia was very nice in the way he phrased that. I \nwill always remember the way he gave us a bouquet tonight on a bill \nwhich he, for his own very strong principles, decided to vote against. \nI want to let my friend know, though I have to leave for a moment, I \nwill be back to say thank you to the Senator from Virginia and the \nstaffs.\n  Mr. WARNER. No thanks are necessary. It is my duty. My constituents \nsent me, and we will at some point in time resume the colloquy between \nthe chairman and myself. At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe conference report to S. 1438, the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2002. I commend Chairman Levin, \nSenator Warner, and their staff for the tremendous amount of work that \nhas resulted in this conference report. There were many difficult \nissues to resolve, and I appreciate the persistence of our chairman and \nranking member in ensuring the successful outcome of this conference \nreport.\n  In the area of readiness and management support, the conference \nreport authorizes $10.5 billion for military construction and family \nhousing programs, an increase of $528.7 million to the administration's \nbudget request. The report also includes $36 million for various \nsystems to improve accounting for spare parts inventories and \nstreamline maintenance processes. These are important steps in our \nefforts to improve the facilities in which our military personnel work \nand the housing in which they and their families live.\n  The conference report includes several provisions to improve the \nmanagement and oversight of the Department of Defense. For example, \nthere is a provision which addresses the Department's inability to \nproduce reliable financial information or auditable financial \nstatements, a long-time concern for myself and a number of my \ncolleagues. The conference report also provides for improved management \nand greater competition for the $50 billion of service contracts \nawarded by the Department of Defense each year.\n  While I am disappointed with the reductions that were made in the \noperations and maintenance accounts, I remain committed to focusing our \nefforts towards ensuring the readiness of our military services. I \nbelieve further advances in sustainment, restoration and equipment \nmaintenance are possible, in particular increasing attention to \ncorrosion prevention technologies and products. As I know from the \nmilitary facilities in Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific, maintaining \nmilitary equipment and facilities in wet, salty, and hot environments \nis a significant challenge. The conference report authorizes $27 \nmillion for equipment and testing to prevent the corrosion of military \nequipment. I look forward to continuing to address the issue of \ncorrosion in the future as its impact on readiness is significant.\n  I am pleased to note that the conference report includes an event-\ndriven implementation of the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet to ensure that \nthe program is fully tested and proven as it is introduced into the \nNavy and Marine field units.\n  I also want to highlight the provision in the conference report which \ndirects the Department of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan for \naddressing environmental problems caused by unexploded ordnance on \ncurrent and former military facilities. I believe this is very \nimportant as we continue to address the issue of encroachment and its \nimpacts on readiness and training.\n  While we have more work to do to ensure the readiness and training of \nour military, the conference report is a significant step forward. I \njoin my colleagues in supporting this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in support of the Defense \nauthorization bill and commend Senator Levin and Senator Warner for \ntheir great efforts. They have crafted a bill that will provide \nmateriel assistance and support to the men and women of our Armed \nForces.\n  This bill includes, among other things, a targeted pay raise for our \nmilitary, authority for military personnel to transfer unused \nMontgomery GI bill benefits to their dependents. This was a particular \nconcern of Senator Cleland, and he should receive particular \ncommendation for his unfailing efforts over several years to get this \nprovision enacted into law. Today it is part of the law.\n  In addition, this legislation will include a base closure round for \nthe year 2005, which is something very important, although very \ncontroversial. It is important to move from a cold war infrastructure \nto a post-cold-war infrastructure, as we have done with our personnel \nand force structure, and this legislation will do that.\n  However, today this conference report has been overshadowed by the \nPresident's announcement that he proposes to withdraw from the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty. As chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, I \nspent long hours examining and looking very closely at the \nadministration's plans for missile defense.\n  I worked closely with all my colleagues, particularly the ranking \nmember, Senator Allard of Colorado. We may have disagreed on issues, \nbut we worked together to try to ensure all the information was \navailable to our colleagues.\n  I believe the legislation we proposed in committee represented a \nsound balancing of the need to develop particularly theater missile \ndefense but also to develop national missile defense. It did so \ncognizant of the fact that to deploy such a national missile defense \nwould be violative of the ABM Treaty and would be a threat to very \ndelicate arms control agreements that have evolved over decades.\n\n  Our legislation was brought to this floor in the wake of September \n11, and in the need, in a very real sense, to provide a rallying point \nof consensus rather than an opportunity for further debate, our \nlegislation, which reduced the\n\n[[Page S13127]]\n\nappropriations for national defense by $1.3 billion, was modified \nsignificantly to give the President the option to apply this $1.3 \nbillion to ballistic missile defense or to counterterrorism. I believe \nas we look very carefully and very closely at the threats we face \ntoday, the terrorism effect is more immediate and more central to our \nconcerns of this moment. I hope the President will take that \nopportunity to apply those resources at $1.3 billion to \ncounterterrorism.\n  Today, the President's announcement has been greeted by different \nopinions in different venues. My impression is that his announcement is \nboth unwarranted and unwise. It is unwarranted because we are far away \nfrom the time that we have the technology to effectively deploy a \nnational missile defense. It is also many years before I sense that we \nneed to conduct tests that would be violative of the ABM Treaty. It is \nunwise because I think we are jeopardizing our relationship with \nRussia. Although their immediate response might be muted in some \nrespects, what we will see is less than enthusiastic cooperation on a \nwhole spectrum of cooperative efforts on which we need their help and \nassistance, from antiterrorism to the securing of their nuclear \nmaterials, to the securing of their biological materials. In this \nsense, it represents a departure from an endeavor over many decades, to \nerect a regime of arms control together with the keen awareness of our \nrelationship with Russia.\n  I believe we have plenty of time to develop, and should develop, an \nadequate system and then face the decision of deployment and the \ndecision of the treaty perhaps years from now. In October, Secretary \nRumsfeld suggested there were four potential tests that would violate \nthe treaty. As a result, he was canceling those tests. I think in fact \nthat might have been a situation where those tests easily could have \nbeen postponed and therefore the decision could have been easily \ndeferred with respect to the treaty.\n  One of the activities in question, for example, was the use of an \nAegis ship radar to observe a missile defense test, clearly in \nviolation of the ABM Treaty. The problem is the development of a sea-\nbased missile defense system is at least a decade away. As a result, to \nrush forward and try at this point to insert a test of that nature \nsuggests to me there was more interest in bumping up, as they say, \nagainst the treaty rather than bringing to the field a system that will \nwork.\n  The system that is the most advanced is the land based national \nmissile defense system. Indeed, this system, too, has plenty of room \nfor further research and development before it is necessary to go ahead \nand call into question the ABM Treaty.\n  The President today called the ABM Treaty a relic, a vestige of the \ncold war. The dynamics of world powers have definitely changed. But the \nreality is clear that nuclear weapons still are present in the world, \nthey still must be contained, their use prevented--we hope. In this \nrespect, we still have a need for a structured arms control regime, a \nstructure that I think will not be aided by the abandonment today by \nthis administration of the ABM Treaty.\n  Now, there is encouraging news. There is news that the Russians and \nthe United States may, either through treaty or by unilateral decision, \nreduce their warheads. That would be progress.\n  But I do believe we are sending a signal not just to the Russians but \nto the rest of the world that the United States is stepping back from \nmultilateral treaties and bilateral treaties which will further the \ncause of arms control. That will set not only the wrong tone but indeed \nperhaps the wrong direction.\n  The other aspect of this unilateral approach is the fact that it may \nnot provoke an immediate and demonstrable adverse reaction from Russia, \nbut as I said before, it will inhibit the kind of full-fledged \ncooperation that we need to address the more immediate threat of \nterrorism. We recognize today that Russian assistance in many ways has \nhelped immensely in our struggle in Afghanistan. The use of their \nintelligence sources and the fact that they have, in an economic sense, \ncontinued to produce petroleum so that energy prices remain low are \nexamples of their cooperative efforts.\n  I ask whether or not, given our unilateral withdrawal, given our \nunwillingness to continue a dialogue with respect to treaty \nmodifications, would essentially undercut other areas of cooperation \nthat, I argue, also are extremely necessary.\n  The proliferation of nuclear materials, the presence of vast stocks \nof biologic materials--all of these within Russia and all of these with \nquestionable security mechanisms--raise a profound issue of our \nsecurity. This afternoon in our committee we had a hearing with respect \nto the control of our nuclear weapons, and we have elaborate \nprocedures, expensive procedures. I suggest the Russians probably do \nnot match us with those procedures but they should. That is an example \nof cooperation we have to undertake immediately, cooperation that might \nbe undercut.\n  China has expressed concern--another area we have to consider--in \nterms of their ability to deploy more missiles, to provide more \nsophisticated warheads with more penetrating aids, with more decoys, \nthose things that will make the world less stable, the nuclear balance \nless stable.\n  I believe we have, today, taken the wrong path. Rather than \ncontinuing to work for a structure of arms control agreements, we have \nturned away from that structure. I hope the President not only \nrecognizes perhaps the arguments we are making this evening, but truly \nworks to reach out to try to develop more cooperative efforts with \nRussia that are to our mutual advantage; also, that we would recognize \nwe still have an obligation to develop a structure of arms control \nagreements that will make the world safer.\n  The decision today to withdraw is, again, in my view, unwarranted by \nthe circumstances and unwise. I believe in the long run it will not aid \nmaterially our security.\n  I hope the provisions we have included in this legislation that \nprovide for overview of the Ballistic Missile Defense Program, that \nprovide the option to use funds not only for ballistic missile defense \nbut for counter-terrorism, will be used by the administration to pursue \nthose aspects of counterterrorism and also a prudent development \nprogram for ballistic missile defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our good friend from Rhode Island is a valued member of \nour committee, very hard working, very industrious. I expect it will be \nthat situation for an indefinite period as the years roll by. He had a \ndistinguished military career himself, a graduate of West Point.\n  But I do have a few differences of view. And my good friend, the \nchairman, utilized these same key phrases I keep hearing. That is, we \nhave a greater threat to our Nation from trucks, ships, or an airline \nthat might bring in a missile or some type of nuclear device. We are \nputting so much money on missile defense at the time ``when it is the \nleast likely means of delivery.''\n  I say to my friend, I listened carefully, but you don't rule out the \npossibility that someone could fire in anger but a single missile.\n  That is the fallacy that I find in this argument. They do not rule \nout, they do not address the possibility, that but a single missile \nwould come in and in all probability that missile would cause \ndevastation far greater than a device that perhaps was conveyed by a \ntruck or otherwise.\n  So I think I just cannot accept the arguments, that concept of the \n``least likely'' would deter this President or any President from \nproceeding toward a system to protect us against an attack by a limited \nnumber of missiles. That is all this President has asked repeatedly in \nhis short term since he has been President. That is what he is asking. \nI hope Congress eventually delivers on that request by our President.\n  Then there is a second argument; that is, suppose a nation possessed \nnuclear weapons which potentially they could use against us. They might \nnot fire the weapon. But as our President might be deploying our forces \nto a region of the world, perhaps not unlike what we are doing in \nAfghanistan with a coalition of other nations, the threat could come: \nIf you deploy a single member of the Armed Forces of the\n\n[[Page S13128]]\n\nUnited States in an effort to deter or, indeed, engage an enemy on a \nforeign land, which enemy is acting against an ally or friendly country \nor in any way inimical to the cause of freedom, that missile could be \nused as a threat against our President. A single missile could make a \ndramatic change in the ability of a President, as Commander in Chief of \nour Armed Forces, to make a decision on a deployment.\n  So perhaps at some point those Senators who have spoken against this \ncould answer the two questions that I leave pending at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as our distinguished colleague from \nAlabama desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and I thank Senator Warner for \nyielding time to me. It has been a tremendous experience for me to \nserve on the Armed Services Committee--over 3 years now, under the \nleadership of Senator Warner and now Senator Levin. It has been a \npleasure to watch how the committee operates. On occasion, we have \ndisagreements, but the committee works with such good grace and harmony \nand a generalized interest in what is best for America that I think it \nhas been a good example for other committees.\n  Senator Levin, I thank you for your consistent courtesy, your \nbrilliant leadership; and Senator Warner, thank you for your leadership \non this bill and in the past as chairman of the committee, now as \nranking member.\n  I am generally very pleased with this legislation. Essentially, as I \nsee it, we had about a $30 billion increase in expenditures planned in \nour budget item as we came forward this year over last year in actual \nappropriations dollars. Then we had a supplemental. Then we had the $20 \nbillion supplemental that we passed after September 11. We are looking \nat a pretty significant increase in defense spending. Some of that, of \ncourse, is going to homeland defense that we were not expecting to \nspend just a few months ago, but essentially we have a nice increase in \ndefense.\n  Our fundamental problem has been, as one of President Clinton's \nservice secretaries said, we are in a death spiral in many aspects of \nour defense because we are carrying equipment--aircraft, ships, \nmilitary vehicles--that are so old, it costs more to operate and \nmaintain than is really justified. We really need to leap forward to a \nnew generation of equipment, but we do not have the money to do that, \nand it is draining us in a lot of different ways.\n\n  But we made some progress this year and last year, with great pay \nraises, or at least significantly above the inflation rate for our men \nand women in uniform, trying to make sure they know we affirm them and \nthe service they are rendering. We did that prior to September 11, and \nI think there is an even stronger feeling in America today of \nappreciation for our men and women in uniform and a respect for the job \nthey do.\n  I feel pretty good about where we are going. We know the Army needs \nto transform itself. That is not an inexpensive process. We have not \ngiven it enough money to transform itself. For each year that I have \nbeen on the Armed Services Committee, we have been talking about the \nchallenge, making sure the Army is capable of doing basically the very \nkind of things we are doing in Afghanistan today. We configured that \nArmy to meet the Soviet Union and their vast capability and large \nstanding Army and heavy equipment that they had, to confront them on \nthe plains of Europe. But we do not have that threat in the same degree \ntoday that we did then.\n  So everybody who has given serious thought to the situation knows we \nought to be moving toward an Army that can respond to the various kinds \nof threats we are likely to be seeing in the world today. If we can do \nthat, we would have served our country well.\n  I do not think we have traveled far enough down that road, frankly. \nIt has been impressive, however, to see that we continue to modernize, \ncontinue to exploit the technological advantage this country has in the \nworld, and our ability to project power in a systematic way. I believe \nour modernization has caused the least possible damage to the defense \nrelated industrial sectors of this Nation in the process, and our \nability to encourage innovation in these sectors while being smarter \nwith our funding has increased dramatically.\n  It has been an extraordinary effort that is being carried on in \nAfghanistan. It points out anew that we need to continue that \ntransformation. We need to continue to bring on aircraft that is \nunmanned in larger numbers, to continue to improve our smart bombs, \nsmart missile capability, and to do it in a way that is most effective \nin different types of conflicts into which we might be entering.\n  I believe this bill has progressed in those areas, for which I am \nvery delighted. One of the issues that we did have a dispute about and \ndebate about in the committee was what to do about an anti-ballistic \nmissile system in our country. I have been a real strong believer that \nthis country needs a ballistic missile defense system, that we have \ndawdled too long, and it is time to move forward.\n  This Congress voted 94-to-3 to deploy an anti-ballistic missile \nsystem as soon as technologically feasible several years ago. President \nClinton signed that legislation. I thought that pretty much settled it.\n  But we have had a good bit of debate since. President Clinton put in \n$5 billion for ballistic missile defense this year in his budget \nrequest before he left office. Under President Bush, that figure was \nraised $3 billion, to $8 billion.\n\n  That is an increase he felt very strongly about. That was an increase \nthat reflected an interest of his that was very important. He \ncampaigned on it. He said he wanted to do it. He has suggested ever \nsince he was elected, and even before he was elected, that we ought to \neither negotiate a new treaty with Russia, or we ought to take \nadvantage of the provisions in the treaty that allows him to get out of \nthe treaty. Today I am pleased to see that he made the decision to \nremove the United States from that treaty.\n  Let me share a few things about this that I think are very important. \nWe signed a treaty with the Soviet Union in 1972, with an ``evil \nempire'' that no longer exists. We now have a healthy, positive, \ngrowing, developing relationship with Russia--a country with which we \nwant to continue to grow and develop our relationship. That old treaty \nin 1972 was no foundation for a relationship. The treaty only dealt \nwith an ABM system. It only prohibited both countries from establishing \nan ABM system. It didn't develop a relationship of any significance \nbetween the countries. It was only a few pages. It only dealt \nexclusively with the details of prohibiting us from developing a \nballistic missile defense and the Soviet Union from building one. It \nwas a good idea at the time. Nobody had missiles but the United States \nand Russia, and perhaps our allies in Europe. We didn't feel threats \nfrom anyone but each other.\n  We had mutual assured destruction. So we agreed that neither country \nwould expend billions of dollars to develop a system that really \nwouldn't be effective against the massive amount of missiles that each \ncountry had.\n  But now something has changed. Other nations have missiles. Lots of \nother nations have missiles. And they are buying more on the market \ntoday. We know the story of North Korea. We know about Iran's effort. \nWe know other countries are expanding their ability to develop \nballistic missile systems.\n  Thus, I think that leaves us in a vulnerable position. We are in an \nironic position, if you think about it, by prohibiting this Nation from \nbuilding a missile defense system to protect us from other hostile \nnations on the basis of a treaty from 1972 with a nation that no longer \nexists.\n  I don't believe Russia has any right--certainly no moral right and no \nlegal right--to ask the United States to keep itself, as Henry \nKissinger said, vulnerable to attack because of that old treaty. They \nhave no right under the generally recognized rules of international \nrelations to ask a nation to leave itself vulnerable to serious attack \nbecause of this old treaty.\n  The President said he wants a new relationship with Russia. We are \ngoing to move forward, with a great new future between us. But I am not \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S13129]]\n\nsit here and allow these United States to be vulnerable to attack from \nKorea, Iran, or any other nation that may acquire a nuclear missile and \nleave our people subject to attack.\n  As Senator Warner said, it is a real problem, because a President may \nbe eyeball to eyeball with some smaller nation and that nation may have \na missile capable of hitting Los Angeles, New York, or Miami. They say: \nMr. President, you move against us like you moved against Afghanistan \nand like you moved against Iraq--let us say that Iraq had one of these \nmissiles, or half a dozen that could reach the United States and Mr. \nSaddam Hussein said, Mr. President, you move against us; I am launching \nmy missiles immediately. Do not move against us. We don't want the \nPresident to be in that position, knowing he has no defense whatsoever \nagainst that kind of attack when we have the capability of building a \ndefense to that attack.\n\n  I think we have made some great progress. I salute President Bush. I \nsalute his National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who from the \nbeginning of this administration has understood quite clearly the \nimportance of moving beyond the ABM Treaty to a new relationship with \nRussia, but at the same time protecting us from attack from who knows \nwhat may occur in the years to come.\n  The bipartisan commission that was chaired by now-Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld concluded we would be vulnerable to that kind of \nattack by 2005. To have a national missile defense system in place by \n2005, you have to get started on it. We may have ups and downs as we go \nforward.\n  But this movement by the President is in the right direction. We are \nmoving away from this old relationship with Russia to a new \nrelationship. We are now going to be able to build a missile defense \nsystem that is the best effective defense of America without having to \nconfigure it, to manipulate it to fit within this treaty's limitations. \nThey were trying to develop a system that would fit within the very \nstrict confines of this treaty.\n  I don't believe that was wise. It would be more costly. The system \nwould be less effective than otherwise would be the case.\n  We are doing the right thing by withdrawing from the ABM treaty. We \nare doing the right thing in following President Bush's suggestion that \nwe increase spending for ballistic missile defense system.\n  As I indicated, we have about $60 billion in increased defense \nspending this year. President Bush simply asked for $3 billion more \nthan did President Clinton. That is not going to break the bank.\n  Don't let anybody tell you that by building a national missile \ndefense system we don't have money to transform the Army, or we don't \nhave money to buy high-tech weaponry, or we don't have money to do \nother things. In the scheme of things, this extra $3 billion is not the \nback breaker to any one program when we have a $330-plus billion \ndefense budget.\n  Also, I am pleased to see one of the finest Senators on the floor, \nSenator Cochran. It was his legislation, I believe with Senator \nLieberman, that we passed overwhelmingly in this body 97- to-3 to \ndeploy a national missile defense system as soon as was technologically \nfeasible. He led that effort. He was ahead of his time.\n  I am sure he has every right to feel today that through that effort \nour Nation is moving on to a new day, geared more to the real threats \nthat we face. I was pleased to support him in that effort, and Senator \nLieberman. They were on the right track.\n  I believe the President has shown consistent courage throughout this \neffort. There were a lot of people who said the Europeans are not going \nto go for this, the Senate is not going to go for this, and the \nRussians are not going to go for this.\n  I know the Russians knew we wanted to get out of the treaty, but they \nknow it does not threaten them for us to get out of this treaty. They \nwould like to see us maybe make some concessions on some other \narrangements in order to justify them giving up a little here. I will \nnot call it extortion, but they are trying to deal with us on this \nissue.\n  I am glad the President worked with them openly. He worked with this \nCongress openly. He worked with the American people openly. He \ncampaigned on a national missile defense system. He has never waffled \non it. President Clinton's was an unwise policy of claiming that he \nreally wasn't building a national missile defense system, but just \ndoing some research on it. We were testing it and doing things that \nwere leading to the point where we were actually in violation of the \ntreaty. A good lawyer could assert that.\n  President Bush has been honest from day 1. He said we have to get out \nof this treaty. We can't keep on being clever and manipulative about \nthe wording of it while intending to build a national missile defense \nsystem. The treaty prohibits the building of a national missile defense \nsystem. If it says anything at all, it says you cannot build a national \nmissile defense system.\n\n  The President's policy and the Congress' policy was to build a \nnational missile defense system. So we couldn't play games forever with \nthis treaty. It was time to put it out on the table. I salute him for \nbiting the bullet on it. I believe it is the right step forward. I am \nhopeful that it will result in improving our ability to act in the \nworld, giving the President some confidence that he does not have to be \nworried every minute that some missile might, by accident, be launched, \nor some small rogue nation might launch an attack on us.\n  Again, I salute our leaders, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, and \nall the members of the committee for their hard work. We made some real \nprogress this year. I hope that we can continue it next year. If we \nhave a disciplined, longtime approach to our defense spending, we can \nrecapitalize the military, we can transform the Army, we can continue \nthe high-tech improvements in our Air Force, Navy and Marine forces and \narmaments, and make sure we are always ahead of the game.\n  We never want our men and women in combat fighting on behalf of the \nUnited States of America put in the same position that those soldiers \nof Iraq were in when they were being attacked on the road as they were \nretreating out of Kuwait. That is the kind of thing that this Nation \nmust never allow to happen.\n  I believe we are doing the right things. We could use some more \nspending, but we are making progress. I am pleased to support this \nbill, and I thank our leadership for bringing it to pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I wish to thank our colleague \nfrom Alabama. He is a very valued member of our committee. I say to the \nSenator, we thank you very much for your work throughout this year to \nmake this bill possible and for your very thoughtful comments about the \nchairman and myself.\n  Madam President, I yield such time to the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi as he so desires.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Mississippi yield for just 30 \nseconds?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also thank our friend from Alabama for making a major \ncontribution as the ranking member on the Seapower Subcommittee. We \nthank him for that effort. We thank him for his kind remarks in this \nChamber. We have a very fundamental disagreement as to the way in which \nthe ABM Treaty has been unilaterally withdrawn from, but that has not \nstopped us from having a very cordial, collegial relationship, or me \nthanking him for that contribution he makes to our committee. I thank \nthe Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, let me first thank the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia for yielding time to me on this conference \nreport. And I commend the Senator from Alabama for his excellent, \npersuasive statement in support of the President's actions that he \nannounced he was taking today to give notice that under the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty of 1972, the United States was withdrawing \nfrom that treaty. It took a lot of courage for the President to \nannounce that today.\n  It has taken a lot of insight and hard work for the Senator from \nAlabama to rise to the position of leadership that he has in the \nSenate, on not only an\n\n[[Page S13130]]\n\nissue such as missile defense but on the wide range of issues that come \nbefore the Armed Services Committee on which he has served so \neffectively, and in a way that has reflected great credit on the Senate \nand on the State of Alabama.\n  I appreciate the kind remarks he has made about my efforts on the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999, to which he referred in his \nremarks. There were a lot of people, a lot of Senators personally and \nactively involved in that effort. He was one of them. He was right at \nthe forefront of the effort to convince the Senate we needed to pass \nthat legislation, that we needed to state it as a matter of national \npolicy and have it in a statute that it is the policy of the United \nStates to deploy a missile defense system that will protect the United \nStates, the territory of the United States, and the citizens of the \nUnited States from ballistic missile attack. And that is on the books.\n  This committee has also provided leadership in ensuring that \nauthorities were given under this bill to the President to proceed to \ncarry out that policy.\n  We have, in this conference report, $8.3 billion that is authorized \nfor use by the administration to develop, to conduct research, to test \nin the missile defense programs that are underway now, to achieve the \ngoals of not only the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 but the \nother responsibilities that the Commander in Chief has to protect \ndeployed forces around the world from theater missile attack. They are \nalready in the hands of adversaries around the world--Scud missiles \nother advanced missile systems--that threaten American forces that are \ndeployed around the world.\n  We are at the point now of actually putting in the field defenses \nagainst these ballistic missiles. These are shorter range missiles. \nThey are not ICBMs, and they do not travel as fast as ICBMs. But the \nArmy has this program, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense. The \nacronym is THAAD, but it is not named for me.\n  The point I am making about that program is that it has been proven \neffective. It works. The tests have been phenomenally successful. There \nhave been a series of tests with a missile hitting a missile to defend \nagainst and knock down an attack from these missile systems that would \nthreaten our forces in the field. Those programs have proven that the \ndefense against missiles is possible by using interceptor missiles to \nknock them down.\n  We were heartened just recently when a missile was fired from \nVandenberg Air Force Base and intercepted from Kwajalein. We saw that \neffectively tested so that the missile hit its target, traveling at \nhigh rates of speed, way up in the atmosphere. It is phenomenal what \nthe research scientists have been able to accomplish in this area.\n  When President Bush was running for President, he told the American \npeople, as Senator Sessions pointed out, that he was in favor of \ndeveloping and deploying a national missile defense system. He \nacknowledged there was an impediment to doing that, and that impediment \nwas a treaty the United States entered into in 1972 with the Soviet \nUnion, saying that neither would deploy a national missile defense \nsystem, except in one case: to protect a civilian population center or \nto protect an offensive capability. Those are the missiles that could \nbe launched against the other side.\n  The United States decided to deploy an ABM system back then. And the \nSenate grudgingly approved it. It was in the process of being deployed, \nand they changed their mind and withdrew the authority for actual \ndeployment of an ABM system that would protect our silos and missiles \nin the Dakotas. That is what we were going to protect.\n  The Russians, on the other hand, decided to deploy their system that \nwas legal under the treaty to protect Moscow. And that system is still \nin place. People wonder: Why would you want to deploy an ABM system. \nWell, Russia did. Russia deployed the system, and they still have it. \nIt is still there. So they must think they have an effective, workable \nmissile defense system in place.\n  So those who wonder whether it is possible to have a system that is \nworkable and effective, look at that example, and look at theater \nmissile systems that we have deployed, that we are deploying, and we \nhave tested effectively, and then the series of tests for the system \nthat has been under development here in the United States.\n  So what I want to do is simply point out how important the decision \nis to our national security interests that the President has made. By \nending the participation of the United States in this obsolete \nagreement--the ABM Treaty--President Bush has removed one of the \ncentral obstacles to ensuring the security of our homeland.\n  The President's actions come as no surprise. It should not surprise \nanyone either in the United States or our friends and allies around the \nworld. At the beginning of his election campaign, President Bush made \nclear that he was determined to defend the United States from the \nthreat of ballistic missile attack and that it was his belief that the \nABM Treaty posed an unacceptable obstacle to doing this.\n  So with this action, the President is doing what he said he would do \nif it was necessary. He has made every effort to explain his views and \nhis intentions to Russian leadership and to outline his plans for our \nfriends and other allies around the world.\n  Since taking office, he and his senior officials have missed no \nopportunity to engage their Russian counterparts on the subject of \nmissile defense. They have labored to convey the President's commitment \nto defending this Nation, the urgency of the threat, and the pressing \nneed to move beyond the ABM Treaty.\n  Over this past year, the issue has been discussed frequently at the \nhighest levels of the United States and Russian Governments. The \nGovernment of Russia has refused to cooperate in an effort to reconcile \nnew security needs with this outdated treaty. Therefore, the President \nhas been given little choice but to proceed as he has. He deserves \ngreat credit not only for his determination to defend our country but \nfor his patience in attempting to resolve this disagreement by arriving \nat a new mutually satisfactory arrangement with Russia.\n  Much work remains to be done though. We have to determine which \ntechnologies are most effective, and we have to produce and deploy \nthem. This work must be pursued with a sense of urgency.\n  For the first time in 30 years, the United States will be able to \ndevelop and field the best technology available to protect our citizens \nfrom missile attack, instead of being artificially constrained by an \noutdated and counterproductive arms control agreement. America's \nscientists, engineers, and policymakers will finally be free to work \ntoward a missile defense that responds to the threat, rather than fear \nof violating an outdated set of rules that prohibited testing of new \ntechnologies.\n  Some have predicted the sky will fall if the United States exercises \nits right to withdraw from this agreement and that the relationship \nbetween the United States and Russia will suffer irreparable harm from \nsuch an action. Some surely will be renewing such claims. Some have \ntoday, and in the days ahead we will hear these remarks. But before \nbecoming overwrought, it might be helpful to note what the President of \nRussia said about this during his recent visit to the United States. \nAsked about the conflict between the United States and Russia over the \nABM Treaty, President Putin said this:\n\n       Given the nature of the relationship between the United \n     States and Russia, one can rest assured that whatever final \n     solution is found, it will not threaten or put to threat the \n     interests of both of our countries and of the world.\n\n  On September 11, ironically, the deputy chief of the Russian General \nStaff, Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, said this:\n\n       I can assure you that our relations will be continuing \n     regardless of whether the U.S. withdraws from the ABM treaty \n     or not. [It] will not affect these relations of trust.\n\n  President Bush has successfully moved us beyond the cold war. He has \nmade it clear that he will not tolerate a relationship between our two \nnations whose most fundamental basis is the threat of mutual \nannihilation and whose currency is fear, suspicion, and mistrust. The \nPresident has said he wants a new relationship with Russia, not one \nmarked by the deadly themes of a dangerous and bygone era. His decision \nto leave the ABM Treaty is a significant step in building that new\n\n[[Page S13131]]\n\nrelationship, and the words of President Putin make it equally clear \nthat Russia also wants a new relationship with the United States.\n  The debate over whether the United States should remain in the ABM \nTreaty is now over. As we move forward with the development and testing \nof missile defense programs, we should support our President and help \nhim implement this important element of our homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend our distinguished colleague from Mississippi. I \nwas the author of the Missile Defense Act of 1991. He was the author of \nthe Missile Defense Act of 1999. We came to the Senate together, my \ndistinguished colleague from Mississippi one number senior to me in \nthis institution. I am always very respectful of that.\n\n  I wonder if I might engage my colleague and suggest he delivered his \nremarks with such eloquence and such authority that those who may not \nhave followed this issue as closely as he and I and others don't \nrealize that the ABM Treaty wouldn't let us utilize our developing \ntechnology in space. We couldn't build any part of the system up in \nspace. We couldn't build any part of the system on the sea, \nincorporating the use of the U.S. Navy as platforms. Those are the \nthings that our President took into consideration. We have one of the \nfinest navies in the world. The American taxpayers have put enormous \nsums of money into that Navy. Yet we cannot use a single ship for that \npurpose.\n  I wonder if the Senator would detail some of the things that the ABM \nTreaty blocked which have now enabled our President and our Nation to \nmove forward and utilize that technology. I remember in this debate \nyears ago I used to explain that it would be more efficient, quicker, \nand less costly to the taxpayer to utilize these options which now \nfinally are going to be on the table in 6 months.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nresponse, I appreciate very much his kind remarks about my efforts on \nthis issue.\n  He is absolutely correct. The effect of the ABM Treaty has been to \ndeny the United States the legal right to test technologies, not only \nradars that are aboard ships, such as the Aegis fire control system \nradar, but also space-based elements such as sensors that could assist \nin making sure the system was effective, that it was workable, and that \nit did what we hoped it would do, and that was knock an incoming \nmissile down before it struck the United States.\n  Just recently, as an example, Secretary Rumsfeld announced that some \ntests that had been planned on this program development schedule were \nbeing canceled because to undertake the tests as planned and as needed \nfor this system would violate the terms and the understanding we have \nhad with Russia since the treaty was ratified, the ABM Treaty. There \nwere demarcation agreements that were agreed to in the Clinton \nadministration that limited the testing programs we were undertaking. \nAll of that now is set aside.\n  When the notice the President gives becomes effective, the notice of \nintent to withdraw, we will then be able to resume tests that had \npreviously been scheduled that we couldn't undertake without violating \nthe treaty. The President was forthright and honest about it. He wasn't \ntrying to hide our violations or get away with something that was \nprohibited under the treaty. He was acknowledging that he couldn't \nproceed because he didn't want to violate the treaty. He didn't want to \nbreak the law. And treaties have the force and effect of law.\n  The Senator from Virginia is absolutely correct in the effect that \nthat treaty was having on our ability to proceed as we had authorized, \nas we had planned, in conformity with a policy that had been adopted by \nthe Congress and signed by the previous President.\n  His leadership and the efforts of Senator Levin, too, in helping to \nensure that this conference report contains authorities and \nauthorization for appropriations that will help us defend our homeland \nsecurity are things for which we should all express our appreciation. I \ndo that tonight with great thanks.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, just one further comment: \nUnderstandably, there are those who disagree with the President, and \nthey have accused him of a violation, but the Senator has correctly \npointed out, the President was faced with, Do I move forward and break \nthe law or do I comply with the terms of the treaty which are explicit? \nHe gave notice of withdrawal in 6 months. He chose to stay within the \nterms of the treaty, and he in no way violated the law. Am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is absolutely correct in pointing that out. \nThat is another mark of the strong leadership the President has \nprovided on this issue. He has made everybody understand what the real \nproblems were and why this treaty was outdated, why we needed to move \nbeyond, why it was a relic of the cold war. And given the threats as \nthey are emerging and exist today, we couldn't be safe confronting the \nnew emerging missile capabilities from many countries all around the \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me very briefly say to my good friend \nfrom Mississippi, we have debated the question of whether or not this \ncountry should unilaterally withdraw from the ABM Treaty and whether \nthat would make us more or less secure probably on half a dozen \noccasions. I have always enjoyed those debates. We have always enjoyed \neach other's company, even though we are on different sides of that \nissue. It has been my feeling--and I have expressed it in a statement \ntoday and on the floor earlier tonight--that we will be less secure as \na result of unilaterally withdrawing from an arms control treaty. It is \ngoing to unleash negative forces, measures, countermeasures. We are \ngoing to find, I am afraid, in my judgment, that we are going to have a \ndangerous action/reaction cycle which is going to be precipitated. \nDefensive technologies are going to make us less secure because of the \neffort of other countries to overcome those technologies. We are going \nto have to try to overcome their efforts. We have debated that many \ntimes. The President has unilaterally given notice, and we are not \ngoing to have too many more of these debates. We will miss them because \nwe have had fun doing this together.\n\n  Nonetheless, that is where we are. I think everybody agrees that the \nsecurity of this Nation comes first. If I thought for 1 minute that \nwithdrawing from this treaty unilaterally would make us more secure, I \nwould recommend that we withdraw from this treaty. I think it leaves us \nless secure. If I thought it would make us more secure, I would not \nhesitate. I think everybody here has the goal to make us more secure.\n  We have had differences, also, on the Missile Defense Act of 1999. \nThe good Senator from Mississippi quotes section 1 of that act. There \nwere two sections to that act, which I always point out. Nonetheless, \nwe are now past that point.\n  I wish to very briefly take up other parts of this bill, including \none in which Senator Reid has been so involved. I want to get to that \npoint immediately because he is in the Chamber now. I want to pay \ntribute to the effort he has made to try to end what is a real \nunfairness in our law. The unfairness is that our disabled veterans are \nnot permitted to receive both retired pay and VA disability \ncompensation. This is something that is unique to our veterans--that \nthey are not able to receive both the retired pay plus the disability \ncompensation, which they have been awarded. It sounds unusual to say \none is ``awarded'' compensation for disability.\n  We had a provision in the Senate bill to address this inequity. We \nwould have allowed our disabled veterans, as others in the Federal \nGovernment employ and others in society, to receive both retirement and \ndisability pay. The House leadership was not willing to have a vote on \nthe budget point of order, which would have been made, which would have \nauthorized this benefit to be paid. So we were left with no \nalternative.\n  Senator Warner and I were both there in conference, day after day. We \npointed out that Senator Harry Reid has been a champion on this, and \nthere\n\n[[Page S13132]]\n\nare others in this body who have pointed out the inequity in the \nprovision that prohibits the receipt of both retired pay and disability \ncompensation.\n  At the end, we could not persuade the House to include this provision \nand have a point of order contested in the House. So what we ended up \nwith was something a lot less than what we hoped we would get, and that \nis the authorization for these payments to be made, the authorization \nto end the unfairness, but it would still require an appropriation in \norder to fund them.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I basically want to spread across the \nRecord of this Senate my appreciation to the chairman and ranking \nmember for the advocacy on behalf of the American veterans regarding \nthis issue. This is basic fairness. Why should somebody retired from \nthe military, who has a disability pension from the U.S. military, not \nbe able to draw both? If that person retired from the Department of \nEnergy, he could do both.\n  We have debated this, and there is overwhelming support from the \nSenate. It is late at night, but I want the Record to be spread with \nthe fact that I deeply appreciate, as do the veterans, your advocacy. I \nwant the Record to also be very clear that the Senate of the United \nStates has stood up for this. The House refused to go along with us.\n  Also, I feel some sadness in my heart because we are going to come \nback and do this next year. Sadly, next year there are going to be \nabout 500,000 less World War II veterans. They are dying at the rate of \nabout 1,000 a day. So people who deserve this and would be getting this \nduring this next year will not because the average age of World War II \nveterans is about 79 years now. So there is some heaviness in my heart.\n  We are going to continue with this. I don't want anybody in the House \nof Representatives to run and hide because there is no place to hide. \nThis was killed by the House. For the third time, I appreciate Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner.\n  So although I support the conference report for H.R. 3338, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, I feel a sense \nof disappointment.\n  Once again this year, the conference report failed to include a \nprovision on an issue that I have been passionately working on for the \nlast couple of years. Namely, the concurrent receipt of military \nretired pay and VA disability compensation.\n  Unbelievably, military retirees are the only group of federal \nretirees who must waive retirement pay in order to receive VA \ndisability compensation.\n  Put simply, if a veteran refuses to give up their retirement pay, the \nveteran must forfeit their disability benefits.\n  My provision addresses this 110-year-old injustice against over 560 \nthousand of our nation's veterans.\n  It is sad that 300-400 thousand veterans die every year. I repeat: \n300,000-400,000 veterans die every year. They will never be paid the \ndebt owed by America to its disabled veterans.\n  To correct this injustice, on January 24th of this year, I introduced \nS. 170, the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001.\n  My bill embodies a provision that permits retired members of the \nArmed Forces who have a service connected disability to receive \nmilitary retirement pay while also receiving veterans' disability \ncompensation.\n  The list of 75 cosponsors clearly illustrates bipartisan support for \nthis provision in the Senate.\n  My legislation is very similar to H.R. 303, which has 378 cosponsors \nin the House. I'm thankful to Congressman Bilirakis, who has been a \nvocal advocate for concurrent receipt in the House for over fifteen \nyears.\n  My legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service \norganizations, including the Military Coalition, the National Military/\nVeterans Alliance, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the \nUniformed Services Disabled Retirees.\n  In October, I introduced an amendment identical to S. 170 for the \nSenate Defense Authorization bill. The Senate adopted my amendment by \nunanimous consent.\n  Unfortunately, the House chose not to appropriate funds for this \nimportant measure.\n  This meant that the fate of my amendment would be decided in a \n``faceless'' conference committee.\n  It pains me deeply to see that my amendment was removed in \nconference.\n  This is an old game played in Congress in which members vote for an \namendment to help veterans, knowing full well the amendment will be \nremoved at a later time.\n  When will decency replace diplomacy and politics when it comes to the \ntreatment of America's veterans.\n  Why won't members of the House of Representatives join their Senate \ncolleagues and right this wrong?\n  Why can't we do our duty and let disabled veterans receive \ncompensation for their years of service and disability compensation for \ntheir injuries?\n  We gather at a solemn moment in the history of our great Nation.\n  On September 11th, terrorists landed a murderous blow against the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n  Right away, we saw the men and women of our Armed Forces placed on \nthe highest level of alert. American troops then deployed to the center \nof the storm, set to strike against the enemies of all civilized \npeople.\n  Our Nation is once again calling upon the members of the U.S. Armed \nForces to defend democracy and freedom. They will be called upon to \nconfront the specter of worldwide terrorism.\n  They will be called upon to make sacrifices.\n  In some tragic cases, they will be seriously injured or even die.\n  Most believe that a grateful government meets all the needs of its \nveterans, no questions asked.\n  I am sad to say this is not the case today.\n  I will continue this fight until we correct this injustice once and \nfor all.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator Reid. He has been a champion of this \ncause. He has fought harder than anybody I know to end this inequity. \nThe House leadership simply would not go along with this. We had a \nchoice: We would either have a bill or no bill. That is what this \nfinally came down to.\n  I believe Senator Reid got something like 75 cosponsors for his \nprovision. The Senate overwhelmingly supported this provision. I hope \nwe have better luck next year in the House.\n  In the meantime, what we have done is we have authorized this, and \nperhaps our Appropriations Committee will be able to find the means to \nfund this. But until next year, I am afraid the number of veterans you \nhave pointed out--perhaps 1,000 a day--will not get the benefits they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. REID. I am on the Appropriations Committee. I will work toward \nthat. I do want the Record to reflect my overwhelming support for this \nlegislation. I feel badly this provision is not in it, but this is a \nfine piece of legislation on which the two of you have worked so hard.\n  Mr. WARNER. I also thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Reid, \nfor his leadership on this issue. We speak of a disabled veteran. I \nhave had a lifetime of association with the men and women in the U.S. \nmilitary. In my military career, I was not a combat veteran. But I \nserved with many who have lost arms, legs, and lives. Those \nindividuals, when they go into combat and lose their limbs, or suffer \ninjuries, are somewhat reduced in their capacity to compete in the \nmarketplace for jobs and do all of the things they would like to do as \na father with their children and their families.\n  I take this very personally. I feel that some day the three of us--\nand indeed I think this Chamber strongly supports it--will overcome and \nget this legislation through. I thank the Senator for his leadership. \nHe is right that the World War II veterans have died at a 1,000, 1,200, \nsometimes 1,400 a day, and many of those are being penalized by this \nparticular law. So I thank the Senator and I thank my chairman. We \nshall renew our effort early next year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to say one thing publicly. I want to again thank \nSenator Warner. As he often points out, we came at the same time to \nthis body. I have been blessed by having him as a partner and a ranking \nmember for the short few months I have been chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. Nobody could have asked for a better partner than I \nhave had in Senator\n\n[[Page S13133]]\n\nWarner. There are times, of course, that we don't agree with each \nother, but there has never been a time I can remember in 23 years where \nwe don't trust each other.\n  There is nothing more important in this body than to be able to look \nsomebody in the eye and say that. That is something I feel very keenly. \nOur staffs have been extraordinary in their work. This has been a very \ndifficult bill.\n  In addition to thanking Senator Warner personally, I thank our staffs \nfor the work they have done. Every night when I call David Lyles--every \nnight--he is there with the staff until 10 or 11 o'clock. I do not even \ncall him after 11 o'clock because that is when I go to bed, or at least \nI try to. I am pretty sure he stays on after that. I know it is true \nwith Senator Warner's great staff, too.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my great chairman. He succeeded \nme as chairman. We just moved one seat at the table in our committee \nhearing room. I guess that was the only change. Of course, other things \ntook place.\n  As he says, the trust is there, the respect is there. We travel. We \njust finished an extraordinary trip. We were the first two Members of \nCongress to go into the area of operations in Afghanistan, having \nvisited our troops in Uzbekistan, our troops in Pakistan and Oman, and \nthen on up into the Bosnia region where we visited our respective \nNational Guards who are serving there now.\n  I value our friendship. I look forward to hopefully many more years \nworking together. I thank my friend. We shall carry forward. We do this \nin the spirit of bipartisanship on behalf of our men and women in \nuniform of the United States. We are here to do the people's business, \nand I say to the Senator, we have done the people's business. We have \nbeen aided in that effort by Judy Ansley, my chief of staff, having \nsucceeded Les Brownlee; and Senator Levin's wonderful David Lyles, and \nPeter Levine. I use Senator Levin's lawyer's legal brains as much as I \nuse my lawyer's legal brains.\n  I thank our distinguished Presiding Officer, again, for helping us \nhere tonight. I again salute and commend my staff. I am a very \nfortunate individual to be served so well in the Senate. We share our \nstaffs in many ways. They get along quite well together.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Indeed, they do.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise in support of the Conference \nReport to accompany S. 1438, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2002 and to congratulate Chairman Levin and Senator Warner \non this agreement. Having served both as the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am aware of the \nchallenges they faced in reaching this compromise. It is a tribute to \ntheir leadership and strong support for our national security and our \nmen and women in uniform that the Senate is considering this Conference \nReport.\n  Typical of all conference reports, this legislation is a compromise \nbetween the House and Senate bills. It is not a perfect bill, however, \nin my judgment it is a bill that responds to the tragic events of \nSeptember 11 and strengthens our national security. It will be critical \nto our effort to win the war against terrorism and meet the challenges \nof the ever increasing missile threat. To support these goals, the \nconference report provides more than $15 billion. Of equal importance \nto our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines is the fact that the \nlegislation includes the largest pay increase for military personnel \nsince 1982, increased housing allowance and substantial improvements to \nthe military health care benefits.\n  I am especially pleased that the agreement includes many programs to \nsupport our reserve components who are finally becoming equal partners \nto the active forces. The bill increases full time manning by more than \n1,700. It provides approximately $1.0 billion for reserves facilities \nenhancement and enhances both medical and commissary benefits for the \nmen and women who serve our Nation both as a citizen and as a soldier.\n  As with any compromise, there are winners and losers. I am \ndisappointed that legislation includes a provision that will severely \nlimit the ability of the Federal Prison Industries to sell its products \nto the Department of Defense. This will have a significant impact on \nthe prison system and its ability to provide programs to rehabilitate \nand occupy the prison population. I hope we will be able to reverse \nthis setback with legislation that is pending in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Finally, I want to thank Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, Chairman \nStump and Representative Skelton for their strong support of Department \nof Energy programs. The conference report includes an increase of more \nthan $700 million for key programs, including more than $200 million \nnot requested in the budget to begin to recapitalize the nation's \nnuclear weapons complex infrastructure. As all those who have DoE \nfacilities in their State know that much of the nuclear weapons complex \ninfrastructure dates to the post-World War II era. It is critical that \nwe begin to restore these facilities to ensure we maintain our nuclear \ncapability.\n  This morning the House agreed to this conference report by a vote of \n382 to 40. I urge my Senate colleagues to demonstrate no less support \nfor our men and women in uniform and the Nation's security.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to support the fiscal year \n2002 National Defense Authorization conference report which we passed \ntoday. As a former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nchair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I fully appreciate the hard work \nand long hours my colleagues in the Senate and their counterparts in \nthe House have dedicated to the completion of this report.\n  I also want to acknowledge the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Carl Levin, and the ranking member, the senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. John Warner, for their superb leadership \nthroughout the entire defense authorization process.\n  First and foremost, the conference report continues to recognized the \ninvaluable contributions--especially since the tragic events of \nSeptember 11 and the subsequent advent of the war on terrorism--of our \nservice members through significant improvements to their quality of \nlife. In addition to substantial pay raises of five to ten percent, the \nreport includes over $10.5 billion for military housing construction, \nwhich is a desperately needed increase of over $500 million from last \nyear's authorization; continues to improve upon the coverage and \nquality of healthcare for our active duty military members, retirees, \nand their family members; expands education benefits for service \nmembers and their families; and enhances the ability of active duty \npersonnel to participate in federal, state, and local elections.\n  Secondly, the bill reaffirms Congress' commitment to the war against \nterrorism by meeting the funding requirements needed to support our \nSoldiers, Marines, Sailors, and Airmen that are on the front lines with \nthe planes, vehicles, ships, and armament they need to carry out their \nmissions. Whether providing over $30 million to improve field living \nconditions for the ground troops, augmenting the Army, Navy, and Air \nForce budgets by over $560 million for unmanned aerial vehicles, or \nincreasing funding for F-15 and F-16 engine conversions, this bill \nsupports the diverse missions our armed forces are accomplishing to \nmeet the national military strategy.\n  Given my tenure of the Seapower Committee and home state of Maine, I \ncannot overlook the substantial funding for ship construction provided \nby this bill. The conference report addresses the future of our \nnation's Navy and the importance of recapitalization of our fleet by \nauthorizing the construction of five new ships. This includes $3 \nbillion for three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers--the most \nadvanced surface combatant in the world; $370 million for the new \nammunition and cargo ship, the T-AKE; and $2.3 billion for a Virginia \nclass attack submarine.\n  Additionally, the committee has laid substantial ground work for \ncontinuing to modernize our amphibious fleet in fiscal year 2003 \nthrough the authorization of $421 million and $260 million in advance \nprocurement funding for the LPD-17 and LHD programs, respectively.\n  I am also pleased to see that the Committee did not lose sight of the \nadministration's long-term goals of\n\n[[Page S13134]]\n\ntransforming and modernizing the military. While we fall short of the \nDefense Department's goal of allocating three percent of the defense \nbudget to investing in future defense development programs, it does \ninclude substantial funding to meet asymmetrical terrorist threats \nincluding chemical and biological weapons and develop the agility, \nmobility, and survivability necessary to meet the challenges of the \nfuture that we are glimpsing today in Afghanistan.\n\n  I voted for this legislation because I believe that it is critically \nimportant to ensure that our armed forces are fully prepared to carry \nout America's war on terrorism. However, I support the bill despite my \nstrong opposition to provisions authorizing a round of base closures in \n2005.\n  Even before the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, I had serious \nquestions about both the integrity of the base closing process itself \nas well as the actual benefits realized. Now, with acts of war \ncommitted against the United States, I do not believe this is the time \nto be talking about closure of bases.\n  The base closure provision in this conference report requires that \nthe Department of Defense submit a comprehensive force structure plan \nto Congress detailing the relationship between defense requirements and \ninfrastructure. This is something I have been calling for 4 years. But \nI believe we need this plan before we debate base closures, not after \nwe have already authorized them. This is putting the cart before the \nhorse.\n  Before we legislate defense-wide policy that will reduce the size \nnumber of training areas critical to our force readiness, the \nDepartment of Defense ought to be able to tell us that level of \noperational and maintenance infrastructure required to support our \nshifting national security requirements. Congress, instead, was pressed \nto authorize base closures essentially in the dark.\n  The administration and proponents of additional base closure rounds \nclaim that reducing infrastructure has not kept pace with other post-\ncold-war military force reductions. They say that bases must be \ndownsized proportionate to the reduction in total force strength. \nHowever, there is no straight line corollary between the size of our \nforces and the infrastructure required to support them.\n  Since the end of the cold war we have reduced the military force \nstructure by 36 percent and have reduced the defense by 40 percent. But \nwhiles the size of the armed services has decreased, the number of \ncontingencies that our service members have been called upon to respond \nto in recent years has dramatically increased. And, keep in mind, Mr. \nPresident, once property is relinquished and remedied, it is \npermanently lost as a military asset for all practical purposes.\n  In addition, advocates of base closure alleged that billions of \ndollars will be saved. And yet, the Department of Defense has admitted \nthat savings will not be immediate; that approximately $10 billion \nwould be needed for up-front environmental and other costs; and that \nsavings would not materialize for years.\n  I want to protect the military's critical readiness and operational \nassets. I want to protect the home port berthing for our ships and \nsubmariners, the airspace that our aircraft fly in and the training \nareas and ranges that our armed forces require to support and defense \nour Nation and its interests. I want to protect the economic viability \nof communities in every State. And I want to make absolutely sure that \nthis nation maintains the military infrastructure it will need in the \nyears to come to support the war of terrorism. We must not degrade the \nreadiness of our armed forces by closing more bases. so I strenuously \noppose the base closure provisions win this legislation, and before it \nis a fundamental mistake to include it in the DOD authorization.\n  With the exception of the basis closure provisions, this defense bill \ntakes a positive stem toward modernizing our armed services, meeting \ntheir operational and maintenance funding requirements, and improving \nthe quality of service for our committed men and women of the military.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to express dissatisfaction \nwith language included in the conference report on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2002 that repeals the requirement \nfor a referendum on the future of U.S. military training on the island \nof Vieques, PR. Although, in the interest of national security, I voted \nfor the adoption of the report, I am deeply disturbed by the manner in \nwhich the people of Vieques have been deprived of the right to decide \nfor themselves as to whether or not they wish to allow the U.S. \nmilitary to continue using their island as a military training \nfacility.\n  I certainly agree with those who argue that in times like these, when \nthe U.S. is heavily involved in military conflict, that we must take \nevery possible step to ensure the readiness of our troops. However, I \nbelieve it is safe to say the people of Vieques have endured more than \ntheir fair share of sacrifice for the good of America, and the cause of \nU.S. military readiness. We must recognize the sacrifices made by the \npeople of Vieques, and provide them with the consideration they deserve \nas American citizens.\n  By repealing the requirement that the people of Vieques have a \nreferendum to decide whether or not the U.S. military is allowed to \ncontinue to presence on the Island, this Congress has taken a dangerous \nstep toward curtailing the inalienable rights to which those who call \nthe island home are entitled as U.S. citizens. I find that outcome to \nbe deeply troubling.\n  As I close, I would like to make perfectly clear that I fully support \nthe efforts of the U.S. military to maintain its readiness to defend \nour nation, as it is so bravely and effectively doing as we speak. \nHowever, I feel that the choice between maintaining readiness and \nprotecting the rights of American citizens on Vieques is a false \nchoice, and one that we do not have to live with. The Department of \nDefense, by its own estimates, if directed to do so should be able to \nleave the island by 2003 without a detrimental effect on military \nreadiness. This knowledge makes the decision of this body to strip the \npeople of Vieques of a voice in their future all the more perplexing.\n  Sixty years of bombing has taken its toll on Vieques. The US citizens \nof Vieques and Puerto Rico have been patient long enough. They should \nbe permitted a free and fair ability to express their wishes, which is \na cornerstone of our great democracy. The language in this Bill which \npertains to Vieques diminishes the rights of the citizens of Puerto \nRico and I believe the Senate should revisit this issue during the next \nsession.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report to accompany S.1438, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2002. I am disappointed that the \nconference agreement did not include some key legislative provisions \nthat I had sponsored in the Senate during the course of the normal \nlegislative process which would have begun to transform the military as \nrequested by the President. Some of the provisions in this bill that I \nfind objectionable are provisions that: delay base realignment and \nclosure, BRAC, authority until 2005, codify the anti-trade domestic \nsource restrictions of the Berry amendment, and continue the unfair \npersonnel policy which financially hurts disabled military retirees by \nreducing their earned military retirement. This is a broken promise to \nmilitary retirees and their families, year after year. These are also \nthe reasons why I did not sign the final conference agreement.\n  With respect to concurrent receipt, clearly, retirees who have \nincurred significant disabilities over the course of a military career \ndeserve better than how they are treated today. Many such service \nmembers are compelled to forfeit their full-retired pay under current \nrules. I have stated before on the Senate floor, and I am compelled to \nreiterate now, retirement pay and disability pay are two distinct types \nof pay.\n  Retirement pay is for service rendered through 20 years of military \nservice. Disability pay is for physical or mental pain or suffering \nthat occurs during and as a result of military service. In this case, \nmembers with decades of military service receive the same compensation \nas similarly disabled members who served only a few years, with no \nrecognition at all for their more extended, careers of service to our \ncountry. This is patently unfair\n\n[[Page S13135]]\n\nand more must be done to correct this problem.\n  I would also like to highlight that this year's defense authorization \nbill contained $1.3 billion in unrequested add-ons to the defense \nbudget that will rob our military of vital funding on priority issues. \nWhile this year's total is less than in previous years, and is far less \nthan the $4.5 billion in the defense appropriations bill, it is still \n$1.3 billion too much. We need to, and can do, better.\n  Over the past 6 years, Congress has increased the President's defense \nbudgets by nearly $60 billion in order to address the military \nservices' most important unfunded priorities. Still, it is sufficient \nto say that the military needs less money spent on pork and more money \nspent wisely to redress the serious problems caused by a decade of \ndeclining defense budgets.\n  We also must reform the bureaucracy of the Pentagon, this bill does \nnot. We did not even make significant improvements requested by the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense when he presented his budget for \nfiscal year 2002. With the exception of minor changes, our defense \nestablishment looks just as it did 50 years ago. We must continue to \nincorporate practices from the private sector-like restructuring, \nreforming, and streamlining to eliminate duplication and capitalize on \ncost savings. More effort must be made to reduce the continuing growth \nof headquarter staffs and to decentralize the Pentagon's labyrinth of \nbureaucratic fiefdoms to change its way of doing business with its \nbloated staffs and its outdated practices.\n  In addition, more must be done to eliminate unnecessary and \nduplicative military contracts and military installations. Every U.S. \nmilitary leader has testified regarding the critical need for further \nBRAC rounds. We can redirect at least $6.3 billion per year by \neliminating excess defense infrastructure. There is another $2 billion \nper year that we can put to better purposes by privatizing or \nconsolidating support and maintenance functions, something not \nconsidered in either body, and an additional $5 billion can be saved \nper year by eliminating ``Buy America'' restrictions that only \nundermine U.S. competitiveness overseas. Despite these compelling \nfacts, the conference agreement on the contrary, includes several \nprovisions that move demonstratively in the opposite direction.\n  The conference agreement delays a base realignment and closure, BRAC, \nround until 2005. There is no good reason to delay BRAC. By doing so, \ntoo many servicemen and women will continue to live in old and \ndilapidated barracks and homes because we have too many bases. Although \nI would prefer to say that base closing is a new idea, it isn't. In \n1970, the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, ``Fithugh Commission'', made \nreference to ``consolidation of military activities at fewer \ninstallations would contribute to more efficient operations and would \nproduce substantial savings.'' In 1983, the President's Private Sector \nSurvey on Cost Control, ``Grace Commission'', made strong \nrecommendations for military base closures. In 1997, the Quadrennial \nDefense Review, QDR, recommended that, even after four base closure \nrounds in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995, the Armed Forces ``must shed \nexcess infrastructure.'' Likewise, the 1997 Defense Reform Initiative, \nDRI, and the National Defense Panel, NDP, ``strongly urged Congress and \nthe Department of Defense to move quickly to restore the base \nrealignment and closure, BRAC, process.''\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, former Secretaries Dick Cheney and \nWilliam Cohen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, all the Service \nChiefs, the Congressional Budget Office, and other respected defense \nexperts have been consistent in their plea that the Pentagon be \npermitted to divest themselves of excess infrastructure beyond what was \neliminated during the prior rounds of base closings. Through the end of \n1998, the Pentagon had closed 97 major bases in the United States after \nfour previous rounds of BRAC. Since then, it has closed none. Moreover, \nthe savings from closing additional unneeded bases would be shifted to \nforce modernization.\n  The Department of Defense is obligated to maintain 23 percent excess \ncapacity in infrastructure. When we actually look for the dollars to \npay for the Unfunded Priority Lists as provided by the Service Chiefs, \nit is important to look to the billions of dollars that would be saved \nby base realignment and closure. Only 30 percent of the defense budget \nfunds combat forces, while the remaining 70 percent is devoted to \nsupport functions such as bases. Continuing to squander precious \ndollars in this manner will make it impossible for us to adequately \nmodernize our forces for the future. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have \nstated repeatedly that they desire more opportunities to streamline the \nmilitary's infrastructure.\n\n  Total BRAC savings realized from the four previous closure rounds \nexceed total costs to date. Department of Defense figures suggest \nprevious base closures will save, after one-time closing costs, $15 \nbillion through fiscal year 2001, $25 billion through fiscal year 2003 \nand $6.3 billion a year thereafter. Additional needed closures can save \n$20 billion by 2015, and $3 billion a year thereafter. Sooner or later \nthese surplus bases will be closed anyway. The sooner the issue is \naddressed, the greater will be the savings that will ultimately go \ntoward defense modernization and greater pay raises for service \nmembers. Delaying the BRAC process, as we have done in this Conference \nReport, only harms force modernization and hurts the pocket book of \nservice members, their families and military retirees.\n  We can continue to maintain a military infrastructure that we do not \nneed, or we can provide the necessary funds to ensure our military can \nfight and win future wars. Every dollar we spend on unnecessary bases \nprecludes our military leaders from spending scarce resources on \ntraining our troops, keeping personnel quality of life at an \nappropriate level, maintaining force structure, replacing old weapons \nsystems, and advancing our military technology.\n  In my view, the Committee on Armed Services took a step backwards by \ncodifying in Title 10 ``Buy America'' restrictions which divert \nnecessary funds to ensure our military is properly equipped. Every \ndollar we spend on archaic procurement policies, like ``Buy America,'' \nis a dollar we cannot spend on training our troops, keeping personnel \nquality of life at an appropriate level, maintaining force structure, \nreplacing old weapons systems, and advancing our military technology.\n  It would be unconscionable not to examine the potential for savings \nfrom modifying congressionally-mandated protectionist procurement \npolicy instead of codifying in Title 10 procurement legislation which \nobligates the Department of Defense to maintain wasteful spending. \nSecretary Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated repeatedly \nthat they want more flexibility to reform the military's archaic \nacquisition practices. We need to give them that flexibility.\n  I have spoken of this issue before in this Chamber and the potential \nimpact of certain domestic source restrictions on bilateral trade \nrelations with our allies. From a philosophical point of view, I oppose \nprotectionist trade policy, not only because I believe free trade is an \nimportant means of improving relations among nations and a key to major \nU.S. economic growth, but also because I believe we must reform these \npractices in order to get more bang for our defense dollars.\n  It is my sincere hope that next year the chairman and ranking member \nof the committee will hold hearings on this issue and start serious \nreform. It is important to point out that the Secretary of Defense and \nthe President do not like, nor do they want this protectionist policy, \ncodifying it as the chairman and ranking member have done, absent any \nhearings or consultation with members of the committee who have strong \nviews on this matter shows disregard to an informed or proper committee \nprocess. We must end once and for all the anti-competitive, anti-free \ntrade practices that encumber our Government, the military, and U.S. \nindustry.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that the conferees did not adopt \nlegislation by Representative Heather Wilson, R-NM, that would rescind \na congressionally-mandated provision added in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1992 over the strong objections of \nthe civilian and military leadership and would return Second \nLieutenants and Ensigns to regular commissions vice reserve commissions\n\n[[Page S13136]]\n\nupon graduation from one of the Service Academies or certain ROTC \nscholarship programs.\n  Service Academies have a unique opportunity and special \nresponsibility to provide an environment that cultivates, indeed \ndemands, the internalization of honor, loyalty, integrity, and moral \ncourage, the qualities essential to developing leadership. The core of \nour officer commissioning program are the Service Academies, this is \nnot to say that the ROTC, OCS, and other critical commissioning \nprograms are not outstanding, they are, just look at our current \nmilitary leadership: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Richard \nMyers, Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Vern Clark, and Marine Corps \nCommandant General Jim Jones. I believe returning to regular service \ncommissions for Academy and certain ROTC junior officers will inspire a \ncore of career-oriented officers for our military.\n  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my belief in the importance \nof enacting meaningful improvements for active duty and Reserve service \nmembers. They risk their lives in Afghanistan and elsewhere to defend \nour shores and preserve democracy, and we cannot thank them enough for \ntheir service. But, we can and should pay them more, improve the \nbenefits for their families, and support the Reserve Components in a \nmanner similar to the active forces. Our service members past, present, \nand future need these improvements. We also cannot continue with this \n``business as usual'' mind set. We must reform the Department of \nDefense and not fall prey to the special interest groups that attempt \nto warp our perspective and misdirect our spending. We owe so much more \nto our men and women in uniform who defend our country. They are our \ngreatest resource, and I believe they are woefully under-represented. \nWe must continue to do better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of items added to the defense \nauthorization bill Conference Report by the Conference Committee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Fiscal Year 2002 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL CONFERENCE REPORT\n                         [In million of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Title I--Procurement\n \nAircraft Procurement, Army Rotary Wing: Helicopter New Training   $25.0\nOther Procurement, Comm-Combat Communications: Improved High        5.0\n Frequency Radio, USAR.........................................\nShipbuilding and Conversion, Navy--Auxiliaries, Craft and Prior     2.0\n Year Program Costs: Mine Hunter SWATH.........................\nMissile Procurement, Air Force--Other Support, Space Programs:     22.7\n NUDET Detection System........................................\n \n      Title II--Research, Development, Test and Evaluation\n \nArmy:\n  Materials Technology.........................................     5.0\n  Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology.....................    15.0\n  Countermine Systems..........................................     5.5\n  Medical Advanced Technology..................................     5.0\n  Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology............    13.0\n  Environmental Quality Technology Dem/Val.....................     7.0\n  Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles............................     1.5\nNavy: Communications, Command and Control, Intelligence,            5.0\n Surveillance..................................................\nAir Force: Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion.................     2.0\nDefense Wide:\n  Cooperative DoD/VA Medical Research..........................     2.5\n  Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative.........    15.0\n \n              Title III--Operations & Maintenance\n \nArmy: (Budget Activity 01: Operating Forces):\n  Land Forces Divisions: ECWCS/MSS.............................     4.0\n  Land Forces Readiness:\n    M-Gator....................................................     6.6\n    Range Instrumentation......................................     6.0\nBudget Activity 04: Administration & Servicewide Activities\n Logistics Operations:\n  Logistics Support Activities: Maintenance AIT/RFID...........     9.0\n    Replacement Containers, Ft.

Pork=$1.3\n Billion\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, 9 months ago I stood before this body as \na proud cosponsor of the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001. This \nbill, which I also cosponsored in the last Congress, seeks to redress a \nmajor inequity that has resulted in a serious slight to the dedicated \nmen and women who have selflessly served our Nation. It is an injustice \nthat has puzzled me for decades.\n  Current law bans so-called ``concurrent receipt'' of VA disability \ncompensation and military retired pay, so that the amount of any VA \ndisability payment to a military retiree is subtracted from the monthly \nretirement check. The obvious flaw of this rule is clear to the vast \nmajority of the members of this body and to most members of the House. \nIn its original form, this legislation garnered 78 cosponsors in the \nSenate and a whopping 378 members in the House. It seems that this was \nsomething that should have made it through the Conference Committee \nprocess without much question. But, unfortunately, what we saw emerge \nfrom conference was a real disappointment to me, to many Members of \nthis body, and most of all, to our brave men and women--both those who \nhave served in the past and those who continue to serve and continue to \nface the risk of disability.\n  Here was an opportunity--a real chance to address a serious inequity \nand we let it fall by the way side. What message are we sending to our \nArmed Services? This incongruity only hurts those men and women who \nhave devoted the majority of their working lives to our Nation because \nit only affects military retirees. If a soldier retires from the \nservice after 20 years and has sustained a service-connected disability \nalong the way, then their VA disability payments are subtracted from \ntheir military pensions. It makes no sense that those in uniform who \nsuffer a service-connected disability end up being penalized for \ndeciding to remain in the military, while those who chose to leave the \nmilitary receive their disability payments along with any pension they \nmay receive from an additional employer. The longer you serve in the \nmilitary, the more you are penalized. Does this make sense? It doesn't \nto me. They surely have earned both.\n  We have been fighting this fight now for too long. Year after year, \nit is brought to the floor and year after year Senators stand up and \nsing its praises. Now more than ever, Americans are painfully aware of \nwhat the sacrifices of our Armed Forces mean to us all. The horrific \nattacks upon our country on September 11 and the recent 60th \nanniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor have made us all appreciate \nthe millions of Americans who have selflessly served our nation and \ncontinue to protect our freedoms today. When our troops eventually \nreturn from serving in Afghanistan, undoubtedly there will be some \namong them who will find themselves penalized by our inability to \ncorrect this wrong. I am frustrated that even in this time when the \nimportance of our troops is more evident than ever, we continue to \nshortchange our veterans.\n  So here we are--poised to send a vastly reduced version of \nlegislation that had huge bipartisan support in Congress to the \nPresident for signature. It is my hope the minor concessions made under \nthe Department of Defense authorization conference report will serve as \na stepping-stone for future improvements. But still, how many more \nmilitary retirees must see their VA disability payments reduce their \nretirement benefits before more meaningful changes are made and this \ninequality is ended?\n  We have troops in the field as I speak, putting their safety on the \nline to protect our way of life, and passage of this Defense \nAuthorization bill is vital to our military operations. So it is \nimportant that this bill be passed. But, I want to put my colleagues \nand this administration on notice, this isn't the last battle in this \nwar. One day those who put their lives at risk by wearing the uniform \nof this country, and who become disabled from their service, won't be \npunished for their duty. This is an unfairness that should have been \ncorrected years ago, and an unfairness that will continue to plague \nthose who offered their lives for the freedom we all enjoy. There is \ntoo much at stake here and I am not going to give up the fight to enact \nfull concurrent receipt until we get this corrected.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I want to address one provision of this \nvery important bill having to do with Department of Energy facilities. \nThis bill will require the Department of Energy to submit to Congress a \nplan for the infrastructure of the nuclear weapons complex. This will \ninclude those facilities that support the nuclear weapons stockpile, \nthe naval reactors program, and nonproliferation and national security \nactivities.\n  In my view, we have not seen adequate investment in the Department of \nEnergy's facilities over the last 10 years. This is true of the \nfacilities and infrastructure that support both the defense and \ncivilian missions of the Department of Energy. In addition to its vital \nnational security missions, DOE is a premier science agency of the U.S. \nGovernment. I am encouraged that my colleagues want to begin to address \nthe decline in DOE's infrastructure. I think this plan will be an \nopportunity for DOE to begin a dialog with Congress on what levels of \nnew investment are needed.\n  The Naval Reactors Program--a joint DOE and Navy program--has a very \nproud history at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory in my State. Although this program is not as active as it \nhistorically was in Idaho, the critical mission of fuel examination and \nstorage continues at the Naval Reactors Facility. This work allows our \ncountry to have continued confidence in the ability to send our \nnuclear-powered naval vessels to any global hotspot or point of \nconflict, on short notice and fully fueled. In this way, nuclear power \ncontinues its critical role in our national defense.\n  Given the technical excellence of the Naval Reactors Program, I am \nconfident that as long as the Navy sends its spent nuclear fuel to \nIdaho for examination and storage, they will provide for the \nsafekeeping of this material until a deep geologic repository is \nopened. In fact, the Navy is party to a court-enforceable agreement \nwith the State of Idaho that commits to this very objective. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in Congress, with the Navy and \nwith DOE on securing a robust nuclear infrastructure within the DOE \ncomplex.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am very pleased that the National \nDefense Authorization Act, which the Senate has passed, includes a \nprovision to allow Federal civilian employees and military personnel, \nas well as their family members, to make individual use of frequent-\nflyer miles and other promotional benefits offered as a result of \nofficial Government travel. This measure, found in section 1116 of the \nlegislation, will correct a glaring inequity that exists between \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S13138]]\n\nand private sector employees for work-related travel. The time has come \nfor us to recognize that the current prohibition on frequent flyer \nbenefits is unfair to our Federal workforce as well as unnecessary for \ngood government. In fact, by making these benefits available to \ngovernment workers, we will help make Federal service more competitive \nwith the private sector.\n  I am especially proud that this measure applies to military \npersonnel, many of whom are deployed in hostile environments, far from \nhome and family. This time of war brings home the fact that every \nsoldier, sailor, pilot and marine who serves our country around the \nclock deserves the best treatment we can offer.\n  This provision originated in an amendment to the Defense \nAuthorization bill offered in the Armed Services Committee in September \nby Senator Warner and myself, and was further developed as S. 1498, a \nbill which I introduced in October with Senators Thompson, Akaka, \nWarner, and Voinovich, and which provided the basis for the final \nlanguage of section 1116.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of this \nprovision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n          Section 1116--Retention of Travel Promotional Items\n\n       Subsection (a)--Definition. The term ``agency'' has the \n     meaning given under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5701.\n       Subsection (b)--Retention of Travel Promotional Items. This \n     subsection provides that government personnel and others may \n     make personal use of frequent flyer miles and other \n     promotional items received from official travel. Official \n     travel may be either at Government expense or accepted by the \n     Government from a non-Federal source. This provision is \n     comprehensive, covering travel by civilian, military, and \n     foreign-service personnel, family members when on official \n     travel (as when personnel are being relocated), and any other \n     individuals (such as academic experts or fellows) who may \n     travel at Government expense (or accepted by the Government \n     from a non-federal source).\n       Subsection (c)--Limitation. This subsection (c) provides \n     that only ``agencies'' (as defined in subsection (a)) are \n     covered by the section. Paragraph (1) of subsection (c) \n     states that only travel at the expense of such an agency (or \n     accepted by the agency from a non-federal source) is covered \n     by the section, and paragraph (2) states that travel by an \n     officer, employee, or other Government official who is not in \n     such an ``agency'' is not covered. Thus, Government personnel \n     in one agency are covered even if they are traveling at the \n     expense of another agency, but Government personnel are \n     excluded if they are not in any agency, even if an agency is \n     paying for the travel.\n       As noted above, subsection (a) applies the definition of \n     ``agency'' in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5701, and that definition is \n     further established by 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101-105, which \n     define certain terms used in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5701. The section \n     thus covers all executive and military departments and most \n     other executive-branch agencies. In the legislative branch, \n     the section covers the General Accounting Office, the Library \n     of Congress, the Government Printing Office, and other \n     legislative-branch agencies. All offices and agencies in the \n     judicial branch are covered.\n       Governmental entities outside of the definition of \n     ``agency'' in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5701 are not considered to be \n     covered by the existing ban on personal use of frequent flyer \n     miles in section 6008 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining \n     Act, and have established their own rules and policies on \n     this subject--some allow their employees to use frequent \n     flyer miles and some do not. This section would not affect \n     any of these entities. These entities include the U.S. Postal \n     Service, government-controlled corporations, and the House \n     and Senate.\n       Subsection (d)--Regulatory Authority. This subsection \n     provides that an agency with authority to regulate official \n     travel may issue regulations necessary to carry out \n     subsection (a) with respect to promotional items granted in \n     connection with such travel. So, for example, for travel by \n     members of the foreign service, the Secretary of State may \n     issue such regulations; for travel by members of the \n     uniformed services, the secretaries of the respective \n     services may issue such regulations; and for travel by most \n     other civilian employees, the Administrator of GSA may issue \n     such regulations.\n       Subsection (e)--Repeal of Superseded Law. This subsection \n     repeals section 6008 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining \n     Act, which now requires that awards under a frequent traveler \n     program or other promotional items accrued through official \n     travel be used only for official travel.\n       Subsection (f)--Applicability. This subsection provides \n     that the section shall apply to promotional items received \n     before, on, and after the date of enactment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13138-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13138-S13140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2598\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, what is the business before the Senate \nat this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The business before the Senate is the McCain \namendment to the substitute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The McCain amendment to the substitute is the pending \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The McCain amendment to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We would like to debate it. I ask if anyone knows where \nSenator McCain is; we would like to debate the amendment. He is not \nhere, so we cannot debate the amendment.\n  What I would like to do--I wonder if I can work with the ranking \nmember to see if we can make some progress on this bill tonight. I \nwould like to ask consent to withdraw the McCain amendment, with the \nunderstanding that tomorrow morning when we come in, the McCain \namendment will be put in order on the substitute after we debate the \nWellstone amendment and lay it aside tomorrow. We will not dispose of \nit until we come back next week.\n  I am saying that we take the McCain amendment off tonight so we can \ndeal with other things, with the understanding or with the agreement, \nwith the consent that tomorrow morning the first thing we will turn to \nis the Wellstone amendment, as I understand; when the debate is \nfinished on the Wellstone amendment, Senator McCain be recognized to \noffer his amendment on the substitute, and it can debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, I just wish to respond to \nmy colleague.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I think he is outlining a reasonable \ncourse of activity. As I understand the Senator's proposal, Senator \nWellstone would debate his amendment; others would debate the \namendment. As we know, a rollcall vote will not be in order, given the \nunanimous consent agreement, until Tuesday. Therefore, after that \ndebate, this will be laid aside, and then Senator McCain will be \nrecognized so we can proceed then, as the Senator from Iowa has \nsuggested, to amend the--whichever--the underlying amendment at that \npoint; is that what the Senator said? In any event, whatever appears to \nbe in order so he is able then to complete the debate on his amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Maybe I should inquire of the President, what is the \norder right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The McCain amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further inquiry, Madam President. Is there a consent \nagreement now in order which lines up some other amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is not. May I further inquire, where is the Smith \namendment and the Torricelli second-degree amendment thereto in the \norder of things right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those are pending to the substitute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If they are pending to the substitute, then the Wellstone \namendment will be to the substitute, and so we will have to lay aside \nthe Smith and Torricelli amendments tomorrow morning in order to go to \nWellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, as well as laying aside the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, then, let's see if we both have the same \nunderstanding of this. What we would do tomorrow morning is lay aside \nthe pending Smith amendment and the Torricelli second-degree amendment \nthereto. We would\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nthen proceed to debate on the Wellstone amendment. When debate is \nfinished on the Wellstone amendment, we would then go to the McCain \namendment as an amendment to the substitute, at which time after the \nMcCain amendment is debated, we would then return to the Smith \namendment with the Torricelli second-degree amendment thereto?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Provided that the McCain amendment has been \nwithdrawn, the Senator is correct, and assuming that the Wellstone \namendment is offered and subsequently the McCain amendment is offered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain \namendment No. 2598 be withdrawn, and that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the farm bill on Friday, the pending Smith and \nTorricelli amendments be laid aside and Senator Wellstone be recognized \nto offer an amendment regarding EQIP grants; that following debate in \nrelation to the Wellstone amendment the amendment be laid aside, and \nSenator McCain or his designee be recognized to offer his amendment \nregarding catfish, and that following the reporting of the clerk, the \nMcCain amendment be laid aside; further, that the pending amendments \nmay be set aside with the concurrence of both managers for the purpose \nof offering additional amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, basically the situation is this. We are \nopen for business again. We could take amendments right now, but I can \nsee that there are not many people around right now.\n  I want to point out again that we are on the farm bill. It is \nThursday, December 13. It looks as if we will have another week and a \nday here. Probably next Friday we will adjourn.\n  We have to get this farm bill done. As chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, I believe I have been more than lenient and willing to let \nother bills come up--the Education bill next Monday, tonight the \nDefense bill--but now it is the hour when we have to focus on the farm \nbill, and we have to get it done. So I intend to object to going to \nanything else. We will remain on this farm bill.\n  Obviously, conference reports are privileged, but for my part there \nwill not be anything else to come before the Senate until we finish the \nfarm bill. It will take unanimous consent to get off the farm bill and \nI, frankly, am serving notice right now that I am not giving consent \nfor anything that keeps us from finishing the farm bill. If people want \nto vote against it and defeat it, that's their business. But at least \nlet's get to a vote and let people know whether or not we are going to \npass this farm bill or whether the will of the Senate is we do not want \nthis farm bill. But we ought to have at least a vote this year.\n  Farm groups all over America have been writing and calling, asking us \nwhen we are going to get this farm bill done. We have done our job in \ncommittee. I point out again and again, every single title of this farm \nbill was passed unanimously out of the committee except one, the \ncommodity title, and that at least had some bipartisan support.\n  I was fully aware that we would have an amendment on the floor by \nSenators Cochran and Roberts that was going to try to change the focus \nof the farm bill on the commodity title and some other titles. We have \nbeen wanting to see the Cochran-Roberts amendment. We have been hearing \nabout it, but they will not bring it up. Where are they? They are not \nhere. They were not here today, they were not here yesterday, and I \ndaresay they will not be here tonight. Will they be here tomorrow? \nThere is some sort of Cochran-Roberts amendment, but they will not \noffer it.\n  It is an unusual way to make legislation unless--unless it is the \ndesire and the plan to stop this bill from going through this year. \nMaybe that is the plan.\n  We ought to have a finite list of amendments. We ought to know what \namendments may be offered. I don't know what amendments are out there. \nI will ask tonight, and I will ask tomorrow, may we have a finite list \nof amendments? Is that possible?\n  Would we be able to finish and go to third reading by Tuesday night? \nWould that be possible? Could we do that? Or by Wednesday? Could we be \nfinished by Wednesday noon? How about Wednesday night? How many \namendments do we need to consider? We can't seem to get anything agreed \nto on this.\n  With all due respect to my friend and my ranking member, Senator \nLugar, I just hope we can reach some kind of finite list of amendments \nand get them listed.\n  I will be asking unanimous consent for that tomorrow. I will not \ntonight. But tomorrow I will ask unanimous consent whether by a certain \ntime tomorrow we may have a finite list of amendments. If that is not \nacceptable, I will ask for such a list by Monday. I will see whether we \ncan ever get to a point where we can have a finite list of amendments. \nIf not, then it will be apparent that some do not want this bill to \npass this year, for whatever reason.\n  Again, I am not saying this is necessarily so. But I am saying that \nis what it appears to be. We have to move ahead on the bill. Yet here \nwe sit. We could have amendments tonight. It is not unusual to be in \nsession Thursday night.\n  Senator Lugar and I are on the floor. We are willing to work. We are \nwilling to stay here and listen to debate and have amendments and vote. \nHowever, no one else is here, except the occupant of the chair, of \ncourse.\n  We just cannot seem to get the cooperation to get this farm bill \nmoving. I hope tomorrow morning we will have some debate. I want to put \non notice all offices who are watching on television right now that we \nwill have amendments tomorrow. There will not be any votes tomorrow. \nThat has already been agreed to. But we will have amendments tomorrow, \nand amendments will be debated. Then they will be set aside. We have \ntried to stack votes for them on Tuesday. There won't be any votes on \nMonday either.\n  We will have debate tomorrow. We will stack the votes on Tuesday. But \nthere will be debate on amendments tomorrow.\n  I say to anyone who has amendments to offer that they should offer \nthem tomorrow because, again, members ought to know we are going to \nvote on cloture again on Tuesday morning. If cloture happens, and they \nhave not offered their amendments, they may be out of order.\n  Again, if we don't get cloture on Tuesday, we will vote again on \ncloture on Wednesday. If we don't get cloture on Wednesday, we will \nvote again on it on Thursday. We will just see whether or not there are \nthose in this body who want to absolutely stymie and stall and keep us \nfrom voting on a farm bill this year.\n  I believe I have acted in good faith. We brought the bill out of \ncommittee. We brought it to the floor. It can be amended. I love \ndebate. I thought we had some good amendments offered. We have had some \ngood debates so far. I am just hoping we can bring this debate to a \nconclusion at some point early next week and get this bill out of the \nSenate.\n  Again, I look around to see if there is anybody to offer any \namendments. It is pretty quiet in here. Evidently, it looks as if we \nare not going to get any amendments here tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will not add to the frustration and \ndiscomfort of my chairman except to empathize with him, having stood in \na similar situation 5 or 6 years ago when we last proceeded with the \nfarm bill. I found it was seemingly an endless task. It does finally \ncome to conclusion. That will be good news for the chairman.\n  I will work with him to try to identify the amendments so we can have \nappropriate debate and votes. Both the chairman and I realize we are \nnear the end of the session, and conference reports on important bills \nare likely to intrude. The chairman recognizes that. He stated \ncorrectly this is the pending business. It ought to be our pending \nbusiness, aside from the privileged motions on appropriations bills \nthat the\n\n[[Page S13140]]\n\nleaders have designated for debate on Monday and early Tuesday.\n  I believe there probably is a finite set of amendments. I suggested \nearlier during the day that we will compile a list of 44 at that time. \nI think some of those perhaps disappeared in the course of the day. \nHopefully others do not emerge.\n  But I think there are some basic issues involving payment limits, for \nexample, that are still out there. Perhaps some are not parochial \ninterests but interests of particular Senators in their States, such \nas, for example, the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, with \na legitimate basin problem not requiring much time, although the Senate \nmay or may not agree with his point of view.\n  Even if these are simple amendments, perhaps they will not be offered \nin the event they are already accepted. Perhaps the chairman and I will \nbe able, with staff, to work together to see which amendments can be \naccepted.\n  We have been engrossed in very heated debate on sugar and on dairy--\nthings that claimed our attention at the time so that we have not \nreally sifted through those things that are perhaps acceptable.\n  But in the course at least of the next couple of days of debate, I \nthink the situation will become more clear. The chairman knows I have a \nnumber of problems with the commodities title. I have already expressed \nthose in the form of one amendment and others.\n  The chairman is also correct that we did reach remarkable accord on \nat least eight titles, perhaps nine. My memory fails as to how many are \nin our bill. But those are good titles to this piece of legislation. It \ndoesn't mean that others may not at least insert lines in them, and \nthey may do so, but at the same time they are in fairly solid shape.\n  The commodity situation is one that is bound to be of controversy \nbecause it has money attached to it. Nevertheless, we will have to \nreach decisions. I pledge to work with the chairman to do that. I will \noffer at least I hope comfort this evening and the belief that the \nchairman's day tomorrow will be a better one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13140-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I recognize the presence today of our \nworld champion Arizona Diamondbacks who are visiting with the President \nlater this morning.\n  We in Arizona are especially proud of them, as I know are all \nbaseball fans across America who hate the Yankees as well. So I \nexpress, on behalf of myself, my colleague Senator Kyl, and the people \nof the State of Arizona, how pleased and proud we are of the \nDiamondbacks and the fact that the President will be greeting them \nlater on; he has a very deep connection and affection for professional \nbaseball.\n  We are especially proud to have our Diamondbacks with us this morning \nto see our Capitol and know that all Americans, in a very difficult \ntime in American history, were uplifted by the incredible series that \nwas played by both teams; it diverted our attention and made us \nappreciate the greatness and strength of America.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield? I want to compliment him and the \nArizona Diamondbacks. What a great series, one of the best World Series \nI have ever watched, being a baseball nut like I am. I think what the \nDiamondbacks showed is not to ever count anyone out and never give up. \nI think the thing that came through with that team was people did not \nthink they would be up for it and counted them out in the beginning. \nThis team never gave up, and I think, as the Senator from Arizona said, \nat this time in our national life we needed to be reminded to never \ngive up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Iowa. It is also important to \nmention my friend from Missouri whose team also played a wonderful \nseries early on with the Diamondbacks, and I think helped them prepare \nfor the World Series.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, a couple of months ago I never thought I \nwould say I am glad to see Curt Schilling again. We saw far too much of \nhim as a Cardinal fan.\n  We congratulate the Diamondbacks on an outstanding year, a great \nvictory and, as I think they used to say in Brooklyn, wait until next \nyear we look forward to renewing the contest.\n  The Diamondbacks were magnificent and, yes, I guess I am even glad to \nsee Curt Schilling.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I \nappreciate them taking a moment to congratulate this wonderful group of \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13140-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13140-S13141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SERGEANT DAN PETITHORY\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

I am touched that his family asked \nme to do so, touched as a veteran who shares with Dan the bond of \nservice in war, touched as a public official who has the privilege of \nexpressing gratitude on behalf of everyone in our State and country \nwhose lives are better for Dan's service, and touched as a citizen and \nfather whose gratitude for Dan's contribution and sacrifice can never \nbe adequately described.\n  No one in all of time has ever been able to soften the blow of a \nyoung person dying. I know all too well, as does Senator Kennedy, how \nthe suddenness of death can rob us of those we love and change life \nforever for those left to live it. But somehow through the tears, God \nhelps us find our way.\n  In the natural order of things, parents are not supposed to bury \ntheir children. The pain of doing so is unfathomable and today \nAmerica's heart and the hearts of all decent, civilized people ache \nuncontrollably for Louis and Barbara, for Michael and Nicole, and for \nall the members of their family.\n  But we are comforted above all by knowing this was not a loss in \nvain. This was not a waste. This was not a death that cannot be \nexplained, difficult as the circumstances were. Sgt. Daniel Petithory \ndied for all of us. He died believing in his country, his values, his \nbrothers in his unit. He died in the extraordinary act of making it \npossible for others to live by the values he loved so deeply, so much \nmore even than he loved his own life.\n  And we will never forget: Dan was a warrior on our behalf. Twice he \nwent to war so we can live our lives in security and freedom. When the \nterrorists brought the frontlines here to America, Sergeant Petithory \ntook the battle back to them in Afghanistan, just as he had taken it to \nSaddam Hussein in the Gulf War a decade ago. That time, he came home \nsafely to America, to a New England community built on the values for \nwhich he'd fought so courageously, home to Cheshire and the love of his \nfamily which all the days of his youth had flown the American flag from \ntheir front porch. Now he is returned to us, resting under that flag to \nwhich he has added an indelible new strand of duty and honor. He gave \nhis life to defend the values and security of our Nation and in doing \nso he joined the special legion of patriots who define the United \nStates of America.\n  For his ultimate sacrifice in the performance of duty, Sgt. Petithory \nis to be awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart, badges of \ndistinction from a grateful Nation. Following his courageous example, \nthe duty is now left to us to spare no sacrifice to finish the mission \nfor which Dan earned our eternal respect, gratitude, and awe.\n  I didn't know Dan personally. Nor did many who mourn him in \nMassachusetts and across the country. But now we know him as the \nneighbor next door; we know him as the kid who always wanted to be a \nsoldier since he\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\nwas 4 years old playing with G.I. Joes in his family's backyard; the \n``all American,'' athletic and funny, who became what he always wanted \nto be, the Army's best and America's best too. We know him as the boy \nat school who Alison Kachel remembers exalting in games of hide and \nseek, as she said, ``hiding like there was no tomorrow.'' While other \nkids hid behind corners and in the bottom of bushes, Dan hid in the \ntree tops, on the school roof, atop neighborhood homes. He was never \ndiscovered until the game was over, out of sight until his friends, \nexasperated, would look up and see him peering out behind a chimney, \nand declare him the winner, if they could find him even then.\n  Alison, today a police officer serving her hometown, told me simply: \n``we've lost one of our elite.'' And indeed we should take a moment to \nhonor what it really meant for Dan to have been a member of the Special \nForces.\n  His unit commander, Captain Jason Amerine, who was wounded at the \nsame time, said we should remember not how Dan and his brothers in arms \ndied, but `what they did beforehand.' What an extraordinary story of \ncourage, initiative, and resolve: a member of an 11 man team, the elite \nof the American fighting forces, dropped into a valley deep inside \nenemy territory in Central Afghanistan, a part of the world they said \nlooked like the ``back side of the moon.'' In the darkness in those \ninitial tense moments they came face to face with Hamid Karzai, then \nthe leader of a committed band of freedom fighters taking on the \nTaliban, and thanks to Dan and his fellow soldiers now about to become \nthe leader of a free Afghanistan. Together they became one fighting \nforce with a common mission. For 6 weeks the men in this small band of \nbrothers depended on each other for life and death, calling in \nairstrikes, repelling Taliban counterattacks, organizing the \nopposition, carrying on their shoulders the hopes of all who were \noutraged by the acts of September 11. And in that far off place where \ndanger was everywhere, Dan excelled on behalf of his Nation, proving, \nas his fellow soldiers said of him, that he was among the best America \nhad to offer. On several occasions Dan directed the air attacks that \nturned the tide of battles. Captain Amerine said of him: ``It's an art. \nAnd the guy I had was the best I've ever seen.''\n  So today, we are all privileged to know Dan and we love him for his \nidealistic, wholehearted commitment to a cause bigger than any of us, \nfor his enduring love of country and his enormous sacrifice for \nfreedom. He has given a great gift to us all, the gift of a life worth \nemulating, the gift of his life for our's.\n  While the Petithorys' hearts will forever be heavier with the loss of \ntheir beloved son and brother, we pray that their pain is lightened to \nsome measure by the knowledge that the whole country shares it, and \nthat our whole country reaches out with an embrace of gratitude. We \npray that their burden will also be lifted in part by the knowledge \nthat the justice for which Dan sacrificed so much, is being delivered \nin Afghanistan, delivered for the brothers and sisters, husbands and \nwives, the children, of every American lost in New York, Pennsylvania, \nand the Pentagon. Louis and Barbara, that justice will be delivered for \none more man, your son, Sergeant Daniel Petithory.\n  President Harry Truman, himself a veteran tested by war, committed to \npeace, 50 years ago honored the Greatest Generation and said of \nAmerica: ``We are not a warlike Nation. We do not go to war for gain or \nfor territory; we go to war for principles, and we produce young men \nlike these.''\n  Once again, our peaceful Nation is at war. We did not seek this war, \nbut we will win it for a principle that is timeless and values which \nshall forever define the greatness of yet another generation of citizen \nsoldiers. And even in our grief, we can say with pride, and conviction, \nthis is America, the Nation we love because it produces and keeps faith \nwith men like Dan Petithory. God bless you Dan, and God Bless the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13141-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 4, 1992 \nin Chicago, IL. Two lesbian women were beaten and taunted by several \nteens in a park. Donna Hayden, 18, and Kimberly Cary, 19, each were \ncharged with battery and hate crime in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13141-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13141-S13142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nsupporting and passing H.R. 2873, the Promoting Safe and Stable \nFamilies Program. Earlier this Fall, Senator Rockefeller and I \nintroduced similar legislation.\n  The bill we are passing today, like our Senate bill, reauthorizes \nfour programs designed to help child welfare agencies establish and \nmaintain permanency by providing grants to States and Indian tribes. \nThe bill also includes programs that the President has proposed, which \nhave my utmost support, as well as a technical correction that Senator \nRockefeller and I have proposed to ensure that special needs children \ncontinue to be eligible for adoption assistance.\n  The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program provides vital \nservices for thousands of at risk children in our Nation. The sad fact \nis that far too many children here at home are at risk, not because of \nthe terrorist threat, but because they are neglected or abused by \nparents or because they are trapped in the legal limbo that is our \nchild welfare system. Because of this, we have an obligation to these \nchildren. We have an obligation to protect these innocent lives.\n  With the passage of our bill, we are taking a big step toward meeting \nthat obligation. By reauthorizing and improving the Safe and Stable \nFamilies Program, we can help strengthen families and ensure the safety \nof vulnerable children.\n  I was very pleased that during the Floor debate on the fiscal year \n2002 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, the Senate agreed to my amendment, \nwhich increased funding for the Safe and Stable Families Program by $70 \nmillion. This raised the program's overall funding level to $375 \nmillion.\n  The funding provided to the States through this legislation is used \nfor four categories of services: family preservation, community-based \nfamily support, time-limited family reunification, and adoption \npromotion and support. These services are designed to prevent child \nabuse and neglect in communities at risk, avoid the removal of children \nfrom their homes, and support timely reunification or adoption. And, \nquite candidly, Promoting Safe and Stable Families is a very important \nsource of funding for post-adoption services.\n  With a nearly 40 percent increase in the number of adoptions since \nthe implementation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, funding for \nadoption promotion and support services is especially vital. These \nservices are necessary to ensure that adoptions are not disrupted, \nwhich risks further traumatizing a child.\n  Our reauthorization bill also amends the Foster Care Independent \nLiving Program to extend the eligibility age from 21 to 23, so that \nchildren aging out of foster care can qualify for educational and \ntraining vouchers. Currently, too many of the 16,000 children youth who \nage out of foster care are not able to pursue educational or vocational \ntraining because they just don't have the money. This provision helps \nthese young people get the education and career training they need and \ndeserve.\n  The bill doubles the funding for the Court Improvement Program, CIP, \nand reauthorizes it through 2006. The CIP program provides grants to \nthe States to develop a system of more timely court actions that \nprovides for the\n\n[[Page S13142]]\n\nsafety of children in foster care and expedites the placement of such \nchildren in appropriate permanent settings. This money helps ensure \nthat State courts have the resources necessary to stay in compliance \nwith the Adoption and Safe Families Act. In my own home State of Ohio, \nthis money has been used to develop and implement an attorney \ncertification program in family law. Additionally, the CIP money has \nbeen used to implement the Court Appointed Special Advocate, CASA, \nProgram throughout Ohio and to implement five pilot programs that \nuniquely address family law issues.\n  Also, Senator Rockefeller and I have added a technical correction to \nthe bill that would clarify how adoption assistance payments are \ndistributed. Prior to January 23, 2001, title IV-E adoption assistance \npayments were available to parents adopting children who met three \nspecial needs criteria, regardless of whether a child was placed by a \nprivate agency or the State foster care system. Unfortunately, some \nprivate agencies were using only one of the three special needs \ncriteria to access payments for these adoptive families.\n  The January 23 adoption assistance decision draws a distinction \nbetween private and State foster care systems to prevent the misuse of \nfunds. However, the decision has had the unintended consequence of \nadversely affecting agencies such as Catholic Charities and their \nability to provide adoptive families with payments. Our correction \nfocuses on the children--not the placement agency--by making special \nneeds children adopted through voluntary relinquishment eligible for \nadoption assistance payments.\n  I am particularly pleased with some of the President's new \ninitiatives authorized in our bill. For example, the President has \nproposed that the Department of Health and Human Services be authorized \nto provide competitive grants to support mentoring programs for \nchildren of incarcerated parents. With more than 2 million children \nwith incarcerated parents, this program would provide valuable outreach \nto this vulnerable group of children.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting our bill today. This is a good \nbill. It is an important bill. It is a major step forward in our \ncontinuing efforts to protect all children in this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13142-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13142-S13143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMBASSADOR STEPHAN M. MINIKES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, \nI take this opportunity to welcome the recent swearing-in of Stephan M. \nMinikes to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, OSCE. Prior to that ceremony, I met with \nSteve to discuss priority issues on the Commission's agenda, including \nthe promotion of democracy, human rights and economic liberty as well \nas such pressing concerns as international crime and corruption and \ntheir links to terrorism.\n  The Commission remains keenly interested in the OSCE as a tool for \npromoting human rights and democratic development and advancing United \nStates interests in the expansive 55-nation OSCE region. The terrorist \nattacks of September 11 represented an assault on the principles of \ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law--core principles at the \nheart of the OSCE. It is crucial that we redouble our efforts to \nadvance these fundamental principles throughout the OSCE region even as \nwe pursue practical cooperation aimed at rooting out terrorism.\n  The OSCE provides an important framework for advancing these vital \nand complementary objectives.\n  I am confident that Steve will draw on his extensive and varied \nexperiences as he assumes his duties as U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE and \nI look forward to working with him and his team in Vienna.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary of State Powell's eloquent \nprepared remarks delivered at Ambassador Minikes' swearing-in ceremony \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at the Swearing-in of \n                           Stephan M. Minikes\n\n       Ambassador Ducaru, Distinguished Guests, welcome to The \n     Department of State.\n       It is my honor and pleasure today to swear-in a \n     distinguished civic leader as our next Ambassador to the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe: Steve \n     Minikes.\n       As a boy in Nazi Germany, Steve knew what it is like to \n     live under oppression. His relatives died in concentration \n     camps. He saw hate consume a country, ravage a continent, and \n     cause a world war. Later, he saw a devastated Europe divided \n     by force and a hot war replaced by a cold one. And since the \n     age of eleven, when he found his new home in America, Steve \n     Minikes has never for a minute taken freedom for granted--not \n     his or anyone else's.\n       And so, when President Bush selected Steve to be his \n     personal envoy to the OSCE, he knew that he was choosing a \n     person who would be deeply committed to the fundamental \n     principles of the Helsinki process.\n       The President knew that Steve needed no convincing that \n     human rights, the rule of law and democracy are inextricably \n     linked to prosperity, stability and security.\n       And the President knew that in Steve he was choosing \n     someone who would work hard and well to realize, in all its \n     fullness, the dream of a Europe whole and free.\n       And so, Ladies and Gentlemen, Steve Minikes will bring to \n     his new position a deep commitment to serve the country that \n     gave him a new life, and a strong determination to help the \n     continent of his birth attain its highest hopes.\n       And Steve will bring a lot more to the table besides. He \n     will bring expertise in and out of government that spans the \n     law, management, banking, trade, energy and defense. He will \n     bring a reputation for excellence and dedication that extends \n     from the corporate world to Capitol Hill, from the Pentagon \n     to the White House, as the presence here of friends from \n     Congress and from a wide range of federal agencies attests.\n       Steve also brings his experience as a Director of the \n     Washington Opera, which will serve him very well at OSCE. \n     Think about it. Conducting multilateral diplomacy with 54 \n     other sovereign countries--countries as big as Russia, \n     Germany and the United States on the one hand, and as small \n     as Liechtenstein, San Marino and Malta on the other. And each \n     of them with a veto. That's a lot like staging the elephant \n     scene from Aida--only easier.\n       The American people are truly fortunate that they can count \n     on a citizen as accomplished and admired as Steve to \n     represent them at so important a forum as the OSCE.\n       I know that Steve would be the first to agree with me, \n     however, when I say that we would not have been able to \n     contribute so much to his community and his country, had it \n     not been for the love and support of his family. I want to \n     especially welcome his partner in life, Dede and their \n     daughter Alexandra and her husband Julian. A warm greeting as \n     well to Dede's sister Jackie and brother Peter and their \n     families. I think they all deserve a round of applause.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen: Twenty-six years ago when President \n     Ford signed the Final Act in Helsinki, he said that the \n     Helsinki process would be judged not by the promises made but \n     by the promises kept.\n       Thanks in incalculable measure to the men and women who \n     braved totalitarian repression to ensure that the promises \n     made in Helsinki would be kept, all 55 members of the OSCE \n     are truly independent nations today, able to chart their own \n     course for a new century.\n       The promises made in Helsinki during the Cold War and \n     reaffirmed during the post-Cold War period, are still \n     fundamental to European security and cooperation in this \n     post-post Cold War world.\n       And, like all his predecessors from Gerald Ford to William \n     Clinton, President Bush is strongly committed to fulfilling \n     the promise of Helsinki.\n       The President and I are counting on you, Steve, to work \n     with our fellow member states, with the various OSCE \n     institutions that have been established, and, of course, with \n     the Members of the U.S. Commission on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, to that noble end.\n       Human rights and fundamental freedoms remain the heart and \n     soul of OSCE. Keep them in the spotlight. Democracy and the \n     rule of law are key to fighting hatred, extremism and \n     terrorism. Work with our OSCE partners, the Office for \n     Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the \n     Representative for Free Media to consolidate democratic \n     processes and promote freedom of expression. Help OSCE foster \n     ethnic tolerance. Help it protect human dignity by \n     strengthening efforts against trafficking in persons.\n       We also look to you, Steve, with your private sector \n     experience, to explore ways to develop OSCE's economic and \n     environmental dimensions. OSCE has done some good work on \n     corruption and good governance. Portugal, the incoming \n     Chairman-in-Office, has some interesting ideas on \n     transboundary water issues. Help us think about what else we \n     might do.\n       The President and I also depend on you to utilize and \n     strengthen OSCE's unique capacities for conflict prevention \n     and crisis management. To work with OSCE's High Commissioner \n     on National Minorities in addressing the root causes of \n     ethnic conflict. We will also look to you to support OSCE's \n     field missions which are contributing to stability from \n     Tajikistan to Kosovo.\n       In the security dimension of OSCE, good progress has been \n     made in meeting conventional force reduction commitments. We \n     will\n\n[[Page S13143]]\n\n     count on you, Steve, to help resolve the remaining issues. \n     The Voluntary Fund for Moldova is a valuable tool for getting \n     rid of weapons and ammunition. Keep using it.\n       OSCE's action plan will be valuable in fighting terrorism. \n     Implementation is critical. Keep the momentum going.\n       Institutionally speaking, OSCE's strengths remain its \n     flexibility, the high degree of political will that is \n     reflected in its consensus decisions, and the politically \n     binding nature of its commitments. As OSCE considers how it \n     might best adapt to changing needs, do not compromise these \n     strengths. Build upon them.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, next week, Steve and I will travel to \n     Bucharest for a meeting of the OSCE Ministerial Council. \n     There, the Chairmanship-in-Office will pass from the capable \n     hands of Romania into the able hands of Portugal. And I will \n     just as confidently witness the passing of the baton from \n     Ambassador Johnson to Ambassador Minikes.\n       There is a great deal of important work ahead for the OSCE. \n     There are still many promises to keep. And Steve, the \n     President and I know that you will help us keep them.\n       You and Dede have President Bush's and my best wishes as \n     you embark upon your new mission for our country.\n       And now it is my pleasure to administer the oath of office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13143-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FREE SPEECH IN CZECH REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity on Cooperation in Europe, I have a keen interest in the fight \nagainst organized crime and corruption in the 55-nation OSCE region. I \nhave raised this issue at the meetings of the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly, at Commission hearings, and in meetings with United States \nGovernment and foreign officials.\n  The impact of organized crime in the OSCE region is not limited to \nsome far-off land. Organized crime and corruption directly bear on \nUnited States security, economic, and political interests at home and \nabroad. And at the OSCE Summit held in Istanbul in 1999, the Heads of \nState and Government of the participating States recognized that \ncorruption poses a serious and great threat to OSCE shared values, \ncutting across security, economic, and human dimensions of the OSCE.\n  One of the best tools at our disposal in advancing the fight against \ncorruption is a free and independent press that can both investigate \nand report on possible corruption. Unfortunately, it is no surprise \nthat journalists who report on issues related to corruption sometimes \nfind themselves the victims of harassment and, in extreme cases, \nviolence.\n  Accordingly, I am disturbed by reports that the Czech Cabinet, led by \nPrime Minister Zeman, is seeking to have criminal charges brought \nagainst a political weekly, Respekt. Threats by the Prime Minister to \nshut down this publication followed the newspaper's coverage of the \nrelease of Transparency International's most recent report, Global \nCorruption Report 2001, in which the Czech Republic compared \nunfavorably to other former Communist countries in the region.\n  In fact, Peter Holub, the editor of Respekt, is not the only Czech \njournalist to get into hot water for trying to report on corruption. In \nJanuary 1998, journalist Zdenek Zukal was arrested in connection with \nhis reporting on alleged corruption in the locality of Olomouc and \ncharged with ``spreading alarming information.'' His case has dragged \non for some four years without resolution.\n  I understand the government's desire to get it's message out. But \ntrying to achieve that goal by muzzling journalists and threatening \nthem with jail time is not the way to do it. More to the point, it \nviolates the OSCE commitments the Czech Republic has freely undertaken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13143-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATIONS TO TEX HALL\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to \ncongratulate Chairman Tex Hall for his recent election as president of \nthe National Congress of American Indians. Tex is the chairman of Three \nAffiliated Tribes, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, in my State of \nNorth Dakota.\n  As my colleagues know, the NCAI is the Nation's oldest and largest \nadvocacy group representing Native Americans. I can vouch from my own \npersonal experience in working with Tex that he will be a strong and \npersistent voice on behalf of Native Americans. Over the years, Tex and \nI have worked together on such issues as Indian education, Indian \nhealth care, economic development, water needs in North Dakota, and \nother issues. Tex has always been fighting, and rightly so, to increase \nthe Federal Government's funding for Indian health, education, \ntransportation, and other programs. Federal funding in these areas has \nbeen woefully inadequate, and I have been glad to join him in this \nfight.\n  A story from just last year illustrates what a strong advocate Tex \nis. I was working very hard with Tex to secure funding for the Four \nBears Bridge, which is the only crossing point across the Missouri \nRiver for 150 miles and is especially important to the Fort Berthold \nReservation because it connects the two halves of the reservation. The \nPresident's budget requested only $5 million for design of the new \nbridge, and at first it looked like even keeping that level of funding \nwould be a challenge. After a lot of elbow grease, however, I was \npleased to call Tex to let him know that I had been able to secure $35 \nmillion, which was the full Federal Government share for the bridge's \ndesign and construction. I was pretty proud of this accomplishment, and \nof course, Tex thanked me very graciously. Then, like the true tribal \nadvocate that he is, he asked for more money.\n  Virtually his entire life, Tex has been a leader in one way or \nanother. For instance, he served 11 years as principal and \nsuperintendent of the Mandaree school, and was named North Dakota \n``Indian Educator of the Year'' in 1995. Prior to being elected tribal \nchairman in 1998, he served on the tribal business council for 3 years. \nHe currently serves on countless boards and task forces, representing \ntribal interests in just about every important area of Indian policy. \nAnd he has even had time for his cattle and buffalo ranching and to \nfound the All Nations High School Basketball Tournament and Tex Hall \nbasketball camps.\n  Tex's election as president of NCAI comes at a very important time in \nthe Federal Government's relationship with tribes. As is well \ndocumented, the Federal Government's century of mismanagement of Indian \ntrust funds and resources is coming to a head with Interior Secretary \nGale Norton's announcement of a reorganization of her Department's \ntrust responsibilities. Chairman Hall has jumped right in as president \nof NCAI and has been leading the fight to ensure that tribes are \nmeaningfully consulted before a plan with such enormous consequences is \nimplemented.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Tex in his new position on \nthe many important issues facing Indian country and Congress. I offer \nhim my congratulations and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13143-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13143-S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM C. WALTERS ON THE OCCASION OF HIS MOVE FROM THE \n      PACIFIC NORTHWEST TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE HEADQUARTERS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my Pacific Northwest colleagues \nand I have mixed emotions about the recent move of our friend Bill \nWalters to Washington, DC. Although he will be sorely missed in our \nregion, where he served in the Seattle office as deputy director for \nthe National Park Service's Pacific West region, we realize that he \nwill be playing a crucial role as associate to the Director for the \nNational Park Service in its headquarters office within the Department \nof the Interior. We wish him much success in this new posting.\n  After serving the Pacific Northwest so ably, Bill has demonstrated he \nis well suited for his new job. The regional leadership of the Park \nService call him the ``regional dad.'' He has a charming way of being \nable to take care of things and make everyone feel good about the \noutcome. I imagine this is what the Director of the Park Service \nimmediately sensed and why we lost a good person in the Northwest, but \ngained one at National Park Service Headquarters.\n  Bill arrived in Seattle in 1992, just as the new administration was \ntalking about downsizing. He shepherded a reasonable approach to \nefficient management, reducing the numbers of employees without an \nemployee losing his or\n\n[[Page S13144]]\n\nher job. More importantly, in consultation with me and other members of \nthe congressional delegation, he maintained an office in Seattle, which \nprovides direct service to the people of the Pacific Northwest.\n  The upheaval created by this reorganization was considerable. His \ncalm voice of reason and genuine compassion made it possible for all of \nus to work at finding improvement, efficiency, and value in maintaining \nan office in the Pacific Northwest.\n  It was through this difficult process that I became acquainted with \nBill. Since then, I have witnessed numerous examples of his good \njudgment and the gracious manner in which he brings people together \naround thoughtful solutions. He is a master statesman.\n  Bill is one of the few park professionals who has experience at the \nlocal, State, and Federal levels. This experience and his rare personal \nqualities make him a perfect negotiator and an effective steward of the \npublic trust. Bill developed a impressive working agreement with the \nState of Idaho for managing the city of Rocks National Reserve. I \nwitnessed his skill firsthand when we worked together in the creation \nof the city, county, and national partnership for Washington's Ebey's \nLanding National Reserve, which is bringing new vision and energy to \nthe management of this unique park.\n  He was instrumental in helping to forge the partnership that resulted \nin the Vancouver National Historic Reserve along the Columbia River in \nmy State of Washington. Without his personal involvement, the site \nwould still be mired in controversy. Instead, we have Federal, State, \nlocal, and private entities working together to support a site that has \n200 years of European history and countless years of pre-European \narcheology.\n  There is a quiet competence and goodness about this man that enables \nhim to work collaboratively with NGOs, environmental activists, \nemployees, allies, community leaders, and opponents alike. I have \nalways appreciated his honesty and forthright character. Many in the \nNorthwest have come to respect and appreciate Bill's open and engaging \nmanner and professionalism. Bill represents park interests in a way \nthat has made partners out of adversaries. You can't go very far in the \nPacific Northwest without seeing examples of Bill's effective problem \nsolving and sound stewardship.\n  We may have lost a skilled and trusted manager in the Northwest, but \nNational Park Service Director Fran Mainella has gained a valuable \nassociate who will serve her and the National Park Service well in the \nyears ahead. We all benefit by having this man of integrity in \nGovernment service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13144-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HAROLD SCHAFER: A NORTH DAKOTA ORIGINAL\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of my State's leading citizens \nhas passed away and I want to reflect on what can only be described as \na triumphant life. I extend my sympathy to his family in this time of \ngrief. But I know his family is also celebrating his full life.\n  Harold Schafer is the classic story of a poor youth who became \nsuccessful through old-fashioned entrepreneurship and flat-out hard \nwork. He deserves our respect for that, but, more importantly, we ought \nto take note of what he did with his wealth.\n  Harold Schafer would not permit his capital to pile up in trust \nfunds, and stock portfolios, and real estate investments. To what will \nbe his ever-lasting credit, he worked just as hard at disbursing his \nmoney to good causes as he initially did earning it. The recipients of \nhis generosity are legion, colleges and communities and authors and \npark boards and hospitals and youth groups and a cavalcade of \nindividuals who needed a hand.\n  Most memorable is his re-creation of the historic and romantic cow \ntown of Medora. Cradled in the spectacular Badlands of North Dakota, \nit's become the State's primary tourist designation. Because of the \nenormous investment and creative imagination that Harold Schafer poured \ninto rejuvenating it, this storied village, a place where Teddy \nRoosevelt once lived, has become symbolic of the Old West. Harold \nSchafer's resurrection and promotion of Medora has made it a jewel of \nNorth Dakota's heritage and will forever be the crowning achievement of \nhis life.\n  Harold Schafer has left us, but he has given us Medora, a sweet, \nhandsome, proud, and historic place. There can be no question but that \nHarold is pleased with this very special legacy and North Dakotans are \nthankful indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13144-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13144-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13144-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:44 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide for the continuation of higher education \nthrough the conveyance of certain public lands in the State of Alaska \nto the University of Alaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the University of Alaska, the \nUniversity, is Alaska's oldest post-secondary school. The University \nwas chartered prior to statehood and has played a vital role in \neducating Alaskans as well as students from around the world. But the \nUniversity of Alaska is also an important asset for our Nation. Today \nit provides a leadership role in Arctic Science and Arctic Engineering \nResearch. Bringing Arctic energy to the Nation has required new \nbreakthroughs in technology and engineering and our need to better \nunderstand global climate change has placed a high value of studying \nthe Arctic where climate changes are most easily detected.\n  Additionally, the University has served as an important cornerstone \nin Alaska's history. For example, the University housed the Alaska \nConstitutional Convention where the fathers of statehood carved out the \nrights and privilege guaranteed to Alaska's citizens. Further, the \nUniversity of Alaska is proud of the fact that it began life as the \nAlaska Agricultural and Mining College. However, what makes the \nUniversity of Alaska truly unique is the fact that it is the only land \ngrant college in the Nation that is virtually landless.\n  As my colleagues know, one of the oldest and most respected ways of \nfinancing America's educational system has been the land grant system. \nEstablished in 1785, this practice gives land to schools and \nuniversities for their use in supporting their educational endeavors. \nIn 1862, Congress passed the Morrill Act which created the land grant \ncolleges and universities as a way to underwrite the cost of higher \neducation to more and more Americans. These colleges and universities \nreceived land from the Federal Government for facility location and, \nmore importantly, as\n\n[[Page S13147]]\n\na way to provide sustaining revenues to these educational institutions.\n  The University of Alaska received the smallest amount of land of any \nState, with the exception of Delaware, that has a land grant college. \nEven the land grant college in Rhode Island received more land from the \nFederal Government than has the University of Alaska. In a state the \nsize of Alaska, we should logically have one of the best and most fully \nfunded land grant colleges in the country. Unfortunately, without the \nland promised under the land grant allocation system and earlier \nlegislation, the University is unable to share as one of the premier \nland grant colleges in the country.\n  Previous efforts in Congress were made to fix this problem. These \nefforts date back to 1915, less than 50 years after the passage of the \nMorrill Act, when Alaska's Delegate James Wickersham shepherded a \nmeasure through Congress that set aside potentially more than a quarter \nof a million acres, in the Tanana Valley outside of Fairbanks, for the \nsupport of an agricultural college and school of mines. Following the \npractice established in the lower 48 for other land grant colleges, \nWickersham's bill set aside every Section 33 of the unsurveyed Tanana \nValley for the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines. \nAlaska's educational future looked very bright.\n  Many Alaskans saw the opportunity to set up an endowment system \nsimilar to that established by the University of Washington in the \ndowntown center of Seattle, where valuable University lands are leased \nand provide funding for the University of Washington which uses those \nrevenues in turn to provide for its programs and facilities.\n  Before that land could be transferred to the Alaska Agricultural \nCollege and School of Mines, renamed the University of Alaska in 1935, \nthe land had to be surveyed in order to establish the exact acreage \nincluded in the reserved land. The sections reserved for education \ncould not be transferred to the College until they had been delineated. \nAccording to records of the time, it was unlikely, given the incredibly \nslow speed of surveying, that the land could be completely surveyed \nbefore the 21st century. Surveying was and is an extraordinarily slow \nprocess in Alaska's remote and unpopulated terrain. In all, only 19 \nsections of land, approximately 11,211 acres, were ever transferred to \nthe University. Of this amount, 2,250 were used for the original campus \nand the remainder was left to support educational opportunities.\n  Recognizing the difficulties of surveying in Alaska, subsequent \nlegislation was passed in 1929 that simply granted land for the benefit \nof the University. This grant totaled approximately 100,000 acres and \nto this day comprises the bulk of the University's roughly 112,000 \nacres of land, less than one-third of what it was originally promised. \nIn 1958, the Alaska Statehood Act was passed which extinguished the \noriginal land grants for all lands that remained unsurveyed. Thus, the \nUniversity was left with little land with which to support itself and \nthus is unable to completely fulfill its mission as a land grant \ncollege.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would redeem the promises made \nto the University in 1915 and put it on an even footing with the other \nland grant colleges in the United States. The bill provides the \nUniversity with the land needed to support itself financially and \noffers it the chance to grow and continue to act as a responsible \nsteward of the land and educator of our young people. The legislation \nalso provides a concrete timetable under which the University must \nselect its lands and the Secretary of the Interior must act upon those \nselections.\n  This legislation also contains significant restrictions on the land \nthe University can select. The University cannot select land located \nwithin a Conservation System Unit. The University cannot select old \ngrowth timber lands in the Tongass National Forest. Finally, the \nUniversity cannot select land validly conveyed to the State or an ANCSA \ncorporation, or land used in connection with federal or military \ninstitutions.\n  Additionally, under my bill the University must relinquish extremely \nvaluable inholdings in Alaska once it receives its State/Federal \nselection awarded under Section 2 of this bill. Therefore, the result \nof this legislation will mean the relinquishment of prime University \ninholdings in such magnificent areas as the Alaska Peninsula & Maritime \nNational Wildlife Refuge, The Kenai Fjords National Park, Wrangell St. \nElias National Park and Preserve, and Glacier Bay National Park. So, \nnot only does this bill uphold a decades old promise to the University \nof Alaska, it provides the Secretary of the Interior the opportunity to \nacquire thousands of acres of inholdings that will further protect \nAlaska's parks and refuges.\n  Specifically, this Section 2 of the bill would grant to the \nUniversity up to 250,000 acres of federal land. Additionally, Section 5 \nof the bill establishes a matching program so that the University would \nbe eligible to receive up to an additional 250,000 acres on a matching \nbasis, acre-for-acre, with the State. This, obviously, would be done \nthrough the state legislative process involving the Governor, the \nLegislature, and the University's Board of Regents. The State matching \nprovision is an important component of this legislation. Most agree \nwith the premise that the University was shorted land. However, some \nbelieve it is solely the responsibility of the State to grant the \nUniversity land. The legislation I am introducing today offers a \ncompromise giving both the State and the Federal Government the \nopportunity to contribute while at the same time providing the Federal \nGovernment with thousands of aces of valuable inholdings in parks and \nrefuges.\n  Finally, this bill contains a provision that incorporates a concept \nput forth by the Governor of Alaska. This provision directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to attempt to conclude an agreement with the \nUniversity and the Governor of Alaska providing for sharing NPRA \nleasing revenues in lieu of land selections to prevent the University \nfrom obtaining more than ten percent of such annual revenues or more \nthan nine million dollars each fiscal year. If an agreement is reached \nand provides for disposition of some portion of NPRA mineral leasing \nrevenues to the University, the Secretary shall submit the proposed \nagreement to Congress for ratification. If the Secretary fails to reach \nan agreement within two years of enactment, or if Congress fails to \nratify such agreement within three years from enactment, the University \nmay select up to 92,000 of its 250,000 initial land grant from lands \nwithin NPRA north of latitude 69.\n  Therefore, this bill has been substantially changed from versions \nintroduced in previous Congresses in two dramatic ways. First, in \nresponse to concerns from the Administration and environmental \norganizations the old growth areas of the Tongass National Forest are \noff limits for selection by the University. The only areas of the \nTongass that could be selected by the University are those areas \npreviously harvested. It is important that the University be allowed to \nselect lands in this area as having the ability to study and manage as \nsuch areas are important tools for the University's School of Forestry.\n  The second substantial change to the bill, which was previously \nnoted, is the revenue sharing component. This aspect provides an \nalternative means of providing for the needs of the University. With \nthe passage of this bill, the University of Alaska will finally be able \nto act fully as a land grant college. It will be able to select lands \nthat can provide the University with a stable revenue source as well as \nprovide responsible stewardship for the land.\n  This is an exciting time for the University of Alaska. The promise \nthat was made more than 80 years ago could be fulfilled by passage of \nthis legislation, and Alaskans could look forward to a very bright \nfuture for the University of Alaska and those seeking an education or \nto conduct research.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Milulski):\n  S. 1818. A bill to ensure that a Federal employee who takes leave \nwithout pay in order to perform service as a member of the uniformed \nservices or member of the National Guard shall continue to receive pay \nand allowances such individual is receiving for such service, will be \nno less than the basic pay such individual would then be receiving if \nno interruption in employment has occurred; to the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs.\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I would like to discuss the \nfinancial burden faced by many of the men and women who serve in the \nmilitary Reserves or National Guard and who are forced to take unpaid \nleave from their jobs when called to active duty. While these \nindividuals receive pay for the time they are on active duty, it is \noften significantly less than what they receive in their normal jobs. \nIt is unfair to ask the men and women who have volunteered to serve \ntheir country, often in dangerous situation, to also face a financial \nstrain on their families.\n  A number of employers have wisely acted to remedy this hardship by \nestablishing a financial compensation plan for their employees in the \nReserves or National Guard. In response to the recent terrorist attacks \nof September 11, the Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank N.V., one of the \nworld's largest banks, has set up a special pay differential program to \nprovide their employees in the Reserves and National Guard compensation \nequaling the income they would normally have to forfeit when called to \nactive duty. LaSalle Bank, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO in Chicago, has \nalready seen this program help 12 reservists in its ranks. The \nspokesperson for LaSalle described the program as something the company \nwanted to do ``to be supportive of the country's efforts''.\n  Let us take similar action in Washington and set an example for \nemployers throughout the country. Today, I am introducing with my \ncolleague from Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Reservist Pay \nSecurity Act of 2001, legislation that will help alleviate the \nfinancial problems faced by many Federal employees who serve in the \nReserves and must take time off from their jobs when called to active \nduty. This bill would allow these employees to maintain their normal \nsalary when called to active service by requiring Federal agencies to \nmake up the difference between their military pay and what they would \nhave earned on their Federal job.\n  As the symbol of American values and ideals, the Federal Government \nshould give these special employees of our government more than just \nwords of support. We should not encourage Americans to protect their \ncountry and then punish those who enlist in the armed forces by taking \naway a large segment of the salary. We must provide our reservist \nemployees with financial support so that they can leave their civilian \nlives to serve in the military without worrying about the financial \nwell-being of their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n        Cochran, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1819. A bill to provide that members of the Armed Forces \nperforming services in the Republic of Korea shall be entitled to tax \nbenefits in same manner as if such services were performed in a combat \nzone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senators Sessions, Cleland, Cochran, and Dayton that simply \nensures that personnel serving in Korea get the same tax benefits as \npersonnel serving in other forward deployed areas of the world such as \nKuwait and the Balkans. I am hoping that this legislation can be added \nto the economic stimulus package, but if not, I want to make other \nSenators aware of the need to take this action for the brave men and \nwomen serving in Korea.\n  We cannot fix all of the quality of life problems in Korea overnight, \nbut we can at least provide basic equity in the tax treatment of \nmilitary personnel who serve there so that they get the same benefits \nthose in Kuwait and the Balkans get.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the facts that led us to \ndecide that this tax equity is needed and is needed now.\n  While we have representatives of every service in Korea, the bulk of \nour force is from the Army. Seventeen percent of the entire Army is \nstationed in, on orders to, or returning from the Republic of Korea at \nany given time. That's about 37,000 soldiers.\n  Unlike most Army postings, which tend to be for six months, ninety-\nsix percent of those stationed in Korea are there for at least one year \nof unaccompanied duty. In some Army specialities, personnel are asked \nto serve for far more than one unaccompanied, year-long tour in Korea, \nwhich encourages experienced personnel to leave the Army.\n  Duty tours in Korea involve longer separations from family, under \nworse quality of life conditions than almost any other overseas Army \npost, in a military zone that is clearly hostile, for less pay. This is \na serious moral issue. Let me give you an example, a typical E-5 will \nmake $5,136 less, $2,292 in Federal taxes that must be paid and not \ngetting the $2,844 separation ration if sent to Korea rather than the \nBalkans. Our men and women in the military do not serve to become rich, \nbut people notice and morale suffers when one assignment means working \nin poor conditions for a year and taking a $5,000 pay-cut.\n  When I say the conditions are poor, I want people to know that I am \nnot exaggerating. The quality of life in Korea is recognized as \nsubstantially lower than other overseas posts and far lower than within \nthe United States. Consider that orders for Korea have the highest \ncommand declination rate and the highest ``no show'' rate in the Army.\n  Even worse, look at the housing situation. Only ten percent of the \ncommand sponsored service members serving in Korea can be housed, and \nthat housing is generally substandard. Compare this to seventy-two \npercent of forces deployed to Japan and seventy-four percent of forces \nin Europe having housing available.\n  Let me explain what I mean by substandard housing in Korea. The same \nQuonset huts built in the 1950s as temporary structures are still being \nused in 2001 to house troops today. Those huts are being shared by 4 or \nmore personnel, often at a level of Sergeant or higher, which is well \nbelow standard quarters for such rank.\n  I visited those Quonset huts when I traveled to Korea in August. I \nsaw the sand bags they have to put out when it rains to prevent major \nflooding. I witnessed the cramped living quarters; even worse than my \nfreshman college dorm room. I have heard that when winter comes, and \nKorean winters are famous for their severity, these buildings are much \nlike living in an igloo.\n  Our troops make the best of this deplorable situation, but they \ndeserve some relief. These are the men and women on whom we rely to \ndeter North Korean aggression on a peninsula that is still technically \nin a state of war.\n  Because the tour of duty is unaccompanied for ninety-six percent of \nthe service members there, most of the approximately 21,000 married \nmilitary personnel in Korea are forced to maintain 2 households. The \nsubstandard accommodations available force significant out-of-pocket \nexpenses for basic items like food for both households, phone access, \ntransportation, and other items basic to other posts. The Command \nestimates that $3,000 to $5,000 per year are spent by deployed \npersonnel on these ``hidden costs.'' Any family that has had to budget \nknows that this is a significant economic burden at a time when these \nfamilies are already enduring a year of separation.\n  It is no wonder that the Army has trouble filling billets in Korea. \nIf you combine the tax disparity and the ``hidden costs'', a mid-level \nE-5 will make $8,000 to $10,000 less if deployed to Korea versus the \nBalkans or Kuwait. This is unacceptable, and it is something that we \ncan fix now. The command estimates that granting pay equity would cost \napproximately $85 million a year. That is surely the least we owe the \nfine men and women serving in Korea today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1820. A bill to enhance authorities relating to emergency \npreparedness grants; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the horrific events of September 11 \nunderscore in red the heroism of the men and women who put their lives \non the line every day, the courageous fire fighters and police officers \nof this Nation, the domestic defenders of America. Each and every day, \nfire fighters and police officers wake up knowing that they may have to \nrun into burning buildings or respond to chemical or biological \nattacks. As thousands and thousands of\n\n[[Page S13149]]\n\npeople were running for their lives out of the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon, police officers and fire fighters were running in the \nopposite direction, into the danger and toward the people who could not \nsave themselves. Tragically, many of those first responders did not \ncome out. Sixty police officers and 344 fire fighters are missing or \nhave been declared dead in the World Trade Center attacks. The majority \nof the fire fighters who responded to the first five alarms of the \nterrorist attacks, including the city's entire search and rescue fleet \nof five squad companies, were in the Twin Towers when they collapsed. \nThey are, by any definition, heroes.\n  We ask for a tremendous amount of responsibility from a small group \nof people. Fire fighters and police officers are the first responders \nto almost every tragedy imaginable. From car accidents to plane \ncrashes, from kitchen fires to towering infernos, from domestic \ndisputes to hazardous material spills, we depend upon their service and \ntraining each and every day. This Nation's fire fighters and police \nofficers stand ready to respond to the needs of America. The terrible \ntragedy of September 11 is a daily reminder of how critical it is that \nAmerica respond to the needs of its first responders.\n  For the last three months our Nation has focused on how we may best \nincrease the security of our borders. During this time, experts on \nterrorism have warned us to think outside the box, that if we fail to \ndo so, this Nation will put itself in the vulnerable position of \nforever responding to the last terrorist attack. The number of anthrax \ncases is a warning in red that biological and chemical agents are \navailable as weapons of mass destruction. Given this fact, the capacity \nof our police officers and fire fighter to respond quickly to \nemergencies involving hazardous materials becomes more important than \never.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation administers the Emergency \nPreparedness Grants Program, which helps State local governments train \npolice and fire fighters to respond to hazmat emergencies. Currently \nthat program is funded at $14 million, and the money comes from \nregistration fees paid by certain hazmat carriers and shippers. Given \nthe growing need for expertise in handling hazardous materials, the $14 \nmillion pot of money is clearly inadequate. It is estimated that \ncurrent funding can provide training to only about 120,000 emergency \npersonnel a year out of a pool of almost 3 million. Grants to local \ngovernments are small, ranging from $100,000 to $300,000 on average. In \nfact, a recent Washington Post article stated that Washington, D.C. is \nsupposed to have a fire department team to respond to a chemical or \nbiological attack, but according to the article, its members rarely \ntrain, and are used instead for routine firefighting.\n  Because money has never been fully allocated for hazmat training \ngrants, there is a current $15 million surplus in the Emergency \nPreparedness Grants Program. This is $15 million which could be going \nfor critical first responder training. Today I am joined by Senators \nRockefeller and Wyden in introducing the Heroic Emergency Response \nOperations Act, the HERO bill, which would allow the Department of \nTransportation to access the $15 million in surplus funds, at no cost \nto the taxpayer, and disperse the lion's share of this money to State \nand local governments for hazmat training of the men and women who are \nat ground zero during emergencies involving hazardous materials.\n  Under our legislation, $1 million of the $15 million surplus would be \nauthorized to go to the International Association of Fire Fighters, \nIAFF, which provides specialized hazmat training free of charge to \nlocal fire departments. According to the IAFF, funding of $1 million \nper year would quadruple the number of fire fighters who receive the \nnecessary training to safeguard their health and safety as well as that \nof the citizens they protect during emergency response at or along our \nNation's transportation corridor. In addition, the HERO bill would also \nrequire the Department of Transportation to develop national standards \nfor security training related to the deliberate release of hazardous \nmaterials used as weapons of mass destruction. These standards would be \nin addition to the existing standards which address emergency response \nto accidental hazmat spills which may occur during the transportation \nof hazardous materials.\n  In this era of potential chemical and biological attacks, we need to \ndo everything we can to ensure that our local police officers and fire \nfighters receive the proper training to do the difficult job we ask \nthem to do. We in Congress must do all we can to help the first \nresponders of this Nation because they do everything they can to help \nus, including giving their lives in the line of duty, as we are \npainfully reminded by the tragic events of September 11. Our \nlegislation is endorsed by the International Association of Fire \nFighters, IAFF, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, \nIBPO. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the HERO bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to the printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                S. 1820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ENHANCEMENT OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Security Training for Transportation of Hazardous \n     Material.--Subsection (i) of section 5116 of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) to develop minimum national standards for, and to \n     develop and conduct, security training relating to the \n     transportation of hazardous material in commerce, except that \n     not more than 5 percent of the amount in the account \n     available in any fiscal year may be used for activities under \n     this paragraph.''.\n       (b) Amount Available for Supplemental Training Grants.--\n     Subsection (j) of that section is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) The amount made available each fiscal year from the \n     account under subsection (i)(1) for grants under this \n     subsection shall be $1,000,000.''.\n       (c) Availability of Funds Generally.--Notwithstanding any \n     limitation in section 5127 of title 49, United States Code, \n     or in any appropriations Act (including any appropriations \n     Act enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act), all \n     fees collected pursuant to section 5108 of that title, \n     including any fees collected before the date of the enactment \n     of this Act that remain available for obligation, shall be \n     available for obligation, without further appropriation in \n     accordance with section 5116(i) of that title, as amended by \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to join my \nfriend from Georgia, Senator Cleland, in cosponsoring the Heroic \nEmergency Response Operations, or HERO, Act. The legislation we \nintroduce today honors individuals whom the tragic events of the past \nfew months have truly shown to be heroes, our firefighters and police \nofficers. The HERO Act honors these men and women by providing grants \nto State and local governments to allow there dedicated public servants \nto be trained in the proper handling of hazardous materials \nemergencies.\n  The HERO Act expands upon the existing Department of Transportation, \nDOT, Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Grants, which are \nintended to provide financial and technical assistance to enhance State \nand local hazardous materials planning and training. The program is \nauthorized to distribute up to $14 million in fees that have been \ncollected from shippers and carriers of hazardous materials to \nemergency responders for hazmat training. Unfortunately, this money has \nnever been fully allocated to this important endeavor, and there is now \na $15 million surplus.\n  The HERO Act will allow the Secretary of Transportation to access \nthis $15 million in surplus funds and use it for its intended purpose. \nAdditionally, the HERO Act authorizes that $1 million of the surplus \nfunds go to the International Association of Fire Fighters, (IAFF), \nwhich offers a specialized program of hazmat training, free of charge, \nto firefighters across the country. The IAFF is the only organization \ncurrently offering this specialized hazmat training, and the additional \nfunding will quadruple the number of firefighters with access to it.\n  In the course of learning some important, but painful, lessons during \nthe\n\n[[Page S13150]]\n\npast few months, our nation has had the opportunity to focus on some \npositives that we may have taken for granted. As surely as the epic \ntragedies of September 11 made us aware of the unspeakable evil in the \nworld, it also gave us great pride in the heroes in our midst. When an \nanthrax-laden letter contaminated the offices of the Majority Leader \nand others, we came to understand our vulnerability to chemical and \nbiological terrorism. At the same time, we came to more fully \nappreciate the dedication of the Capitol Police, and the highly trained \nbiohazard units from several agencies of the Federal Government and the \narmed forces. I am among a group of displaced Senators and staff \nanxiously waiting for these experts to determine that the Hart Building \nis safe to re-enter, and I am confident that when we do go back in, the \nhealth of Senators and staff members will have been safeguarded by \nthese brave men and women.\n  I believe it is our duty as members of Congress to see to it that \nwhen firefighters and police officers anywhere in the country respond \nto an accident, crime, or act of terrorism that has resulted in the \nrelease of hazardous materials, these heroes have the proper training \nto protect themselves and the general public. I further believe it is \nunconscionable that while hazmat teams in every State in the Union go \nwithout this much-needed training, this stockpile of money sits unused \nin the Treasury.\n  Even before the events of the past few months highlighted the need \nfor enhanced and expanded hazardous materials training, DOT and the \nIAFF were training as many emergency personnel as possible. However, at \nits current level of funding, the Emergency Preparedness Grants Program \ncan only provide hazmat training to approximately 120,000 of the \nnation's 3 million emergency workers each year. Given what has \nhappened, it should be obvious that the need for specialized hazmat \ntraining has quickly outpaced the money currently available. This \nleaves emergency workers in big cities and small towns in the untenable \nsituation of knowing the risks they face, but lacking the proper \ntraining to react appropriately.\n  The legislation I am cosponsoring with Senator Cleland offers an \nexcellent solution to this problem. At no cost to taxpayers, the HERO \nAct will allow many thousands of emergency personnel to receive \nhazardous materials training that they would not otherwise be able to \nreceive. Further, it will require DOT to develop minimal national \nstandards for providing security training to those who transport \nhazardous materials in commerce, which should reduce the likelihood \nthat emergency personnel will have to put their lives at risk to \nprotect us. I commend Senator Cleland for his work on this issue, and I \nwholeheartedly recommend it to my colleagues. I believe the Congress \nshould enact this bill at its earliest opportunity, and that the \nPresident should sign it into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Smith of Oregon, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1825. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to provide \nfinancial assistance to the States of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \nCalifornia, and Idaho and tribes in the region for salmon habitat \nrestoration projects in coastal waters and upland drainages, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be introducing the \nPacific Salmon Recovery Act to grant Federal funding for salmon \nrecovery efforts in California, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. \nThe Salmon Recovery Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide \n$350 million during each of the next six fiscal years to these five \nwestern States and the Tribes in that region.\n  In California, as in much of the West, wild salmon stocks have \ncollapsed. Their precipitous decline is the result of habitat \ndestruction, overfishing, pollution, and dams that block the passage of \nfish to and from their spawning areas. The results have been tragic. \nFishermen have lost their jobs. Tribes have lost species that are their \nreligious and cultural icons. And, the environment is suffering.\n  This bill would help to remedy these problems by investing in the \nrestoration of these economic and culturally important fish. \nSpecifically, it will provide funds to support projects in coastal \nwaters and river habitats that will help restore and recover wild \nsalmon. It directs that priority be given to the restoration of species \nlisted as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. It \nestablishes criteria to ensure that funds are not wasted on projects \nthat will not benefit fish. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to \ndevelop a process for peer reviewing proposed projects to ensure that \nonly scientifically sound projects receive funding. And, it requires \nStates and Tribes to provide an annual spending plan to Congress as \nwell as a one-time comprehensive plan for salmon restoration.\n  It is important to note that Idaho and the Tribes will finally be \neligible for Pacific Salmon Recovery Fund dollars as a result of this \nbill. There is no justification for them to have been excluded in the \npast. Additionally, this bill requires that the funds be divided \nequally among the 5 States. This will ensure that the funding \ndistribution is not distorted by political pressures.\n  I am particularly pleased that the supporters of this bill come from \nacross the political spectrum. I am joined in the introduction of this \nbill by Senators Craig, R-ID, Crapo, R-ID, Wyden, D-OR, Smith, R-OR, \nand Feinstein, D-CA. We worked together for many months to craft this \nlegislation. We were ultimately successful because we all share the \nsame goal, saving wild salmon.\n  Finally, this bill illustrates clearly that our economy and our \nenvironment are linked. I have always said we cannot have a healthy \neconomy without a healthy environment. In restoring the salmon, we will \nalso be restoring the economy of many communities in the West that are, \nor were, dependent on healthy salmon runs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pacific Salmon Recovery \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide permanent authorization for International \nLabor Affairs Bureau to continue and enhance their work to alleviate \nchild labor and improve respect for internationally recognized worker \nrights and core labor standards, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, laws are only as effective as their \nimplementation and enforcement. That is why today I am introducing the \nFair International Standards in Trade and Investment Act of 2001 along \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senator Kennedy, chairman of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and Senator \nBaucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  This legislation will provide much-needed policy direction to the \nU.S. Labor Department DOL, and enhance the standing and capacity of the \nInternational Labor Affairs Bureau, ILAB, within that Department in the \nformulation and conduct of our nation's international economic \npolicies. With these tools, ILAB can better inform and equip U.S. \npolicy-makers in all three branches of our Federal Government to assist \nand induce our foreign trading partners to enforce their own national \nlaws against abusive child labor and to comply with thirteen U.S. laws \nthat have been enacted since 1983 which link U.S. trade, investment, \nand aid policies to the elimination of abusive child labor and growing \ninternational respect for the other internationally-recognized worker \nrights and core labor standards.\n  Currently, ILAB does not have any underlying, permanent statutory \nauthority for any of its international activities. It simply operates \nas an adjunct to the personal office of the Secretary of Labor. \nPractically speaking, this gives ILAB very little clout in inter-agency \npolicy-making and no real voice to insist on better enforcement of the \nchild labor provisions and other worker rights provisions in U.S. law, \ninternational law, or any of the bilateral trade and investment \nagreements that America has with more than 150 foreign countries.\n  The time has come for better equipping our government and the rest of \nthe world with urgently-needed tools to constructively link compliance \nwith child labor laws and other basic worker rights to the conduct of \ncontinued trade and investment liberalization. We need new thinking and \nnew resolve to crackdown on abusive child labor throughout the global \neconomy and to beef up protection of internationally-recognized worker \nrights and core labor standards. If enacted, this legislation will lay \na solid statutory foundation underneath ILAB. It will empower ILAB to \nhelp ensure that as our Nation enters into additional trade and \ninvestmennt agreements, that those new agreements as well as all of our \npre-existing agreements serve to raise the living standards and protect \nthe rights of working people as well as corporate managers and \ninvestors.\n  I have spent more than a decade in this Senate leading the charge \nagainst the commercial exploitation of children in the workplace at \nhome and abroad. Just last year, the Congress enacted provisions I \nauthored in the Trade and Development Act of 2000 which prohibit trade \npreferences and duty-free access to the U.S. marketplace for any \ntrading nation that is not meeting its international legal obligations \nto eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Now we have to make \ncertain that these new provisions and our other trade-linked worker \nrights laws are practically enforced and that means improving ILAB's \ncapacity to meet this increasingly-immportant responsibility.\n  In the final analysis, increased trade and investment are not ends in \nthemselves. They are means for achieving more broad-based, sustainable \ndevelopment and greater economic and social justice in the global \neconomy. Our real choice is not between free trade or protectionism. \nOur policy challenge is to identify new and constructive ways in which \nthe power of government can be used to manage globalization in ways \nthat curb abusive child labor and protect worker rights as much as \nproperty rights. A well-grounded and enhanced ILAB within the one \nCabinet department in our government that was created to advance the \nneeds and protect the fundamental rights of working people everywhere \ncan help us meet this challenge for the 21st century and beyond.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1828. A bill to amend subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84 \nof title 5, United States Code, to include Federal prosecutors within \nthe definition of a law enforcement officer, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, with my good friend \nSenator Hatch, the Federal Prosecutors' Retirement Benefit Equity Act \nof 2001. This bill would correct an inequity that exists under current \nlaw, whereby Federal prosecutors receive substantially less favorable \nretirement benefits than other nearly all other people involved in the \nFederal criminal justice system. The bill would increase the retirement \nbenefits given to Assistant United States Attorneys by including them \nas ``law enforcement officers'' ``LEOs'', under the Federal Employees' \nRetirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System. The bill \nwould also allow the Attorney General to designate other attorneys \nemployed by the Department of Justice who act primarily as criminal \nprosecutors as LEO's for purposes of receiving these retirement \nbenefits.\n  The primary reason for granting enhanced retirement benefits to LEOs \nis the often dangerous work of law enforcement. Currently, Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, ``AUSAs'', and other Federal prosecutors are \nnot eligible for these enhanced benefits, which are enjoyed by the vast \nmajority of other employees in the criminal justice system. This \nexclusion is unjustified. The relevant provisions of the United States \nCode dealing with retirement benefits define an LEO as an employee \nwhose duties are, ``primarily the investigation, apprehension, or \ndetention'' of individuals suspected or convicted of violating Federal \nlaw. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331(20) and 8401(17). AUSAs and other \nFederal prosecutors participate in planning investigations, \ninterviewing witnesses both inside and outside of the office setting, \ndebriefing defendants, obtaining warrants, negotiating plea agreements \nand representing the government at trials and sentencings, all of which \nfall within the definition of the duties performed by law enforcement \nofficers. Indeed, once a defendant is brought into the criminal justice \nsystem, the person with whom they have the most fact-to-face contact, \nand often in an extremely confrontational environment, is the Federal \nprosecutor.\n  Although prosecutors do not personally execute arrests, searches and \nother physically dangerous activities, LEO status is accorded to many \ncriminal justice employees who do not perform such tasks, such as \npretrial services officers and probation officers and accountants, \ncooks and secretaries of the Bureau of Prisons. Moreover, because they \nare often the most conspicuous representatives of the government in the \ncriminal justice system, Federal prosecutors are natural targets for \nthreats of reprisals by vengeful criminals. Indeed, there are numerous \nincidents in which assaults and serious death threats have been made \nagainst Federal prosecutors, sometimes resulting in significant \ndisruption of their personal and family lives.\n  Only recently a veteran Federal prosecutor in the Western District of \nWashington was murdered in his home, and, although the crime remains \nunsolved, based upon the facts of the case the authorities have \nreferred to the crime as a hit. In addition, I have received many other \naccounts from Federal prosecutors regarding specific threats to which \nthey and their families have been subjected because of the performance \nof their duties. Federal prosecutors have written to me that they have \nbeen forced to relocate themselves and their families due to death \nthreats; that they have been assaulted; that they and their families \nhave been followed by members of criminal organizations; that have been \nforced to install security systems at their homes and to change \ntheir routes to and from the office to protect their safety and the \nsafety of their families.\n\n  As our war against terrorism continues, Federal prosecutors will be \non the front lines once again as the symbols of our criminal justice \nsystem, and\n\n[[Page S13154]]\n\nunfortunately therefore the targets of those who seek its downfall. \nAmong other tasks, the Attorney General has designated AUSA's to play a \nmajor role working with police and Federal agents in forming each \njudicial district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force. One Federal prosecutors \nwrote to me stating that shortly after his name was in the local news \nas heading his district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force and he had spoken \nto his family about taking suitable precautions, that his young son \ncame into his bedroom one night holding a hockey stick for protection \nasking about their safety. Thus, Federal prosecutors and their families \nwill deal more than ever with a level of stress and danger that \njustifies their being treated as LEOs.\n  Enhanced retirement benefits are also justified by the Federal \nGovernment's need for experienced prosecutors to bring ever more \nsophisticated cases under increasingly complex Federal criminal laws. \nIn recent years, we have seen the growth of complex Federal prosecutors \nto combat the threats posed by organized crime, drug cartels, terrorist \ngroups and other sophisticated criminals. The prosecution of such \ndifficult cases is best handled by experienced prosecutors. It is \ntherefore in the public interest to provide reasonable financial \nincentives for talented, experienced prosecutors to remain in \ngovernment service.\n  This bill would make Assistant United States Attorneys and other \nFederal prosecutors designated by the Attorney General eligible for \nimmediate, unreduced retirement benefits at age 50 with 20 years of \nservice. For example, prosecutors who are covered by the Civil Service \nRetirement System would receive 50 percent of the average of their \nthree highest years' salary. At the same time, it would exempt \nprosecutors from the mandatory retirement provisions that require other \nlaw enforcement officers to retire at age 57. Because the loss of \nphysical strength and agility does not adversely affect a person's \nability to function as a prosecutor, there is no reason to mandate \nearly retirement.\n  Two important features of this bill will contain its costs. First, \nthe bill provides that incumbent Federal prosecutors are themselves \nresponsible for making up the difference in individual contributions \nowed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for their \nprior service. An incumbent has the choice of making up this difference \neither by making a payment up front or by accepting a reduction in \nretirement benefits. Second, government contributions for the prior \nservice of incumbents are made ratably over a ten-year period under \nthis bill. Thus, payments for prior government contributions are spread \nout to lessen the financial impact. These two provisions will insure \nthat the cost of the bill is kept well within reasons.\n  This bill enjoys broad, grass root support. In the last month alone, \nI have received literally hundreds of letters supporting this bill, \nsent from over 40 States, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The \nbill also enjoys support in the law enforcement community. The National \nAssociation of Assistant United States Attorneys, the Federal Criminal \nInvestigators Association, and the Southern States Police Benevolent \nAssociation have all written me to voice support for the inclusion of \nAUSAs in the definition of an LEO.\n  In addition, I know that other Senators, including Senator Mikulski, \nare considering additional measures to expand these same retirement \nbenefits to other Federal employees who perform law enforcement \nfunctions, including IRS employees whose primary duty is to collect \ndelinquent taxes.

ANIMAL DRUGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Minor \n     Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2001''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs \n     for use in minor species.\n       (2) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs \n     for treating animal diseases and conditions that occur \n     infrequently or in limited geographic areas.\n       (3) Because of the small market shares, low-profit margins \n     involved, and capital investment required, it is generally \n     not economically feasible for new animal drug sponsors to \n     pursue approvals for these species, diseases, and conditions.\n       (4) Because the populations for which such new animal drugs \n     are intended may be small and conditions of animal management \n     may vary widely, it is often difficult to design and conduct \n     studies to establish drug safety and effectiveness under \n     traditional new animal drug approval processes.\n       (5) It is in the public interest and in the interest of \n     animal welfare to provide for special procedures to allow the \n     lawful use and marketing of certain new animal drugs for \n     minor species and minor uses that take into account these \n     special circumstances and that ensure that such drugs do not \n     endanger animal or public health.\n       (6) Exclusive marketing rights and tax credits for clinical \n     testing expenses have helped encourage the development of \n     ``orphan'' drugs for human use, and comparable incentives \n     should encourage the development of new animal drugs for \n     minor species and minor uses.\n       (c) Definitions.--Section 201 of the Federal, Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(kk) The term `major species' means cattle, horses, \n     swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats, except that the \n     Secretary may revise this definition by regulation.\n       ``(ll) The term `minor species' means animals other than \n     humans that are not major species.\n       ``(mm) The term `minor use' means the intended use of a \n     drug in a major species for an indication that occurs \n     infrequently or in limited geographical areas.''.\n       (d) Three-Year Exclusivity for Minor Use and Minor Species \n     Approvals.--Section 512(c)(2)(F) (ii), (iii), and (v) of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by striking \n     ``(other than bioequivalence or residue studies)'' and \n     inserting ``(other than bioequivalence studies or final \n     residue depletion studies, except final residue depletion \n     studies for minor uses or minor species)'' every place it \n     appears.\n       (e) Scope of Review for Minor Use and Minor Species \n     Applications.-- Section 512(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(5) In reviewing an application that proposes a change to \n     add an intended use for a minor use or a minor species to an \n     approved new animal drug application, the Secretary shall \n     reevaluate only the relevant information in the approved \n     application to determine whether the application for the \n     minor use or minor species can be approved.

Nevertheless, EPA cannot guarantee that \n     registered pesticides do not pose risks, and unnecessary \n     exposure to pesticides should be avoided. Based in part on \n     recommendations of a 1993 study by the National Academy of \n     Sciences that reviewed registered pesticides and their \n     potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects on human \n     health, particularly on the health of pregnant women, \n     infants, and children, Congress enacted the Food Quality \n     Protection Act of 1996.

REVIEW OF STATE MEAT INSPECTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the goal of a safe and wholesome supply to meat and \n     meat food products throughout the United States would be \n     better served if a consistent set for requirements, \n     established by the Federal Government, were applied to all \n     meat and meat food products, whether produced under State \n     inspection or Federal inspection;\n       (2) under such a system, State and Federal meat inspection \n     programs would function together to create a seamless \n     inspection system to ensure food safety and inspire consumer \n     in the food supply in interstate commerce; and\n       (3) such a system would ensure the viability of State meat \n     inspection programs, which should help to foster the \n     viability of small establishments.\n       (b) In General.--Not later than September 30, 2003, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a comprehensive review \n     of each State meat and poultry inspection program, which \n     shall include--\n       (1) a determination of the effectiveness of the State \n     program; and\n       (2) identification of changes that are necessary to enable \n     the possible future transition to a State program of \n     implementing a State meat and poultry inspection program that \n     enforces the mandatory antemortem and postmortem inspection, \n     reinspection, sanitation, sanitation, and related titles of \n     the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products \n     Inspection Act.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 227, H.R. 2873.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2873) to extend and amend the program entitled \n     Promoting Safe and Stable Families under title IV-B, subpart \n     2 of the Social Security Act, and to provide new authority to \n     support programs for mentoring children of incarcerated \n     parents; to amend the Foster Care Independent Living program \n     under title IV-E of that Act to provide for educational and \n     training vouchers for youths aging out of foster care, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senate is passing the House bill \nto reauthorize the Safe and Stable Families Program. This is necessary \naction to protect funding that is fundamental for promoting adoptions \nand preventing child abuse and neglect. By acting today, the Senate can \nsecure $1.5 billion over the next 5 years for vital priorities. It \nwould be wrong to leave Washington without taking action to ensure \nlong-term support for such vulnerable children.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with Senator Mike DeWine and a bipartisan \ngroup in introducing an even better legislative package to boldly \nexpand this vital program. Our bill, which was based on President \nBush's own proposal, would have increased the basic funding for the \nSafe and Stable Families Program from $305 million to $505 million of \nguaranteed annual funding. This would have provided an additional $1 \nbillion over the next 5 years, including $60 million in funding for \nscholarships for teens aging out of foster care. It would also have \nprovided authority to create a new program designed to mentor the \nchildren of prisoners. I truly wish we were moving the Senate bill \ntoday, but since that is not possible. I believe enacting the House \nbill is essential for the long-term security of this program.\n  The House version provides a 5-year reauthorization of the Safe and \nStable Families Program. The House bill also authorizes scholarships \nfor teens aging out of foster care and new programs for mentoring \nchildren of prisoners.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senators Harkin and Specter, there is a \n$70 million increase in this year's Senate Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations. That is good news for families who need adoption \nsupport services and prevention services. I am proud of this increase, \nand enormously grateful for the support and cooperation of the \nAppropriations Committees in both the House and Senate.\n  Throughout my years of legislative work on child welfare, I have \nworked hard to forge bipartisan compromise and consensus. I strongly \nbelieve that we must maintain such bipartisanship. The best news is \nthat we have more money to provide more services to families next year. \nBut the challenge remains for us to work and achieve the goals of the \noriginal Senate bill and President Bush's proposal. I remain\n\n[[Page S13226]]\n\ncommitted to this, and hope that this important step forward will help \nbuild the good will and bipartisanship necessary to deliver on all of \nour long-term goals in the years ahead.\n  I want to especially thank my primary cosponsor, Senator Mike DeWine, \nwho has been a passionate leader on adoption and child welfare reform \nfor many years. Senator DeWine was a leader in 1997 on improving the \nreasonable efforts standards to ensure that a child's health, safety, \nand need for a permanent home are priorities. This change and others \nhave helped reform the system and dramatically increase adoptions.\n  I also want to thank and recognize the strong bipartisan support from \nall of my Senate colleagues for our original bill, including Senators \nBingaman, Bond, Breaux, Chafee, Collins, Craig, DeWine, Graham, \nJohnson, Kerry, Landrieu, Levin, Lieberman, Lincoln, and Snowe.\n  In West Virginia, adoptions are increasing, thanks to both the \nreforms set in 1997 under the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the \nnew investments. My state needs increased funding to help develop local \ncommunity-based programs, so our children can get needed services in \ntheir own communities and not be sent out-of-state, away from family, \nfriends and familiar schools. I am proud of my State for its \nimprovement, but we all understand much more must be done, in West \nVirginia and nationwide, for these vulnerable children who depend on \nour efforts.\n  Today's action provides a good foundation, but we must continue \nworking in a bipartisan manner to build upon today's action, and \nachieve all of the goals we share.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Promoting Safe \nand Stable Families Amendments of 2001. This legislation continues our \nsupport for state efforts to reunify troubled families and to promote \nthe adoption of children in foster care who are unable to return to \ntheir birth homes. It also authorizes additional educational assistance \nto former foster children in the Independent Living program. Abused and \nneglected children are among the most vulnerable of all the members of \nour society--it is important that we continue to look after their \nneeds.\n  This proposal mirrors that made by the President. I thank him for his \ninterest in this issue. It is an important part of being a \ncompassionate leader, ensuring that federal efforts to assist abused \nand neglected children continue. It also contains a new proposal \noffered by the President, authorizing a new grant program to mentor the \nchildren of prisoners, a particularly disadvantaged group. I commend \nhim for that idea.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read the \nthird time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and \nany statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 93) recognizing and \n     honoring the National Guard on the occasion of the 365th \n     anniversary of its historic beginning with the founding of \n     the militia of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am privileged today to introduce a \nconcurrent resolution recognizing and honoring the National Guard on \nthe occasion of the 365th anniversary of its historic beginning with \nthe founding of the milita of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n  This resolution is cosponsored by all members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, the Republican Leader, \nSenator Lott, the co-chairs of the U.S. Senator National Guard Caucus, \nSenators Leahy and Bond, and Senator Rockefeller. I invite all other \nmembers to join with me in cosponsoring this concurrent resolution.\n  It is significant that we appropriately recognize the 365th \nanniversary of the National Guard, which serves our Nation 365 days a \nyear. National Guardsmen and women respond to every crisis that affects \nAmerican citizens, from natural disasters to terrorist attacks.\n  As one of the Members of Congress who visited the ruins of the World \nTrade Center just days after the September 11th attacks, I will never \nforget that Guardsmen were among the first to respond. More than 4,000 \nArmy National Guardsmen from New York rushed to lower Manhattan to help \nto remove debris, rescue victims, treat the injured, and provide \nsecurity. Today, National Guard personnel are flying combat patrols \nover American cities; they are providing security at our nation's \nairports, and they even provide security for us here on Capitol Hill. \nIn my home state of Michigan, they stand guard at crossings along the \nCanadian border.\n  These citizen soldiers and airmen are indispensable to our Nation's \nsecurity and to U.S. military operations. They have fought in every \nmajor American conflict since the colonial wars of the 17th century, \nand they are an integral part of all of our ongoing military operations \ntoday.\n  I know my colleagues join me in recognizing the many achievements of \nthe National Guard on this historic day.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am delighted to join Chairman Levin and \nothers in cosponsoring this resolution to honor the National Guard on \nthe occasion of its 365th anniversary.\n  The men and women of today's National Guard have inherited a proud \ntradition of military service dating back to colonial days and \nextending throughout this Nation's history. Today, they are adding to \nthis tradition. National Guard units are integrally involved in \nmilitary operations in Bosnia, over Iraq, and against the al Qaeda \nterrorist network and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Our citizen \nsoldiers and airmen are diligently performing their homeland security \nmission as part of Operation Noble Eagle. This service includes \naugmenting airport security operations at Virginia's nine commercial \nservice airports.\n  No element of the National Guard has a prouder, more distinguished \nrecord of service that that of the Virginia National Guard. I need only \nmention the 29th Infantry Division and its superb service in the D-Day \ninvasion at Normandy. In seven minutes that awful day, one company of \nthat Division's 116th Infantry Regiment lost 96 percent of its fighting \nforce. Twenty-six Bedford, Virginia, men went ashore. Nineteen were \nkilled, including the company commander and first sergeant. Today, \nGuardsmen of that same unit are leading the U.S. sector's multinational \nStabilization Force in Tuzla,\n\n[[Page S13227]]\n\nBosnia. I was privileged to visit those Guardsmen in Bosnia over this \npast Thanksgiving week.\n  The National Guard is critically important to the national security \nof the United States, and that has never been more true than in the war \nagainst terrorism we are involved in today. We honor the commitment and \nsacrifies of the 458,400 citizen soldiers and airmen of the National \nGuard, their families, their employers, and their communities. I \ncongratulate the National Guard, all its personnel, and particularly \nMajor General Claude Williams, the Adjutant General of the Virginia \nNational Guard, and all soldiers and airmen of the Virginia National \nGuard on this important milestone.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 365th \nanniversary of a true American institution: The National Guard. Now, \nperhaps more than ever, it is fitting to pay a special anniversary \ntribute to our citizen-soldiers, the oldest of America's armed forces.\n  The National Guard dates back to the first Americans. Responsible for \ntheir own defense, the colonists drew on English military tradition and \norganized their able-bodied male citizens into militias.\n  These early colonial militias protected citizens from Indian attacks, \nforeign adversaries and eventually successfully waged our Nation's war \nfor independence. Following independence, the framers of the \nConstitution empowered Congress to ``provide for organizing, arming, \nand disciplining the militia.'' Thus commenced the historic dual role \nof the National Guard as a state and a Federal force.\n  My home State of Minnesota formed a Territorial Enrolled Militia in \n1850, and in April 1856 the first uniformed, volunteer company was \nformed in St. Paul. Called the Minnesota Pioneer Guards, it was a \nsource of pride and inspired the subsequent formation of nine sister \ncompanies in St. Paul, St. Anthony, Minneapolis, and in river towns \nfrom Stillwater to Winona. From these roots grew the Minnesota National \nGuard on which we depend so greatly. Each State has a similar, \ndistinguished inspirational story.\n  Throughout the 19th Century, the size of the regular U.S. Army was \nsmall. The militia provided the bulk of the troops during the Mexican \nWar, the early months of the Civil War, and the Spanish-American War. \nThe National Guard comprised 40 percent of American troops deployed in \nFrance during World War I. In World War II, National Guard units were \namong the first to deploy overseas and the first to fight. Following \nWorld War II, National Guard aviation units, some of them dating back \nto World War I, because the Air National Guard, the Nation's newest \nReserve component.\n  September 11 ushered in a new chapter in the storied history of our \nheroes in the National Guard. We called on them to secure our Nations' \nmost vital infrastructure from terrorists committed to evil and \nviolence. They did not hesitate to leave their jobs and families to \nanswer the call to protect the American freedoms we hold so dear.\n  Today the National Guard continues to provide the States' trained and \nready units equipped to protect life and property at home. And it \nstands ready to defend the United States and its interests all over the \nglobe. Whether called upon by governor or President, from the village \nstreets of Bosnia, to the terminals of our own Minneapolis-St. Paul \nInternational Airport, our coworkers and neighbors in the National \nGuard continue to answer the call to defend freedom.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Administration.''.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 1291, the proposed \n``Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001.''\n  The pending measure is the final compromise version of an omnibus \nbill that improves a wide variety of veterans benefits, such as the \namount and flexibility of the Montgomery GI bill, enhances compensation \nto Gulf War veterans, as well as to Vietnam veterans with Agent Orange-\nrelated conditions, increases the VA home loan guaranty amount, extends \nVA's authority to provide home loans to Reservists and on Native \nAmerican tribal land, and augments burial benefits. The key provisions \nare described in more detail below. I refer my colleagues seeking more \ndetail to the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying this statement.\n  H.R. 1291, which I will refer to as the ``compromise agreement,'' \nmakes significant enhancements to educational benefits for veterans and \ntheir families. I thank my colleagues in the House for working with our \ncommittee staff to enhance the education benefits that help pay back \nveterans for the service they have given our Nation. Today's Montgomery \nGI bill, MGIB, provides a valuable recruitment and retention tool for \nthe Armed Services. As a transition benefit, it allows veterans to gain \nthe skills they need to adjust productively to civilian life when they \nreturn from service.\n  I am very pleased that the compromise bill, in section 101, will \nincrease the MGIB basic monthly benefit to $800 per month beginning in \nJanuary 2002, $900 in 2002, and $985 in 2003. I am even more proud that \nH.R. 1291 also takes the next step to keep pace with education needed \nfor success in high-technology fields. As our colleagues know, many \nservicemembers leave the military with skills that place them in demand \nfor careers in the technology sector. But even these veterans may \nrequire additional coursework to convert their military skills to \ncivilian careers. Sections 104 and 110 of the committee bill will allow \nveterans to use their Montgomery GI bill educational benefits to pay \nfor short-term, high technology courses that enable veterans to earn \nthe credentials they need to gain entry to lucrative civilian-sector \ncareers.\n  Currently, the MGIB provides a basic monthly benefit for education \ncosts. This payment structure is designed to assist veterans pursuing \ntraditional 4-year degrees at universities. However, in today's fast \npaced, high-tech economy, traditional degrees may not always be the \nbest option. Many veterans are pursuing forms of nontraditional \ntraining, such as short-term courses that lead to certification in a \ntechnical field. In certain fields, these certifications are a \nprerequisite to employment.\n  These courses, such as Microsoft or Cisco systems training, may be \noffered through training centers, private contractors to community \ncolleges, or the companies themselves. They often last just a few weeks \nor months, and can cost many thousands of dollars. The way MGIB is paid \nout in monthly disbursements is not suited to this course structure. \nFor example, MGIB would pay less than $1,400 for a 2-month course that \ncould cost as much as $10,000.\n  The percentage of veterans who actually use the MGIB benefits they \nhave earned and paid for is startlingly low, 45 percent of eligible \nveterans, according to VA's Program Evaluation of the Montgomery GI \nbill published in April 2000, despite almost full enrollment in the \nprogram by servicemembers. By increasing the flexibility of the MGIB \nprogram, we will permit more veterans to take advantage of these \nbenefits. This legislation gives veterans the right to choose the kind \nof educational program that will be best for them.\n  This legislation will modify the payment method to accommodate the \ncompressed schedule of these courses. Specifically, section 104 allows \nveterans to receive an accelerated payment equal to 60 percent of the \ncost of the program. This is comparable to VA's MGIB benefit for flight \ntraining, for which VA reimburses 60 percent of the costs. The dollar \nvalue of the accelerated payment would then be deducted from the \nveteran's remaining entitlement. Section 110 allows courses offered by \nthese providers to be covered by MGIB.\n  I am extremely proud that section 103 of this legislation will \nrestore educational and vocational rehabilitation and training benefits \nfor servicemembers and reservists who must leave their course of study \nto serve on active duty, such as military members called away to serve \nin connection with the current National Emergency declared in response \nto the events of September 11, 2001. This provision will amend a \nprovision that restores such entitlements for servicemembers and \nreservists called to active duty for the Persian Gulf War. In 1997, \nCongress similarly expanded educational benefits restoration for the \nSelected Reserve Program.\n  Section 102 will increase the Dependent's Educational Allowance, DEA, \nfor dependents and eligible spouses of veterans. Congress created this \neducational program in 1968 to provide educational opportunities to \nchildren whose education would be impeded or interrupted because of the \ndisability or death of a parent from a disease or injury incurred or \naggravated in the Armed Forces. In addition, surviving spouses of \nveterans who do not remarry are generally eligible for the educational \nallowance in order to assist them in preparing to support themselves \nand their families at the standard-of-living level that the veteran \ncould have been expected to provide for his or her family but for the \nservice-connected disability or death. Children and surviving spouses \nof servicemembers who are missing in action for 90 days, captured in \nthe line of duty by a hostile force, or detained or interned by a \nforeign government, are also eligible for the educational allowance.\n  DEA is available for full-time, three-quarter time or half-time \nattendance at an institution of higher learning, for students taking \ncorrespondence courses, pursuing special restorative training, or \napprenticeship training. The increase in DEA for full-time students \nwould be to $670 from $608 on January 1, 2002, with no cost-of-living \nadjustment that year. The allowance for a three-quarter time student \nwould increase to $503 from $456, and the allowance for half-time \npursuit would increase to $335 from $304.\n  As many of my colleagues remember, questions about the long-term \nconsequences of exposure to Agent Orange arose during the Vietnam War. \nDecades later, veterans of that war still await clear answers. A series \nof ongoing reviews by the National Academy of Sciences has helped to \nprovide some of those answers, such as the potential link between \nexposure to chemicals in Agent Orange and respiratory cancers. The \nlegislation before us would continue these scientific reviews, and \nextend the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' authority to act upon new \nscientific evidence.\n  Currently, Vietnam veterans can claim service-connected benefits for \nrespiratory cancers, but only if those\n\n[[Page S13235]]\n\ncancers are diagnosed within 30 years of their Vietnam service. Section \n201 would remove that time limit, which the last scientific review \npreliminarily found to be without clear basis. However, to ensure that \nthis decision is based upon sound evidence, the provision also allows \nthe Secretary to request a scientific review by NAS specifically \naddressing whether a time limit on manifestation of respiratory cancers \nis warranted, and to impose such a limit if supported by scientific \nfindings. Should the Secretary's requested review result in a finding \nof a more restrictive latency period for manifestation of these \nrespiratory cancers, the compromise agreement would ensure that the \nfamilies and survivors of these veterans remain eligible for VA \nbenefits. Finally, this bill also restores a VA presumption, eliminated \nby a Court decision, that all in-country Vietnam veterans were exposed \nto Agent Orange.\n  Following the Gulf War, returning troops began to report a range of \nunexplained illnesses that many attributed to their service, but that \ncould not be linked conclusively to a specific battlefield hazard. In \n1994, Congress passed the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act, \nallowing the Secretary to compensate certain Gulf War veterans disabled \nby ``undiagnosed illnesses'' for which no other causes could be \nidentified. The term ``undiagnosed illnesses'' has been interpreted by \nVA to preclude any veteran from eligibility who has received a \ndiagnosis, even if that diagnosis is merely a descriptive label for a \ncollection of unexplained symptoms. This legislation would authorize \nthe Secretary to compensate an eligible Gulf War veteran disabled by a \n``medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness defined by a \ncluster of signs or symptoms,'' such as chronic fatigue syndrome or \nfibromyalgia. Rather than defining Gulf War illnesses, section 202 of \nthis legislation would correct an unfair situation that penalizes Gulf \nWar veterans whose physicians have embraced changes in medical \nterminology in the past decade.\n  Since 1933, there has been a prohibition on paying benefits to an \nincompetent veteran who has no dependents and who has assets of $1,500 \nor more, if the veteran is being provided institutional health care by \nthe Government. Then, incompetent individuals might be \ninstitutionalized for years. It was believed that a large estate based \non the veteran's benefits should not be allowed to build up just to \npass to the state upon the veteran's death. Now, treatment modalities \nhave changed and veterans are more likely to cycle in and out of \ntreatment, which results in virtually constant suspension and \nreinstatement of their benefits.\n  Last year, in Public Law 106-419, Congress addressed this anomaly in \nlaw. Although we had hoped to fully eliminate the disparate and \ndiscriminatory treatment of incompetent veterans, due to cost \nrestraints we were only able to raise the dollar amount of the cutoff \nto five times the 100 percent compensation rate. I am enormously proud \nthat Section 204 would fully repeal the limitation on payment thereby \nending decades of prejudice and discrimination against these veterans.\n  The committee bill also enhances and extends home loan programs. As \nmost of our colleagues appreciate, VA does not provide a direct home \nloan for servicemembers and veterans. Instead, it provides a guaranty \nto mortgage lenders should the borrower veteran be unable to meet the \npayments and go into foreclosure. A VA guaranty allows a veteran to buy \na home valued at up to four times the guaranty amount. The price of \nhomes in major metropolitan areas has increased significantly in the \nlast several years, yet the VA guaranty amount has not been increased \nsince 1994. VA estimates that during fiscal year 2001, VA will have \nguaranteed 250,000 loans for veterans. Section 401 will increase the \nhome loan guaranty amount to $60,000 from the current $50,750, \nsupporting a loan of up to $240,000.\n  Section 403 will extend for 2 years the authority for housing loan \nguaranties for members of the Selected Reserve, currently set to expire \nin 2007. Reservists must serve 6 years in order to become eligible for \na VA-guaranteed loan. In order for the home loan to be used as a \nrecruiting incentive now, the benefit must be authorized beyond 6 \nyears. It is especially appropriate that we recognize the importance of \nthose who serve in the Selected Reserves as we rely on them yet again, \nin this time of national crisis.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank Senator Specter and his benefits \nstaff, Bill Tuerk, Jon Towers, and Chris McNamee, for diligently \nworking with me and my benefits staff, Bill Brew, Mary Schoelen, Julie \nFischer, Bridget Baylin, Chris Reinard, and Dahlia Melendrez, to craft \nthis legislation during this extraordinary year. I urge my colleagues \nto support these vital enhancements to veterans benefits. As has been \nthe case in previous years and is particularly important in light of \nour country's current military actions, this truly represents a \nbipartisan commitment to our Nation's veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Explanatory Statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of H.R. 1291, Compromise Agreement, the Veterans Education and \n                     Benefits Expansion Act of 2001\n\n       The Senate considered S. 1088, as amended, struck the \n     existing text and incorporated it into H.R. 1291, then passed \n     it by unanimous consent on December 7, 2001.\n\n\n                           Education Matters\n\n       Increases the rate of the basic benefit of the Montgomery \n     G.I. Bill (MGIB) from the current $672 per month to $800 per \n     month beginning on January 1, 2002; $900 per month on October \n     1, 2002; and $985 per month on October 1, 2003.\n       Increases the Dependent's Educational Allowance to $670 \n     from $608 for dependents and spouses of veterans who are \n     totally disabled or who die as a result of a service-\n     connected condition, effective January 1, 2002.\n       Restores lost educational and vocational rehabilitation \n     benefits for servicemembers and reservists who must leave \n     their course of study to serve on active duty, such as \n     military members called away to serve in the current National \n     Emergency.\n       Creates flexibility in the payment method for MGIB to \n     partially pay for short-term/high tech courses. It would \n     accelerate payment of up to 60 percent of the cost of an \n     approved program that leads to employment in a high \n     technology industry.\n\n\n                    Compensation and Pension Matters\n\n       Removes the arbitrary 30-year limit for manifestation of \n     Agent Orange-related respiratory cancers in Vietnam veterans \n     and tasks the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to continue \n     reviewing scientific evidence on effects of dioxin or \n     herbicide exposure through October 1, 2014.\n       Extends authority of the VA to presume service connection \n     for additional diseases as based on future NAS reports \n     through September 30, 2015.\n       Codifies presumption that Type 2 diabetes in Vietnam \n     veterans exposed to Agent Orange is service-connected.\n       Authorizes the Secretary to pay compensation to Gulf War \n     veteran chronically disabled by a diagnosed, but medically \n     unexplained multisymptom illness, such as chronic fatigue \n     syndrome.\n       Allows the Secretary to protect the grant of service \n     connection for an undiagnosed illness when a Persian Gulf War \n     veteran participates in a VA-sponsored medical research \n     project.\n\n\n                            Housing Matters\n\n       Increases the VA home loan guaranty amount to $60,000 from \n     the current $50,750. The VA guaranty amount has not been \n     increased since 1994.\n       Extends the Native American veterans housing loan program, \n     which allows loans on tribal lands for four years. Extends \n     the authority for housing loan guaranties for members of the \n     Selected Reserves for two years.\n       Increases the grant for specially adapted housing for \n     severely disabled veterans to $48,000 from $43,000.\n\n\n                             Burial Matters\n\n       Increases VA burial benefits for service-connected deaths \n     of veterans from $1,500 to $2,000.\n       Allows VA to furnish a bronze marker to permanently \n     commemorate the service of a veteran on an already marked \n     grave in a private cemetery.\n\n Explanatory Statement on House Amendment to Senate Amendments to H.R. \n                                  1291\n\n       The House amendment to the Senate amendments to H.R. 1291 \n     reflect a compromise agreement that the House and Senate \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs have reached on H.R. 801, \n     H.R. 1291, H.R. 2540, H.R. 3240, and S. 1088. H.R. 801 passed \n     the House on March 27, 2001. H.R. 1291 passed the House on \n     June 19, 2001. H.R. 2540 passed the House on July 31, 2001. \n     H.R. 3240 passed the House on November 13, 2001. The Senate \n     considered S. 1088 (hereinafter known as the ``Senate bill'') \n     on December 7, 2001. This measure was incorporated in H.R. \n     1291 as an amendment and passed the Senate by unanimous \n     consent on December 7, 2001.\n       The House an Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of H.R. 1291, as amended, \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise Agreement''). \n     Differences between the provisions contained in the \n     Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of H.R. 801,\n\n[[Page S13236]]\n\n     H.R. 1291, H.R. 2540, H.R. 3240, and S. 1088 are noted in \n     this document, except for clerical corrections, conforming \n     changes made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor \n     drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n               Title I--Educational Assistance Provisions\n\n\nINCREASES IN RATES OF BASIC EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE MONTGOMERY \n                                GI BILL\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3011 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     basic educational assistance entitlement under the All-\n     Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program, commonly \n     referred to as the Montgomery GI Bill or MGIB--Active Duty \n     program. Section 3015 establishes the base amount of such \n     educational assistance at the monthly rate of $528 for a 3-\n     year period of service and $429 for a 2-year period of \n     service. These amounts increased to $650 per month and $528 \n     per month, respectively, on November 1, 2000. With the \n     addition of a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on October 1, \n     2001, the rates are $672 and $546, respectively.\n     House bill\n       Section 2(a)(1) of H.R. 1291 would amend section 3015(a)(1) \n     to increase the amount of educational benefits under the \n     Montgomery GI Bill for an approved program of education on a \n     full-time basis from the current monthly rate of $650 ($672 \n     with (COLA) for an obligated period of active duty of 3 or \n     more years to $800 effective October 1, 2001, $950 effective \n     October 1, 2002, and $1,100 effective October 1, 2003.\n       Section 2(a)(2) of H.R. 1291 would amend section 3015(b)(1) \n     of title 38, United States Code, to increase the amount of \n     educational benefits for an obligated period of active duty \n     of 2 years from the current monthly rate of $528 ($546 with \n     COLA) to $650 effective October 1, 2001, $772 effective \n     October 1, 2002, and $894 effective October 1, 2003.\n       Section 2(b) of H.R. 1291 would suspend the statutory \n     annual adjustment in MGIB rates based on the Consumer Price \n     Index beginning in fiscal year 2002 and reinstate that \n     adjustment beginning in fiscal year 2005.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 101 of the Senate bill would increase the amount of \n     educational benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill for \n     veterans whose original service obligation was 3 or more \n     years to $700 in fiscal year 2002, $800 in fiscal year 2003, \n     and $950 in fiscal year 2004. For veterans whose original \n     service obligation was 2 years, the monthly educational \n     benefit would be increased to $569 in fiscal year 2002, $650 \n     in fiscal year 2003, and $772 in fiscal year 2004.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 101 of the compromise agreement would increase the \n     amount of educational benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill \n     for an obligated period of active duty of 3 or more years to \n     $800 effective January 1, 2002; $900 effective October 1, \n     2002; and $985 effective October 1, 2003. For service \n     obligation of 2 years, increases are to $650 effective \n     January 1, 2002; $732 effective October 1, 2002; and $800 \n     effective October 1, 2003. The COLA is suspended for Fiscal \n     Years 2003 and 2004.\n\n\n INCREASE IN RATES OF SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE\n\n     Current law\n       Chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     educational assistance to spouses and dependent children of \n     veterans who are totally disabled or who die as a result of a \n     service-connected condition. Eligible persons are paid at a \n     monthly rate of $588, $441, and $294, respectively, for full, \n     three-quarter, and half-time studies. The cost-of-living \n     adjustment (COLA) furnished on October 1, 2001, increased \n     these rates to $608, $456, and $304, respectively.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 106 of the Senate bill would increase the monthly \n     amount of education benefits provided under chapter 35 of \n     title 38, United States Code, for full-time students from \n     $588 ($608 with the COLA) to $690, from $441 ($456 of COLA) \n     to $517 for three-quarter time students, and from $294 ($306 \n     with the COLA) to $345 for half-time students (rates in \n     current law after cost-of-living adjustment). These \n     increases would take effect October 1, 2001.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 102 of the compromise agreement would follow the \n     language of the Senate bill, except that it would increase \n     the monthly amount of education benefits provided to full-\n     time students in traditional education programs, training in \n     business or industry, correspondence courses or special \n     restorative training from $608 to $670 on January 1, 2002. \n     The compromise agreement would also include increases for on-\n     job training, apprenticeship, and farm cooperative programs.\n\n\nrestoration of certain education benefits of individuals being ordered \n                             to active duty\n\n     Current law\n       Sections 3013(f)(2), 3231(a)(5), and 3511(a)(2)(B)(i) of \n     title 38, United States Code, provide that no educational \n     allowance paid to servicemembers, reservists, or eligible \n     dependents shall be counted against the total length or \n     amount of their education entitlement if the pursuit of an \n     educational objective was interrupted as a result of being \n     ordered to serve in connection with the Persian Gulf War.\n     House bill\n       H.R. 3240 would restore entitlement under the Montgomery GI \n     Bill (MGIB), Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP), \n     and Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance program \n     (DEA) for any servicemembers, reservists, or DEA recipients \n     called to active duty during Operation Enduring Freedom and \n     at any time in the future.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 105 of the Senate bill would restore entitlement \n     under the MGIB, VEAP, and Survivor's and DEA programs for any \n     servicemembers, reservists, or DEA recipients called to \n     active duty in connection with the National Emergency \n     declared by the Presidential Proclamation dated September 14, \n     2001.\n     Compromise bill\n       Section 103 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language and adds entitlement restoration for persons \n     pursuing education or training under chapter 31 of title 38, \n     United States Code. Further, the period during which the \n     person may use his or her educational benefits under chapters \n     31 or 35 would be the period equal to the length of active \n     service for which the person is recalled, plus four months.\n\n\naccelerated payments of educational assistance under montgomery gi bill \n    for education leading to employment in high technology industry\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3014 of title 38, United States Code, provides that \n     the basic educational benefit available under the Montgomery \n     GI Bill be disbursed in up to 36 monthly installments. \n     Benefits are provided for each month in which the MGIB \n     participant is certified to be participating in a course of \n     study. If requested by a veteran, section 3680(d)(2) of title \n     38, United States Code, allows for an advance payment of \n     educational assistance in an amount equivalent to the \n     allowance for the month, or fraction thereof, in which \n     pursuit of an education program will commence, plus the \n     allowance for the succeeding month. This payment structure is \n     geared primarily toward the pursuit of traditional two- and \n     four-year degrees.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 103 of the Senate bill would further expand the \n     Montgomery GI Bill benefit to accommodate a compressed \n     schedule of courses leading to employment in a high \n     technology industry by authorizing accelerated payment \n     covering up to 60% of the cost of a high technology course, \n     provided the cost of such course exceeds 200% of the monthly \n     MGIB rate. This lump sum would be deducted from the veteran's \n     remaining MGIB entitlement.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 104 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language, effective October 1, 2002.\n\n\n   eligibility for montgomery gi bill benefits or certain additional \n                          vietnam-era veterans\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3011 of title 38, United States Code, provides that \n     a Vietnam-era veteran may convert his or her Vietnam-era GI \n     Bill benefit to the Montgomery GI Bill educational benefit, \n     if the veteran had eligibility for Vietnam-era GI Bill \n     benefits as of December 31, 1989, was on active duty on \n     October 19, 1984, and served 3 continuous years after June \n     30, 1985.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 104 of the Senate bill would enable Vietnam-era \n     veterans to convert their Vietnam-era GI Bill benefits to \n     Montgomery GI Bill benefits if the veteran had eligibility \n     for the Vietnam-era GI Bill benefits as of December 31, 1989, \n     was not on active duty on October 19, 1984, and served 3 \n     continuous years in the Armed Forces on or after July 1, \n     1985.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 105 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  INCREASE IN MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ANNUAL ROTC AWARD FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR \n                 BENEFITS UNDER THE MONTGOMERY GI BILL\n\n     Current law\n       Sections 3011(c)(3)(B) and 3012(d)(3)(B) of title 38, \n     United States Code, provide that $2,000 is the maximum annual \n     amount of a partial scholarship that a participant in the \n     Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (SROTC) may receive \n     and still be eligible for basic educational assistance \n     entitlement for service on active duty under the Montgomery \n     GI Bill educational assistance program.\n     House bill\n       Section 101 of H.R. 801 would increase from $2,000 to \n     $3,400 per year the amount a student under SROTC may receive \n     in scholarship assistance and still retain eligibility for \n     the Montgomery GI Bill--Active Duty under chapter 30, of \n     title 38, United States Code.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n[[Page S13237]]\n\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 106 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n                 EXPANSION OF WORK-STUDY OPPORTUNITIES\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3485(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, \n     establishes work-study policies for veteran-students and \n     eligible dependents. In general, VA work-study students may \n     prepare or process VA paperwork at schools or VA facilities, \n     provide care at VA hospitals and domiciliaries, or work at \n     Department of Defense facilities in certain circumstances.\n     House bill\n       Section 102 of H.R. 801 would expand work-study \n     opportunities for veteran-students and eligible dependents to \n     include: outreach services furnished by State Approving \n     Agencies to servicemembers and veterans; activities for \n     veteran-students and/or dependents (who have declared an \n     academic major) within the department of an academic \n     discipline that complements and reinforces the program of \n     education pursued by the veteran-student; and the provision \n     of chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, domiciliary \n     care and nursing home and hospital care to veterans, \n     including state veterans homes.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 107 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language that excludes work-study opportunities within the \n     department of the veteran-student's academic discipline, and \n     adds additional work-study opportunities through national and \n     state veterans cemeteries.\n\n\n   ELIGIBILITY FOR SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE \n   BENEFITS OF SPOUSES AND SURVIVING SPOUSES OF VETERANS WITH TOTAL \n                     SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES\n\n     Current law\n       Spouses of veterans who die of service-connected \n     conditions, who are rated as totally and permanently \n     disabled, or who die while rated as totally and permanently \n     disabled, are eligible for Survivors' and Dependents' \n     Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits. Prior to Ozer v. \n     Principi, a 2001 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     Veterans Claims, 14 Vet. App. 257 (2001), VA applied a 10-\n     year delimiting period during which spouses were eligible to \n     use their DEA benefits. VA had been following regulations \n     stating that the 10-year delimiting period began when \n     eligibility is first established. However, the statute which \n     authorized the DEA regulations prescribed that a spouse may \n     not receive educational assistance beyond 10 years after the \n     last occurrence of three eligibility criteria, one of which \n     is the veteran's death. In its Ozer decision, the Court \n     invalidated the VA regulation, reasoning that the delimiting \n     period established by VA was in conflict with the authorizing \n     statute.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 107 of the Senate bill would reinstate a 10-year \n     delimiting period in which spouses may, upon first becoming \n     eligible, use DEA benefits. Spouses made eligible for DEA \n     under more than one of the eligibility criteria would have \n     two separate 10-year delimiting periods in which to use \n     their DEA benefits, but in no case would their aggregate \n     entitlement exceed 45 months.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 108 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n EXPANSION OF SPECIAL RESTORATIVE TRAINING BENEFIT TO CERTAIN DISABLED \n                      SPOUSES OR SURVIVING SPOUSES\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3541 of title 38, United States Code, provides that \n     eligible children entitled to assistance under the Survivors' \n     and Dependents' Educational Assistance program of chapter 35 \n     may receive special restorative training to overcome or \n     lessen the effects of a physical or mental disability and \n     enable them to undertake a program of education.\n     House bill\n       Section 104 of H.R. 801 would expand the special \n     restorative training benefit provided under the chapter 35 \n     program to include certain disabled spouses or surviving \n     spouses.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 109 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n INCLUSION OF CERTAIN PRIVATE TECHNOLOGY ENTITIES IN THE DEFINITION OF \n                        EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3452(c) of title 38, United States Code, defines \n     ``educational institution'' as any public or private \n     elementary school, secondary school, vocational school, \n     correspondence school, business school, junior college, \n     teachers' college, college, normal school, professional \n     school, university, scientific or technical institution \n     furnishing education for adults. Section 3501(a)(6) of title \n     38, United States Code, uses a substantively identical \n     definition with the addition of any other institution if it \n     furnishes education at the secondary school level or above.\n     House bill\n       Section 103 of H.R. 801 would expand the definition of an \n     educational institution to include any private entity that \n     offers, either directly or under an agreement with another \n     entity, a course or courses to fulfill a requirement for the \n     attainment of a license or certificate generally recognized \n     as necessary to obtain, maintain, or advance in employment in \n     a profession or vocation in a technological occupation, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 105 of the Senate bill contains a substantively \n     identical provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 110 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n                           DISTANCE EDUCATION\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3680A(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, limits \n     the enrollment of an eligible veteran to an accredited \n     independent study program (including open circuit television) \n     leading to a standard college degree.\n     House bill\n       Section 105 of H.R. 801 would permit eligible veterans to \n     receive VA education benefits while pursuing non college-\n     degree courses that are offered through independent study by \n     institutions of higher learning.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 111 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n             Title II--Compensation and Pension Provisions\n\n\n  modification and extension of authorities on presumption of service-\n connection for herbicide-related disabilities of vietnam-era veterans\n\n     Current law\n       Under section 1116(a)(2)(F) of title 38, the presumption of \n     service-connection with respect to respiratory cancers is \n     limited to those cancers manifesting within 30 years of a \n     servicemember's last active-duty date in Vietnam.\n       The CAVC decision in McCartt v. West, 12 Vet. App. 164 \n     (1999) held that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can \n     only presume exposure to Agent Orange if the Vietnam veteran \n     has one of the diseases listed as related to such exposure in \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 1116(a) or 38 CFR Sec. 3.309(e). VA practice \n     prior to this decision had been to presume exposure for \n     anyone who had served in Vietnam during the statutorily \n     defined period of war unless there was affirmative \n     evidence to the contrary.\n       Section 1116 authorizes the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs \n     to establish, through regulation, a presumption of service-\n     connection for diseases associated with exposure to Agent \n     Orange. The Secretary is further authorized to contract with \n     the National Academy of Sciences for the purposes of studying \n     the effects of dioxin, and is required to base the \n     establishment of a presumption of service-connection on NAS \n     findings. This authority commenced in 1993 and will expire at \n     the end of Fiscal Year 2003.\n     House bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 2540 codifies VA's July 9, 2001, \n     regulation providing benefits for Vietnam veterans with Type \n     2 diabetes.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 201 of the Senate bill would remove the 30-year \n     limitation on the manifestation of respiratory cancer. This \n     section would also change the result of the CAVC decision in \n     McCartt by requiring VA to presume exposure to Agent Orange \n     for all persons serving in Vietnam during the statutorily \n     defined period of that conflict.\n       Section 201 would extend the Secretary's authority to \n     determine a presumption of service-connection for additional \n     diseases; based on future NAS Reports, through 2011. VA's \n     authority to contract with the NAS to review scientific \n     evidence on the effects of dioxin or herbicide exposure would \n     be extended through 2011.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 201(a)(1) of the compromise agreement follows the \n     Senate language, but modifies the effective date for \n     subsection (a) of the Senate bill to January 1, 2002. Section \n     201(a)(2) of the compromise directs the Secretary to enter \n     into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences \n     specifically to review available scientific literature on \n     exposure to herbicides and dioxin and the development of \n     respiratory cancers. Section 201(a)(3) allows the Secretary \n     to consider whether an upper limit on manifestation of \n     respiratory cancers can be supported, and to impose such a \n     limit by regulation if warranted, by available scientific \n     evidence. Section 201(4) protects a grant of service-\n     connection made under this section for purposes of all \n     benefits administered by the Secretary; section 201(b) of the \n     compromise agreement provides a statutory presumption of \n     service-connection of Diabetes Type 2 for veterans exposed to \n     Agent Orange and follows the House language; section 201(c) \n     of the compromise agreement presumes that veterans who served \n     in the Republic of Vietnam during the time period when \n     herbicides were used were exposed to herbicides and follows\n\n[[Page S13238]]\n\n     the Senate language; and section 201(d) of the compromise \n     agreement extends the Secretary's authority to contract with \n     NAS through October 1, 2014, and extends the Secretary's \n     authority to determine a presumption of service-connection \n     through September 30, 2015.\n\n\n  payment of compensation for persian gulf war veterans with certain \n                          chronic disabilities\n\n     Current law\n       Public Law 103-446 gave the Secretary the authority to \n     compensate a Gulf War veteran who suffers from disabilities \n     that cannot be diagnosed or clearly defined, when other \n     causes cannot be identified. Section 1117 of title 38, United \n     States Code, sets forth parameters for compensating \n     disabilities occurring in Gulf War veterans.\n     House bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 2540 would expand, effective April 1, \n     2002, the definition of ``undiagnosed illness'' for Gulf War \n     veterans to include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, \n     and chronic multisymptom illness, as well as other illnesses \n     that cannot be clearly defined. Signs and symptoms listed in \n     the House bill that are associated with an undiagnosed \n     illness include headache, muscle pain, joint pain, neurologic \n     signs or symptoms, neuropsychological signs or symptoms, \n     signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or \n     lower), sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal signs or \n     symptoms, cardiovascular signs or symptoms, abnormal weight \n     loss, and/or menstrual disorders.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 202(b) of the Senate bill would expand the \n     definition of ``undiagnosed illness'' by adding poorly \n     defined chronic multisymptom illnesses of unknown etiology, \n     regardless of diagnosis, characterized by two or more of the \n     symptoms already listed in VA regulations. This section would \n     also extend the presumptive period for service connection for \n     Gulf War veterans by 10 years.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 202 of the compromise agreement authorizes the \n     Secretary effective March 1, 2002, to pay compensation to any \n     eligible Gulf War veteran chronically disabled by an \n     ``undiagnosed illness,'' a ``medically unexplainable chronic \n     multisymptom illness defined by a cluster of signs or \n     symptoms,'' or ``any diagnosed illness that the Secretary \n     determines in regulations prescribed under subsection (d) \n     warrants a presumption of service-connection'' (or any \n     combination of these). The term ``undiagnosed illnesses'' has \n     been interpreted by VA to preclude from eligibility for \n     benefits under sections 1117 or 1118 of title 38, United \n     States Code, any veteran who has received a diagnosis, even \n     if that diagnosis is merely a descriptive label for a \n     collection of unexplained symptoms. This provision's addition \n     of ``medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness \n     defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms'' to the list of \n     compensable conditions fully implements the intent of Public \n     Law 103-446. Public Law 103-446 authorized the Secretary to \n     compensate certain Gulf War veterans disabled by symptoms \n     that could not be connected conclusively to specific wartime \n     exposures otherwise not compensable under other existing \n     statutory bases.\n       In selecting this language, it is the intent of the \n     Committees to ensure eligibility for chronically disabled \n     Gulf War veterans not withstanding a diagnostic label by a \n     clinician in the absence of conclusive pathophysiology or \n     etiology. The compromise agreement's definition encompasses a \n     variety of unexplained clinical conditions, characterized by \n     overlapping symptoms and signs, that share features such as \n     fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical \n     findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory \n     abnormalities. Aaron and Buchwald, A Review of the Evidence \n     for Overlap Among Unexplained Clinical Conditions, 134(9) \n     Annals of Internal Med:868-880 (2001). Although chronic \n     fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome \n     are the most common diagnoses under this definition, other \n     conditions that may be characterized similarly include other \n     chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders and chronic headache \n     disorders.\n       By listing the first three diagnoses as examples, it is the \n     Committees' intend to give guidance to the Secretary rather \n     than to limit eligibility for compensation based upon other \n     similarly described conditions that may be defined or \n     redefined in the future. The Committees do not intent this \n     definition to assert that the cited syndromes can be \n     clinically or scientifically linked to Gulf War service based \n     on current evidence, nor do they intend to include chronic \n     multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and \n     pathophysiology such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis.\n       In evaluating chronic multisymptom illnesses, the \n     Committees expect that VA will develop a schedule for rating \n     disabilities based on severity of symptoms and the degree to \n     which these impair a veteran's ability to obtain and retain \n     substantially gainful employment. The ratings schedule \n     already established by VA in section 4.88b of 38 CFR (6354) \n     for chronic fatigue syndrome bases the degree of disability \n     on the veteran's incapacitation rather than specific medical \n     findings. This schedule can be used as a model for rating \n     disabilities stemming from chronic multisymptom illnesses in \n     general.\n       The compromise agreement includes a technical correction \n     substituting a date certain of October 1, 2010, for ``10 \n     years after the last day of the fiscal year in which the \n     National Academy of Sciences (NAS) submits the first report'' \n     as written under current law in section 1603(j) of the \n     Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. This provision \n     requires the Secretary to contract with the NAS for five \n     biennial reports on Gulf War health issues. The compromise \n     also amends sections 1117 and 1118 of title 38, United States \n     Code, to clarify that the authority of the Secretary to \n     determine that a disease warrants presumptive service-\n     connection based on these NAS reports continuing through \n     September 30, 2011.\n\n\nPreservation of Service Connection for Undiagnosed illnesses to Provide \n      for Participation in Research Projects by Gulf War Veterans\n\n     Current law\n       Under current law, the Secretary does not have specific \n     authority to protect a Persian Gulf War veteran's grant of \n     service connection for an undiagnosed illness if, as a result \n     of participating in a medical research study, the condition \n     is diagnosed.\n     House bill\n       Section 203 of H.R. 2540 would authorize the Secretary to \n     protect the grant of service connection for an undiagnosed \n     illness when a Persian Gulf War veteran participates in a VA-\n     sponsored medical research project. The Secretary would be \n     required to publish in the Federal Register any medical \n     research project whose participants would be protected under \n     this section. The Secretary's authority extends to research \n     projects commenced before, on or after date of enactment.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 203 of the compromise agreement protects veterans \n     participating in medical research projects sponsored by the \n     Department from loss of service-connection if the Secretary \n     determines that such protection is necessary for conduct of \n     the medical research. The Secretary is required to publish in \n     the Federal Register a list of medical research projects \n     sponsored by the Department for which service-connection is \n     protected under this section.\n\n\n    Repeal of the Limitation on Payments of Benefits to Incompetent \n                                Veterans\n\n     Current law\n       Subsections (b) and (c) of section 5503 of title 38, United \n     States Code, establishes that compensation and pension \n     benefits cannot be issued to an incompetent, \n     institutionalized veteran with no dependents whose assets \n     exceed five times the 100-percent compensation rate. Public \n     Law 106-419 raised the dollar amount of the cutoff from \n     $1,500 to its present level.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 209 of the Senate bill would repeal the asset \n     limitation on payment of benefits to incompetent \n     institutionalized veterans who have no dependents.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 204 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  extension of round-down requirement for compensation cost-of-living \n                              adjustments\n\n     Current law\n       Under sections 1104 and 1303 of title 38, United States \n     Code, the Secretary has the authority to round down to the \n     next lower whole dollar amount in the computation of cost-of-\n     living adjustments through fiscal year 2002.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 205 of the compromise agreement extends the \n     Secretary's authority to round down to the next lower whole \n     dollar amount the computation of cost-of-living adjustments \n     through Fiscal Year 2011.\n\n\n    Expansion of presumptions of permanent and total disability for \n           veterans applying for nonservice-connected pension\n\n     Current law\n       Under section 1502(a) of title 38, United States Codes, \n     applicants for nonservice-connected pensions are considered \n     to be totally and permanently disabled if they are \n     unemployable, unable to follow a gainful occupation, or \n     determined by the Secretary to be totally and permanently \n     disabled. It is the Committees' understanding that VA \n     regional office directors have been verbally instructed to \n     implement a policy of presuming permanent and total \n     disability for veterans who are patients in nursing homes for \n     long-term care, or veterans determined permanently disabled \n     by the Social Security Administration.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n        Section 203 of the Senate bill would presume that veterans \n     who are in nursing\n\n[[Page S13239]]\n\n     homes for long-term care; are determined to be permanently \n     disabled by the Social Security Administration (SSA); are at \n     least 65 years old and have no current, recurring income from \n     employment; or are unemployable as a result of a disability \n     reasonably certain to continue throughout life, are \n     permanently and totally disabled for purposes of nonservice-\n     connected pension. This provision would be made retroactive \n     to September 10, 2001.\n     Compromise agreement\n       According to information provided to the Committees, VA has \n     recently instructed its employees to adjudicate pension \n     claims for veterans who are patients in long-term care \n     facilities or who have been determined to be permanently \n     disabled by the Social Security Administration without \n     requiring a VA determination of disability. The Committees \n     express their strong disapproval of the verbal manner in \n     which the policy changes concerning evaluation of disability \n     for patients in long-term care and those determined disabled \n     by SSA were implemented. Verbally advising VA regional office \n     directors to implement major policy changes without issuing \n     either formal regulations or written guidance invites \n     misinterpretation and confusion. The Committees strongly urge \n     the Secretary to communicate all interpretative changes to \n     policy in writing to appropriate officials, to make such \n     instructions available to the public, and to comply with the \n     notice and comment requirements of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act for all substantive rules.\n       Section 206(a)(1) of the compromise agreement provides \n     specific statutory authority for the evidentiary presumption \n     verbally communicated to regional office directors for \n     determining the eligibility of patients in a nursing home for \n     long-term care to be disabled for purposes of pension \n     benefits. The compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language and provides for an effective date of September 17, \n     2001, the date VA regional offices are believed to have \n     implemented this policy.\n       Section 206(a)(2) of the compromise agreement provides that \n     persons who have been determined disabled by the Social \n     Security Administration (SSA) will be considered disabled for \n     purposes of pension benefits. Since the Committees believe \n     that a SSA disability determination is an appropriate \n     evidentiary basis for considering a veteran disabled, the \n     compromise agreement considers a veteran disabled if SSA has \n     made a determination of disability. The bill provides for an \n     effective date of September 17, 2001, the date VA regional \n     offices are believed to have implemented this policy.\n       Section 206(a)(3) of the compromise agreement provides that \n     a person shall be considered disabled if the veteran is \n     unemployable as a result of disability reasonably certain to \n     continue throughout the life of the person. The compromise \n     agreement follows the Senate language.\n       Section 206(a)(4) restates provisions currently contained \n     in section 1502(a)(1) and (2) of current law. The compromise \n     agreement follows the Senate language.\n\n\neligibility of veterans 65 years of age or older for veterans' pension \n                                benefits\n\n     Current law\n       Public Law 90-77 provided that a veteran is presumed \n     disabled for purposes of pension benefits at age 65. Public \n     Law 101-508 revoked the Secretary's authority to presume that \n     a veteran was disabled for purposes of pension benefits at \n     age 65. Although the Secretary lacks statutory authority to \n     presume disability at age 65, it is the Committees' \n     understanding that VA regional office directors were \n     verbally instructed to implement a policy of presuming \n     disability for pension applicants aged 65 and older.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 203(a)(3) of the Senate bill would restore the \n     presumption of disability for purposes of pension eligibility \n     at age 65 for veterans who based on evidence available to the \n     Secretary have no current recurring income from employment.\n     Compromise agreement\n       According to information provided to the Committees, VA has \n     recently instructed its employees to adjudicate pension \n     claims for veterans who are aged 65 or older and who have no \n     wages from employment without requiring a VA determination of \n     disability. The Committees express their strong disapproval \n     of the Secretary's decision to ignore the requirements of \n     Public Law 101-508 prohibiting a presumption of disability \n     for purposes of pension eligibility at age 65 by verbally \n     reinstating the policy. when the Secretary believes that \n     legislation passed by Congress and enacted into law is unwise \n     or administratively inefficient, it is the Secretary's \n     responsibility to propose appropriate legislation to the \n     Congress so that the problem identified can be corrected. \n     Verbally instructing VA regional office directors to ignore \n     statutory requirements and to presume that veterans are \n     disabled at age 65 without authorizing legislation violates \n     current law. The Committees expect the Secretary to advise \n     Congress of any statutory provisions, which in the judgment \n     of the Secretary are detrimental to caring for our Nation's \n     veterans, and to transmit appropriate corrective legislative \n     proposals for consideration.\n       Section 207 of the compromise agreement provides that a \n     pension will be provided to wartime veterans aged 65 and \n     older without regard to disability. These veterans must still \n     meet the nondisability requirements of section 1521 of title \n     38, United States Code, such as income and net worth. In \n     determining that benefits will be provided at age 65 without \n     regard to employment status, the Committees noted that any \n     veteran employed full-time and receiving at least a minimum \n     wage would not qualify for pension based on the pension \n     income limitation.\n       Nonetheless, the Committees agree that a policy of \n     requiring proof of disability for an aged wartime veteran \n     with incomes below the pension benefit amount involves use of \n     scarce agency resources without a commensurate return. The \n     Committees have determined that aged wartime veterans should \n     be provided a needs-based pension under conditions similar to \n     that provided for veterans of the Indian Wars and the \n     Spanish-American War. The compromise agreement renders a \n     wartime veteran eligible for a needs-based pension upon \n     attaining age 65 effective September 17, 2001, the date VA \n     regional offices are believed to have implemented a policy of \n     providing a presumption of disability for wartime veterans \n     aged 65 and older.\n\n             Title III--Transition and Outreach Provisions\n\n\n AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH OVERSEAS VETERANS ASSISTANCE OFFICES TO EXPAND \n                         TRANSITION ASSISTANCE\n\n     Current law\n       Sections 7722, 7723 and 7724 of title 38, United States \n     Code, set forth VA's responsibilities with respect to \n     outreach services, including outreach provided to separating \n     servicemembers and eligible dependents. These sections do not \n     specifically provide for the establishment and maintenance of \n     veterans' assistance offices on military installations \n     outside of the United States, its territorial possessions, or \n     the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Through a funding \n     arrangement with the Department of Defense, VA currently \n     assigns representatives overseas on a rotational basis in a \n     number of locations with large military populations.\n     House bill\n       Section 201(a) of H.R. 801 would amend section 7723(a) of \n     title 38, United States Code, to give the Secretary specific \n     discretionary authority to establish veterans' assistance \n     offices on such military installations in other locations as \n     the Secretary determines necessary. In doing so, the \n     Secretary would be required to consult with the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 301 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n                    TIMING OF PREPARATION COUNSELING\n\n     Current law\n       The Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor \n     assist separating servicemembers with benefits and services \n     to facilitate a successful transition to civilian life. \n     Currently, section 1142(a)(1) of title 10, United States \n     code, requires that preseparation counseling begin not less \n     than 90 days prior to discharge or release.\n     House bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 801 would change the timing of \n     preseparation counseling to begin as soon as possible during \n     the 24-month period preceding an anticipated retirement and \n     as soon as possible during the 12-month period preceding \n     other separations, but in no event later than 90 days before \n     the date of discharge or release.

Eligibility for grave \n     markers would apply to deaths occurring after the date of \n     enactment of this provision and deaths occurring before its \n     enactment, but after November 1, 1990, so long as the request \n     for the marker is made within 4 years after the enactment \n     date.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 502 of the compromise agreement creates a five-year \n     program requiring the Secretary to furnish a bronze marker to \n     those families that request a government marker for the \n     marked grave of a veteran at a private cemetery. The \n     Secretary is required to furnish the marker directly to the \n     cemetery and the family is required to place the marker on \n     the veteran's gravesite. Not later then February 1, 2006, the \n     Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on \n     the use of this five-year authority to include: the rate and \n     cost of the use of the benefit by fiscal year; an assessment \n     if the extent to which markers are being delivered to \n     cemeteries and placed on gravesites; and the Secretary's' \n     recommendation for extension or repeal of the December 31, \n     2006, expiration date.

This provision \n     would not affect any payments made prior to the enactment of \n     this legislation.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 506 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language. It is the Committees' hope that VA will receive all \n     necessary cooperation from the state and federal prison \n     systems in implementing this provision, such as the timely \n     compiling of data of incarcerated veterans affected by this \n     change in law.\n\n\nelimination of requirement for providing a copy of notice of appeal to \n                   the secretary of veterans affairs\n\n     Current law\n       Section 7266(b) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     an individual appealing a decision of the Board of Veterans' \n     Appeals to furnish the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with a \n     copy of his or her notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n     House bill\n       Section 406 of H.R. 2540 repeals section 7266(b) of title \n     38, United States Code.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 507 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n    Increase in Fiscal Year Limitation on the Number of Veterans in \n         Programs of Independent Living Services and Assistance\n\n     Current law\n       Under section 3120 of title 38, United States Code, VA's \n     Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service maintains an \n     independent living program designed to assist service-\n     disabled veterans, who are to disabled to retrain for \n     employment, in achieving and maintaining defined independent \n     living outcomes. Subsection 3120(e) of this title limits \n     participation in this program to no more than 500 veteran \n     participants per fiscal year. Despite this limitation, VA has \n     been providing services to approximately 2,400 veterans per \n     year.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 501 of the Senate bill would eliminate the 500-\n     veteran cap for participants of the independent living \n     program, and would retain first priority to veterans for whom \n     there is a reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational \n     goal but for their service-connected condition.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 508 of the compromise agreement would increase the \n     maximum number of veterans allowed to participate in the VA \n     independent living program to 2,500, and would retain first \n     priority to veterans for whom there is a reasonable \n     feasibility of achieving a vocational goal but for their \n     service-connected condition.\n       While the Committees acknowledge the value of this program, \n     the Committees strongly disapprove of VA's apparent decision \n     to ignore the limitations in current law. When a limitation \n     contains in current law proves detrimental to veterans, the \n     Committees expect that the Secretary will not proceed to \n     ignore the law, but rather to present the Congress with \n     appropriate corrective legislation. In the event that the \n     number currently authorized proves to be insufficient to meet \n     the needs of our Nation's disabled veterans, the Committees \n     direct the Secretary to propose appropriate legislation to \n     Congress.\n\n          Title VI--U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\n\n\n Facilitation of Staggered Terms of Judges Through Temporary Expansion \n                              of the Court\n\n     Current law\n       Section 7253 of title 38, United States Code, requires that \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) shall be \n     composed of no more than seven judges and one shall be chief \n     judge. After the Court's establishment in 1988, the initial \n     seven judges were appointed within 16 months of one another. \n     A new judge was appointed in 1997 to fill a vacancy created \n     by the death of one of the originally appointed judges. The \n     chief judge retired in 2000, and his seat has not yet been \n     filled. By 2005, the terms of five of the remaining judges \n     will have ended.

These fees may be used \n     for purposes of hiring independent counsel to pursue \n     disciplinary matters and defraying administrative costs for \n     the implementation of the standards of proficiency prescribed \n     for practice before the Court.\n     House bill\n       Section 301(a) of H.R. 2540 would authorize the Court to \n     collect registration fees for persons participating in a \n     judicial conference or other Court-sponsored activities where \n     appropriate.\n       Section 301(b) of H.R. 2540 would amend section 7285(b) of \n     title 38, United States Code, to add that registration fees \n     paid to the Court may also be used generally in connection \n     with practitioner disciplinary proceedings and in support of \n     certain bench-and-bar veterans' law educational activities.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 604 of the Senate bill contains a comparable \n     provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 604 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n                       administrative authorities\n\n     Current law\n       The CAVC, established by Congress under Article I of the \n     United States Constitution to exercise judicial power, has \n     unusual status as an independent tribunal that does not have \n     the same general administrative authority as courts \n     established under Article III of the Constitution. Because of \n     its status, the Court does not have available to it certain \n     general authorities that would normally be available were it \n     part of the executive branch or another administrative \n     structure.\n     House bill\n       Section 302 of H.R. 2540 would add a new section 7287 to \n     title 38, United States Code, to make available to the Court \n     generally the same management, administrative, and \n     expenditure authorities that are available to Article III \n     courts of the United States.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 605 of the Senate bill contains a comparable \n     provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 605 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n                   legislative provisions not adopted\n\n  authority for accelerated payments of basic educational assistance \n                        under montgomery gi bill\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3014 of title 38 provides that the basic \n     educational benefit available under the Montgomery GI Bill be \n     disbursed in up to 36 monthly installments. Benefits are \n     provided for each month in which the MGIB participant is \n     certified to be participating in a course of study. If \n     requested by a veteran, section 3680(d)(2) of title 38 allows \n     for an advance payment of educational assistance in an amount \n     equivalent to the allowance for the month, or fraction \n     thereof, in which pursuit of an education program will \n     commence, plus the allowance for the succeeding month.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 102 of the Senate bill would allow Montgomery GI \n     Bill participants to receive their otherwise monthly payment \n     as an accelerated lump-sum payment for the month in which a \n     course of study begins, plus up to 4 months worth of \n     educational assistance allowance. In the case of a term, \n     quarter, or semester, the accelerated lump-sum payment would \n     equal the amount of the aggregate monthly educational \n     assistance allowance for the entire term, quarter, or \n     semester.\n\n\n              presumptive period for undiagnosed illnesses\n\n     Current law\n       Section 1117(b) of title 38 United States Code authorizes \n     the Secretary to extend the period of presumption of service \n     connection for Persian Gulf War veterans disabled by \n     undiagnosed illnesses by regulation. On October 12, 2001, the \n     Secretary published a regulation extending the presumptive \n     period through December 31, 2006.\n     House bill\n       Section 204 of H.R. 2540 extends the presumptive period for \n     undiagnosed illnesses to December 31, 2003.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 202(a) of the Senate bill extended the presumptive \n     period for undiagnosed illnesses to December 31, 2011, or \n     such later date as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.\n\n\nrevision of rules with respect to net worth limitation for eligibility \nfor pensions for veterans who are permanently and totally disabled from \n                   a nonservice-connected disability\n\n     Current law\n       The VA Pension Program at chapter 15 of title 38, United \n     States Code, provides financial assistance based upon need to \n     veterans who have had at least 90 days of military service, \n     including at least one day of wartime service, and who are \n     totally and permanently disabled for employment purposes as a \n     result of disability not related to their military service. \n     In determining eligibility for pension benefits, VA is \n     required to consider not only the family income, but also the \n     family's ``net worth.'' The value of farm and ranch land is \n     included in determining net worth unless VA determines that \n     land can be sold at ``no substantial sacrifice,'' section \n     3.275 of chapter 38, Code of Federal Regulations.\n     House bill\n       Section 306 of H.R. 801 would revise the rule with respect \n     to net worth limitation for VA's means-tested pension program \n     by excluding the value of property used for farming, \n     ranching, or similar agricultural purposes.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n  modification of the time limitation for receipt of claim information\n\n     Current law\n       Under section 5103(b) of title 38 there exists a one-year \n     time limit, following notification by the Secretary, on the \n     receipt of information and evidence necessary to substantiate \n     a claim for benefits based on an already complete or \n     substantially complete application. Public Law 106-475 \n     established this time limitation and eliminated an identical \n     limitation on the receipt of information and evidence \n     necessary to complete an application for benefits.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 205 of the Senate bill would restore the one-year \n     time limit on the receipt of information or evidence \n     necessary to complete an application following notification \n     by the Secretary. It would also eliminate the existing one-\n     year time limit on information or evidence necessary to \n     substantiate a claim based on a completed or substantially \n     complete application.\n\n\n modification of the effective date of change in recurring income for \n                            pension purposes\n\n     Current law\n       Section 5112(b)(4) of title 38, United States code, \n     requires VA pensions be reduced or discontinued effective the \n     first day of the month following the month in which the \n     pensioner's net income is reported to have increased.\n     House bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 206 of the Senate bill would modify the effective \n     date of reduction or discontinuation of compensation or \n     pension by reason of a change in recurring income to the \n     first day of the year following the year in which the \n     pensioner's net income is reported to have changed.\n\n[[Page S13243]]\n\n PAYMENT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS TO AN ALTERNATE BENEFICIARY WHEN FIRST \n                    BENEFICIARY CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED\n\n     Current law\n       Under chapter 19 of title 38, United States Code, there is \n     no time limitation for a first-named beneficiary of a \n     National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) or a United States \n     Government Life Insurance (USGLI) policy to file a claim for \n     proceeds. As a result, when the insured dies and the \n     beneficiary does not file a claim, VA is required to hold the \n     unclaimed funds indefinitely in order to honor any possible \n     future claims by that beneficiary. VA is not permitted to pay \n     the proceeds to an alternate beneficiary unless VA can \n     determine that the first beneficiary predeceased the \n     policyholder.\n     House bill\n       Section 401 of H.R. 2540 would grant the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs the authority to authorize payment of NSLI \n     or USGLI proceeds to an alternate beneficiary when the \n     proceeds have not been claimed by the first-named beneficiary \n     within three years following the death of the policyholder. \n     If no beneficiary has filed a claim within five years of the \n     veteran's death, benefits could be paid to such person as the \n     Secretary determines is equitably entitled to the proceeds of \n     the policy.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n    EXTENSION OF COPAYMENT REQUIREMENT FOR OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION \n                              MEDICATIONS\n\n     Current law\n       Section 1722A(c) of title 38, United States Code, furnishes \n     the Secretary the authority, through September 30, 2002, to \n     require a copayment of $2 for each 30-day supply of \n     medication VA furnishes a veteran on an outpatient basis for \n     the treatment of a nonservice connected disability or \n     condition.\n       House bill Section 402 of H.R. 2540 would extend until \n     September 30, 2006, the authority of the Secretary to require \n     a $2 copayment for each 30-day supply of medication.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH SERVICES IMPROVEMENT FUND MADE \n                       SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS\n\n     House bill\n       Section 403 of H.R. 2540 would amend section 1729B of title \n     38, United States Code, by making the availability of funds \n     in the VA's Health Services Improvement Fund subject to the \n     provisions of appropriations acts effective October 1, 2001.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n PILOT PROGRAM FOR EXPANSION OF TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE ACCESS TO VETERANS \n                        SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES\n\n     Current law\n       VA provides various toll-free automated telephone response \n     systems for veterans to furnish them information on VA \n     benefits and services.\n     House bill\n       Section 407 of H.R. 2540 would establish a two-year \n     nationwide pilot program to test the benefit and cost \n     effectiveness of expanding current access to VA veterans \n     service representatives through a toll-free telephone number. \n     Under the pilot program, the Secretary would be required to \n     expand the available hours of such access to veterans service \n     representatives to not less than twelve hours on each regular \n     business day across U.S. time zones and not less than six \n     hours on Saturday. The pilot would also require that such \n     service representatives have available to them information \n     about veterans benefits provided by all other federal \n     departments and agencies, and state governments.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n CODIFICATION OF RECURRING PROVISIONS IN ANNUAL DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                      AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACTS\n\n     Current law\n       Each year the Congress appropriates funds to the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs as part of the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act. Although the amount of the \n     appropriations varies from year to year, the purposes for \n     which appropriations are made are generally fixed, and change \n     little, if any, from year to year.\n     House bill\n       Section 409 of H.R. 2540 would codify recurring provisions \n     in annual Department of Veterans Affairs Appropriations Acts.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/13/senate-section/article/S13243-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.
