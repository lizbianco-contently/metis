We thank You for the \ninspiring memory of Queen Esther who, in the fifth century B.C., threw \ncaution to the wind and interceded with her husband, the King of \nPersia, to save the exiled Jewish people from persecution. The words of \nher uncle, Mordecai, sound in our souls: ``You have come to the kingdom \nfor such a time as this.''--Esther 4:14.\n  Lord of circumstances, we are moved profoundly by the way You use \nindividuals to accomplish Your plans and arrange what seems like \ncoincidence to bring about Your will for Your people. You have brought \neach of us to Your kingdom for such a time as this. You whisper in our \nsouls, ``I have plans for you, plans for good and not for evil, to give \nyou a future and a hope.''--Jeremiah 29:11.\n  Grant the Senators a heightened sense of the special role You have \nfor each of them to play in the unfolding drama of American history. \nGive them a sense of destiny and a deep dependence on Your guidance and \ngrace.\n  On Purim, we renew our commitment to fight against sectarian \nintolerance in our own hearts and religious persecution in so many \nplaces in the world. This is Your world; let us not forget that \n``though the wrong seems oft so strong, You are the Ruler yet.''

The assistant minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see the manager of the bankruptcy bill \ncoming on the floor. If there are matters dealing with bankruptcy that \nthe Senator wants to take care of at this time, I will be happy to \nyield to him. I know Senator Conrad wishes to speak some time this \nmorning.\n  I yield to my friend from Utah.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are now on the 4th day of debating the \nbankruptcy reform legislation. Yesterday we were given a list of some \n100 Democratic amendments to this bill. If Members are serious about \ntheir amendments, then I ask that they come down and offer them, and \nthat they do so now, so we can see the actual text and avoid any \nfurther undue delays and move forward with this much needed reform \nlegislation. There may be one or two amendments on our side, but I do \nnot think much more than that. So it comes down to getting our friends \non the other side to come and offer their amendments and we will go \nfrom there.\n  I understand Senator Conrad will be here in a few minutes to speak to \none of his amendments. With that, I yield back to the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the senior Senator from \nUtah, I thought we made headway yesterday, with the majority leader, \nwhere he indicated he thought it was important that we work our way \nthrough these amendments. He and Senator Daschle thought that was the \nbest way to proceed. I agree.\n  They have a goal of finishing this bill next week. There are other \nmatters because of calendar obligations that we have that must be taken \nup the following week. I think we can work our way through these \namendments.\n  I agree with my friend from Utah, the manager of this bill, that we \nshould move on some of these amendments. We have all day today and all \nday Monday. After Monday there are going to be people saying: I don't \nhave time to debate this. I don't have time to offer this. Here are 2 \nfull days uninterrupted. They can talk as long as they want. So I hope \nwe can have some of these amendments offered.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that Senator Conrad will be here shortly. \nWith the consent of my friend from Utah, I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed, for the purposes of introducing a bill, as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I say to Senator Hatch, I will, with your permission, until \nSenator Conrad gets here, be as in morning business to introduce a \nbill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid pertaining to the introduction of S. 503 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend from North Dakota is going \nto address the Senate on a very important amendment. But I wanted to \nsay--for I have not had an opportunity publicly for some time--that \nSenator Conrad and I came to the Senate together; we were elected in \n1986. We both had tough, hard-fought elections, and we were grateful \nfor the people of our respective States allowing us to serve in the \nSenate. We have gotten to know each other very well in the years since \n1986.\n  I have been in public life all my adult life--they were all part-time \njobs until I came here in 1982 to the House of Representatives--so I \nhave seen a lot of people and worked with people in many different \ncapacities in government. During my career, I have never known anybody \nwho has a better grasp of finances than Kent Conrad. He not only \nunderstands them, but he can articulate them. I speak for the entire \nDemocratic caucus, and I think most Republicans, in indicating how good \nhe is and how well he understands numbers. The people of North Dakota \nand this country are so fortunate to have someone who understands \nmoney. It is easy to understand the more sexy issues, for lack of a \nbetter description, such as crime and punishment and education. But \nmoney is hard to explain. Dollars are hard to explain. Budgets are hard \nto explain. Taxes are hard to explain.\n  I repeat that I have never known anybody in my career who better \nunderstands and can better express himself in his understanding than \nKent Conrad.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for nice, kind words \nthis morning. I appreciate that. I rise this morning to talk about what \nI think is a very important amendment. It is an amendment I offered \nyesterday to provide protection to the trust funds of Social Security \nand Medicare. We call it the Social Security and Medicare off-budget \nlockbox. It is designed to save both the trust funds of Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  Mr. President, this is critically important because it is right at \nthe heart of the debate that is going to occur this year over our \nbudget priorities. My Social Security and Medicare lockbox amendment \nprotects Social Security surpluses in each and every year, takes the \nMedicare Part A trust fund off budget, gives Medicare the same \nprotections as the Social Security trust fund, and it contains strong \nenforcement provisions.\n  This is the amendment we voted on last year on the floor of the \nSenate. We had 60 votes, a strong bipartisan vote, to protect both the \nSocial Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund.\n  Speaker Hastert, in speaking on a bill offered in the House said:\n\n       We are going to wall off Social Security trust funds and \n     Medicare trust funds . . . and consequently, we pay down the \n     public debt when we do that. So we are going to continue to \n     do that. That's in the parameters of our budget and we are \n     not going to dip into that at all.\n\n  In other words, the Speaker is endorsing the principle, at least, of \nwhat is contained in this amendment, this legislation. Unfortunately, \nif you look at the lockbox they passed in the House, it has a giant \ntrapdoor. It is not really protecting the two funds, the Social \nSecurity and the Medicare trust fund. I think we can do better here in \nthe Senate. We did last year, and I think we can again this year.\n\n  Really, what they passed is what I call a ``leaky lockbox.'' It \ndoesn't really protect Social Security and Medicare trust funds because \nit has a big exception that will allow them to be used for other \npurposes, to be used for new commitments for Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  I think all of us know we need the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds to keep the promises that have already been made. We have \nadditional challenges, no question about that. We have a long-term \nchallenge of Social Security that will not be solved even by saving \nevery penny of the trust fund. We are going to have to put more money \ninto it. But I don't believe we should set those funds up to be raided \nfor any other purpose.\n  Some will say if you save the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds, you are going to build up cash, and then the Government will \nhave to figure out what to do with that cash. Let me just say that we \nhave done a detailed cashflow analysis. You can save every penny of the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds and have no buildup of surplus \ncash until the year 2010--2010 is 9 years from now. That gives us \nplenty of time to adjust to that, if indeed it begins to happen.\n  If these forecasts that have been made actually develop, if we \nactually see them coming true, we will have plenty of additional time \nto adjust.\n  I go back to a statement made by a fellow Budget Committee member, \nSenator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is also on the Finance Committee. He \nsaid, back in 1998, in the Budget Committee deliberations:\n\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\n\n       But the fundamental strength of it is, whether they are \n     Democrats or Republicans who have gotten together in these \n     dark corners of very bright rooms and said, what would we do \n     if we had a half trillion dollars to spend? The obvious \n     answer that cries out is Medicare. I think it is logical. \n     People understood the President on save Social Security \n     first, and I think they will understand save Medicare first. \n     Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare first.\n\n  What we are saying in this legislation is, we want to save Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We ought to treat the trust funds of Social \nSecurity and Medicare in the same way. We ought to protect them both, \ngive them the same protections. We don't in current law. In current \nlaw, we give much more protection to the Social Security trust fund \nthan we do the Medicare trust fund.\n  We all know the Medicare trust fund is in greater danger; we face \ninsolvency in a more recent timeframe than we do with Social Security. \nSo what we are saying is, let's protect them both. That just makes \ncommon sense.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee said this at that same time back \nin 1998:\n\n       For every dollar you divert to some other program, you are \n     hastening the day when Medicare falls into bankruptcy and you \n     are making it more and more difficult to solve the Medicare \n     problem in a permanent manner into the next millennium.\n\n  That is absolutely right. The chairman of the Budget Committee was \nright then, and this same sentiment is right now. We should not raid \nthe Medicare trust fund for other purposes. That hastens its \ninsolvency.\n\n  Let me say the proposal the Republicans have made that will be the \ncompeting proposal to what I have offered, which will be voted on on \nTuesday, I refer to as the ``Republican broken safe.'' Under the \nPresident's budget plan that he has sent us, not a penny is reserved \nfor the Medicare trust fund, not a penny. That is kind of startling and \nalmost hard to believe, but it is true.\n  So their broken safe has a wide open door on it. It has a wide open \ndoor because the President doesn't reserve any money for the Medicare \ntrust fund. It has a wide open door because the proposal that has come \nover from the House is very leaky. It has a huge, ``we will protect the \nMedicare trust fund, unless we don't.'' That is not going to work, or \nsell, and it should not because it is not right.\n  One of the reasons this proposal is necessary is because, if you look \nat the President's budget proposal, it simply does not add up. As I \nhave gone through the numbers and tried to determine the President's \nplan and the effect of the President's plan, here is what I have found: \nThe projected surplus is $5.6 trillion. That is what the CBO says and \nwhat the OMB says, and we all know that is a 10-year forecast, and we \nall know it is highly uncertain. We all know there is only a 10-percent \nchance that is really going to come true. The people who made the \nforecast told us there is a 45-percent chance it will be greater than \nthat. There is a 45-percent chance it will be lower than that.\n  That counsels to many of us that we ought to use caution here. The \nPresident says the Social Security trust fund is $2.6 trillion out of \nthat $5.6 trillion. His documents say the Medicare trust fund is $500 \nbillion of that $5.6 trillion.\n  If you subtract out the Social Security and the Medicare trust funds, \nyou wind up with an available surplus of $2.5 trillion.\n  If we look at the cost of the Bush tax cut, here is what we find. It \nhas been advertised as a tax cut of $1.6 trillion, but when the House \nconsidered parts of the President's tax cut, they reestimated the cost, \nand they increased the cost by over $100 billion. For just part of what \nthe President has proposed, they have increased the cost by over $100 \nbillion.\n  Part of that is moving up the effective date. Part of it is a \nreestimate of the true cost of parts of the President's proposal. \nInstead of a $1.6 trillion tax cut, it is a $1.7 trillion tax cut.\n  In that same reestimate done for the House, we learn that there is a \nvery serious problem that will be created or made worse by the \nPresident's proposal, and that is the alternative minimum tax. The \nalternative minimum tax today affects about 2 million taxpayers. The \nJoint Tax Committee has now told us if we pass the President's plan, \nthe alternative minimum tax will affect not 2 million people, but over \n30 million people.\n  Let me repeat that. The Joint Tax Committee has now told us that if \nwe pass the President's tax plan, it will affect not 2 million people \nin the alternative minimum tax, which is currently the case, but over \n30 million people, and that it will cost $300 billion to fix it.\n  That has to be added to the President's plan. It is not in the \nPresident's plan. It is not there, but this is made more necessary by \nthe President's plan, and it will cost $300 billion to fix.\n  The interest cost associated with this tax cut and the alternative \nminimum tax reform is another $500 billion because anytime you spend \nmoney or cut taxes, that means you have greater interest costs and the \ninterest cost associated with that tax cut and the alternative minimum \ntax reform that it makes more necessary is $500 billion.\n  Then we have the President's spending initiatives over the baseline. \nThat is $200 billion. If you add up the President's tax cut, his \nspending initiatives, it is $2.7 trillion, but if you are protecting \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds, you only have $2.5 \ntrillion available. He is, by my calculation, $200 billion in the hole \nalready and counting, and it will be more because we have yet to have \nthe estimate of what his estate tax elimination costs. We can be \nconfident it is going to be far higher than the previous estimate \nbecause of the economic changes that have occurred in the interim.\n  They have not reestimated his marriage penalty proposal, which we \nknow is going to be higher, again because of changes that have occurred \nin the economy since the previous estimate. This is before any defense \ninitiative sent forward by the President. Does anybody in this Chamber \nnot believe the President is going to send up a major defense \ninitiative next year? We all know he is. I personally believe he \nshould. I think we are going to need more money in defense, but it does \nnot end there.\n  Some of the tax extenders are included in the President's baseline; \nothers are not. We all know the provisions that affect energy are going \nto be extended in the Tax Code. There is a cost to that. That is not in \nthese calculations, and it does not stop there because we now know the \nPresident's prescription drug proposal is badly deficient in terms of \nthe resources he has dedicated to a prescription drug benefit.\n  The Republican chairman of the Finance Committee said to us the \nnumber is going to have to be much higher to have a serious \nprescription drug benefit; it is going to be much higher than what is \nin the President's budget. The President has $153 billion in his \nestimate for a prescription drug benefit. The Congressional Budget \nOffice is telling us the estimates on all the prescription drug \nproposals are being increased by about one-third because of new \ninformation on what is happening to the cost of pharmaceuticals.\n\n  I am saying this to my colleagues and I am saying this to anybody who \nis listening because when you add these things up, the President's \nproposal simply does not make it. There is this tremendous gap between \nwhat is available if we are protecting the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds and what is being used. In fact, it is very clear that the \nPresident is using all of the non-trust-fund money for his tax cut and \nits related expenses.\n  It is clear, I just do not know how any of this can be in any serious \nquestion. We all agree on the projected surplus, and I think most of us \nunderstand it is highly uncertain. It is a 10-year number. The \nforecasting agency itself has told us it is highly uncertain. This is \nthe President's own number for the Social Security trust fund. This is \nhis number for the Medicare trust fund.\n  The Bush tax cut--this is the reestimate done on the House side of \njust part of his plan, and it added $100 billion to the $1.6 trillion \nthat has been so much discussed. We know there is an interest cost \nassociated with any tax cut or any spending proposal. The spending \ninitiatives of the President are not in dispute. It is $200 billion \nabove the so-called baseline.\n  The only question there can be of these figures is this one, fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax. The President\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\nhas not included it in his plan, but it is clearly made necessary by \nhis plan. We cannot take 2 million people who are currently caught up \nin the alternative minimum tax and have it affect 30 million people. \nThat will never be tolerated in this country, and it should not be. It \nwould be unfair for 30 million taxpayers. And they are not saying 30 \nmillion, they are saying substantially in excess of 30 million people \nwill be caught up in the alternative minimum tax if the Bush tax cut \nproposal is passed. It costs $300 billion to fix. That is not Kent \nConrad's number. That is the number of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  There is something else people should know in this Chamber that I \ncall the dirty little secret of the President's budget proposal. The \nPresident's budget is in deficit in the year 2005 if he does not raid \nthe Medicare trust fund. The reason I believe his proposal does not \nprotect the Medicare trust fund is that he needs the money in the year \n2005 to avoid being in deficit.\n  These are the numbers from his proposal. What they show is that in \nthe year 2005, the President's budget is in deficit unless he is using \nthe full Medicare trust fund surplus. Some of us believe that is a \nprofound mistake, that that is not a place we should go; we should not \nraid the Social Security trust fund surplus for any other purpose; we \nshould not raid the Medicare trust fund for any other purpose; we \nshould hold those funds for the purposes intended. We should protect \nthe Social Security trust fund. We should protect the Medicare trust \nfund. We should not allow them to be raided for any other purpose.\n\n  This year, certain Republicans have asserted there is no trust fund \nsurplus in Medicare. It is a bizarre argument, is the only thing I can \nsay. Their argument is there is a Part A trust fund to Medicare and \nthere is a Part B trust fund. They say the trust fund of Part A is in \nsurplus by $500 billion. They say the Part B surplus is in deficit.\n  As I said yesterday, there is no Part B trust fund deficit. There is \nnone. They are arguing there is a surplus in Part A, there is a deficit \nin B, so let's not count the trust funds at all in Medicare.\n  What a bizarre argument. No. 1, they are factually wrong. There is no \ndeficit over the 10 years in Part B. I direct them to page 19 of the \nCongressional Budget Office report. Page 19 of this report, available \nto every Member of Congress, makes it very clear in table 1. It is \ntitled ``Trust Fund Surpluses.'' First is Social Security. We all know \nSocial Security has a trust fund and it is in surplus. That is, it is \nin surplus during this period of time. It is needed when the baby \nboomers start to retire. So ``surplus'' is a little misleading. It is \nin surplus temporarily, but it is committed to future liability.\n  The next trust fund mentioned is the Medicare trust fund's Part A. \nThe Congressional Budget Office showed over a $400 billion surplus. \nTheir numbers are somewhat different from the President's numbers. The \nPresident has an even larger surplus in trust fund Part A. He has a \n$500 billion surplus.\n  In Part B, where some are claiming it is in deficit, the \nCongressional Budget Office shows very clearly there is no deficit over \nthe 10-year period in Part B, it is roughly in balance.\n  The argument that some on the other side are making is, since only 25 \npercent of the Part B trust fund is for premiums and 75 percent comes \nfrom the general fund, that means it is in deficit. That isn't what the \nlaw says. That isn't what the actuaries say. That isn't what the \nCongressional Budget Office reports. They report the Part A trust fund \nis in surplus. They report that the Part B is in balance over the 10-\nyear period. There is no justification for making the claim that if you \nput the two together there is no surplus at all, because there clearly \nis.\n  Even if there weren't, if there were a deficit in Part B, what \nearthly sense would it make to move the Part A trust fund surplus to a \ncategory called ``undesignated,'' called ``contingency fund'' in the \nPresident's plan? That is what he has done. He has taken all of the \nMedicare trust fund money and moved it from a committed category, a \ntrust fund category, to an undesignated category, a category available \nfor every other kind of spending.\n  In my State yesterday, he stated he has this fund, this uncategorized \nfund, this undesignated fund, and if you need more money for \nagriculture, go to that fund. It is kind of the magic asterisk.\n  There is no such fund. There is no such fund unless you raid every \npenny of the Medicare trust fund. If somebody does it, they will be \nheld to account, because some of us are going to tell the truth and we \nare going to remind people there is a trust fund of Medicare and a \ntrust fund of Social Security and that both of them deserve protection \nand both of them deserve support and both of them should not be used \nfor other purposes.\n  I frankly think we ought to put more money in agriculture, but I am \nnot for taking it out of the Medicare trust fund. Any move to use the \nMedicare trust fund money for other purposes moves up the date of \ninsolvency, and in fact the President's plan to take the $500 billion \nfrom the Medicare trust fund and use it for his so-called contingency \nfund that is available for defense spending or agriculture spending or \nany other kind of spending, that moves up the date of insolvency of the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  In fact, the actuaries say if we do what the President has proposed \nand take the money from the Medicare trust fund, put it in the \ncontingency funds, and make it available for other spending, we move up \nthe date of insolvency of the Medicare trust fund by 16 years and it \ngoes broke in the year 2009.\n  Some of us will not have any part of that plan because it is wrong. \nIt is wrong for the country. It is wrong for Medicare. It is wrong to \ntake trust fund money that has been designated for a specific purpose \nand seek to raid it for other purposes. That is what has gotten us into \nfinancial trouble in the past. That is what would get us into financial \ntrouble in the future, if we permitted it to happen.\n  This is a debate that deserves to be heard all across this country. \nIt is fundamental to the economic future of America. Do we raid the \ntrust funds to try to provide an oversized tax cut, or do we protect \nthem? That is the question.\n  I believe our colleagues will rally around a principle they have \nrallied around before, which is the fundamental notion, you don't raid \ntrust funds: You don't raid Social Security trust funds, you don't raid \nMedicare trust funds; those funds ought to be lockboxed, they ought to \nbe walled off, they ought to be protected. That is what this amendment \nis all about. I believe this is what the American people support.\n  On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported that the American people, \nif they are asked: Are you for the Bush tax cut? Are you against it? \noverwhelmingly, they say they are for it. If you ask the American \npeople about the choices, they give quite a different answer. When The \nLos Angeles Times asked in a nationwide poll if they would prefer the \nBush tax cut or the Democratic proposal that had a tax cut half as big \nas the President proposed, with more money for Medicare, more money for \neducation, and more money to pay down debt--which would they prefer--\nthen the American people gave this answer: 30 percent said they were \nfor the Bush tax cut; 55 percent said they were for the alternative \nplan to reduce the size of the President's tax cut in half and to have \nmore money to strengthen Medicare, to improve education, and to pay \ndown more of the debt.\n  That is what the American people are supporting. Yes, they want a tax \ncut, but they want one that is affordable. They want one that gives \nroom to strengthen Social Security, improve Medicare, enhance \neducation, strengthen defense, and pay down more of our national debt. \nThat is where the American people are. That is where I hope this \nChamber will be.\n  The first fundamental test is on Tuesday. The basic question: Do we \nprotect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds? I hope very much \nwe get the same result this year as we got last year. The result last \nyear was 60 votes, on a strong bipartisan basis, for the fundamental \nprinciple that we do not permit a raid of the Social Security or the \nMedicare trust funds. That is important for the future of our country. \nIt is important for the future of our economy. I hope very much this \nChamber will say we are not going to abandon fiscal discipline.\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n  We are not going to abandon the notion that we ought to pursue the \nmaximum paydown of both our short-term and long-term debt. That is in \nAmerica's interest. That is what is at stake on Tuesday.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was sitting here mulling things over \nafter I listened to my colleague from North Dakota and his very erudite \ncomments about the budget, about President Bush's budget, the tax cut \npackage, and so forth.\n  It is kind of amazing to me because, in all honesty, I am afraid our \ncolleagues on the other side completely ignore what happened during the \nReagan years. In their zeal to say that President Reagan caused the \nbudget deficits, they ignore the impact of the marginal tax rate \nreductions that occurred during those years.\n  The reason I know a little bit about this is because I was one of a \nhandful who worked very hard to convince President Reagan to cut the \nmarginal tax rates, which at that point topped out at 70 percent in \nthis country. He cut the maximum rate down to 28 percent by 1986.\n  I remember all the arguments that were raised then by our colleagues \non the other side; and they basically centered on the fact that if you \ncut taxes like that, you will run us into huge deficits because by \ncutting taxes, you will cut revenues. Those were the arguments made by \nour colleagues on the other side. They have completely glossed over \nwhat really happened in saying that all of the subsequent deficits \noccurred because of Ronald Reagan and his tax cuts.\n  The real facts are that Ronald Reagan's tax cuts--those marginal tax \nrate reductions from 70 percent down to 28 percent, by 1986--helped to \nlead us into an unprecedented era of prosperity we still enjoy today, \nand that the resulting federal revenues that came about after those \ncuts did not decrease, except for one single year. In fact, annual \nrevenue to the Treasury actually almost doubled during the Reagan \nyears. The fact is, those tax cuts led to greater revenues because more \npeople saved their money. Instead of the federal Government spending \nit, most people invested their money, created businesses, \nopportunities, and jobs for others. In the end, we actually received \nmore tax revenues.\n  Well, then, how did we get the big deficits? In part, the deficits \ncame from Reagan's increases in military spending. But let's stop and \nthink about that for a minute. That spending has been highly \ncriticized. But defense is the only area where he literally increased \nspending that I can recall. All of the other increases in spending came \nfrom our friends on the other side and liberal Republicans.\n  Let's quit talking about Democrats and Republicans. Let's talk about \nliberals and conservatives. The fact is, we enacted the marginal tax \nrate reductions, and revenue jumped to almost double as a result. But \nspending went up dramatically during those years because, in order to \nget the marginal tax rate reductions, Ronald Reagan had to agree to \nDemocrat spending because Tip O'Neill was the Speaker of the House at \nthat time, and the House was controlled by Democrats, or should I say, \nby the liberals, and they just kept spending. That was part of the \npayoff in order to get tax rate reductions.\n  But we should not lose sight of the fact that we had a tremendous \nincrease in revenues as a result of tax rate reductions.\n  The same revenue effect occurred when Senator Lieberman and I pushed \nthrough the Hatch-Lieberman capital gains rate reduction in 1997. I can \nremember our friends, our liberal friends in this body, saying: If you \ncut capital gains rates, we will lose revenues. We said: No. If you cut \ncapital gains rates, people will save more, invest more, create more \nbusinesses, more jobs, more opportunities, we will have more people \nworking, with more people paying taxes into the system. We will \nactually increase revenues.\n  Some of them even laughed at us until the DRI econometricians came \nout with their analysis, and they are hardly a conservative group. They \ncame out and made it clear that not only did we not lose revenues as a \nresult of reducing capital gains rates from 28 percent down to 20 \npercent, but we actually gained revenues. We did not gain as much as I \nthought we would, but we gained revenues. That is what happened with \nthe Reagan marginal tax rate reductions.\n  But the spending increases were phenomenal during those years. True, \nmilitary spending went up during the Reagan years. And I am sure Ronald \nReagan would be the first to take credit for spending more on the \nmilitary. In fact, during John F. Kennedy's tenure as President, we \nwere spending almost 50 percent of the budget on the military. Over the \nnext years, it greatly decreased. Reagan finally got it up to higher \nlevels, but it was far cry from where John F. Kennedy had it as a \npercentage of budget expenditures.\n  Today, under the Clinton budget, it has gone down to somewhere below \n3 percent, virtually half or less of where Ronald Reagan had it.\n  But what people seem to ignore, when they complain about military \nspending, is that because of the increase in the budget for the \nmilitary, the cold war was ended because the Soviets had to throw in \nthe towel because they could not compete with the United States of \nAmerica. The fact is, we probably have saved trillions of dollars by \nending the cold war, with the United States emerging as the No. 1 power \nin the world today.\n  So even with that additional spending, which was not anywhere near as \nhigh as the percentage of the budget that John F. Kennedy was spending, \nwe have probably saved trillions of dollars over the years since the \ncold war came to an end.\n  I never cease to be amazed at how our liberal friends in this body \nare constantly talking about balancing the budget. It never ceases to \namaze me because in 1994, when they controlled both Houses of Congress, \nand President Clinton was President, their budget projections showed \n$200 billion in deficits every year ad infinitum. Tell me that isn't \ntrue. I know it is. I was here--$200 billion every year, henceforth in \nthe future. Basically, President Clinton said there was not much we \ncould do about it.\n  And then, all of a sudden, the first Republican Congress in almost 40 \nyears came into being, and we started pushing for a balanced budget, \nwhich we shortly after achieved. And now our liberal friends are trying \nto claim they balanced the budget. Give me a break.\n  I am talking about liberals on both sides of the aisle. If you just \nlook at last year, the people in these two bodies could not control \nspending and it went up in whopping fashion. The reason it went up is \nbecause there was no pressure to control spending because we had a \nsurplus, and we could just tap into that surplus at will.\n  I might also add that President Clinton used the surpluses for \n``emergency'' spending that exceeded $20 billion a year. Frankly, \nalmost everything they wanted to spend on, from a liberal perspective, \nsuddenly became an emergency. Some of those programs were emergencies, \nbut certainly not all.\n  I guess what I am saying is, if we do not give the taxpayers back \nsome of this $5.6 trillion projected surplus--and I have to say $1.6 \ntrillion of the $5.6 trillion isn't very much--if we do not give them \nback some of that surplus, I guarantee you the wonderful Members of \nCongress, especially those on the liberal side--but I have to say some \nconservatives, too; all of us are to blame--we will spend every \nstinking dime of it. And the American people will be the worse off for \nit.\n  When I hear these analyses done by our friends on the other side, \nthey never give credit for the dynamic effects of cutting marginal tax \nrates. They always use static budgetary figures that never take into \nconsideration economic stimuli that comes from cutting taxes and giving \npeople a break.\n  Of course, they have been able to get away with it for years because, \nfor all of the time I have been here--and I have been here for 25 \nyears--there has never been a conservative control of either House of \nCongress. It has always\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\nbeen under the control, if you look at the numbers, of the left. And \nthe left believes in spending. They believe the Federal Government is \nthe last answer to everything.\n  They believe the Federal Government, like a great big all-consuming \nnanny, is going to take care of all of us. They ignore the economic \nfact that there are some dynamics in economics that do occur when you \ngive incentives to the American people.\n  We have a $5.6 trillion projected surplus. Most economists, including \nOMB, including CBO, indicate that this may be a conservative figure. It \nmay be even beyond that if we do what is right. One of the things we \ncan do to make sure it is a conservative figure and to make sure we \nmight even get more money in revenue is to cut marginal tax rates \nbecause it does work to do so. If we have the guts and the brains and \nthe ability to do that, the American economy is going to be much better \noff.\n  President Bush has said he doesn't want a spending increase of more \nthan 4 percent in the total budget. He has also said he will be \nreasonable with regard to the spending needs of Congress. He has also \nsaid he only wants $1.6 trillion from the $5.6 trillion projected \nbudget in tax cuts. That leaves $4 trillion more, and he is going to \nput $2.6 trillion away for Social Security and Medicare.\n  I get such a kick out of the lockbox arguments on both sides because \nthere is no lockbox. There is never going to be a lockbox. The fact is, \nif we save that money, unless we reform Medicare and Social Security, \nwe are going to have to take that money and either spend it, which is \nwhat Congress will probably do, or we are going to pay down the \nnational debt, which is what we should do to an extent.\n  Even if you save the $2.6 trillion for Social Security and Medicare, \nthat is not going to do much good unless we reform those programs. \nEverybody knows there are approximately 40 million people on Medicare \nnow. That is going to rise to 80 million people by the year 2035. If we \ndon't do something now to reform Medicare, it won't make any difference \nhow much money we put in there. It will not be enough. Social Security \nhas some of the same problems.\n  When Social Security came into existence, there were 46 workers, if I \nrecall correctly, for everybody receiving Social Security. Today, it is \n3.4 workers for everybody on Social Security, going down to 3, maybe \n2.9 in the next 10 years, 2.9 workers for everybody receiving Social \nSecurity.\n  What future do our kids have unless we reform these programs and make \nthem work and make them live within their means? I hear all these \ncomments about a lockbox and how we have to save Medicare and Social \nSecurity. Yet I don't see a lot of effort being made, at least by the \nleft and maybe some of us on the right, being made to save these \nprograms, to reform them, and make them work. I am very concerned about \nthese issues.\n  President Bush is willing to set aside $2.6 trillion of the projected \nsurplus. He wants $1.6 trillion for a tax cut, and that still leaves a \nconsiderable amount of money to take care of other problems we have. \nThat surplus won't be there if we keep taxing and spending as we have a \ntendency to do.\n  Last year was a perfect illustration, as we just spent ourselves into \na blind fit of passion. Those who actually handle the budget, those who \nhandle the appropriations process, are having a heck of a time trying \nto hold the more moderate-to-liberal members among us from spending \nthis Nation into bankruptcy.\n  Yet all we hear is, we shouldn't cut taxes. When you have a $5.6 \ntrillion projected surplus, by gosh, you know the taxpayers are paying \ntoo much in taxes. It is the time to give them some of these taxes \nback. Is this $1.6 trillion tax cut exorbitant? Hardly. It is about \nhalf in relative terms what John F. Kennedy did and only a third of \nwhat Ronald Reagan did. It is not a great big ballooning tax cut. The \nfact is, if we cut taxes, this economy will be stimulated and spurred \non to higher revenue.\n\n  The so-called ``budget surplus'' is really an overcollection of taxes \nwhich belongs to the American people. There is no question about it.\n  One other point we need to understand is that the budget surplus is \nnot the result of some brilliant new goods or services the Federal \nGovernment sells. The Government's revenues come from collections from \nthe American people. The Federal Government hasn't created this \nsurplus.\n  Some on the other side would say their massive increases of taxes, \nsuch as the 1993 tax increase, have helped. I suspect that is possibly \ntrue. Then again, doesn't that argue in my favor and make the point I \nhave been making: we are taxing the American people far too much when \nyou have these kind of surpluses? There are some on the other side who \nhave never seen a spending bill they didn't fall in love with. There \nare some on the other side who have never said, in the whole time I \nhave known them--and I think we could pick them out rather easily--they \nhave never said: Where are we going to get the money to pay for these \nprograms?\n  There are some on the other side who really do want us to have the \nFederal Government take care of everybody from the cradle to the grave. \nThat sounds wonderful except it would make the United States an also-\nran country like so many others that have taken that type of philosophy \nand put it into practice.\n  What we have to do as Members of Congress is to support this \nPresident. The American people did elect him, in spite of all the \nmoaning and groaning about Florida. The facts are that George Bush did \nwin Florida. He probably won New Mexico, too. Because Florida was where \nit was at, they didn't contest New Mexico. He probably won a few other \nStates. If you look at some of the reports that have come in, there is \nno reason for anybody on the other side to be complaining at this \nparticular point.\n  Some have said Gore received a half million more votes. Well, that is \nirrelevant because we have an electoral college system where we have a \ndirect election by 50 States, not by 280 million people, except insofar \nas they vote for a particular candidate in their respective States. \nThere is a genius to that system because it makes our system for \nrunning for President a truly national election rather than a series of \nregional elections. Under this system, a candidate can't afford to \nignore any State, any of the 50 States, when he or she is running for \nPresident.\n  If you need any further proof, just look at the last election. \nWyoming, with three electoral college votes, made the difference. I \nmight add, Vermont would have made the difference with three. North \nDakota would have made the difference with three, or Alaska with three \nvotes. Every State was in play. There was a genius to the Founding \nFathers.\n  Our electoral college system requires a national, not a regional, \ncampaign. Why is that important? Because the Founding Fathers were \nafraid, in fact terrorized, that the small States, the more rural \nStates, would be completely obliterated by those who had all the money \nand the population. So they gave a little advantage to the small States \nby having the House of Representatives elected proportionately but the \nSenate with equal rights of suffrage for every State. In other words, \nUtah, with 2.1 million people, has the same number of Senators as \nCalifornia with 32 million. The reason was because they wanted to have \nthe Senate protect the country. That is why Senators have 6-year terms, \nso they can rise above politics occasionally.\n  The fact is, our electoral college system works very well because \nPresidential campaigns have to be national, not regional. The media \nwould not control the Federal election completely, which they would, \nbecause only the 10 or 12 largest States would control the country. \nWhat it means is that George Bush, if we had a direct popular election, \nwould have spent a lot more time in New York, a lot more time in \nCalifornia, a lot more time in Michigan, a lot more time in Illinois. \nHe would have picked up those 500,000 votes or more. He didn't spend a \nlot of time in States he knew he was going to lose. He had to try to \nmake sure he ran a national campaign and picked up enough votes to win \nthe electoral college, so that no 6, or 8, or 10, or 12 States, at the \nmost, would control everything in this country. The media would not \ncontrol the major centers that disseminate all the news in this \ncountry. Nobody doubts for a minute that the media is one-sided. \nEverybody in America\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nknows the media are certainly tilted to the left. It is awfully hard to \neven get a job in the media unless you are on the left. We all know \nthat; the media knows that; there isn't even a question about it.\n\n  So our electoral college system does work. It makes it a national \nelection, not a regional election. The media can't control the \nelection. You have to campaign in all of the respective States, and, \nliterally, it makes a lot of sense. This last election proved that more \nthan ever before.\n  I hear these arguments that George Bush is taking us down the road to \ndestruction because he wants to give the American people some of their \nmoney back. George Bush is absolutely right on his tax cut. There \nshould not be a $5.6 trillion surplus without a realization that the \nAmerican people are being taxed and overtaxed. I have to tell you, if \nwe don't do something about it and give some of that money back, our \nwonderful friends in both bodies here--and they are good people; they \njust can't help themselves--are going to spend all that money and we \nare going to try to ``do good'' with all that money. In the end, we \nwill kill this economy deader than a doornail.\n  So what President Bush is fighting for out in the hinterland right \nnow is extremely important. It will make the difference as to whether \nwe have another 17 or 18 years of economic prosperity, with continual \nrises in productivity and other benefits that are economic in nature, \nor whether we start to descend and retrogress as a nation. I believe \nthat is one reason he was elected. I believe that is one reason we need \nto support him.\n  I have heard a lot about bipartisanship around here. In all honesty, \nthis is a good chance for everybody to show bipartisanship and support \nthe President in the one program that he really thinks is the \ncenterpiece of his agenda. We are going to try to do something on \neducation, but let's be honest about that: The Federal Government \naffects only about 7 percent of all of public education in this \ncountry; 93 percent of all educational funds come from the States. That \nis where they ought to come from, and that is where the power ought to \nbe, and that is where the authority ought to be. But President Bush is \ngoing to do what he can in education. That will probably be the next \nbill on the floor after bankruptcy.\n  The hallmark of the Bush tax cut legislation is the same as Ronald \nReagan's. When Reagan came in, people laughed at first when he started \ntalking about a 25-percent marginal tax rate reduction over a 3-year \nperiod. But you can't laugh at it today. It was the Reagan marginal tax \nrate reductions that almost doubled the revenues. It was Congress' \nspending that put us into the huge deficits we had. Plus, he did \nincrease the military, but we ended the cold war, which saved us \ntrillions of dollars over the years.\n  Then we had a battle for the balanced budget amendment year after \nyear. We knew we would always lose that battle. There was only one time \nwe had a chance of winning. It had to be waged, and it got the American \npeople thinking, my gosh, they are right, we should balance the budget. \nIt was the 1997 capital gains rate reductions, that Senator Lieberman \nand I and a whole raft of others in the Congress fought so hard to get, \nwhich helped to stabilize the economy. It helped in so many ways. It \nwas the productivity that grew out of those issues. I think Alan \nGreenspan, to a large degree, has done very remarkable work at the Fed. \nI think Bob Rubin did a very good job in stabilizing world markets as \nTreasury Secretary. But it was the first Republican Congress in almost \n40 years that insisted on balancing the budget, and President Clinton \nwas brought reluctantly with us. We insisted on balancing the budget, \nand we were able to finally do it. Our colleagues on the left are now \nclaiming they are the ones who did it. Give me a break.\n  As bad as spending was last year, it could have been far worse. We \nhad to fight every inch of the way to control it, to the extent that we \ncould. It would have gone completely out of control. It is not all the \nleft's fault; some of the blame is on the right as well.\n\n  All of these factors came together to bring us to the point now where \nwe have a balanced budget and a projected $5.6 trillion surplus. I \nsuggest there will be a lot more if we cut tax rates by $1.6 trillion, \nas President Bush would like to.\n  I get a little tired of this class warfare that goes on around here, \ntoo. It gets very old to hear that ``the upper 1 percent'' is going to \nbenefit so much and those making $25,000 a year will get no benefits \nout of this program. That is not true. All levels of taxpayers are \ngoing to get tax cuts from the Bush plan.\n  A family of four earning $35,000 a year or less will pay nothing in \ntaxes. There is a good reason that taxpayers with even lower incomes \nare not going to get much benefit from the tax cut they don't pay any \ntaxes to begin with, as far as income taxes are concerned. They do pay \nthrough the nose, especially if they are self-employed, on Social \nSecurity, FICA taxes, there is no question about it. We need to do \nsomething about that, but not without some reform of the Social \nSecurity system.\n  When you stop and think about it, the upper 5 percent of income-\ntaxpayers pay 50 percent of all the income taxes in this country. All \nBush wants to do is reduce the top rate from 39.6 percent down to 33 \npercent, and the other three brackets correspondingly, with the lower \nones being reduced the most.\n  Guess what the bottom 50 percent pay in Federal income taxes. Less \nthan 5 percent of Federal income taxes.\n  So, naturally, those who benefit from marginal rate reductions will \nbe those who pay taxes. Naturally, there will be people who are wealthy \nand who will benefit from that tax rate reduction. But these people \ndon't take that money and put it into socks or mattresses, they put it \ninto productive uses, by and large, and in the process create more \nopportunity, jobs, high-technology, and they keep the United States in \nthe forefront of all of these economic programs that have made us the \ngreatest Nation in the world.\n  Yes, those who pay taxes are going to get tax reductions. Those who \ndon't are still going to get plenty of benefits from the Federal \nGovernment. We do need to do something to save Social Security and \nMedicare, no question about it. I, for one, hope we have the guts to do \nsomething about that over the next few years. But when I hear these \ncomments all based on a static economic analysis, never considering the \ndynamism we have all seen occur since 1982, just completely ignoring \nthat and acting as though it doesn't exist, and coming out with these \ndoomsday scenarios that are trying to undermine what President Bush is \ntrying to do, which is to just get the taxpayers a little bit back. In \ncomparison to John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, the Bush tax cut is \nhalf of the Kennedy tax cut and one-third of the Reagan tax cut, if you \nwant to put it in relative terms.\n  I hear these doomsday scenarios that we should not cut taxes because \nwe have so much for which we need to spend that money. I am not \nspeaking of my friend from North Dakota. I think he literally wants to \ndo what is right, but he is using the static economic analyses that \naren't necessarily accurate.\n  You can use figures to make any point you want. But there is one \nfigure you can't ignore, and that is a $5.6 trillion surplus that \nvirtually all of the major economic analytical groups say is going to \nbe there. If that is so, then you have to draw the conclusion that the \nAmerican people are paying too much in taxes and that they deserve tax \nbreaks under these circumstances.\n  I want to see us go toward a more dynamic economic analysis, at least \nhave both sides of it so we do not just have this stultification to any \nkind of tax rate reduction that is being argued by our friends on the \nother side.\n  I hope they are not arguing these basic budgetary principles, that I \nthink are wrong, just so they can politically make it tough for \nPresident Bush. He has only been in office a couple months.\n  Frankly, it would be a crime to not give his program a chance to work \nsince he is our President. It would be a crime to not work in a \nbipartisan fashion to do what needs to be done. Literally, it would be \na crime not to give this President some support. We have done it for \nPresident Clinton, and it is time to do it for President Bush. It is \nnot President Bush for whom we are doing it in the final analysis, it \nis for everybody in our society, and really for many places in the \nworld that depend\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\nupon the economic stability of the United States of America.\n  I make these points because I get concerned when I hear one-sided \narguments on the budget, one-sided arguments on tax rate reductions, \none-sided arguments on Medicare and Social Security, one-sided \narguments based on static analyses that never take into consideration \nactual real-world results, one-sided arguments that ignore the facts in \nthis country that tax rate reductions work, and one-sided arguments in \ncomplete derogation and ignorance of the last 18 years.\n  The fact is, we all have to do our best to analyze this the best we \ncan, but we should not ignore the econometricians, though not \nconservative, who have proven that tax rate reductions do work, and we \nshould not ignore the fact that restraint in spending does work, too. \nWe have not had much of that around here, even with a Republican \nCongress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few more minutes to \nrespond to some of the comments of my friend and colleague from North \nDakota.\n  The Senator from North Dakota keeps talking about a Bush tax cut of \nmore than $1.6 trillion. He can talk about any number he wants, but the \nPresident has made it clear that he is committed to a budget that would \nreduce Federal revenue collections by $1.6 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. Budget Committee Chairmen Domenici and Nussle have committed to \nproducing a budget that reduces tax collections by $1.6 trillion over \n10 years.\n  The House and Senate Republican leadership are determined to allow \ntaxpayers to keep more of their own money--$1.6 trillion--over the next \n10 years. All the above have agreed that any changes to the President's \ntax relief proposal--adding provisions, removing provisions, changing \nprovisions--would have to be accommodated within a budget that reduces \nFederal revenues by $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Let's now look at why the number is not $2.4 trillion, $2.5 trillion \nor $2.6 trillion.\n  The claimed additional interest cost of $500 billion to the tax cut \nis a red herring argument; interest is included in the budget; trying \nto tie interest cost to the tax cut is inconsistent with past practice \non spending increases and tax cuts.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, adding interest to these tax cuts assumes \nthat the every dollar of the tax cut would be used to pay down the debt \nif the taxes were not cut. In reality, every Member of this Chamber \nvery well knows that if we do not send this money home to the taxpayers \nwho were overcharged in the form of too high of taxes, most of the \nsurplus will be spent by Congress. There is no interest savings when \nthe alternative to tax cuts is spending increases. All one has to do is \nlook at last year for an illustration.\n  The claimed additional revenue loss of $200 billion connected with \nthe alternative minimum tax will have to be addressed within the \ncontext of the $1.6 trillion figure; with respect to the child tax \ncredit, it is already accounted for in the President's budget. The \nPresident, the Vice President, and the Secretary of the Treasury have \nmade it clear that if the AMT is taken care of, some other feature of \nthe President's tax plan would be reduced to make it fit in the $1.6 \ntrillion number.\n  The claimed additional revenue loss of $200 billion for the \nretroactive portion of the tax cut will also have to be addressed \nwithin the context of the $1.6 trillion figure.\n  The claimed additional revenue loss of $100 billion for tax extenders \nis an example of double counting; extenders are already addressed in \nthe President's budget.\n  The bottom line is that the numbers used by the other side are bogus \narguments to support their ultimate goal: very little tax cut and much \nhigher spending.\n  The President's budget shows that you can pay down the Federal debt, \nreturn some of the surplus to the people as tax relief, and provide \ntargeted spending increases. I think we ought to talk facts, not \nfiction. That is what I am trying to do.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lugar pertaining to the introduction of S. 508 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 28\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of amendment No. \n28. This amendment will increase the authorization of appropriations \nfor LIHEAP assistance, weatherization programs, and State conservation \ngrants. It also will expand the Federal energy efficiency program to \ninclude water, as well as energy, conservation.\n  This provision is critical. In my part of the country, and elsewhere \naround the Nation, we have experienced record cold temperatures, and \nrecord-high natural gas prices. I have received letters from people who \nhave to choose between heating their homes and eating, because they \ncan't afford both. I also heard from a couple that can't afford to keep \ntheir retirement home, because the heating bills have been so high. We \nmust do something to rectify this terrible situation now.\n  Under current law, States have the flexibility to establish, or \nraise, the threshold for LIHEAP eligibility at 60 percent of the \nState's median income level. Because of limited resources, States \nrarely reach that threshold.\n  Specifically, \\2/3\\ of LIHEAP funds currently go to individuals who \nearn $8,000 per year or less. One-third goes to those who earn \napproximately $15,000 per year. That is, only 19 percent of people that \ncould qualify for eligibility to receive LIHEAP funds actually receive \nsuch funds. Eighty-one percent of those eligible, therefore, do not \nreceive LIHEAP funding.\n  This amendment would expand the LIHEAP program to attempt to reach \nthe 81 percent not currently receiving LIHEAP assistance.\n  This amendment also is critical because it would increase the \neligible income levels, so that LIHEAP assistance would be provided to \na broader group of people, who cannot pay their exorbitant energy \nbills. This amendment would enable States to provide LIHEAP assistance \nto households with incomes up to and including 200 percent of the \npoverty level for each State.\n  We also need to place a greater emphasis on conservation, and on \nrenewable energy. Unfortunately, the President's budget cuts these \ncritical program elements.\n  As yesterday's Washington Post reported, ``The Bush plan calls for a \n$700 million reduction from this year's $19.7 billion Energy Department \nspending.'' Nearly half ``of those proposed cuts were aimed at the \nefficiency and renewable-energy programs. They are currently budgeted \nat $1.18 billion. The research is focused on a range of programs, from \nhigh-mileage, hybrid motor-engines and more energy-efficient industrial \nprocesses to new building designs that conserve energy.''\n  I hope the Bush administration will realize the impracticality of \ncutting alternative energy and energy conservation programs at a time \nwhen we have a shortage of domestic energy supply sources and are \noverly reliant on foreign energy supplies.\n  Beyond the short-term, emergency measures we are working to pass \ntoday, we need to develop a broader, long-term energy policy that will \nattempt to address the multiple energy problems we are facing. I will \nwork with my colleagues to develop such legislation, legislation that \nmust include renewable energy and conservation measures, including \nimproved vehicle efficiency, as well as efforts to diversify our fuel \nsupply sources in an environmentally sustainable manner. This\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nwould include advancing clean coal technologies, for example.\n  I have introduced legislation to provide a 5-year extension of the \nwind energy production tax credit. This will help develop a non-fossil \ninfrastructure to relieve burden on other fuel sources and help bring \noverall energy prices down. I understand that President Bush has \nannounced his support for this type of incentive.\n  I also am considering legislation to pursue exploration not of the \nArctic Refuge, but of Alaska's North Slope, where 35 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas have already been identified as readily available. \nSuch legislation would include provisions to develop the pipeline \ninfrastructure to bring that natural gas to the lower 48 States. We \nmust pursue exploration and development, but must do so in a safe and \nenvironmentally sustainable manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nover the decision announced this week by Commerce Secretary Donald \nEvans to release raw census data without adjustment for the undercount \nof an estimated three million Americans.\n  By law, the Census Bureau is required to provide census figures to \nthe States for the purpose of redistricting by April 1, 2001; a \ndeadline that is nearly four weeks away. Only last week, I joined with \n47 of my Senate colleagues in a letter to Secretary Evans urging him to \ndelay a decision to release the 2000 census figures until after the \nCommerce Department's self-imposed March 5, 2001, deadline to allow the \nappropriate Senate Committees an opportunity to hold hearings. My \nintent in signing the letter was not to delay the statutory deadline, \nbut rather to request that there be Congressional input.\n  I was interested that the President, in his first budget proposal, \nsaid, ``our Nation has a long and honorable commitment to assisting \nindividuals, families, and communities who have not fully shared in \nAmerica's prosperity.'' I believe this is true, which is why failing to \ncount all Americans has serious consequences for State, local, and \nFederal Government.\n  There are approximately 1,327 Federal domestic assistance programs \nthat use population data in some way. The breadth of the programs \naffected that touch families and businesses throughout the nation \nclearly spells out the need to ensure that all Americans are counted. \nFederal and State funds for schools, employment services, housing \nassistance, road construction, day care facilities, hospitals, \nemergency services, programs for seniors, and much more are distributed \nbased on census figures. The use of raw census data, without adjustment \nfor the differential undercount, will result in the unfair distribution \nof Federal funds.\n  A March 1, 2001 memorandum to Secretary Evans from the acting \ndirector of the Census Bureau recommended using unadjusted census data \nfor redistricting purposes. According to the memo, ``The primary reason \nfor arriving at this conclusion is the apparent inconsistency in \npopulation growth over the decade as estimated by the Accuracy and \nCoverage Evaluation, ACE, and demographic analysis. These differences \ncannot be resolved in the time available for the Committee's work.'' In \nother words, the Executive Steering Committee for ACE Policy ran out of \ntime and could not determine whether the uncorrected data is more \naccurate than corrected data.\n  As a member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I provide \nlegislative support and oversight over the decennial census and the \nCensus Bureau. Moreover, as a Senator from Hawaii, I knew that the \npercentage of people undercounted in my state during the 1990 Census, \n1.9 percent, was higher than the national average. The largest \ncomponent of my state's undercount by race was projected to be Asians \nand Pacific Islanders. I was so concerned that Hawaii would once again \nhave a higher than average undercount that, last March, I held a forum \nin Hawaii on issues facing Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders \nrelated to the 2000 Census. I urged Native Hawaiians and other Pacific \nIslanders to participate in the 2000 Census in order to ensure accurate \ndata and statistics especially since this information directly impacts \nour lives for the next ten years.\n  I call upon the Secretary to make available to the public the \ndetailed information that the Census Bureau has compiled to date, \nincluding over-counts and undercounts. Again, I am disappointed with \nthe Administration's decision in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/09/senate-section/article/S2115-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LAURIE LAWSON\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

I know he is \nlooking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren and \nkeeping up with his beloved Clemson Tigers.

Mr. President, I am very fortunate to be one of \nonly one hundred individuals chosen to represent my fellow Americans \nhere in the Senate. As a result of this work, I have the opportunity to \nmeet many, many people. Occasionally I have come to know people who are \nso giving of themselves, so devoted to their life's work, that they \ntruly serve as an inspiration. I would like to take a few moments to \nrecognize one such individual, Harold Howrigan of Fairfield, VT.\n  Harold has been a dairy farmer in Vermont his entire life and has \nbeen a Director of the St. Albans Cooperative Creamery for over 20 \nyears, as well as the long-time President of the co-op. He has been \nactively involved with dairy promotion on State, national, and \ninternational levels, and has worked with practically every dairy farm \norganization that I know, including Dairy Management Inc., the National \nMilk Producers Federation, the U.S. Dairy Export Council, the National \nDairy Board, the Vermont Farm Bureau, and the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact Commission.\n  Harold and his wife, Anne--a former school teacher, who is still a \nvery active tutor, mentor and volunteer in the cause of education have \nalso devoted themselves to educating future generations about \nagriculture, starting with their five children--Harold, Lawrence, \nMichael, Bridget and Ellen--and their 12 grandchildren. They are very \nspecial friends of my wife Marcelle, my children and me.\n  Most recently, Harold has been honored as the recipient of what some \ncall the ``Nobel Prize'' of the dairy industry, the Richard E. Lyng \naward from the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. This award \nrecognizes an individual for their ``distinguished service to dairy \npromotion and research.'' I can't think of another individual more \ndeserving of this honor than Harold Howrigan.\n  In a recent interview Harold said ``family farmers are the best, \nhardest working people in the world . . . it's a business and a way of \nliving that is second to none in this country.'' I couldn't agree more \nand I thank Harold for the tremendous work he has done for the dairy \nindustry in Vermont and across America, as well as the expert and \nunselfish counsel on agriculture he has provided to me and my staff \nover many years.\n  I ask that an article about Harold be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the St. Albans (VT) Messenger, Feb. 26, 2001]\n\n                  To Harold Howrigan: Congratulations\n\n                           (By Emerson Lynn)\n\n       Occasionally, something happens that is so right that when \n     you learn about it, you pound the table and say, yes, that's \n     what should have happened.\n       That's our response to the news that Harold Howrigan was \n     the recipient of the Richard E. Lyng Award for \n     ``distinguished service to dairy promotion and research.'' \n     The award, which is only given out periodically, is the \n     industry's equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n       There is not a person in the industry, anywhere, who \n     deserves the award more. That there may not be a kinder, more \n     professional person alive is an aside, what made the award so \n     appropriate is the incredible level of dedication he has made \n     toward his profession, or, as he would say, his way of life.\n       His name and the St. Albans Cooperative Creamery are \n     synonymous. He's its president\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\n     and has sat on its board for two decades. If there is an \n     issue that involves the industry he is there, as he has been \n     for all rounds with the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. \n     He knows the politics of Washington and Montpelier as well as \n     any insider and he is as respected there as he is here.\n       But what shines through all this is the understanding that \n     if the awards were not there his commitment would be no less. \n     He's a fortunate man; he believes in what he does and would \n     choose no other way of life. To Harold Howrigan, there is no \n     higher calling than producing food for a hungry world and, in \n     the process, keeping alive and vibrant a livelihood that's as \n     healthy as the milk he produces.\n       He knows better than most the value of the industry's $350 \n     million that sustains our communities. And he understands the \n     importance of pushing the industry's efforts far past \n     Franklin County's borders.\n       But what he understands best is the meaning of the words he \n     once heard from his school's nun: ``Much has been given to \n     you, and much will be expected from you.''\n       It can be safely said that he has met her \n     expectations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/09/senate-section/article/S2116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SALUTING DOVER'S POLICE CHIEF\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true local \nhero in my State, Dover's Police Chief Keith Faulkner.\n  Chief Faulkner retired his badge earlier this month after an \nunprecedented 28 years of service on the Dover Police Department. His \nservice and leadership truly were unique. He joined the police force as \na student cadet and is the first and only such officer to rise to the \nrank of Chief of Police.\n  Personally, I have to admit I know what it must feel like when a \npolice officer's long-serving, trusted partner retires. Keith Faulkner \nproudly first put on his Dover Police uniform the same year I took \noffice as a U.S. Senator. Chief Faulkner and I have been through a lot \ntogether, and I will greatly miss his advice, counsel and support.\n  Fortunately, Chief Faulkner isn't going far. He already has started a \nnew venture at nearby Delaware State University in Dover as associate \ndirector of public safety. DSU just formed a police department last \nyear, and I am confident the University, its students and faculty will \nbenefit immensely from his nearly three decades of law enforcement \nexperience.\n  Chief Faulkner is widely credited with restoring and strengthening \nthe Dover Police Department's reputation as a leading law enforcement \nagency in our State. Under his command, Dover achieved the coveted \nnational accreditation, a distinction shared by only about 700 police \nforces nationwide. He also presided over the institutionalization of \ncommunity policing on the Dover police force, which has contributed to \nreducing crime and boosting the confidence of local residents in the \npolice. In fact, for the first time ever, crime rates for violent and \nnon-violent crimes are down for the past two straight years.\n  And his commitment to public service goes beyond Dover. Keith has \nserved as Vice-Mayor on the Smyrna Town Council, Chair of the Delaware \nPolice Chiefs' Council, and sits on my independent Military Academy \nReview Board to interview and select the high school students I appoint \nto our national military service academies.\n  To be honest, the real purpose of this tribute to Chief Faulkner is \nnot to wish him a ``happy retirement!'' I am confident he will continue \nto be a leader in our State on law enforcement issues. And I am hopeful \nthat his role as a public servant has only just begun.\n  I wish Keith and his family many more years of good health, safety \nand good fortune.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/09/senate-section/article/S2116-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:01 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3.

A bill to provide for periodic Indian needs assessments, to \nrequire Federal Indian program evaluations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Inouye in introducing the Indian Needs \nAssessment, Program Evaluation and Policy Coordination Act of 2001 to \nbring about needed reforms in the way Indian programs are designed and \nfunded.\n  As the annual funding debates over Indian programs show us year after \nyear, rational and equitable funding decisions are made more difficult \nbecause of the lack of accurate and up-to-date information about the \nneeds of tribal governments and tribal members.\n  The ability of the Congress to target unmet needs and make available \nadquate funds for tribes and tribal members is directly related to the \nquantity and quality of information available about the type and degree \nof demand for federal programs and services.\n  Within two years of the enactment of this act, and every 5 years \nthereafter, each Federal agency or department is required to conduct an \n``Indian Needs Assessment'', INA, aimed at determining the needs of \ntribes and Indians eligible for programs and services administered by \nsuch agency or department.\n  To facilitate information collection and analysis, the bill requires \nthe development of a uniform method, criteria and procedures for \ndetermining, analyzing, and compiling the program and service needs of \ntribes and Indians.\n  The resulting ``Indian Needs Assessments'' are to be filed with the \nCommittees on Appropriations and Indian Affairs of the Senate, and the \nCommittees on Appropriations and Resources of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In addition to a Needs Assessment, the bill also requires that each \nFederal agency or department responsible for providing services to \nIndians file an ``Annual Indian Program Evaluation'', AIPE, with these \nsame committees.

A bill to amend the Safe Water Act to provide grants to small \npublic drinking water systems; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have spent a great deal of time, as we \nshould, focusing on President Bush's tax cut. There are some \ndifferences that have been noted on numerous occasions. My point is, \nthere are many other issues about which we need to be engaged.\n  Yesterday in the Environment and Public Works Committee, we did some \nvery good work. We reported a bill out of that committee dealing with \nbrownfields. The Acting President pro tempore, who is presiding, was a \ncosponsor of that legislation last year. It is very important \nlegislation. It will allow the cleanup of about 450,000 sites that now \nare blighted sites, most of them in city centers--where there may have \nbeen a dry cleaner there before, or there may have been some business--\nand there may be some toxic substances in the ground.\n  This legislation will allow the cleanup to go forward. It will allow \nthese places to become productive.\n  We have already identified, for example, in Nevada, some 30 sites \nthat need to be cleaned up, producing hundreds of jobs and millions and \nmillions of dollars on the tax rolls. We did this. It shows that we can \ndo things on a bipartisan basis.\n  The subcommittee is run by Senators Boxer and Chafee. They work very\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nwell together. There was bipartisan support for this legislation. I am \nvery proud of what the committee did.\n  I hope, with the schedule that we have, we can have this on the \nfloor, and we can pass this out of here, and send it to the House, \nwithin the next month. It is good legislation.\n  Mr. President, communities in Nevada and nationwide are facing a \ncrisis in their ability to provide clean, affordable drinking water to \nthe public.\n  Dramatic population growth in some areas of the country has only \nincreased the demand for more drinking water.\n  At the same time, standards are being adopted by local, State, and \nFederal governments to assure the safety of drinking water supplies.\n  Because of this, communities all across the country are facing the \nneed to install, upgrade, and replace their drinking water \ninfrastructure. That is why I and Senator Ensign are introducing the \nSmall Community Safe Drinking Water Funding Act.\n  However, the cost of putting this infrastructure in place is \nstaggeringly high. The Environmental Protection Agency has recently \nestimated that to meet the Nation's needs, our communities' drinking \nwater infrastructure will require an investment of more than $150 \nbillion over the next 20 years.\n  While communities of all sizes face the crisis in drinking water \ninfrastructure, the greatest burden is on small communities.\n  For example, the per-household cost for water infrastructure \nimprovements is almost four times higher for small systems than for \nlarge ones.\n  One reason for this disproportionate impact is that small public \ndrinking water systems are so numerous--representing nearly 95 percent \nof all systems. It is that way in Nevada and most western states.\n  In my home State of Nevada, the percentage is even greater. Upwards \nof 98 percent of public drinking water systems in the Silver State are \nsmall systems.\n  Also, because small communities lack the tax base and economies-of-\nscale of larger communities, they typically incur much higher per-\nhousehold costs in upgrading their drinking water infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  In Nevada alone, small communities will need to invest hundreds of \nmillions of dollars over the next 20 years in drinking water \ninfrastructure.\n  The dilemma faced by small communities has been highlighted recently \nby EPA's new drinking water standard for arsenic.\n  Arsenic is a naturally occurring contaminant that impacts drinking \nwater supplies in Nevada, and other States throughout the west and \nnortheast.\n  The public health threat posed by arsenic in drinking water is well-\nestablished by scientists.\n  Despite the public health need, many small communities will find it \nextremely difficult to finance improvements needed to meet the arsenic \nstandard.\n  This is because EPA estimates that compliance with this standard will \nincrease annual household water costs in communities of less than \n10,000 people from between $38 to $327--an increase in water costs \nroughly 10 times greater than for communities with more than 10,000 \npeople.\n  In Nevada, we have very few communities of more than 10,000. We have \nLas Vegas, Reno, Henderson, Sparks, Elko, Carson City. This has a \ntremendous impact in Nevada.\n  Due to these costs to small communities, some have called for the \nstandard to be rolled back. In fact, the Bush administration has held \nup the implementation of the regulation, and is currently considering \nwhether or not to nullify it.\n  A roll-back of the new arsenic drinking water standard would be a \nserious mistake.\n  The old drinking water standard for arsenic had not been revised in \nover 55 years.\n  In 1999, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the scientific \ndata on arsenic and urged EPA to implement a lower, more protective \nstandard as quickly as possible.\n  The new EPA arsenic standard--the one currently under review by the \nBush Administration--was set at the very level as the standard adopted \nby the World Health Organization almost a decade ago.\n  Undoing EPA's new arsenic standard would deny millions of American \nfamilies access to safe drinking water.\n  Rolling back this standard is simply the wrong way to ensure clean, \nreliable, and affordable water to all Americans.\n  The right way to address the new arsenic standard, as well as the \ncrisis this country faces with its drinking water infrastructure, is \nfor the Federal Government to provide a helping hand to communities to \nmeet their drinking water needs.\n  Take my home State of Nevada for example. The city of Fallon, a \nsmall, rural community in the northwest part of the State, has been \nwrestling with high levels of naturally-occurring arsenic in its public \nwater supply for decades. When I served in the State legislature in the \n1960s, this was a problem. It still is.\n  Despite the difficulties involved in solving its arsenic problem, the \ncity is not asking for a roll-back of EPA's new arsenic standard.\n  On the contrary, the city very much wants to meet the new standard so \nthat it can provide safe drinking water to its citizens.\n  What the city needs, in order to accomplish this, is our financial \nhelp. It is a national problem, and we should help.\n  I should add, even though there is naturally occurring arsenic in the \nwater in Fallon, it may have been exacerbated by a Federal project, the \nfirst Bureau of Reclamation project in the history of the country, in \n1902, when it sent water from the Truckee River into Churchill County. \nIt may have raised the arsenic level higher than it would have been \notherwise.\n  Currently, the primary source of Federal assistance for local \ndrinking water projects is the EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving \nLoan Fund.\n  This fund--which I, along with others on the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, helped add to the Safe Drinking Water Act when \nit was amended in 1996--has been an overwhelming success.\n  Since its inception, the Fund has allowed States to provide more than \n1,200 low-interest loans totaling over $2.3 billion for upgrading and \ninstalling drinking water systems.\n  However, many small and disadvantaged communities are left out of the \nState revolving fund program.\n  Many of these communities do not attempt to participate in the \nprogram because they lack the financial resources to meet the terms of \nloans.\n  Although we added a provision to the act in 1996 allowing loans to be \nsubsidized for disadvantaged communities, a significant number of \nStates have not taken advantage of it.\n  Therefore, many small, cash-strapped communities receive little or no \nfinancial assistance form the Federal Government, at a time when they \nare faced with costly improvements to systems like that of Fallon, NV.\n  Today, I and Senator Ensign introduce a bill to address the needs of \ncommunities that face the greatest difficulties in ensuring clean \ndrinking water for their residents.\n  It will ensure that our Nation's small, disadvantaged communities \nhave access to the financial help they need to provide safe, reliable, \nand affordable drinking water.\n  This bill, the Small Community Safe Drinking Water Funding Act, \naccomplishes this goal by establishing a program to provide almost $750 \nmillion annually to Indian tribes and States, so they can make grants \nto public water systems that serve small communities.\n  I would like to highlight several key aspects of the bill:\n  First, the Small Community Safe Drinking Water Act provides \nsubstantial flexibility to States.\n  Each State choosing to participate in the grant program will receive \nan allocation of money from EPA, based on the drinking water \ninfrastructure needs of that State.\n  The State can then distribute this money as grants according to the \nState's own prioritization of communities' needs.\n  Second, the act streamlines the workload associated with a new grant \nprogram by taking advantage of procedures already in place through the \nDrinking Water State Revolving Fund program.\n  The identification of communities in most need of grant support is \ncoordinated with the annual ``Intended Use Plans'' already required of \nStates by the State revolving fund.\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\n  States can also administer grants through the same agencies that \ncurrently administer State revolving fund loans.\n  Third, the drinking water treatment needs of Indian tribes and \nAlaskan native villages are addressed through a $22.5 million EPA-\nadministered grants program modeled after the one established for \nStates.\n  This money will be targeted, in the form of grants, to those small \ncommunities determined to be in most need of drinking water system \nimprovements.\n  Finally, the act ensures that small, disadvantaged communities \nreceiving grants have access to technical assistance through non-profit \norganizations.\n  These organizations have established relationships with small \ncommunities, as well as a solid track record in helping these \ncommunities to solve their drinking water problems.\n  These organizations will be able to assist small communities to plan, \nimplement, and maintain the drinking water projects funded through \ngrants.\n  Nevada's small communities are facing a drinking water infrastructure \ncrisis.\n  These communities, and other small communities nationwide, confront \nincreasing demand for clean, reliable, and affordable drinking water.\n  But it is simply too costly for small communities, alone, to address \nthis water infrastructure crisis.\n  They need a financial helping hand from the Federal Government.\n  The bill I and Senator Ensign are introducing today will provide this \nmuch-needed Federal helping hand.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work \nwith us to see that it is swiftly enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 504. A bill for administrative procedures to extend Federal \nrecognition to certain Indian groups, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nInouye and Bingaman in introducing the Indian Tribal Federal \nRecognition Administrative Procedures Act of 2001. From the first days \nof the republic, the Congress has acted to recognize the unique legal \nand political relationship the United States has with the Indian \ntribes. Reforming the process of Federal recognition is the purpose of \nthe legislation I am introducing today.\n  Federal recognition is critical to tribal groups because it triggers \neligibility for services and benefits provided by the United States \nbecause of their status as members of federally recognized Indian \ntribes.\n  I want to be clear, I am not advocating for the approval of every \npetition for recognition, and I am not proposing that the petitions \nreceive a limited or cursory review. I am concerned with the viability \nof the current recognition process and am interested in seeing \nfairness, promptness, and finality brought into that process while \nproviding basic assurances to already-recognized tribes regarding their \ninherent rights.\n  Federal recognition may be accomplished in two ways: through the \nenactment of federal legislation; or through the administrative process \nthat occurs, or more accurately does not occur, within the Branch of \nAcknowledgement and Research, BAR.\n  Over the years, the length of time the Bureau has taken to process \ncertain petitions and the process for which applications for \nrecognition are considered has increased. At a hearing on similar \nlegislation in 2000, one group testified that its petition has been \npending since 1970!\n  The process in the Department of the Interior is time consuming and \ncostly, although it has improved from its original state. It has \nfrequently been hindered by a lack of staff and resources which are \nneeded to fairly and promptly review all petitions.\n  The cases on active consideration, including those with proposed \nfindings, have been in the process for anywhere from 2 to 9 years.\n  As with any decision-making body, fairness and timeliness are the \nkeys to maintaining a credible system which holds the confidence of \naffected parties. I believe that it is in the interests of all parties \nto have a clear deadline for the completion of the recognition process.\n  In 1978, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations to \nestablish criteria and procedures for the recognition of Indian tribes \nby the Secretary of Interior.\n  Since that time tribal groups have filed 250 letters of intent and \npetitions for review and consideration. Of those, 51 have been \nresolved, 34 by the BAR.\n  The remainder are in various stages of consideration by the \nDepartment either ready for active status or are already placed on \nactive status.\n  In the last twenty years, the Committee on Indian Affairs has held \nseveral oversight hearings on the Federal recognition process. At those \nhearings the record clearly showed that the process does not work. At a \nCommittee on Indian Affairs hearing in 1995, the Bureau testified that \nat the current rate of review and consideration, it would take several \ndecades to eliminate the entire backlog of tribal petitions. The record \nfrom numerous previous hearings reveals a clear need for the Congress \nto address the problems affecting the recognition process.\n  The bill I am introducing today will go a long way toward resolving \nthe problems which have plagued both the Department of the Interior \nand tribal petitioners over the years.\n\n  This bill, the Indian Tribal Federal Recognition Administrative \nProcedures Act of 2001, provides the required clarification and changes \nthat will help tribal petitioners and the United States in providing \nfair and orderly administrative procedures to extend Federal \nrecognition to eligible Indian groups. The principal purpose is to \nremove the Federal acknowledgment process from the BAR and transfer the \nresponsibility for the process to a temporary and independent \nCommission on Indian Tribal Recognition.\n  This bill provides that the Commission will be an independent agency, \ncomposed of three members appointed by the President, and authorized to \nhold hearings, take testimony, and reach final determinations on \npetitions for recognition.\n  The bill provides strict but realistic time-lines to guide the \nCommission in the review and decision-making process. Under the \nexisting process, some petitioners have waited ten years or more for \neven a cursory review of their petition.\n  This bill will allow for a cost-effective process for the BIA and the \npetitioners, it will provide definite time-lines for the administrative \nrecognition process, and sunsets the Commission in 12 years.\n  To ensure fairness, the bill provides for appeals of adverse \ndecisions to the federal district court here in the District of \nColumbia.\n  To ensure that the views and comments of all affected parties are \nconsidered, the bills directs the Commission to consider evidence and \nmaterials submitted by states, local communities, and State attorneys \ngeneral.\n  To ensure promptness, the bill authorizes adequate funding for the \ncosts of processing petitions through the Commission.\n  The bill also provides finality for both the petitioners and the \nDepartment by requiring all interested tribal groups to file their \npetitions with 8 years after the date of enactment and requiring the \nCommission to complete to work within 12 years from enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, and urge my colleagues to join me in enacting \nthis much-needed reform legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to regulate \ncertain .50 caliber sniper weapons in the same manner as machine guns \nand\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\nother firearms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself, Senator \nSchumer, and Senator Kennedy to re-introduce the Military Sniper Weapon \nRegulation Act. This bill, which I first introduced with Senator \nLautenberg in 1999, will reclassify powerful .50 caliber military \nsniper rifles under the National Firearms Act, thus making it much more \ndifficult for terrorists, doomsday cults, and criminals to obtain these \nguns for illegitimate use. It is my sincere hope that in this new, 50-\n50 Senate, we can finally make some progress on this bill and limit the \nuse of these powerful guns.\n  Fifty caliber sniper rifles, manufactured by a small handful of \ncompanies and individuals, are deadly, military style assault weapons, \ndesigned for armed combat with wartime enemies. They weigh up to 28 \npounds and are capable of piercing light armor at more than 4 miles. \nThe guns enable a single shooter to destroy enemy jeeps, tanks, \npersonnel carriers, bunkers, fuel stations, and even communication \ncenters. As a result, their use by military organizations worldwide has \nbeen spreading rapidly.\n  But along with the increasing military use of the gun, we have also \nseen increased use of the weapon by violent criminals and terrorists \naround the world. The weapons are deadly accurate up to 2,000 yards. \nThis means that a shooter using a 50 caliber weapon can reliably hit a \ntarget more than a mile away. In fact, according to a training manual \nfor military and police snipers published in 1993, a bullet from this \ngun ``even at one and a half miles crashes into a target with more \nenergy than Dirty Harry's famous .44 magnum at point-blank'' range.\n  And the gun is ``effective'' up to 7,500 yards. In other words, \nalthough it may be hard to aim at that distance, the gun will have its \ndesired destructive effect at that distance--more than 4 miles from the \ntarget.\n  The weapon can penetrate several inches of steel, concrete, or even \nlight armor. In fact, many ranges used for target practice do not even \nhave enough safety features to accommodate these guns, it is just too \npowerful.\n  Recent advances in weapons technology allow this gun to be used by \ncivilians against armored limousines, bunkers, individuals, and even \naircraft, in fact, one advertisement for the gun apparently promoted \nthe weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars' worth of jet \naircraft with one or two dollars' worth of cartridge.''\n  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover GAO \ninvestigators ``You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time \nbefore someone lets go a round on a range that travels so far, it hits \na school bus full of kids. The government will definitely ban .50 \ncalibers. This gun is just too powerful.''\n\n  When I first introduced this bill, I commented that a study by the \nGeneral Accounting Office revealed some eye-opening facts about how and \nwhere this gun is used, and how easily it is obtained. The GAO reports \nthat many of these guns wind up in the hands of domestic and \ninternational terrorists, religious cults, outlaw motorcycle gangs, \ndrug traffickers, and violent criminals.\n  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased 10 of these guns \nand stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of \nrounds of ammunition and other guns. At least one .50 caliber gun was \nrecovered by Mexican authorities after a shoot-out with an \ninternational drug cartel in that country. The gun was originally \npurchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the guns are making their way \ninto the hands of criminals worldwide.\n  Another .50 caliber sniper rifle, smuggled out of the United States, \nwas used by the Irish Republican Army to kill a large number of British \nsoldiers.\n  And ammunition for these guns is also readily available, even over \nthe Internet. Bullets for these guns include ``armor piercing \nincendiary'' ammunition that explodes on impact, and even ``armor \npiercing tracing'' ammunition reminiscent of the ammunition that lit up \nthe skies over Baghdad during the Persian Gulf war.\n  Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing \nammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the \ninvestigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored \nlimousine or maybe to ``take down'' a helicopter. In fact, our own \nmilitary helps to provide thousands of rounds of .50 caliber \nammunition, by essentially giving away tons of spent cartridges, many \nof which are then refurbished and sold on the civilian market.\n  This bill will begin the process of making these guns harder to get \nand easier to track.\n  Current law classifies .50 caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to \nthe least government regulation for any firearm. Sawed-off shotguns, \nmachine guns, and even handguns are more highly regulated than this \nmilitary sniper rifle. In fact, many states allow possession of .50 \ncaliber guns by those as young as 14 years old, and there is no \nregulation on second-hand sales.\n  Essentially, this bill would re-classify .50 caliber guns under the \nNational Firearms Act, which imposes far stricter standards on powerful \nand destruction weapons. For instance:\n  NFA guns may only be purchased from a licensed dealer, and not \nsecond-hand. This will prevent the sale of these guns at gun shows and \nin other venues that make it hard for law enforcement to track the \nweapons.\n  Second, purchasers of NFA guns must fill out license transfer \napplications and provide fingerprints to be processed by the FBI in \ndetailed criminal background checks. By reclassifying the .50 caliber, \nCongress will be making a determination that sellers should be more \ncareful about to whom they give these powerful, military guns.\n  ATF reports that this background check process takes about 60 days, \nso prospective gun buyers will face some delay. However, legitimate \npurchasers of this $7,000 gun can certainly wait that long.\n  Clearly, placing a few more restrictions on who can get these guns \nand how is simply common sense. This bill will not ban the sale, use or \npossession of .50 caliber weapons. The .50 caliber shooting club will \nnot face extinction, and ``legitimate'' purchasers of these guns will \nnot lose their access--even though that, too, might be a reasonable \nstep, since I cannot imagine a legitimate use of this gun.\n  The bill will simply place stricter requirements on the way in which \nthese guns can be sold, and to whom. The measure is meant to offer a \nreasoned solution to making it harder for terrorists, assassins, and \nother criminals to obtain these powerful weapons. If we are to continue \nto allow private citizens to own and use guns of this caliber, range, \nand destructive power, we should at the very least take greater care in \nmaking sure that these guns do not fall into the wrong hands.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Sniper Weapon \n     Regulation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) certain firearms originally designed and built for use \n     as long-range 50 caliber military sniper weapons are \n     increasingly sold in the domestic civilian market;\n       (2) the intended use of these long-range firearms, and an \n     increasing number of models derived directly from them, is \n     the taking of human life and the destruction of materiel, \n     including armored vehicles and such components of the \n     national critical infrastructure as radars and microwave \n     transmission devices;\n       (3) these firearms are neither designed nor used in any \n     significant number for legitimate sporting or hunting \n     purposes and are clearly distinguishable from rifles intended \n     for sporting and hunting use;\n       (4) extraordinarily destructive ammunition for these \n     weapons, including armor-piercing and armor-piercing \n     incendiary ammunition, is freely sold in interstate commerce; \n     and\n       (5) the virtually unrestricted availability of these \n     firearms and ammunition, given the uses intended in their \n     design and manufacture, present a serious and substantial \n     threat to the national security.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to \nprovide for a land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Huna Totem Corporation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today \non behalf of the Huna Totem Corporation and the residents of Hoonah, \nAlaska.\n  This bill would require the Huna Totem Corporation to convey \nownership of approximately 1,999 acres of land to the United States \nForest Service. In exchange for these lands the Huna Totem Corporation \nwill be allowed to select other lands readily accessible to Hoonah in \norder to fulfill their ANCSA entitlement. This legislation also \nrequires the exchange of lands to be of equal value and provides for \nadditional compensation if needed. Lastly, the legislation requires \nthat any potential timber harvested from land acquired by Huna Totem \nCorporation not be available for export.\n  The city of Hoonah is located in Southeast Alaska on the northeast \npart of Chichagoff Island. Hoonah has been the home of the Huna people \nsince the last advance of the great ice masses into Glacier Bay, \nforcing the Huna people to look for new homes. Since the Huna people \nhad traditionally used the Hoonah area each summer as a subsistence \nharvesting area, it was natural for them to settle in the area now \ncalled Hoonah. The community has a population of approximately 918 \nresidents and is located forty miles from Juneau; Alaska's capital \ncity.\n  Within the city of Hoonah is located the Huna Totem Corporation, an \nAlaska Native Corporation formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, ANCSA. Huna Totem is the largest Tlingit Indian Village \nCorporation in Southeast Alaska. Under the terms of ANCSA each village \ncorporation had to select lands within the core township or townships \nin which all or part of the Native village is located.\n  In 1975, Huna Totem filed its ANCSA land selections within the two \nmile radius of the city of Hoonah as mandated by ANCSA. Since the \ncommunity of Hoonah is located along the shoreline at the base of \nHoonah Head Mountain, the surrounding lands are steep hillsides, \ncliffs, or are designated watershed for the municipal water sources. \nMost of the acres, approximately 1,999, of this land are not suitable \nfor economic purposes due to the topography and watershed limitations.\n  Therefore in order for the Huna Totem Corporation to receive full \neconomic benefit of the lands promised to them under ANCSA, and for the \ncity of Hoonah to protect its watershed, alternative lands must be \nsought for Huna Totem to seek revenue from.\n  The legislation I am offering today would achieve these goals. By \nauthorizing a land exchange between the Huna Totem Corporation and the \nU.S. Forest Service the residents of Hoonah will be able to fully \nrecognize the benefits promised under the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 509. A bill to establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm \nNational Heritage Area in the State of Alaska, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nestablish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage Corridor \nin my State of Alaska.\n  The national heritage corridor, when enacted, will include the first \nleg of the Iditarod National Historic Trail and most of the Seward \nHighway National Scenic Byway. National heritage designation will give \nus the ability to tell the American public about the critical role that \nthis transportation corridor played in shaping the traditions and \nvalues of the residents of south-central Alaska. From native trade-\nroutes to shipping ports, from trails to railroads and later highways, \nthese are the themes of our national heritage and the settling of the \nNorth.\n  This would be the first among the 16 existing national heritage areas \nthat highlights the experience of settling the northern frontier. The \nfact that it would be one of a kind strengthens the case for \ndesignation.\n  Unlike any of the existing national heritage areas, the Kenai \nMountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage Corridor will highlight the \nexperience of the northern frontier--of transportation and settlement \nin a harsh landscape, of the gold rush and resource development in a \nremote area. These are the themes of the proposal, themes that form our \nperception of ourselves as a nation. The proposed heritage corridor \nwonderfully expresses these themes.\n  Within the proposed heritage corridor there are a number of small \nhistoric communities that developed around transportation and the gold \nrush. Dwarfed by the sweeping landscapes around them, these small \ncommunities are today still tied to cycles of nature: summer runs of \nsalmon, the fall migration of wildlife, the deep snows of winter, and \nthe rush of springtime melt. National heritage designation is about the \nrelationship that people develop with their surroundings. This \nrelationship remains intact in the proposed corridor and has had a \nlasting impact on the values of the residents who live there today.\n  Turnagain Arm, once a critical transportation link, has the world's \nsecond largest tidal range. Visitors can stand along the shore lines \nand actually watch 30 foot tides move in and out of the arm. On \noccasion, the low roar of an oncoming bore tide can be heard as a wall \nof water sweeps up the Turnagain.\n  A traveler through the alpine valleys and mountain passes of the \nheritage corridor can witness a landscape shaped by powerful geologic \nforces: retreating glaciers, earthquake subsidence, and avalanche \nscars. The area is home to variety of wildlife: Dall sheep, Beluga \nwhales, moose, bald eagles, trumpeter swans, and Arctic terns to name a \nfew.\n  Bounded by saltwater on either side, the proposed corridor has been \nan important transportation route from the resource rich Kenai \nPeninsula into the rest of Alaska. Alaskan natives established trade \nroutes following river valleys and around like the fjord-like lakes. \nLater, Russian fur-traders, gold rush stampeders, missionaries, and \nothers arrived all seeking access into the resource-rich land. The \nfamous Iditarod Trail to Nome, which was used to haul mail in and gold \nout, started on the Kenai Peninsula.\n  A series of starts and stops by railroad entrepreneurs eventually \nculminated in the completion of the Alaska Railroad from Seward to \nFairbanks by the federal government. President Harding boarded the \ntrain in Seward in 1923 to drive the golden spike at Nenana (and died \non the boat returning to Seattle). It was only in the last half of this \ncentury that the highway from Seward to Anchorage was opened. Before \nthen the small communities of the area were linked to the rest of \nAlaska by wagon trail, rail, and by boat across Turnagain Arm and the \nKenai River.\n  The Heritage corridor contains one of the earliest mining regions in \nAlaska. Russians left evidence of their search for gold at Bear Creek \nnear Hope. In 1895, discovery of a rich deposit at Canyon Creak \nprecipitated the Turnagain Arm Gold Rush, predating the stampede to the \nKlondike.\n  The early settlements and communities of the area are still very much \nas they were in the past. But, as in the early days, this is a region \nwhere ``nature is boss,'' and historic trails and\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\nevidence of mining history are often embedded and nearly hidden in the \nlandscape. What can be seen stands as powerful testimony to the human \nfortitude, perseverance, and resourcefulness that is America's proudest \nheritage from the people who settled the Alaskan frontier.\n  People living in the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm Corridor share a \nsense that it is a special place. In part, this is simply because of \nthe sheer natural beauty; but it is also because the Alaska frontier is \nrelatively recent. Memories of the times when the inhabitants were \ndependent on their own resources, and on each other, are still very \nmuch alive.\n  Communities are small, but they are alive with volunteerism. All have \nactive historical societies. Groups in Seward and Girdwood have \norganized to rebuild the Iditarod Trail. In town of Hope citizens \nconstructed a museum of mining history, building it themselves out of \nlogs and donated materials. Local people have conducted historic \nbuilding surveys, written books and short histories, collected and \npublished old diaries, and created web pages to record and share the \nhistory of their communities. Seward, the corridor's gateway, has \ncreated a delightful array of visitor opportunities that display and \ninterpret the region's natural setting, Native culture, and history. \nNational heritage area designation would greatly encourage and expand \nthese good efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that this national heritage \narea is a local grass roots effort and it will remain a locally driven \ngrass roots effort. Decisions will be made by locals, not by Federal \nbureaucrats. The only role of the Federal Government is to provide \ntechnical expertise, mostly in the areas of the interpretation of the \nmany historic sites and tremendous natural resource features that are \nfound throughout the entire region.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kenai Mountains-Turnagain \n     Arm National Heritage Area Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress find that--\n       (1) The Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation \n     corridor is a major gateway to Alaska and includes a range of \n     transportation routes used first by indigenous people who \n     were followed by pioneers who settled the nation's last \n     frontier;\n       (2) the natural history and scenic splendor of the region \n     are equally outstanding; vistas of nature's power include \n     evidence of earthquake subsidence, recent avalanches, \n     retreating glaciers and tidal action along Turnagain Arm, \n     which has the world's second greatest tidal range;\n       (3) the cultural landscape formed by indigenous people and \n     then by settlement, transportation and modern resource \n     development in this rugged and often treacherous natural \n     setting stands as powerful testimony to the human fortitude, \n     perseverance, and resourcefulness that is America's proudest \n     heritage from the people who settled the frontier;\n       (4) there is a national interest in recognizing, \n     preserving, promoting, and interpreting these resources;\n       (5) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm region is \n     geographically and culturally cohesive because it is defined \n     by a corridor of historic routes--trail, water, railroad, and \n     roadways through a distinct landscape of mountains, lakes, \n     and fjords;\n       (6) national significance of separate elements of the \n     region include, but are not limited to, the Iditarod National \n     Historic Trail, the Seward Highway National Scenic Byway, and \n     the Alaska Railroad National Scenic Railroad;\n       (7) national heritage area designation provides for the \n     interpretation of these routes, as well as the national \n     historic districts and numerous historic routes in the region \n     as part of the whole picture of human history in the wider \n     transportation corridor including early Native trade routes, \n     connections by waterway, mining trail, and other routes;\n       (8) national heritage area designation also provides \n     communities within the region with the motivation and means \n     for ``grass roots'' regional coordination and partnerships \n     with each other and with borough, State, and Federal \n     agencies; and\n       (9) national heritage area designation is supported by the \n     Kenai Peninsula Historical Association, the Seward Historical \n     Commission, the Seward City Council, the Hope and sunrise \n     Historical Society, the Hope Chamber of Commerce, the Alaska \n     Association for Historic Preservation, the Cooper Landing \n     Community Club, the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism \n     Association, Anchorage Historic Properties, the Anchorage \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Cook Inlet Historical \n     Society, the Moose Pass Sportsman's Club, the Alaska \n     Historical Commission, the Girdwood Board of Supervisors, the \n     Kenai River Special Management Area Advisory Board, the Bird/\n     Indian Community Council, the Kenai Peninsula Borough \n     Trails Commission, the Alaska Division of Parks and \n     Recreation, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, the Kenai \n     Peninsula Tourism Marketing Council, and the Anchorage \n     Municipal Assembly.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize, preserve, and interpret the historic and \n     modern resource development and cultural landscapes of the \n     Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm historic transportation \n     corridor, and to promote and facilitate the public enjoyment \n     of these resources; and\n       (2) to foster, through financial and technical assistance, \n     the development of cooperative planning and partnerships \n     among the communities and borough, State, and Federal \n     Government entities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the President to promote posthumously the \nlate Raymond Ames Spruance to the grade of Fleet Admiral of the United \nStates Navy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, at 10:25 a.m. on June 4, 1942, a Japanese \narmada including four carriers was steaming east towards Midway Island, \n1150 miles west of Pearl Harbor in the Central Pacific. Its objectives: \nInvade the strategically situated atoll, seize the U.S. base and \nairstrip, and, if possible, destroy what remained of our Pacific fleet \nafter the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor the preceding December.\n  At 10:30 a.m. three of the four Japanese carriers and their aircraft \nwere a flaming shambles. Moments before, Japanese fighter cover had \nswatted down torpedo bomber squadrons from the U.S. carriers \nEnterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown--the final, fatal mission for 35 of 41 \nAmerican planes and 68 of 82 pilots and gunners. But their courageous \nattack had drawn the fighters down to deck level, leaving the skies \nnearly empty for the 37 U.S. dive bombers who then appeared and, in \nfive fateful minutes, changed the course of history. By nightfall, the \nfourth Japanese carrier, too, was a blazing wreck, a fitting coda to a \nday that reversed forever the military fortunes of Imperial Japan.\n  ``So ended,'' wrote Churchill, ``the battle of June 4, rightly \nregarded as the turning point of the war in the Pacific.'' With Sir \nWinston, of course, the question at times was whether the event could \nrise to the level of his prose. Midway measured up. ``The annals of war \nat sea,'' he intoned, ``present no more intense, heart-shaking shock'' \nthan Midway and its precursor in the Coral Sea--battles where ``the \nbravery and self-devotion of the American airmen and sailors and the \nnerve and skill of their leaders was the foundation of all.''\n  Few today pause to remember Midway, now six decades past. Fewer still \nrecall the American leader whose nerve and skill were paramount in what \nhistorians consider one of the two or three most significant naval \nbattles in recorded history. He was an unlikely figure, a little-known, \nsoft-spoken, publicity-averse 56-year-old Rear Admiral from Indiana \nnamed Raymond Ames Spruance. Yet it is doubtful that any other American \nin uniform contributed more than this quiet Hoosier to our World War II \ntriumph--a foundation for every blessing of peace and prosperity we now \nenjoy.\n  I heard Admiral Spruance speak in February 1946, when I was 13 years \nold and he visited Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, his alma \nmater and soon to be mine. Our teachers were excited as they shepherded \nmy junior high classmates and me into the auditorium for a joint \nassembly with the high schoolers. But nothing about the speech was \nparticularly vivid or exciting to this member of the youthful audience. \nI recall little more than the talk about our recent victory in the \nPacific--with little hint from the modest man on stage about his \npersonal involvement, at one crucial juncture after another, in making \nthat victory possible.\n  Only years later did I really understand how large a role Raymond \nSpruance had played on the stage of actual events, starting at Midway. \nHis very presence at the battle--replacing the flamboyant William \n``Bull'' Halsey, temporarily shore-bound with a skin ailment--had been \nhappenstance. Yet it was Spruance, with no prior carrier combat \nexperience, who at the key moment made the crucial command decision to \nlaunch all available aircraft, which led to the devastation of the \nenemy carriers. It was Spruance who then preserved that turning-point \nvictory, instinctively resisting Japanese attempts over the next two \ndays to lure the American fleet into a trap--a trap subsequent U.S. \nintelligence would confirm was indeed waiting. It was Spruance, as \nfamed Navy historian Samuel Eliot Morison would write, who ``emerged \nfrom the battle one of the greatest admirals in American naval \nhistory.''\n  It was also Spruance who, when complimented on Midway years after the \nWar, would say, ``There were a hundred Spruances in the Navy. They just \nhappened to pick me for the job.'' Herman Wouk's masterful ``War And \nRemembrance'' has the best rejoinder, which the author puts in the \nmouth of a fictional wartime adversary: ``In fact, there was only one \nSpruance and luck gave him, at a fateful hour, to America.'' Speaking \nin their own voices, Wouk and other Americans of faith would quarrel \nonly with the word ``luck.''\n\n  Midway would prove but the first of many Spruance-led successes. As \nCommander of the newly formed Fifth Fleet, he would lead American \noperations in the Gilberts, then in the Marshalls, and then in the \nMarianas, including the invasion of Saipan. (Among the fighting men \nunder Spruance's overall command during this 1943-44 period was a young \naviator--the war's youngest commissioned Naval pilot--named George \nBush). Spruance would then command 1945's crucial, hard-fought \ninvasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, the latter involving some 1,200 \nvessels and 548,000 men, an amphibious operation on a scale surpassed \nonly by Normandy.\n  Throughout, he maintained the unassuming attitude that downplayed his\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\nown role at Midway. Unlike some of his contemporaries (and in marked \ncontrast to the spirit of our own age), Spruance avoided publicity and \nabjured self-promotion, which he saw as a threat to effective command. \n``A man's judgment is best,'' said Spruance, ``when he can forget \nhimself and any reputation he may have acquired, and can concentrate \nwholly on making the right decision.'' These are words to live by for \nany leader. Spruance, both during the war and in his later service as \nPresident of the Naval War College and Ambassador to the Philippines, \nlived them as few other leaders in any age and any field of endeavor \nhave managed.\n  One consequence was that he forwent levels of recognition and reward \naccorded others who, though fully worthy, were certainly no more worthy \nthan he. Serious historians and scholars, however, never doubted the \nmerits of the man whose biography is aptly titled ``The Quiet \nWarrior.'' Among all the war's combat admirals ``there was no one to \nequal Spruance,'' wrote Morison. ``He envied no man, regarded no one as \nrival, won the respect of all with whom he came in contact, and went \nahead in his quiet way winning victories for his country.''\n  That was surely enough for Spruance, who passed away in December \n1969. But I do not think it should be enough for us, his countrymen, \nwho are the beneficiaries of the victories he won. That is why I have \nintroduced legislation authorizing and requesting President Bush to \npromote Raymond Spruance--the ``quiet warrior'' under whom the \nPresident's father once served--to the five-star rank of Fleet Admiral \nof the United States Navy. I believe this posthumous honor should be \nthe fitting, and final, promotion among America's World War II Armed \nForces, even as we anticipate dedication of a national memorial \nhonoring all who served in that conflict.\n  It is fitting, first of all, because it corrects an oversight. Near \nthe end of the war, Congress authorized four five-star positions each \nin the Army and in the Navy. The new generals of the Army were George \nMarshall, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower and Henry ``Hap'' \nArnold--later redesignated general of the Air Force. The first three \nfive-star admirals were Pacific commander-in-chief Chester Nimitz, \nwartime CNO Ernest King, and William Daniel Leahy, President \nRoosevelt's chief of staff and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. But an \ninternal battle raged for months over whether the fourth fleet admiral \nwould be the colorful Halsey--who was ultimately selected--or his more \nreticent colleague, the victor at Midway. Later, when Congress \nauthorized another five-star post for the ``GI General,'' Omar Bradley, \nit overlooked creating a fifth Navy five-star opening, which \nunquestionably would have gone to Bradley's ocean-going counterpart, \nRaymond Spruance.\n\n  Typically, Spruance stayed away from these controversies. His one \ncomment came in 1965, when he wrote a friend:\n\n       So far as my getting five-star rank is concerned, if I \n     could have had it along with Bill Halsey, that would have \n     been fine; but, if I had received it instead of Bill Halsey, \n     I would have been very unhappy over it.\n\n  Well, Raymond Spruance can now have five-star rank ``along with Bill \nHalsey.'' He deserves it, the more so because he did not seek it. It is \nan oversight that he was not given it earlier. But these are reasons \nenough to correct that oversight now.\n  And there are other reasons we should pay Raymond Spruance this \nposthumous honor, reasons that have as much to do with us as with him. \nWhat we choose to honor says a great deal about who we are. Much of \nwhat our political and popular culture ``honors'' today--with celebrity \nand fortune and swarms of media attention is the foolish and flighty, \nthe sensational and self-indulgent. Too often, the pursuits made \npossible by freedom are unworthy of the sacrifices that preserved \nfreedom itself.\n  Those sacrifices were made by earlier generations inspired by a \nsimpler, sturdier set of values, values that included duty to country \nand, when necessary, self-sacrifice on her behalf. If we cherish and \nwould preserve the blessings of freedom, we must hold up before our \nchildren--who daily see too many less worthy models--those who \nwillingly made the sacrifices that kept freedom alive.\n  No one served the values of freedom more fully or nobly, and with \nless thought of personal praise or fame, than Raymond Spruance. On any \nlist of the great Allied military leaders of World War II, his \ncharacter and his contributions to victory stand in the very first \nrank. It is simple justice to him, and fitting and proper for us, now \nto award him actual rank commensurate with such character and \ncontributions. My hope is that my colleagues and the President will \nagree--so that history henceforth will honor Fleet Admiral Raymond Ames \nSpruance, the quiet Hoosier warrior whose triumph at Midway opened the \ndoor to America's triumph in the Pacific.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 510.

A bill to foster innovation and technological advancement in \nthe development of the Internet and electronic commerce, and to assist \nthe States in simplifying their sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators Enzi, Graham, \nVoinovich, Breaux, and a number of our colleagues in re-introducing the \nInternet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act. This legislation is nearly \nidentical to legislation we sponsored in the last Congress. We believe \nthat it is absolutely imperative that Congress move quickly this year \nto consider this legislation and the difficult tax issues relating to \nInternet sales that it seeks to address.\n  First, most everyone who is familiar with this issue knows that the \ncurrent expiration date for the moratorium on Internet access and \ndiscriminatory taxes is fast approaching. We believe\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\nthe moratorium should be extended. Also, this legislation moves toward \na solution to the growing web of tax compliance problems that faces \nvirtually everyone who would do business across State lines, sellers \nand customers alike.\n  Despite some setbacks, Internet technology and commerce will continue \nto be a real growth engine for our economy. The past holiday season, \nretail sales over the Internet jumped 76 percent from the same period a \nyear earlier. A recent University of Texas study estimated that $830 \nbillion in revenues were generated by the Internet economy in 2000, up \n58 percent from 1999 levels. Together, this information suggests that \nInternet sales are not going to be either temporary or insignificant, \nand neither are the compliance problems.\n  We believe that the approach embraced in our bill would help create a \nclimate in which Web-based firms and Main Street businesses can co-\nexist and compete on fair and even terms. Any new form of commerce \npresents a challenge to the rules and structures that have grown up \naround the old. The automobile required the reform of traffic-control \nrules designed for the horse-and-buggy era. And the Internet is no \nexception. The Internet has raised vexing questions about privacy and \nproperty rights. It has raised similarly vexing questions regarding the \nrevenue systems of the States and localities of this nation. Clearly, \nthe Internet does not fit neatly into these systems as they have \nevolved over the last two hundred years.\n  This disconnect has created tensions on all sides. On one side are \nthe vital new businesses, Internet service providers, Web-based \nbusinesses and the rest, worried that they will be singled out as cash \ncows and subjected to new and unfair taxes. On the other side are State \nand local governments worried about the erosion of their tax bases and \ntheir ability to pay for the schools, police, garbage collection and \nmore that their taxpayers need and expect. In between are Main Street \nmerchants who collect sales taxes from their customers and worry about \nunfair competition from Web-based business that do not have to collect \nthese taxes. And we shouldn't overlook the citizens and taxpayers, who \nappreciate the convenience and opportunities of the Web but who also \ncare about their Main Street merchants, and about their schools and \nother local services.\n  All of these concerns are understandable and valid. Our job in \nCongress is to try to address the problem in a fair and constructive \nway.\n  The solution begins with a recognition of the problem. Collecting a \nsales tax in a face-to-face transaction on Main Street or at the mall \nis a relatively simple process. The seller collects the tax and remits \nit to the State or local government. But with remote sales--such as \ncatalog and Internet sales, it's more difficult. States cannot require \na seller to collect a sales tax unless the business has an actual \nlocation or sales people in the State. So most States, and many \nlocalities, have laws that require the local buyer to send an \nequivalent ``use tax'' to the State or local government when he or she \ndid not pay taxes at the time of purchase.\n  The reality, of course, is that customers almost never do that. It \nwould be a major inconvenience, and people are not accustomed to paying \nsales taxes in that way. So, despite the requirement in the law, most \nsimply don't do it. This tax, which is already owed, is not paid. For \nyears, State and local governments could accept this loss because \ncatalog sales were a relatively minor portion of overall commerce. The \nrapid growth of Internet sales is changing all that.\n  Internet and catalog sellers correctly argue that collecting sales \ntaxes would be a significant burden for them. Understandably, they \ncontend that it would be difficult for them to have to comply with tax \nlaws from thousands of different jurisdictions, 46 States and thousands \nof local governments have sales taxes, with different tax rates and all \nof the idiosyncracies regarding what is taxable and what is non-\ntaxable. They have a point.\n  However, there are some remote sellers who know they enjoy an \nadvantage over Main Street businesses and simply do not want to lose \nit. They can sell a product without collecting the tax, whereas Main \nStreet businesses must collect the local sales tax. Main Street \nbusinesses claim that is unfair, and they have a point, too.\n  As I have said before, all sides in this debate have valid points, \nand that is the premise of the bill we introduce today. There are three \nbasic principles underlying the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act.\n  First, we believe that this new Internet technology will remain a \nreal growth engine for our economy, and the solution must begin by \nputting the worries of Web-based entrepreneurs to rest. They should not \nbe concerned about new and discriminatory tax burdens, and they should \nnot be singled out as cash cows. Congress should make this clear. \nThat's why our bill would extend the existing moratorium, which is set \nto expire on October 21st, through December 31, 2005. That will help \nremove some of the anxiety about the approaching expiration date, \nwhile giving all stakeholders--State and local governments, Internet \nsellers, and the bricks and mortar retail community, time to work \ntogether to develop a real solution for the sales and use tax \ncompliance problems now facing many businesses and their customers.\n\n  Second, State and local governments should be encouraged to simplify \ntheir sales tax systems as they apply to remote sellers. And third, \nonce States have reduced the burden on sellers by simplifying their \nsales and use tax systems, then it is only fair that remote sellers do \ntheir part and collect any use tax that is owed, just as local \nmerchants collect sales taxes. This simple step would free the consumer \nfrom the burden of having to report such taxes individually. It would \nlevel the playing field for local retailers and others that already \ncollect and remit such taxes, and it would protect the ability of State \nand local governments to provide necessary services for their residents \nin the future.\n  Specifically, the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act would do the \nfollowing:\n  Extend the existing moratorium on Internet access, multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes through December 31, 2005.\n  Put Congress on record as urging States and localities to streamline \ntheir sales and use tax systems. Among other things, a dramatically \nsimplified sales and use tax system would allow remote sellers to use \ninformation provided by the States to easily identify the single \napplicable rate for each sale, as well as provide sellers relief from \nliability for relying on such information.\n  Require such a simplified tax system to include: uniform definitions \nfor goods and services, uniform procedures for the treatment of exempt \npurchasers, and uniform rules for attributing transactions to \nparticular tax jurisdictions, as well as uniform audit procedures and a \nseller's option for a single audit.\n  Authorize States to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax \nCompact through which member States would adopt the streamlined sales \nand use tax system. Congressional authority and consent to enter into \nsuch a Compact would expire if it has not occurred by January 1, 2006.\n  Authorize States that adopt the Compact to require remote sellers \nwith more than $5 million in annual gross sales to collect and remit \nsales and use taxes on remote sales, once twenty States have adopted \nsuch a Compact, unless Congress has acted to disapprove the Compact by \nlaw within a period of 120 days after the Congress receives it.\n  Prohibit States that have not adopted the simplified sales and use \ntax system from gaining benefit from the authority extended in the bill \nto require sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote \nsales.\n  In my judgment, it would be a serious mistake for Congress to adopt a \nlengthy extension of the current Internet tax moratorium without \naddressing these underlying problems. If we don't address the problems, \nthen the growth of the Internet, which should be a benefit to \nAmericans, will instead mean a major erosion of funds available to \nbuild and maintain schools and roads, finance police departments and \ngarbage collection, and all the other services that citizens in this \ncountry want and need.\n  Moreover, the competitive crisis facing local retailers is also \ngrowing more\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\nurgent. In testimony before the Commerce Committee in the last \nCongress, a representative from a large retailer testified that his \ncompany is incorporating a separate business to put the business on the \nInternet. It will do so in a manner that will enable them to avoid \nsales and use taxes. Even though the retailer has locations in every \nState and therefore would be required to collect such taxes on Internet \nsales, it believes that such avoidance is needed to compete with other \nlarge competitors that will be making those sales tax-free. This \nscenario could play out over and over again unless we act quickly and \ndecisively. If we don't act, the large retailers will survive, the \nsmall Main Street businesses will continue to struggle, and there will \nbe a massive loss of revenues to fund schools and other basic services.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating that this is an issue that Congress \nmust address now. It is important for Congress to begin the process of \nfinding a long-term solution to the problem this year before the \nmoratorium expires. We believe that our legislation strikes a proper \nbalance between the interests of the Internet industry, State and local \ngovernments, local retailers and remote sellers. It is workable and \nfair, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this much-needed bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following two statements put in \nthe Record, one from a group of organizations representing States and \nlocalities, and the other from the E-Fairness Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From National Governors' Association, National Conference of State \n  Legislatures, Council of State Governments, National Association of \n Counties, United States Conference of Mayors, and International City/\n             County Management Association, March 9, 2001]\n\n  Statement on the Introduction of the ``Internet Tax Moratorium and \n  Equity Act'' Sponsored by Senators Dorgan, Enzi, Voinovich, Graham, \n   Breaux, Hutchison, Chafee, Thomas, Lincoln, Durbin and Rockefeller\n\n       Our organizations representing the nation's state and local \n     governments support the goals of Senators Dorgan, Enzi, \n     Voinovich, Graham, Breaux, Hutchison, Thomas, Chafee, \n     Lincoln, Durbin and Rockefeller to provide for a level \n     playing field for all retail sales through state based \n     simplification of sales and use tax structures that allows \n     for the collection of the appropriate applicable state and \n     local sales and use tax.\n       State and local governments recognize the need to simplify \n     the current sales and use tax collection systems to benefit \n     the national economy through the removal of unnecessary \n     complexity. The nation's state and local sales and use taxes \n     are the single most important source of support for public \n     education in America. We regard it as critical that the \n     Congress support efforts to prevent erosion of this revenue \n     source essential to funding our education systems.\n       The efforts of the more than 30 states to simplify their \n     systems to dramatically reduce the complexity and cost of \n     collection for all sellers is evidence of our commitment to \n     adapt to the new economy. We would oppose any effort to \n     extend the moratorium, unless and until, Congress acts to \n     restore the authority of states and local governments to \n     ensure that all vendors are treated equally.\n       We support federal legislation that ensures that any sales \n     and use tax simplification process would be developed and \n     implemented on the state and local level and grant to those \n     states the authority to require out of state sellers to \n     collect and remit sales and use taxes. Preservation of state \n     and local sovereignty is a cornerstone of our federal system; \n     this legislation promises an important opportunity to restore \n     this element.\n       We look forward to working with Senators Dorgan, Enzi, \n     Voinovich, Breaux, Graham, Hutchison, Thomas, Chafee, \n     Lincoln, Durbin, Rockefeller and others to further refine \n     legislative language to achieve this end.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   e-Fairness,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I am writing to congratulate you on \n     the introduction of the ``Internet Tax and Moratorium Equity \n     Act.''\n       The e-Fairness Coalition includes brick-and-mortar and \n     online retailers, realtors, retail and real estate \n     associations, as well as publicly and privately owned \n     shopping centers, the Newspaper Association of America, and \n     members of the high-tech community such as Gateway and \n     Vertical Net. The Coalition advocates a level playing field \n     with respect to sales and use tax collection for all \n     retailers, including bricks-and-mortar as well as Internet-\n     based.\n       We have been working for over 18 months to help provide a \n     comprehensive solution to the questions surrounding Internet \n     taxation. We continue to believe that federal legislation is \n     necessary in order to provide for tax equity amongst all \n     retailers. Your bill is important because it promotes the \n     continued growth of the Internet by extending the current \n     moratorium on Internet access fees and multiple and \n     discriminatory taxes. However, it also provides clear and \n     reasonable simplification guidelines that once adopted would \n     allow the states to require that remote sellers collect use \n     taxes just as Main Street retailers collect sales taxes.\n       On behalf of the nation's retailers and real estate \n     interests--and the 1 in 5 American workers our members \n     represent--I applaud you for your leadership on this \n     important issue.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Internet Tax \nMoratorium and Equity Act introduced today by Senator Dorgan. I am an \noriginal cosponsor and I encourage each of my colleagues to join me as \na cosponsor of this bill. We had to take a look at the Internet sales \ntax issue for people who might be using legislative vehicles to develop \nhuge loopholes in our current system. We are federally mandating states \ninto a sales tax exemption. We need to preserve the system for those \ncities, towns, counties, and states that rely on the ability to collect \nthe sales tax they are currently getting.\n  There are some critical issues here that have to be solved to keep \nthe stability of state and local government--just the stability of it--\nnot to increase sales tax, just protect what is there right now. I \nbelieve the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act is a monumental step \nforward in protecting, yet enhancing, the current system.\n  Certainly, no Senator wants to take steps that will unreasonably \nburden the development and growth of the\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\nInternet. At the same time, we must also be sensitive to issues of \nbasic competitive fairness and the negative affect our action or \ninaction can have on brick-and-mortar retailers, a critical economic \nsector and employment force in all American society, especially in \nrural states like Wyoming. In addition, we must consider the legitimate \nneed of state and local governments to have the flexibility they need \nto generate resources to adequately fund their programs and operations.\n  If the loophole exists, I can share a method for local retailers to \navoid sales tax collection too--but creating this loophole will lead to \nothers--pay attention here. Sales tax collection and federal and state \nincome tax could be in the same boat, if sales tax collection is no \nlonger necessary on Internet sales purely by virtue of the sale over \nthe Internet. Why shouldn't an employee whose check is written on the \nInternet and transmitted directly to his bank account not owe any \nincome tax? Both would be Internet tax loopholes--tax collection \nexemptions forced by an all-knowing federal government.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I have a unique perspective on \nthe dozens of tax proposals that are introduced in Congress each year. \nIn addition, my service on the state and local level and my experiences \nas a small business owner enable me to consider these bills from more \nthan one viewpoint.\n  I understand the importance of protecting and promoting the growth of \nInternet commerce because of its potential economic benefits. It is a \nvaluable resource because it provides access on demand. In addition, it \nis estimated that the growth of online businesses will create millions \nof new jobs nationwide in the coming years. Therefore, I do not support \na tax on the use of Internet itself.\n  I do, however, have concerns about using the Internet as a sales tax \nloophole. Sales taxes go directly to state and local governments and I \nam very leery of any federal legislation that bypasses their \ntraditional ability to raise revenue to perform needed services such as \nschool funding, road repair and law enforcement. I will not force \nstates into a huge new exemption. While those who advocate a permanent \nloophole on the collection of a sales tax over the Internet claim to \nrepresent the principles of tax reduction, they are actually advocating \na tax increase. Simply put, if Congress continues to allow sales over \nthe Internet to go untaxed and electronic commerce continues to grow as \npredicted, revenues to state and local governments will fall and \nproperty taxes will have to be increased to offset lost revenue or \nstates who do not have or believe in state income taxes will be forced \nto start one.\n  After months of hard work, negotiations, and compromise, the Internet \nTax Moratorium and Equity Act has been introduced. I would like to \ncommend Senator Dorgan on his commitment to finding a solution and \nworking with all parties to find that solution. The bill extends the \nexisting moratorium on Internet access, multiple, and discriminatory \ntaxes for an additional four years through December 31, 2005.\n  Throughout the past several years, we have heard that catalog and \nInternet companies say they are willing to allow and collect sales tax \non interstate sales (regardless of traditional or Internet sales) if \nstates will simplify collections to one rate per state sent to one \nlocation in that state. I think that is a reasonable request. I have \nheard the argument that computers make it possible to handle several \nthousand tax entities, but from an auditing standpoint as well as \nsimplicity for small business, I support one rate per state. I think \nthe states should have some responsibility for redistribution not a \nbusiness forced to do work for government. Therefore, the bill would \nput Congress on record as urging states and localities to develop a \nstreamlined sales and use tax system, which would include a single, \nblended tax rate with which all remote sellers can comply. You need to \nbe aware that states are prohibited from gaining benefit from the \nauthority extended in the bill to require sellers to collect and remit \nsales and use taxes on remote sales if the states have not adopted the \nsimplified sales and use tax system.\n\n  Further, the bill would authorize states to enter into an Interstate \nSales and Use Tax Compact through which members would adopt the \nstreamlined sales and use tax system. Congressional authority and \nconsent to enter into such a compact would expire if it has not \noccurred by January 1, 2006. The bill also authorizes states to require \nall other sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote \nsales unless Congress has acted to disapprove the compact by law within \na period of 120 days after the Congress receives it.\n  We introduce this bill because we do not think there is adequate \nprotection now. It is very important we do not build electronic \nloopholes on the Internet, an ever-changing Internet, one that is \ngrowing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology \nvirtually every day. What we know as the Internet today is not what we \nwill be using by the time the moratorium is finalized. More and more \npeople are using the Internet everyday.\n  Mr. President, I recognize this body has a constitutional \nresponsibility to regulate interstate commerce. Furthermore, I \nunderstand the desire of several Senators to protect and promote the \ngrowth of Internet commerce. Internet commerce is an exciting field. It \nhas a lot of growth potential. The new business will continue to create \nmillions of new jobs in the coming years.\n  The exciting thing about that for Wyomingites is that our merchants \ndo not have to go where the people are. For people in my state, that \nmeans their products are no longer confined to a local market. They do \nnot have to rely on expensive catalogs to sell merchandise to the big \ncity folks. They do not have to travel all the way to Asia to display \ntheir goods. The customer can come to us on the Internet. It is a \nremarkable development, and it will push more growth for small \nmanufacturers in rural America, especially in my state. We have seen \nsome of the economic potential in the Internet and will continue this \nprogress. It is a valuable resource because it provides access on \ndemand. It brings information to your fingertips when you want it and \nhow you want it.\n  I was the mayor of a small town, Gillette, Wyoming, for 8 years. I \nlater served in the State House for 5 years and the State Senate for 5 \nyears. Throughout my public life, I have always worked to reduce taxes, \nto return more of people's hard-earned wages to them.\n  I am not here to argue in favor of taxes. There were times in \nGillette when we had to make tough decisions. I was mayor during the \nboom time when the size of our town doubled in just a few years. We had \nto be very creative to be sure that our revenue sources would cover the \nnecessary public services--important services like sewer, water, curb \nand gutter, filling in potholes, shoveling snow, collecting garbage, \nand mostly water. It is a tough job because the impact of your decision \nis felt by all of your neighbors. Hardly any of those problems is \nsolved without money. When you are the mayor of a small town, you are \non call 24 hours a day. You are in the phone book. People can call you \nat night and tell you that the city sewer is backing up into their \nhouse. I was fascinated how they were always sure that it was the \ncity's sewer that was doing it. Therefore, it is important that we do \nnot cut towns out of an historic source of revenue. They provide \nservices you really depend on. Remember you cannot flush your toilet \nover the Internet.\n  The point is that the government that is closest to the people is \nalso on the shortest time line to get results. I think it is the \nhardest work. I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that \nmandates or restricts local government's ability to meet the needs of \nits citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic loopholes \nthat will take away all of their revenue. The Internet Tax Moratorium \nand Equity Act would designate a level playing field for all involved--\nbusiness, government, and the consumer.\n  I do strongly support this bill. The current system of collecting \nrevenues for those towns and states should be preserved--preserved on a \nlevel playing field for all involved. I do not think we have all the \nanswers, or we would not be asking for this bill. So whatever we do, we \nhave to have a bill that will preserve the way that small business and \nsmall towns function at the present time. Our bill is critical for \ntowns,\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\nsmall businesses, and you and me. I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/09/senate-section/article/S2135-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 56--HONORING THE MEMORY OF JAMES A.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas the uninsured population in the United States is \n     approximately 43,000,000 and is estimated to reach over \n     53,000,000 people by 2007;\n       Whereas nearly 80 percent of the uninsured population are \n     members of working families who cannot afford health \n     insurance or cannot access employer-provided health insurance \n     plans;\n       Whereas minority populations, rural residents, and single-\n     parent families represent a disproportionate number of the \n     uninsured population;\n       Whereas the problem of health care access for the uninsured \n     population is compounded in many urban and rural communities \n     by a lack of providers who are available to serve both \n     insured and uninsured populations;\n       Whereas community, migrant, homeless, and public housing \n     health centers have proven uniquely qualified to address the \n     lack of adequate health care services for uninsured \n     populations, serving over 4,900,000 uninsured patients in \n     2000, including over 1,000,000 new uninsured patients who \n     have sought care from such centers in the last 3 years;\n       Whereas health centers care for almost 12,000,000 patients, \n     nearly 8,000,000 minorities, nearly 650,000 farmworkers, and \n     almost 600,000 homeless individuals each year;\n       Whereas health centers provide cost-effective comprehensive \n     primary and preventive care to uninsured individuals for less \n     than $1.00 per day, or $350 annually, and help to reduce the \n     inappropriate use of costly emergency rooms and inpatient \n     hospital care;\n       Whereas current resources only allow health centers to \n     serve more than 10 percent of the Nation's 43,000,000 \n     uninsured individuals;\n       Whereas past investments to increase health center access \n     have resulted in better health, an improved quality of life \n     for all Americans, and a reduction in national health care \n     expenditures;\n       Whereas Congress can act now to increase access to health \n     care services for uninsured and low-income people together \n     with or in advance of health care coverage proposals by \n     expanding the availability of services at community, migrant, \n     homeless, and public housing health centers; and\n       Whereas President George W.

RHODES, A GIFTED POLITICAL SERVANT AND STATESMAN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 56, submitted \nearlier by Senator Voinovich and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 56) honoring the memory of James A. \n     Rhodes as a gifted political servant and statesman.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nOhio's greatest and most dedicated public servants, a former four-term \nOhio Governor, James A. Rhodes, who passed away on March 4 of this year \nat the age of 91.\n  Though Jim Rhodes will be deeply missed, he will always, always, be \nremembered. My friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, and I \nhave introduced a resolution to honor the memory of Governor Rhodes as \na gifted political servant and statesman.\n  I thank my colleague from Ohio for his work in crafting this \nresolution. I know Senator Voinovich shares my admiration and deep \nrespect for Governor Rhodes. In fact, both Senator Voinovich and I \ntraveled back to Ohio this past week to attend the final ceremony for \nGovernor Rhodes in the rotunda of the State Capitol of Ohio.\n  Governor Rhodes was one of a kind--a one-of-a-kind leader, \npolitician, husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and \nfriend. No one--no one--loved Ohio more than Gov. Jim Rhodes.\n  No one was more dedicated to making Ohio bigger, better, stronger, \nand safer. Jim Rhodes was a visionary. And though a lot of politicians \nhave big visions, Governor Rhodes was different. He turned those \nvisions into reality. That is what set him apart. That is what made him \none of Ohio's most influential political figures of the 20th century. \nThat is what made him a legend.\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\n  Whether it is buildings, roads, airports, parks, vocational schools, \ncommunity colleges, or universities, most physical infrastructure in \nOhio today is attributable directly to Gov. Jim Rhodes. The simple fact \nis that you can't drive anywhere in Ohio without driving on or driving \npast something that Jim Rhodes built--something with which he had a \nrole to play. Without question, he will continue to touch lives every \nday in many, many ways.\n\n  Most people don't realize that when Ohio first elected James Rhodes \nas Governor, it was his 13th political race. It was because of this, \nbecause of the vastness of his experience, that he was able to govern \nso effectively for all of us in Ohio.\n  It is often said that the greatness of a man can be measured by the \nextent and the breadth of his interests and then how he acts on those \ninterests to turn them into reality. By that test, Governor Rhodes was \nindeed a great man. His interests were Ohio's interests and, because of \nthat, he was passionate in promoting Ohio's economy, its tourism, its \nnatural resources, its schools, and its universities.\n  While that was such an important part of his legacy, we must remember \nthat Governor Rhodes was also equally passionate in his concern for \npeople--for all the people of the State of Ohio. No matter where he \nwent in Ohio, everyone always thought Governor Rhodes was from where \nthey were from. Though he was born in Jackson County and went to high \nschool in Springfield and was mayor of Columbus, for us, he was from \nGreene County, and he was from Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Marietta, \nand every other township, village, and city in our great State.\n  He was one of us. He was one of us not just because he got so much \ndone for the State; he was one of us because he knew people, understood \nthem, and he liked them. And people liked him back. That is what made \nGovernor Rhodes a great leader and a great man.\n  I will always remember Governor Rhodes for his personal generosity. \nHe was generous with his time, energy, and especially, with his \npolitical advice. Back in 1980, when I ran for the State senate in the \nold 10th Senatorial District, Governor Rhodes came down and campaigned \nfor me on four separate occasions. That was just the start. He \ncontinued to support me throughout the last 20 years, even campaigning \nfor me in Jackson County, his home county, this past October, just a \nfew days before the election.\n  The people of Jackson County were happy to see him one more time.\n  I admired Governor Rhodes, and I respected him. I especially \nrespected his strong and enduring love for his wonderful family. That \nwas such a large part of who Jim Rhodes was. He cherished the time he \nspent at home with his family, often advising others to go home. If you \nasked him for political advice, he would say: My advice is go home--and \nhe did that.\n  He was married to his beautiful wife Helen for 46 years and every \ntime I saw the Governor, whether at an Ohio State football game, or at \nhis beloved State fair, he had one or more of his grandchildren or \ngreat grandchildren with him. He loved his family dearly, and it \nshowed.\n  As Chesterton once said:\n\n       Great men take up great space even when they are gone.\n\n  To be sure, Governor Rhodes will continue to take up great space on \nthis Earth, not just in buildings and roads, airports and parks, but in \nthe lives he touched and the lives he changed. He will continue to live \non for the great work he has done for Ohio and will also continue to \nlive on through his family.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Ohio, to introduce a resolution \nmourning the passage and honoring the life of former governor of Ohio, \nJames A. Rhodes. Governor Rhodes passed away last Sunday at the age of \n91.\n  Governor Rhodes began his career in public service in 1937, when he \nwas elected to a term on the Columbus board of education. Two years \nlater, he was elected Columbus city auditor and in 1943, he was elected \nMayor of Columbus. In 1952, he successfully ran for State Auditor and \nin 1962, he ran for Governor of Ohio and won. He ultimately served the \ncitizens of Ohio for four terms as governor.\n  As my interest in politics began to spark, Governor Rhodes' public \nservice inspired me to also pursue a life of service to the people of \nOhio. He was my mentor and without his example and counsel I could \nnever have become governor of Ohio. In fact, I would not have had a \ncareer in government had it not been for Jim Rhodes' sweeping re-\nelection victory in 1966. He had very long coattails, because he \ncarried an unknown 30-year-old named George Voinovich to victory in an \nOhio House district that was 6 to 1 democrat-to-republican. He \nfurthered my career along when in 1978, he turned to me--a relatively \nunknown County Commissioner from Cuyahoga County--and asked me to be \nhis running mate as Lieutenant Governor. Since then, Jim Rhodes and I \ngrew close and my time with him over the years was some of the most \nmeaningful of any person I have associated with in government.\n  Mr. President, they broke the mold after James A. Rhodes entered the \npolitical arena. There never will be another like the Governor, and he \nwill go down in Ohio history not only because of the 16 years he served \nas governor, but more importantly, because of the positive impact he \nhad on the quality of life of Ohio's citizens and the direction of our \nState.\n  He was a good, God-fearing man who looked on his service in \ngovernment as an opportunity to give witness to the Second Great \nCommandment--love of fellow man. He never forgot his roots in the coal \nfields of southeastern Ohio. He wrapped his arms around all Ohioans. He \nwas inclusive and reached out to everyone, regardless of stature in \nlife, economic status, religion or color of skin.\n  Because of his humble beginnings, he understood the importance of \nproviding an education to every man, woman and child in Ohio, whether \nit was a public education or a non-public education. He initiated the \nOhio Auxiliary Services program, and because of his efforts, today, \nthere is no state in the nation that does as much for non-public \nschools as Ohio. He brought Ohio's higher education system into the \n20th century. His goal of having higher education within the grasp of \nevery Ohioan--that is, no more than 30 minutes away--changed the face \nof higher education forever, and enabled millions of Ohioans to get the \neducation so essential to their economic well-being.\n  His mantras--``jobs and progress'' and ``profit is not a dirty word \nin Ohio''--will never be forgotten by any politician who wants to be \nsuccessful in Ohio. There are thousands of Ohioans working today \nbecause of the businesses the Governor brought into this state.\n  Jim Rhodes had his priorities in order, and his number one priority \nwas his family. Jim Rhodes will always be a role model to me because of \nthe way he treasured his family and encourage me and all who knew him \nto take care of their families. Jim's wife Helen, his daughters and \ntheir husbands, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren were \nparamount in his life. He always had a special twinkle in his eye when \nhe talked about this family.\n  Mr. President, Governor James A. Rhodes spoke to the basic needs and \nyearnings of the people of Ohio; he loved Ohio, and Ohio loved him. We \nmay have lost him in body, but he will always be with us in spirit. \nOhio will never forget Jim Rhodes.\n  Mr. LUGAR.
