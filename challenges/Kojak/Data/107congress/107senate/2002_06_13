Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be here again this \nmorning speaking about one of the most important topics to touch \nAmerican families, seniors, and businesses. The entire economy, right \nnow, is struggling with the explosion of health care costs. Most of \nthose relate to the crisis of prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\n  First, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership, for \nbringing forward and fighting for Medicare and prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors. I was pleased yesterday to join with the occupant \nof the chair, Senator Bob Graham from Florida, Senator Ted Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, Senator Harry Reid, our distinguished assistant majority \nleader, and many others who have come together to put forward a \nvoluntary, comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors, one we can be proud of, one that people can choose to sign up \nfor if they need it; and if they choose not to because of other \ncoverage, that is good as well. But it will be there for everyone. It \nwill finally keep the promise of Medicare by truly covering the way \nhealth care is provided today. We know that is long overdue.\n  As we all know, in 1965, when Medicare was constructed, it covered \nthe way health care was provided. When you went in the hospital and had \nan operation, you might need penicillin or something else connected \nwith your stay in the hospital. But today is different. Most people \ndon't go to the hospital. Most people are able fortunately to receive \nsome kind of assistance, such as medications that prevent problems. \nSome have high blood pressure or high cholesterol and many other things \nthat they need to take medication to control. You also may be able to \ntake a pill that stops open-heart surgery. A gentleman in Michigan \ntells me he takes one pill a month, and it stops him from having to \nhave open-heart surgery. He said that is great, but the pill costs $400 \na month.\n  This is a gentleman who, fortunately, is a UAW retiree and is able to \nreceive some assistance from an excellent benefit plan. But he said: \nWhat if I didn't have that? What if I was just on Medicare and didn't \nhave that extra help that came from my job? That $400 a month that \nstops open-heart surgery is a wonderful benefit.\n  We celebrate the fact that that drug was created. But too many people \nwould either not be able to afford that, would be sitting at the \nkitchen table, like a lot of people today, saying: Do I eat today? Do I \npay the utility bill? Am I able to pay the other things that will allow \nme to live independently or do I get my medicine?\n  So I am very pleased to be a part of the effort that is building in \nthe Senate to pass a real Medicare prescription drug benefit, which we \nintend to do.\n  I thank our leader, Tom Daschle, for making a commitment that we are \ngoing to bring this issue before the Senate for a vote in a matter of a \nfew weeks.\n  There are those around the country who are listening today and \nsaying, Sure, we have heard this before, but is it really going to \nhappen? Are we really going to be able to move the ball forward?\n  The answer is, with the help of people who are watching and listening \ntoday, we will. The reason this has been so difficult an issue is that, \nunfortunately, we see an industry doing very well by diverting a lot of \nthe current rules, by getting around a lot of the rules. The current \nsystem works well for the drug industry. There are six drug company \nlobbyists for every Member of the Senate. So their voice is heard here \nevery day.\n  I was pleased yesterday to join with about 30 different health care \nconsumer groups to launch an effort to get the people's voice into this \ndebate. Not only are we asking people to write their Senators, their \nHouse Member, and the President and say, now is the time to act--it is \npast the time to act--but we are also asking people to join us in an \neffort called fairdrugprices.org. Fairdrugprices.org is a new action \ncenter. We are asking people to log on--maybe this is your first time \non a computer; if you do not have a computer, ask a family member, ask \nsomebody else, and if, like so many of us, you are learning all this, \njust type in ``fairdrugprices.org'' and go to this site.\n  You can sign a petition to send two messages to Congress: Pass a real \nMedicare prescription drug benefit and lower prices for everybody. We \nhave a plan on how to do both. If you go to fairdrugprices.org, you can \nsign up to be a part of this process. You can also communicate with \nyour Member of Congress through this site, as well as directly going to \ntheir site.\n  Also, we are asking you to share your story. If you are a small \nbusiness, the senior premium for health care went up 30 percent last \nyear, and insurance companies said most of that was the explosion in \nprescription drug prices. Or if you are an 85-year-old woman with \nbreast cancer struggling to buy tamoxifen or a 65-year-old man who is \nstruggling with high blood pressure and other ailments and struggling \nto get the medicine you need, sign up, share that story, and we will \nbring that story to the floor of the Senate. We will make the people's \nvoice a part of this process in a very real way because when the people \nare engaged--and, Mr. President, you know this--the right things \nhappen.\n  When people are involved in telling what is real--they are not making \nthis up; this is not a made-up problem; they are not just trying to \ntalk the talk--they want action. They want action from Senators. They \nwant this to be bipartisan. They want the President to embrace this. \nThey want us to solve the problem.\n  There are a lot of other issues we can talk about around here, but we \nwant to get this done. This effort is beginning to really get up steam. \nWe want to invite everybody to go to fairdrugprices.org and engage in \nthis issue.\n  We also ask for some help to take a serious look at other proposals \nthat are coming forward from other places that do not do the job. There \nare a lot of proposals that are being called Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage. There are those who provide coverage that is affordable. We \nare pleased that our plan would be a $25-per-month premium and would \nprovide comprehensive coverage with no gaps. It would not cut home \nhealth care to do it. It would not cut our hospitals or nursing homes \nto do it.\n\n  We have a real plan. I regret to say that our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, on the other side of the Capitol, through the \nSpeaker and the Republicans in the House, have not yet put forward a \nreal Medicare plan. Unfortunately, what they put forward covers very \nlittle of the prescription drug bill, and they are talking continually \nabout including cuts to hospitals and other providers to pay for it and \nsetting up new costs for home health care.\n  I know in my own family and friends' families, often when you are \nstruggling with that prescription drug bill, you also need some home \nhealth care help. Those frequently go together.\n  Today we are very proud of the home health care industry, our \nvisiting nurses, and our other small businesses that set up shop to \nhelp people live in dignity at home. We know it is good from a quality-\nof-life standpoint. We know it saves money. It is good on all accounts. \nHome health care makes sense.\n  My fear is that what is being talked about by our House Republican \ncolleagues is charging copays. One will have to pay on the front end \nfor visits. On the one hand, while saying we want to help with \nprescription drug coverage, on the other, we are going to create new \ncosts for you, we will save a little money in this pocket and take a \nlittle more out of this pocket. In the end, that will not be helpful to \npeople.\n  I call upon my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the \nother side of the Capitol, in the House of Representatives, to join \nwith us in a real effort. Do not add costs to home health care. Do not \ncut our providers who have already been cut enough. Join with us in \nsomething that is real and makes sense.\n  One of my other concerns about what the House is talking about is \nthat it would not be a benefit under Medicare. They are saying let \nprivate insurance cover prescription drugs with prescription-only \npolicies. I suggest that if the insurance companies wanted to do that, \nthey would have already done that. The reason they do not is that it is \nvery expensive to provide a prescription-only insurance policy, outside \nof Medicare or outside of a standard policy.\n  Ironically, if you go back and look at the debate prior to 1965 when \nMedicare came into being, it came into being because the only thing \nthat older adults had at that time was to try to find insurance in the \nprivate sector, and about half of them could not find any or it was not \naffordable because it is\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\nless profitable to cover older adults or to cover the disabled or to \ncover people who are likely to begin to have more health ailments. So \nthose policies were not there.\n  Medicare came into being to make sure that everybody had access to \nhealth care; that our older citizens, our disabled citizens would be \nable to get the same care that other citizens received. That was a \npromise we made in 1965.\n  Now, instead of making sure that promise is real by covering \nprescription drugs, which is the way health care is provided today, we \nhave our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle saying: Let's \ngo back to what did not work before 1965. Let's go back to the system \nthat does not work.\n  We are saying that is not good enough. More importantly, the people \nof the country are saying that is not good enough. I believe people are \nwatching and are holding us accountable. They are holding us \naccountable as to whether or not we are going to get past the talk and \nstart walking the walk.\n  Are we going to make this happen or continue to set up straw men that \nsound good, get people through an election, but, in the end, do not \ncreate the ability for one senior to buy one pill? That is the \nchallenge we face, and we have an opportunity because of the leadership \nin the Senate by our Senate majority leader, Senator Daschle, and \nSenator Harry Reid, and others who have said this is so important, we \nare going to make this a priority now, that this summer we are going to \nact on this issue; we are going to bring this up.\n  It is so important we now engage people and invite people to join us \nto make sure we are successful. This is not just about getting a vote \nor bringing up a bill, this is about fixing the problem. It is about \ncreating a Medicare prescription drug benefit for everyone who needs it \nand making sure they then have the ability to get the health care they \nneed.\n  Frankly, I am excited about what \nis ahead in the next few weeks and \nwant to invite people to join us to \nbe a part of this effort--again, fairdrugprices.org.\n  I want to also invite people from Michigan, if those from Michigan \nare listening, to visit my own Web site. We are asking people as well \nto come and join us and check out what is happening through my Senate \nWeb site: Stabenow.Senate.gov. At this Web site, we are asking people \nto take a look at what we are doing and share the stories through our \nWeb site as well.\n  I also mention this morning the important efforts to cut prices for \neveryone. As I said in the beginning, we have two goals. We have the \ngoal of updating Medicare so it really provides health care and meets \nthe promise that was made in 1965, but we also know that this issue \naffects everyone. As I said before, if one is a business owner, a \nfarmer trying to get health care coverage for their family, a young \nworking family, or an older working family, right now we have a very \nunfortunate situation in our country. In fact, in some cases we are \npaying for all of the initial research on these new lifesaving drugs \ninto the billions, over $23 billion.\n  We have been increasing the research through the National Institutes \nof Health every year. As of this year, I believe, we have doubled in \nthe last 5 years the funding for NIH, a very important thing to do. It \nis something we have had support for on both sides of the aisle. It is \nvery important that we be able to move forward on this funding. That is \ngood.\n  We then have a situation in our country where we allow companies to \ntake that information that you and I pay for, and begin to develop \nthese new drugs. As they do that, as a further incentive, we allow them \nto take deductions on their taxes for the research. We give them a new \n20-percent tax credit on new research. We also allow them to write off \ntheir advertising, marketing, and sales costs. We give them up to a 20-\nyear patent. We say it is so expensive to create these new drugs that \nwe are going to make sure their name brand cannot be challenged and \nthey cannot have competition for that formula for up to 20 years. So we \nprotect that for them through a patent.\n  When all is said and done, after all this investment and all of this \neffort to support creating these new drugs, what do we have? \nUnfortunately, we have, as Americans, the highest prices in the world. \nThat makes absolutely no sense.\n  What I fear is that we are seeing more and more an industry that is \nless focused on new breakthrough drugs and more focused on how to \ncreate more profit by slightly changing the drug to keep the patent \ngoing, making it a purple pill instead of a red pill, changing the box, \npromoting it, changing the name, keeping the patent going so there is \nno competition, and keep raising those prices right through the roof.\n  I was very interested in watching a program that Peter Jennings put \nforward on ABC a couple of weeks ago. I commend ABC and Peter Jennings \nfor coming forward with something that was very comprehensive but, \nunfortunately, extremely disturbing. It indicated that about 80 percent \nof the new patents, the new drugs that are going on the market, the new \npatents approved by FDA on what is called standard drugs--that is a \ncategory that means there is very little difference between the drug \nthat was already there and the new drug--80 percent are not drugs that \nhave changed the formulas in a way that would improve health care.\n  What we see happening instead is this movement of sales and marketing \nand advertising, and now, unfortunately, in the last 5 years--in fact, \nsince 1996--the FDA has changed the rules so that drug consumer \nadvertising is allowed. They have loosened the rules, and we have seen \nan explosion in the amount of direct consumer advertising.\n\n  Anyone listening today, anyone listening in the Chamber, all we have \nto do is turn on our television set, and if not every ad, every other \nad is a beautiful picture, a beautiful ad, for a prescription drug. \nThat is great if they want to do that, but unfortunately we now see two \nand a half times more being spent on advertising than on research. The \nlatest numbers show there was more spent on advertising Vioxx than \nPepsi, Coke, or Budweiser.\n  As I have said so many times before, someone can decide not to have a \nCoke today, although I am pretty addicted to Diet Coke, but if someone \nis a breast cancer patient, they cannot decide not to take Tamoxifen \nwithout very serious consequences. So this is not the same and should \nnot be treated the same.\n  So one of the bills that we put forward--and I appreciate the \nPresiding Officer's support and cosponsorship with me--is something \ncalled the FAIR Act, the Fair Advertising and Increased Research Act. \nIt is a bill that would simply say we will allow the companies to write \noff advertising and marketing and sales from their taxes. In other \nwords, we will subsidize that as taxpayers but only to the level we \nsubsidize research. It makes sense to me. We will allow advertising, \nand certainly they can do as much as they want, but we just do not want \nto pay for it. So we are saying we will pay for as much or help \nsubsidize as much on advertising as we do on research; beyond that, \nthey are on their own.\n  I hope we will get a vote on that bill, that we will be able to cap \nthose excessive advertising costs, because it is overdue and we know it \nis part of the explosion. It is not only the advertising costs, it is \nthat increased utilization that comes from promoting medications and \nthe top name brand rather than one that may be exactly the same that is \nnot advertised.\n  That leads me to another very important issue, and that is the \nquestion of unadvertised brands. We know that at least half of the \nmedications out today have another drug that is exactly the same or \nextremely close, that is just not advertised. It is called a generic. \nWe know that if someone uses that unadvertised brand, they can cut \ntheir costs 35, 50, 75 percent. I have seen quotes of savings up to 90 \npercent. So there is a major effort now happening. I commend Blue \nCross/Blue Shield of Michigan, which is working with our Chamber of \nCommerce and others, in a coalition, and I know it is happening across \nthe country, to close the loopholes in the law.\n  Senator John McCain and Senator Chuck Schumer have a bill, which I am \npleased to be cosponsoring, that would close the loopholes which right \nnow allow the drug companies to stop these unadvertised brands from \ngoing on the\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\nmarket. So we want to address that as well.\n  We want to have the opportunity to do away with excessive \nadvertising, use more of the unadvertised brands and drop the prices \nfor people. We also want to open the border to Canada where right now \none can buy prescriptions at half the price.\n  The final thing on our agenda is to support those States that are \ncreatively looking for ways and acting to lower prescription drug \nprices for their citizens. About 30 different States, including my home \nState of Michigan, are developing ways to lower prices, some very \ncreatively.\n  In Maine, for example, they have developed a policy where if someone \nis doing business and they have a Medicaid contract for prescription \ndrugs, then they are requiring that same discounted price be provided \nthat is provided to the State through Medicaid to those who do not have \ninsurance but are not on Medicaid. So they are using their clout as \npurchasers to be able to lower prices, and they are being sued. Not \nsurprisingly, a drug company lobby is suing all of the States that are \ndoing that.\n  The final bill I have introduced is called the RX Flexibility for \nStates bill, which would make it clear that States have a right to \ndevelop innovative programs to lower prices for their citizens and to \nuse the Medicaid purchasing power as a part of that.\n  In conclusion, let me say we have a plan. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, because he is one of the key leaders on our Medicare plan, we \nhave a Medicare plan. We have proposals to lower prices. We have a plan \nthat will make sure our seniors and our disabled have what they need in \nlifesaving medicine. We will make sure small businesses can count on us \nto do something to lower prices for our farmers, our families.\n\n  I call upon colleagues to join as quickly as possible to put this \nplan in action. Again, I invite all citizens listening today to join \nwww.fairdrugprices.org. Get involved. Put the people's voice in this \ndebate. I know we will be able to get something done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

BARNETT SLEPIAN AND CONDEMNING ANTI-ABORTION VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, after the attacks against our country on \nSeptember 11th and with ongoing violence in the Middle East, we have \ntaken steps to remind Americans that not all Arabs and not all Muslims \nare terrorists. And it is important to remember that not all terrorists \nare Arabs or Muslims.\n  Terrorism is not an ideology linked to any particular religion, race, \nor nationality; rather it is a tactic, a method deliberately chosen by \nthose who reject peaceful means of promoting their cause and instead \nturn to violence. Obviously not all terrorists share the same goals--\nindeed, there are many cases where terrorists with diametrically \nopposed views are fighting against one another.\n  But terrorists seem to hold in common a belief that they are above \nthe law and a common disregard for human life.\n  Unfortunately, we have homegrown terrorists right here in America:\n  People like Timothy McVeigh who bombed the Federal building in \nOklahoma City and whoever is responsible for the anthrax attacks of \nlast year.\n  America has also been plagued by numerous acts of violence by \nextremists in the anti-abortion movement. One of their victims was \nBarnett Slepian, a husband and a father of four. He was killed in his \nfamily's home in Buffalo, New York 3\\1/2\\ years ago shortly after \nreturning from synagogue where he had gone to mourn his father's death.\n  Barnett Slepian was a gynecologist and obstetrician. He provided \nhealth care to women and delivered babies. And he also performed \nabortions at a downtown clinic, because he wanted to make sure that \neven poor women had access to safe, legal procedures. Because of this \nhe was killed.\n  I didn't know Dr. Slepian, but I learned after his death that he was \nthe uncle of a woman from Reno, Nevada who worked for me here in \nWashington.\n  Dr. Slepian's killer is not only a cold-blooded murderer, but should \nalso be seen as a terrorist. The man police have identified as \nresponsible for killing Dr. Slepian was recently extradited from France \nwhere he had fled. His name is James Kopp.\n  Kopp has been indicted for the shooting of a doctor in Canada and is \na suspect in 3 other shootings of doctors who provided abortions. While \nKopp alone might have pulled the trigger and fired the shot that killed \nDr. Slepian, we have learned that he was part of an organized network \nof violent extremists, including a group that calls itself the Army of \nGod. (Imagine that a group would invoke the Lord's name and believe \nthat God sanctions their lawless violence. And this group of murderers \nprofesses a respect for life!)\n  This group and others similar to it have engaged in a long campaign \nof harassment, intimidation, and violence. Their crimes include \nkidnaping, bombing, arson, assault and murder. They have targeted \nhealth clinic employees, judges and other officials. And not only have \nthey attacked and killed doctors, but they have also threatened the \ndoctors' children. These groups have hosted Web sites that post the \nnames, addresses, license plate numbers of doctors and others on hit \nlists and even put up pictures of their targets' family members and \nidentify where their children catch the school bus.\n  Fortunately, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled just last month \nthat targeting specific doctors in this way constitutes an illegal \nthreat, and found those responsible for the Web sites in violation of \nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. I applaud the court's \nruling, and I am pleased that the FACE legislation we passed has helped \nprotect Americans. But we must remain vigilant and continue to take \nappropriate action to prevent extremist groups from terrorizing \nvictims. Their intention is to intimidate and threaten, and sometimes \nthey succeed as some doctors have given up their practice due to the \nemotional stress and constant fear they faced.\n  Dr. Slepian courageously endured threats for over a decade before he \nwas murdered. We must have the courage to condemn the violent \nextremists in the anti-choice movement. Those who kill and commit other \nheinous acts to express their opposition to abortion do so with the \nsupport of many others people who fund their crimes, aid and abet them, \nharbor fugitives. Others help create a climate that encourages this \nviolence through their hateful speech or by remaining silent.\n  We cannot remain silent. We must say loudly and unequivocally that \nmurder is wrong.\n  America is a nation of laws. I believe in following the law. You \nmight not always agree with the law or how it is interpreted. But that \ndoes not entitle you to willfully violate it without \nconsequences. America instead offers you an opportunity to seek to \nchange the law through peaceful means.\n\n  We express policy differences civilly through discourse and resolve \nthem through the political process, not through violence. Here in the \nSenate we debate passionately, but in a manner of respect and civility, \nand attempt to persuade others of the merits of our positions.\n  Those who resort to violence are violating not only our laws but our \nAmerican principles and values.\n  We in the Senate must identify them as terrorists. The American \npeople must recognize them as terrorists. And law enforcement officials \nmust treat them as terrorists--for that is what they are.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the role.\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concerns about \nthe concentration of ownership in the radio and concert industry and \nits effect on consumers, artists, local businesses, and ticket prices.\n  I will be introducing legislation to address these concerns in the \ncoming weeks, but wanted to make my colleagues aware of the seismic \nchanges that have taken place in the radio and concert industries \nfollowing the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  During the debate of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, I joined a \nnumber of my colleagues in opposing the deregulation of radio ownership \nrules because of concerns about the impact on consumers, artists, and \nlocal radio stations.\n  Passage of this act was an unfortunate example of the influence of \nsoft money in the political process. As my colleagues will recall, I \nhave consistently said that this act was really in many ways bought and \npaid for by soft money. Everyone was at the table, except for the \nconsumers.\n  In November, we will finally have rid the system of this loophole, \nbut we must repair its damage.\n  In just 5 years since its passage, the effects of the \nTelecommunications Act have been far worse than we imagined. While I \nopposed this act because of its anticonsumer bias, I did not predict \nthat one provision would have caused so much harm to a diverse range of \ninterests.\n  The provision I am referring to is the elimination of the national \nradio ownership caps and relaxation of local ownership caps, which has \ntriggered a wave of consolidation and caused harm to consumers, \nartists, concert goers, local radio station owners, and promoters.\n  To put the changes of the 1996 act in perspective, it is helpful to \ncompare them to other moves towards deregulation of radio ownership \nthat began in 1984.\n  In 1984, there were limitations on the total number of radio stations \nthat one company could own nationally and locally, and how long a \ncompany had to hold a station before being allowed to sell. That year, \nthe ownership regulations were changed to allow one entity to own 12 AM \nstations, 12 FM stations and 12 television stations--an increase from 7 \nto each type a year earlier.\n  The Federal Communications Commission again loosened the ownership \nrequirements in 1992 by allowing one company to own up to two AM and \ntwo FM stations in a specific market, so long as they did not account \nfor more than 25 percent of the total listening audience. The national \nownership limits were also raised to 18 AM and 18 FM stations.\n  This change brings us to the seismic shift that shook up the radio \nand live concert industries across the country--the passage of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act.\n  This legislation did not simply raise the national ownership limits \non radio stations--it eliminated them altogether. It also dramatically \naltered the local radio station ownership limits through the \nimplementation of a tiered ownership system which allowed a company to \nown more radio stations in the larger markets.\n  The highest range was in the largest markets, those with 45 stations \nor more. In those markets, one group could own up to eight stations, \nwith no more than five in either AM or FM. The strictest limit was in \nthe smallest markets with less than 15 stations, where one entity could \nown five stations, but only three in any one service.\n  This change was not beneficial to consumers or local radio station \nowners or broadcasters. It simply led to a number of national super \nradio station corporations that now dominate the marketplace, and \nallegedly engage in anticompetitive business practices.\n  The concentration levels of radio station ownership, both across the \nUnited States and in most local markets, is staggering.\n  In 1996, prior to the passage of the Telecommunications Act, there \nwere 5133 owners of radio stations. Today, for the contemporary hit \nradio/top 40 formats, four radio station groups--Chancellor, Clear \nChannel, Infinity, and Capstar--just four control access to 63 percent \nof the format's 41 million listeners nationwide. For the country music \nformat, the same four groups control access to 56 percent of the \nformat's 28 million listeners.\n  The concentration of ownership is even more startling when we look at \nradio station ownership in local markets.\n  Four radio station companies control nearly 80 percent of the New \nYork Market. Three of these same four companies own nearly 60 percent \nof the market share in Chicago. In my home State of Wisconsin, four \ncompanies own 86 percent of the market share in the Milwaukee radio \nmarket.\n  Let me repeat, four companies control 86 percent.\n  The list continues in almost every market across the United States. \nThe concentration of radio station ownership by a few companies is mind \nboggling, and its effect on consumers, artists and others in the music \nindustry is cause for great concern.\n  Many of the same corporations that own multiple radio stations in a \ngiven market wield their power through their ownership of a number of \nbusinesses related to the music industry. For example, the Clear \nChannel Corporation owns over 1200 radio companies, more than 700,000 \nbillboards, various promotion companies, and venues across the United \nStates. Also, just three years ago, in 1999, Clear Channel bought SFX \nproductions, the Nation's largest promotion company.\n  A national group of organizations, recently joined together to voice \nmany of the same concerns that I have heard from my constituents in \nWisconsin--that the high levels of concentration are hurting the entire \nindustry.\n  This coalition of artists, labor groups, small businesses, and radio \ncompanies recently released a joint statement that expressed a number \nof concerns about the levels of concentration and the anticompetitive \npractices.\n  These concerns included that a corporation that owns radio stations, \npromotion companies and venues has a conflict of interest in terms of \npromoting its own concerts and tours on its radio stations over those \nof any competition.\n  They are also concerned about a corporation's interest in limiting \nthe promotional support of bands and artists that are performing for \nother companies, performing at other venues or sponsored by other \nstations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint statement by this \ngroup be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. After I began looking into the consolidation trends, I \nwas taken aback by the diverse range of people that expressed concerns \nabout the effects of concentration and consolidation. Concert goers \ntalk all the time about higher ticket prices.\n  Broadcasters, artists, and others in Wisconsin and across the country \nhave told me about reduced diversity and local input in the music \nindustry. And local businesses have spoken about anticompetitive \nbehaviors that have put them on an unfair playing field.\n  Following the passage of the Telecommunications Act, and the \nresulting vertical concentration, a number of trends have emerged. \nTicket prices have gone through the roof, during the same period in \nwhich a few companies consolidated ownership of radio stations, \npromotion companies, venues, and advertising.\n  This chart compares ticket prices during the period of consolidation \nfollowing the 1996 act with the preceding 5 year blocks of time. Before \nthe passage of the 1996 act, ticket prices rose slightly faster than \nthe Consumer Price Index.\n  For example, from 1991 to 1996, concert ticket prices grew by about \n21 percent, compared to the consumer price index increase of about 15 \npercent. Following the Telecommunications Act of\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n1996, however, ticket prices have increased almost 50--50--percentage \npoints more than the Consumer Price Index. From 1996 to 2001, concert \nticket prices grew by more than 61 percent, while the Consumer Price \nIndex increased by only 13 percent.\n  Ticket prices have gone up by nearly 50 percentage points more than \nconsumer prices since passage of the Telecommunications Act, and that \ndoesn't even include the facility fees, parking charges, box office \ncharges, or food and beverage increases.\n  I think we have to look into allegations that consolidation in the \nradio industry has triggered anticompetitive practices and raised \nticket prices.\n  A broad coalition, including the American Federal of Television and \nRadio Artists, has also expressed concerns that consolidation in the \nradio industry has led to reduced diversity and competition in local \nmarkets.\n  As corporations buy stations in the same market, they combine \nnewsrooms and reporters and share playlists and radio personalities--\nall with the same effect: less choice in music and less information for \nconsumers.\n  Radio airwaves are public property. Unlike other business ventures, \nradio stations have acquired their distribution mechanisms--the \nairways--without any expenditure of capital. They were given access to \nthe broadcast spectrum by the Government for free.\n  Since 1943, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission have \ntried to ensure that this medium serves the public good, but limiting \naccess to information and diversity on the radio does not achieve this.\n  I have also heard concerns from artists and radio stations about how \nthe vertically concentrated radio corporations leverage their market-\npower to shake down the music industry in exchange for playing their \nmusic.\n  As my colleagues are aware, payola--the practice of paying money to \nget music played--has been prohibited under Federal law since the \n1960s. I have heard a number of concerns, however, about the alleged \ntendency of some owners of multiple radio stations to shake down the \nmusic industry.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I will ask a question.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent morning business be extended \nuntil the Senator from Wisconsin finishes his statement, which should \nbe a couple, 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have a question for my friend.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from Wisconsin. I think maybe \nthere is one thing these people who own all this stuff have missed, and \nthat is the parking lots. They own about everything else.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am not certain they missed that.\n  Mr. REID. You have not mentioned that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am still checking into all the different aspects.\n  Mr. REID. To go to a concert, you need a place to park, right?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am sure they will get to it if they haven't.\n  They are able to achieve this shakedown, it is said, by establishing \nexclusive agreements with independent promoters that collect a fee in \nexchange for access to the airwaves.\n  I am very troubled by these allegations. If true, they mean that \nartists that can't, or don't, pay these independent promoters will not \nbe able to get access to the airwaves. Artists should not be required \nto pay for access to the airwaves. I am continuing to investigate these \nallegations of a new shakedown, but if they are true, this practice \nshould be prohibited.\n  Finally, I am deeply disturbed about concerns that have been voiced \nby individuals and local businesses--promoters, radio station owners, \nand artists--that have been forced out of the business or have been put \non an unfair playing field as a result of the concentration of market \npower caused by the deregulation of the 1996 act.\n  These are local promoters and businesses who have succeeded through \neconomic downturns, recessions and many other challenging times. But \nwhen placed on an unfair playing field, they are being pushed out of \nthe market.\n  Radio is a public medium and we must ensure that it serves the public \ngood. The concentration of ownership, both in radio and the other \nfacets of the concert industry, has caused great harm to people and \nbusinesses that have been involved and concerned about the radio and \nconcert industry for generations.\n  It also harms the flow of creativity and ideas that artists seek to \ncontribute to our society. This concentration does a disservice to our \nsociety at every level of the industry, and it must be addressed.\n  This is about the very freedom of radio as a medium. Radio is one of \nthe most important media we have for exchanging ideas and expressing \nour creativity. But that free exchange of ideas often isn't free \nanymore--if you want to get played, often it's going to cost you. And \nif you can't afford it, then you might not get heard at all.\n  Being able to hear a variety of voices is fundamental to a free \nsociety. Concentration in the radio industry is diminishing the number \nof voices that get heard. And that risks diminishing our freedom.\n  It isn't just about who is talented, and who deserves to be played. \nIt is about a shakedown, and that is just unacceptable for the \nindustry, for the artist, and for all of us who listen.\n  While we took a step forward in reforming the campaign finance system \nearlier this year, we must fix the problems that the soft money \nloophole caused--including the gaping flaws of the Telecommunications \nAct that have hurt competition in the radio and concert industries.\n  In the coming weeks, I will be introducing legislation to address the \nconcerns about concentration and anticompetitive practices that have \nresulted from the Telecommunications Act. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I just want to alert my colleagues to this trend, and \nwe will introduce legislation to deal with it. I am convinced the \ncomplaints I have heard from such a wide variety of Wisconsinites are \nthe same concerns being raised in all the States in this country, and I \nlook forward to submitting a proposal and a bill to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n        Joint Statement on Current Issues in Radio, May 24, 2002\n\n       We are a diverse coalition representing performing artist \n     groups, labor, record labels, merchandisers, songwriters, \n     community broadcasters, consumers and citizens advocates. We \n     urge the government to revise the payola laws to cover \n     independent promotion to radio, to investigate the impact of \n     radio consolidation on the music community and citizens and \n     to work to protect non-commercial space on both the \n     terrestrial radio bandwidth and the emerging webcasting \n     models.\n       Radio is a public asset, not private property. Since 1934, \n     the federal government, through the Federal Communications \n     Commission, has overseen the regulation and protection of \n     this public asset to create a communications medium that \n     serves the public interest. Unlike other businesses, radio \n     stations have acquired their distribution mechanism--the \n     airwaves--without any expenditure of capital. The public owns \n     the airwaves. Owners of broadcast stations were given access \n     to the broadcast spectrum by the government for free. The \n     quid pro quo for free use of the public bandwidth requires \n     that broadcast stations serve the public interest in their \n     local communities.\n       However, it has become clear that both recording artists \n     and citizens are negatively impacted by legislation, \n     regulatory interpretations and by a number of standardized \n     industry practices that fail to serve the public interest. We \n     call on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \n     undertake a comprehensive review of the following aspects of \n     the radio industry that are anti-artist, anti-competition and \n     anti-consumer. Further, we call on Congress to be vigilant in \n     their oversight of the FCC to ensure the public interest is \n     being upheld in regards to radio.\n       Specifically:\n       1. We request that payments made to radio stations which \n     are designed to influence playlists (other than legitimate \n     and reasonable promotional expenses) be prohibited, unless \n     such payments are announced over the air, even when such \n     intent is subtle and disguised. This includes payments made \n     through independent radio promoters.\n       2. We request an investigation of the impact of recent \n     unprecedented increases in radio ownership consolidation on \n     citizens and the music community.\n       3. We request an examination of the way vertical \n     integration of ownership in broadcasting, concert promotion \n     companies and venues decreases fair market competition for \n     artists, clubs and promotion companies.\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\n       4. We request that policies that protect non-commercial \n     space in the radio bandwidth and in the emerging webcasting \n     models be enacted, securing the benefits of programming \n     diversity for the music community and citizens.\n\n\n                               background\n\n              Pay for Play and Independent Radio Promotion\n\n       Payola--the practice of paying money to people in exchange \n     for playing a particular piece of music--has a long history \n     in the music industry. The practice didn't garner much public \n     attention until the late 1950s and 1960s when rock and roll \n     disc jockeys became powerful gatekeepers who determined what \n     music the public heard. Federal laws were passed starting in \n     the 1960s that forbid the direct payment or compensation of \n     disc jockeys or other radio staff in exchange for the playing \n     of certain records unless such payments were announced over \n     the air.\n       The various laws and hearings from the 1960s-1970s muted \n     the prominence of payola for a while. However, payola-like \n     practices eventually resurfaced, but in a more indirect form. \n     Standardized business practices now employed by many \n     broadcasters and independent radio promoters result in what \n     we consider a de facto form of payola. Often, in an effort to \n     stay within the law, the payment is characterized as, for \n     example, payment to receive first notice of the station's \n     playlist ``adds.''\n       The new payola-like practices take two primary forms. Radio \n     consolidation has created the first type. Radio station group \n     owners establish exclusive arrangements with ``independent \n     promoters,'' who then guarantee a fixed annual or monthly sum \n     of money to the radio station group or individual station. In \n     exchange for this payment, the radio station group agrees to \n     give the independent promoter first notice of new songs added \n     to its playlists each week. Stations in the group also tend \n     to play mostly records that have been suggested by the \n     independent promoter. As a result of the standardization of \n     this practice, record companies and artists generally must \n     pay the radio stations' independent promoters if they want to \n     be considered for airplay on those stations.\n       The second payola-like practice occurs after the music \n     labels hire an ``independent radio promoter'' to legitimately \n     promote their records to specific stations for a fee. \n     Reportedly, certain indie promoters use the labels' money to \n     pay the stations for playing songs on the air.\n       These practices result in ``bottom line'' programming \n     decisions where questions of artistic merit and community \n     responsiveness take a back seat to the desire of broadcasters \n     to gain additional revenue. As a result, many new and \n     independent artists, as well as many established artists, are \n     denied valuable radio airplay they would receive if \n     programming decisions were more objective. Furthermore, \n     whatever form the pay-for-play takes, these ``promotion'' \n     costs are often shared by the artists and adversely impact \n     the ability of recording artists to succeed financially.\n       To protect the public interest, we request the payola \n     prohibition be revised by the FCC so that it cannot be \n     circumvented by any entity via the use of independent \n     promoters. If the music played on the radio has less to do \n     with the quality of the song than the economics of the \n     business arrangement, how does this serve the needs of \n     citizens? Also, when payments are not announced, isn't the \n     public misled into thinking that the station chooses which \n     songs to broadcast based on merit?\n\n              Impact of Widespread Industry Consolidation\n\n       The federal government must also examine the impact of \n     loosened ownership caps on the listening public. Until 1996, \n     the Federal Communications Commission regulated ownership of \n     broadcast stations so any company could own no more than two \n     radio stations in any one market and no more than 40 \n     nationwide. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act \n     of 1996, the restrictions government ownership of radio \n     stations evaporated. Now, radio groups own numerous stations \n     around the country and exercise unreasonable control over the \n     airwaves. For example, in 1996, there were 5133 owners of \n     radio stations. Today, for the Contemporary Hit Radio/Top 40 \n     formats, only four radio station groups--Chancellor, Clear \n     Channel, Infinity and Capstar--control access to 63 percent \n     of the format's 41 million listeners nationwide. For the \n     country format, the same four groups control access to 56 \n     percent of the format's 28 million listeners.\n       This consolidation has led to a new dynamic in the music \n     industry. Radio station groups have centralized their \n     decision-making about playlists and which new songs to add to \n     the playlist. These centralized playlists have reduced the \n     local flavor and limited the diversity of music played on \n     radio. Due to their sheer market power, radio station groups \n     now have the ability to make or break a hit song.\n       With the increased leverage resulting from ownership \n     consolidation, at least one group owner is considering \n     charging labels for merely identifying the name of the artist \n     and song played. The CEO of Clear Channel told the Los \n     Angeles Times that it might sell song identification as a \n     form of advertising. This miserly practice would harm the \n     music community and citizens, as it would make it difficult \n     for radio listeners to identify new artists and purchase \n     music. Once again, this practice would impact the ability of \n     new and independent artists to succeed.\n       We request that the FCC investigate consolidation of radio \n     ownership focusing on the public interest which radio \n     stations are supposed to serve. This investigation should \n     look at the difficulties small independent broadcasters face \n     when going up against large and powerful radio station groups \n     in a specific market. It should study the role that national \n     playlist decisions have had on the skyrocketing cost of radio \n     promotion. It should also take into account the impact of \n     reduced staffing levels on members of local stations and the \n     reduction of classical, jazz, bluegrass and other formats \n     from the airwaves.\n\n                  Vertical Integration of Radio Owners\n\n       Many radio groups are also vertically integrated companies \n     increasing their already substantial leverage and control. \n     For example, Clear Channel, a company that owns over 1200 \n     radio stations, also owns tens of thousands of billboards, \n     and various promotion companies and venues. In 1999 Clear \n     Channel purchased SFX Entertainment, the nation's most \n     powerful concert promoter. This gave Clear Channel control of \n     the concert promotion industry in most of the key regions of \n     the US virtually overnight. Clear Channel therefore has a \n     direct economic interest in promoting its own concerts and \n     tours on its numerous radio stations over those of the \n     competition. It also has an interest in limiting the \n     promotional support of bands and artists who are performing \n     for other companies, at other venues or who are sponsored by \n     other stations.\n       Some of the remaining independent concert promoters have \n     alleged that Clear Channel is engaging in anti-competitive \n     behavior by using this leverage to force smaller companies \n     out of business. In particular, the mid-size promoter NIPP in \n     Denver brought suit against Clear Channel in 2001, alleging \n     that Clear Channel--which owns all three rock stations in the \n     Denver area--was not running the ads that NIPP paid for on \n     its stations to promote last year's NIPP-promoted Warped \n     Tour. There have been other allegations from bands and \n     performers--mostly off-the-record for fear of retaliation--\n     who have stated that radio station groups have pressured them \n     into playing shows for free in exchange for airplay, or who \n     have had their songs removed from playlists for playing non-\n     exclusive venues.\n       We would like to see the FCC investigate whether an \n     artist's choice to play or not to play in Clear Channel \n     venues or to use or not to use Clear Channel's promotion \n     company impacts the artist's positions on or removal from \n     Clear Channel playlists.\n\n                            Community Radio\n\n       Rampant consolidation of commercial radio and increased \n     budgetary pressures felt by non-commercial stations have led \n     to a reduction in radio play for musical genres like \n     classical, jazz, opera and bluegrass. Congress needs to \n     reevaluate the current status of non-commercial radio, \n     including exploring new strategies for sustaining existing \n     community radio stations and moving forward with full \n     implementation of community-based Low Power FM radio. After \n     an intense lobbying campaign by the National Association of \n     Broadcasters and NPR, the FCC's Low Power FM plan was scaled \n     back significantly via an Appropriations rider in 2000. The \n     FCC is currently following Congress' request for additional \n     testing of the impact of these tiny stations on existing \n     broadcasters. Once the FCC report is submitted to Congress, \n     Congress must move forward by passing legislation to \n     authorize the FCC to license these stations in urban areas. \n     If consolidation in the radio environment has stifled \n     competition and reduced diversity of programming, low power \n     radio can begin to address the lack of community-based \n     programming.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We are deeply concerned about payola and payola-like \n     practices, as well as the problems caused by radio station \n     ownership consolidation, and the vertical iintegration of \n     station ownership with venue ownership and concert promoters. \n     New rules must be written by the FCC to prohibit payments to \n     radio stations from ``independent promoters'' unless such \n     payments are announced. The FCC must seriously evaluate \n     whether a radio station is even satisfying the current \n     license requirement that sponsorship identification or \n     disclosure must accompany any material that is broadcast in \n     exchange for money, service, or anything else of value paid \n     to a station, either directly or indirectly. The FCC should \n     also consider whether radio stations are serving the public \n     interest by contributing to localism, and independence in \n     broadcasting. Finally, Congress must be vigilant in ensuring \n     that the FCC is upholding the public interest in all of these \n     matters.\n       Respectfully submitted by the following organizations:\n       American Federation of Musicians (AFM), American Federation \n     of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), Association for \n     Independent Music (AFIM), Future of Music Coalition (FMC), \n     Just Plain Folks, Nashville Songwriters Association \n     International (NSAI), National Association of Recording \n     Merchandisers (NARM), National Federation of Community \n     Broadcasters (NFCB), Recording Academy, Recording Industry \n     Association of America (RIAA).\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5468-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5468-S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMEMBERING DR. BARNETT SLEPIAN AND CONDEMNING ANTI-ABORTION VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, after the attacks against our country on \nSeptember 11th and with ongoing violence in the Middle East, we have \ntaken steps to remind Americans that not all Arabs and not all Muslims \nare terrorists. And it is important to remember that not all terrorists \nare Arabs or Muslims.\n  Terrorism is not an ideology linked to any particular religion, race, \nor nationality; rather it is a tactic, a method deliberately chosen by \nthose who reject peaceful means of promoting their cause and instead \nturn to violence. Obviously not all terrorists share the same goals--\nindeed, there are many cases where terrorists with diametrically \nopposed views are fighting against one another.\n  But terrorists seem to hold in common a belief that they are above \nthe law and a common disregard for human life.\n  Unfortunately, we have homegrown terrorists right here in America:\n  People like Timothy McVeigh who bombed the Federal building in \nOklahoma City and whoever is responsible for the anthrax attacks of \nlast year.\n  America has also been plagued by numerous acts of violence by \nextremists in the anti-abortion movement. One of their victims was \nBarnett Slepian, a husband and a father of four. He was killed in his \nfamily's home in Buffalo, New York 3\\1/2\\ years ago shortly after \nreturning from synagogue where he had gone to mourn his father's death.\n  Barnett Slepian was a gynecologist and obstetrician. He provided \nhealth care to women and delivered babies. And he also performed \nabortions at a downtown clinic, because he wanted to make sure that \neven poor women had access to safe, legal procedures. Because of this \nhe was killed.\n  I didn't know Dr. Slepian, but I learned after his death that he was \nthe uncle of a woman from Reno, Nevada who worked for me here in \nWashington.\n  Dr. Slepian's killer is not only a cold-blooded murderer, but should \nalso be seen as a terrorist. The man police have identified as \nresponsible for killing Dr. Slepian was recently extradited from France \nwhere he had fled. His name is James Kopp.\n  Kopp has been indicted for the shooting of a doctor in Canada and is \na suspect in 3 other shootings of doctors who provided abortions. While \nKopp alone might have pulled the trigger and fired the shot that killed \nDr. Slepian, we have learned that he was part of an organized network \nof violent extremists, including a group that calls itself the Army of \nGod. (Imagine that a group would invoke the Lord's name and believe \nthat God sanctions their lawless violence. And this group of murderers \nprofesses a respect for life!)\n  This group and others similar to it have engaged in a long campaign \nof harassment, intimidation, and violence. Their crimes include \nkidnaping, bombing, arson, assault and murder. They have targeted \nhealth clinic employees, judges and other officials. And not only have \nthey attacked and killed doctors, but they have also threatened the \ndoctors' children. These groups have hosted Web sites that post the \nnames, addresses, license plate numbers of doctors and others on hit \nlists and even put up pictures of their targets' family members and \nidentify where their children catch the school bus.\n  Fortunately, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled just last month \nthat targeting specific doctors in this way constitutes an illegal \nthreat, and found those responsible for the Web sites in violation of \nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. I applaud the court's \nruling, and I am pleased that the FACE legislation we passed has helped \nprotect Americans. But we must remain vigilant and continue to take \nappropriate action to prevent extremist groups from terrorizing \nvictims. Their intention is to intimidate and threaten, and sometimes \nthey succeed as some doctors have given up their practice due to the \nemotional stress and constant fear they faced.\n  Dr. Slepian courageously endured threats for over a decade before he \nwas murdered. We must have the courage to condemn the violent \nextremists in the anti-choice movement. Those who kill and commit other \nheinous acts to express their opposition to abortion do so with the \nsupport of many others people who fund their crimes, aid and abet them, \nharbor fugitives. Others help create a climate that encourages this \nviolence through their hateful speech or by remaining silent.\n  We cannot remain silent. We must say loudly and unequivocally that \nmurder is wrong.\n  America is a nation of laws. I believe in following the law. You \nmight not always agree with the law or how it is interpreted. But that \ndoes not entitle you to willfully violate it without \nconsequences. America instead offers you an opportunity to seek to \nchange the law through peaceful means.\n\n  We express policy differences civilly through discourse and resolve \nthem through the political process, not through violence. Here in the \nSenate we debate passionately, but in a manner of respect and civility, \nand attempt to persuade others of the merits of our positions.\n  Those who resort to violence are violating not only our laws but our \nAmerican principles and values.\n  We in the Senate must identify them as terrorists. The American \npeople must recognize them as terrorists. And law enforcement officials \nmust treat them as terrorists--for that is what they are.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the role.\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concerns about \nthe concentration of ownership in the radio and concert industry and \nits effect on consumers, artists, local businesses, and ticket prices.\n  I will be introducing legislation to address these concerns in the \ncoming weeks, but wanted to make my colleagues aware of the seismic \nchanges that have taken place in the radio and concert industries \nfollowing the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  During the debate of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, I joined a \nnumber of my colleagues in opposing the deregulation of radio ownership \nrules because of concerns about the impact on consumers, artists, and \nlocal radio stations.\n  Passage of this act was an unfortunate example of the influence of \nsoft money in the political process. As my colleagues will recall, I \nhave consistently said that this act was really in many ways bought and \npaid for by soft money. Everyone was at the table, except for the \nconsumers.\n  In November, we will finally have rid the system of this loophole, \nbut we must repair its damage.\n  In just 5 years since its passage, the effects of the \nTelecommunications Act have been far worse than we imagined. While I \nopposed this act because of its anticonsumer bias, I did not predict \nthat one provision would have caused so much harm to a diverse range of \ninterests.\n  The provision I am referring to is the elimination of the national \nradio ownership caps and relaxation of local ownership caps, which has \ntriggered a wave of consolidation and caused harm to consumers, \nartists, concert goers, local radio station owners, and promoters.\n  To put the changes of the 1996 act in perspective, it is helpful to \ncompare them to other moves towards deregulation of radio ownership \nthat began in 1984.\n  In 1984, there were limitations on the total number of radio stations \nthat one company could own nationally and locally, and how long a \ncompany had to hold a station before being allowed to sell. That year, \nthe ownership regulations were changed to allow one entity to own 12 AM \nstations, 12 FM stations and 12 television stations--an increase from 7 \nto each type a year earlier.\n  The Federal Communications Commission again loosened the ownership \nrequirements in 1992 by allowing one company to own up to two AM and \ntwo FM stations in a specific market, so long as they did not account \nfor more than 25 percent of the total listening audience. The national \nownership limits were also raised to 18 AM and 18 FM stations.\n  This change brings us to the seismic shift that shook up the radio \nand live concert industries across the country--the passage of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act.\n  This legislation did not simply raise the national ownership limits \non radio stations--it eliminated them altogether. It also dramatically \naltered the local radio station ownership limits through the \nimplementation of a tiered ownership system which allowed a company to \nown more radio stations in the larger markets.\n  The highest range was in the largest markets, those with 45 stations \nor more. In those markets, one group could own up to eight stations, \nwith no more than five in either AM or FM. The strictest limit was in \nthe smallest markets with less than 15 stations, where one entity could \nown five stations, but only three in any one service.\n  This change was not beneficial to consumers or local radio station \nowners or broadcasters. It simply led to a number of national super \nradio station corporations that now dominate the marketplace, and \nallegedly engage in anticompetitive business practices.\n  The concentration levels of radio station ownership, both across the \nUnited States and in most local markets, is staggering.\n  In 1996, prior to the passage of the Telecommunications Act, there \nwere 5133 owners of radio stations. Today, for the contemporary hit \nradio/top 40 formats, four radio station groups--Chancellor, Clear \nChannel, Infinity, and Capstar--just four control access to 63 percent \nof the format's 41 million listeners nationwide. For the country music \nformat, the same four groups control access to 56 percent of the \nformat's 28 million listeners.\n  The concentration of ownership is even more startling when we look at \nradio station ownership in local markets.\n  Four radio station companies control nearly 80 percent of the New \nYork Market. Three of these same four companies own nearly 60 percent \nof the market share in Chicago. In my home State of Wisconsin, four \ncompanies own 86 percent of the market share in the Milwaukee radio \nmarket.\n  Let me repeat, four companies control 86 percent.\n  The list continues in almost every market across the United States. \nThe concentration of radio station ownership by a few companies is mind \nboggling, and its effect on consumers, artists and others in the music \nindustry is cause for great concern.\n  Many of the same corporations that own multiple radio stations in a \ngiven market wield their power through their ownership of a number of \nbusinesses related to the music industry. For example, the Clear \nChannel Corporation owns over 1200 radio companies, more than 700,000 \nbillboards, various promotion companies, and venues across the United \nStates. Also, just three years ago, in 1999, Clear Channel bought SFX \nproductions, the Nation's largest promotion company.\n  A national group of organizations, recently joined together to voice \nmany of the same concerns that I have heard from my constituents in \nWisconsin--that the high levels of concentration are hurting the entire \nindustry.\n  This coalition of artists, labor groups, small businesses, and radio \ncompanies recently released a joint statement that expressed a number \nof concerns about the levels of concentration and the anticompetitive \npractices.\n  These concerns included that a corporation that owns radio stations, \npromotion companies and venues has a conflict of interest in terms of \npromoting its own concerts and tours on its radio stations over those \nof any competition.\n  They are also concerned about a corporation's interest in limiting \nthe promotional support of bands and artists that are performing for \nother companies, performing at other venues or sponsored by other \nstations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint statement by this \ngroup be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. After I began looking into the consolidation trends, I \nwas taken aback by the diverse range of people that expressed concerns \nabout the effects of concentration and consolidation. Concert goers \ntalk all the time about higher ticket prices.\n  Broadcasters, artists, and others in Wisconsin and across the country \nhave told me about reduced diversity and local input in the music \nindustry. And local businesses have spoken about anticompetitive \nbehaviors that have put them on an unfair playing field.\n  Following the passage of the Telecommunications Act, and the \nresulting vertical concentration, a number of trends have emerged. \nTicket prices have gone through the roof, during the same period in \nwhich a few companies consolidated ownership of radio stations, \npromotion companies, venues, and advertising.\n  This chart compares ticket prices during the period of consolidation \nfollowing the 1996 act with the preceding 5 year blocks of time. Before \nthe passage of the 1996 act, ticket prices rose slightly faster than \nthe Consumer Price Index.\n  For example, from 1991 to 1996, concert ticket prices grew by about \n21 percent, compared to the consumer price index increase of about 15 \npercent. Following the Telecommunications Act of\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n1996, however, ticket prices have increased almost 50--50--percentage \npoints more than the Consumer Price Index. From 1996 to 2001, concert \nticket prices grew by more than 61 percent, while the Consumer Price \nIndex increased by only 13 percent.\n  Ticket prices have gone up by nearly 50 percentage points more than \nconsumer prices since passage of the Telecommunications Act, and that \ndoesn't even include the facility fees, parking charges, box office \ncharges, or food and beverage increases.\n  I think we have to look into allegations that consolidation in the \nradio industry has triggered anticompetitive practices and raised \nticket prices.\n  A broad coalition, including the American Federal of Television and \nRadio Artists, has also expressed concerns that consolidation in the \nradio industry has led to reduced diversity and competition in local \nmarkets.\n  As corporations buy stations in the same market, they combine \nnewsrooms and reporters and share playlists and radio personalities--\nall with the same effect: less choice in music and less information for \nconsumers.\n  Radio airwaves are public property. Unlike other business ventures, \nradio stations have acquired their distribution mechanisms--the \nairways--without any expenditure of capital. They were given access to \nthe broadcast spectrum by the Government for free.\n  Since 1943, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission have \ntried to ensure that this medium serves the public good, but limiting \naccess to information and diversity on the radio does not achieve this.\n  I have also heard concerns from artists and radio stations about how \nthe vertically concentrated radio corporations leverage their market-\npower to shake down the music industry in exchange for playing their \nmusic.\n  As my colleagues are aware, payola--the practice of paying money to \nget music played--has been prohibited under Federal law since the \n1960s. I have heard a number of concerns, however, about the alleged \ntendency of some owners of multiple radio stations to shake down the \nmusic industry.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I will ask a question.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent morning business be extended \nuntil the Senator from Wisconsin finishes his statement, which should \nbe a couple, 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have a question for my friend.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from Wisconsin. I think maybe \nthere is one thing these people who own all this stuff have missed, and \nthat is the parking lots. They own about everything else.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am not certain they missed that.\n  Mr. REID. You have not mentioned that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am still checking into all the different aspects.\n  Mr. REID. To go to a concert, you need a place to park, right?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am sure they will get to it if they haven't.\n  They are able to achieve this shakedown, it is said, by establishing \nexclusive agreements with independent promoters that collect a fee in \nexchange for access to the airwaves.\n  I am very troubled by these allegations. If true, they mean that \nartists that can't, or don't, pay these independent promoters will not \nbe able to get access to the airwaves. Artists should not be required \nto pay for access to the airwaves. I am continuing to investigate these \nallegations of a new shakedown, but if they are true, this practice \nshould be prohibited.\n  Finally, I am deeply disturbed about concerns that have been voiced \nby individuals and local businesses--promoters, radio station owners, \nand artists--that have been forced out of the business or have been put \non an unfair playing field as a result of the concentration of market \npower caused by the deregulation of the 1996 act.\n  These are local promoters and businesses who have succeeded through \neconomic downturns, recessions and many other challenging times. But \nwhen placed on an unfair playing field, they are being pushed out of \nthe market.\n  Radio is a public medium and we must ensure that it serves the public \ngood. The concentration of ownership, both in radio and the other \nfacets of the concert industry, has caused great harm to people and \nbusinesses that have been involved and concerned about the radio and \nconcert industry for generations.\n  It also harms the flow of creativity and ideas that artists seek to \ncontribute to our society. This concentration does a disservice to our \nsociety at every level of the industry, and it must be addressed.\n  This is about the very freedom of radio as a medium. Radio is one of \nthe most important media we have for exchanging ideas and expressing \nour creativity. But that free exchange of ideas often isn't free \nanymore--if you want to get played, often it's going to cost you. And \nif you can't afford it, then you might not get heard at all.\n  Being able to hear a variety of voices is fundamental to a free \nsociety. Concentration in the radio industry is diminishing the number \nof voices that get heard. And that risks diminishing our freedom.\n  It isn't just about who is talented, and who deserves to be played. \nIt is about a shakedown, and that is just unacceptable for the \nindustry, for the artist, and for all of us who listen.\n  While we took a step forward in reforming the campaign finance system \nearlier this year, we must fix the problems that the soft money \nloophole caused--including the gaping flaws of the Telecommunications \nAct that have hurt competition in the radio and concert industries.\n  In the coming weeks, I will be introducing legislation to address the \nconcerns about concentration and anticompetitive practices that have \nresulted from the Telecommunications Act. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I just want to alert my colleagues to this trend, and \nwe will introduce legislation to deal with it. I am convinced the \ncomplaints I have heard from such a wide variety of Wisconsinites are \nthe same concerns being raised in all the States in this country, and I \nlook forward to submitting a proposal and a bill to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n        Joint Statement on Current Issues in Radio, May 24, 2002\n\n       We are a diverse coalition representing performing artist \n     groups, labor, record labels, merchandisers, songwriters, \n     community broadcasters, consumers and citizens advocates. We \n     urge the government to revise the payola laws to cover \n     independent promotion to radio, to investigate the impact of \n     radio consolidation on the music community and citizens and \n     to work to protect non-commercial space on both the \n     terrestrial radio bandwidth and the emerging webcasting \n     models.\n       Radio is a public asset, not private property. Since 1934, \n     the federal government, through the Federal Communications \n     Commission, has overseen the regulation and protection of \n     this public asset to create a communications medium that \n     serves the public interest. Unlike other businesses, radio \n     stations have acquired their distribution mechanism--the \n     airwaves--without any expenditure of capital. The public owns \n     the airwaves. Owners of broadcast stations were given access \n     to the broadcast spectrum by the government for free. The \n     quid pro quo for free use of the public bandwidth requires \n     that broadcast stations serve the public interest in their \n     local communities.\n       However, it has become clear that both recording artists \n     and citizens are negatively impacted by legislation, \n     regulatory interpretations and by a number of standardized \n     industry practices that fail to serve the public interest. We \n     call on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \n     undertake a comprehensive review of the following aspects of \n     the radio industry that are anti-artist, anti-competition and \n     anti-consumer. Further, we call on Congress to be vigilant in \n     their oversight of the FCC to ensure the public interest is \n     being upheld in regards to radio.\n       Specifically:\n       1. We request that payments made to radio stations which \n     are designed to influence playlists (other than legitimate \n     and reasonable promotional expenses) be prohibited, unless \n     such payments are announced over the air, even when such \n     intent is subtle and disguised. This includes payments made \n     through independent radio promoters.\n       2. We request an investigation of the impact of recent \n     unprecedented increases in radio ownership consolidation on \n     citizens and the music community.\n       3. We request an examination of the way vertical \n     integration of ownership in broadcasting, concert promotion \n     companies and venues decreases fair market competition for \n     artists, clubs and promotion companies.\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\n       4. We request that policies that protect non-commercial \n     space in the radio bandwidth and in the emerging webcasting \n     models be enacted, securing the benefits of programming \n     diversity for the music community and citizens.\n\n\n                               background\n\n              Pay for Play and Independent Radio Promotion\n\n       Payola--the practice of paying money to people in exchange \n     for playing a particular piece of music--has a long history \n     in the music industry. The practice didn't garner much public \n     attention until the late 1950s and 1960s when rock and roll \n     disc jockeys became powerful gatekeepers who determined what \n     music the public heard. Federal laws were passed starting in \n     the 1960s that forbid the direct payment or compensation of \n     disc jockeys or other radio staff in exchange for the playing \n     of certain records unless such payments were announced over \n     the air.\n       The various laws and hearings from the 1960s-1970s muted \n     the prominence of payola for a while. However, payola-like \n     practices eventually resurfaced, but in a more indirect form. \n     Standardized business practices now employed by many \n     broadcasters and independent radio promoters result in what \n     we consider a de facto form of payola. Often, in an effort to \n     stay within the law, the payment is characterized as, for \n     example, payment to receive first notice of the station's \n     playlist ``adds.''\n       The new payola-like practices take two primary forms. Radio \n     consolidation has created the first type. Radio station group \n     owners establish exclusive arrangements with ``independent \n     promoters,'' who then guarantee a fixed annual or monthly sum \n     of money to the radio station group or individual station. In \n     exchange for this payment, the radio station group agrees to \n     give the independent promoter first notice of new songs added \n     to its playlists each week. Stations in the group also tend \n     to play mostly records that have been suggested by the \n     independent promoter. As a result of the standardization of \n     this practice, record companies and artists generally must \n     pay the radio stations' independent promoters if they want to \n     be considered for airplay on those stations.\n       The second payola-like practice occurs after the music \n     labels hire an ``independent radio promoter'' to legitimately \n     promote their records to specific stations for a fee. \n     Reportedly, certain indie promoters use the labels' money to \n     pay the stations for playing songs on the air.\n       These practices result in ``bottom line'' programming \n     decisions where questions of artistic merit and community \n     responsiveness take a back seat to the desire of broadcasters \n     to gain additional revenue. As a result, many new and \n     independent artists, as well as many established artists, are \n     denied valuable radio airplay they would receive if \n     programming decisions were more objective. Furthermore, \n     whatever form the pay-for-play takes, these ``promotion'' \n     costs are often shared by the artists and adversely impact \n     the ability of recording artists to succeed financially.\n       To protect the public interest, we request the payola \n     prohibition be revised by the FCC so that it cannot be \n     circumvented by any entity via the use of independent \n     promoters. If the music played on the radio has less to do \n     with the quality of the song than the economics of the \n     business arrangement, how does this serve the needs of \n     citizens? Also, when payments are not announced, isn't the \n     public misled into thinking that the station chooses which \n     songs to broadcast based on merit?\n\n              Impact of Widespread Industry Consolidation\n\n       The federal government must also examine the impact of \n     loosened ownership caps on the listening public. Until 1996, \n     the Federal Communications Commission regulated ownership of \n     broadcast stations so any company could own no more than two \n     radio stations in any one market and no more than 40 \n     nationwide. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act \n     of 1996, the restrictions government ownership of radio \n     stations evaporated. Now, radio groups own numerous stations \n     around the country and exercise unreasonable control over the \n     airwaves. For example, in 1996, there were 5133 owners of \n     radio stations. Today, for the Contemporary Hit Radio/Top 40 \n     formats, only four radio station groups--Chancellor, Clear \n     Channel, Infinity and Capstar--control access to 63 percent \n     of the format's 41 million listeners nationwide. For the \n     country format, the same four groups control access to 56 \n     percent of the format's 28 million listeners.\n       This consolidation has led to a new dynamic in the music \n     industry. Radio station groups have centralized their \n     decision-making about playlists and which new songs to add to \n     the playlist. These centralized playlists have reduced the \n     local flavor and limited the diversity of music played on \n     radio. Due to their sheer market power, radio station groups \n     now have the ability to make or break a hit song.\n       With the increased leverage resulting from ownership \n     consolidation, at least one group owner is considering \n     charging labels for merely identifying the name of the artist \n     and song played. The CEO of Clear Channel told the Los \n     Angeles Times that it might sell song identification as a \n     form of advertising. This miserly practice would harm the \n     music community and citizens, as it would make it difficult \n     for radio listeners to identify new artists and purchase \n     music. Once again, this practice would impact the ability of \n     new and independent artists to succeed.\n       We request that the FCC investigate consolidation of radio \n     ownership focusing on the public interest which radio \n     stations are supposed to serve. This investigation should \n     look at the difficulties small independent broadcasters face \n     when going up against large and powerful radio station groups \n     in a specific market. It should study the role that national \n     playlist decisions have had on the skyrocketing cost of radio \n     promotion. It should also take into account the impact of \n     reduced staffing levels on members of local stations and the \n     reduction of classical, jazz, bluegrass and other formats \n     from the airwaves.\n\n                  Vertical Integration of Radio Owners\n\n       Many radio groups are also vertically integrated companies \n     increasing their already substantial leverage and control. \n     For example, Clear Channel, a company that owns over 1200 \n     radio stations, also owns tens of thousands of billboards, \n     and various promotion companies and venues. In 1999 Clear \n     Channel purchased SFX Entertainment, the nation's most \n     powerful concert promoter. This gave Clear Channel control of \n     the concert promotion industry in most of the key regions of \n     the US virtually overnight. Clear Channel therefore has a \n     direct economic interest in promoting its own concerts and \n     tours on its numerous radio stations over those of the \n     competition. It also has an interest in limiting the \n     promotional support of bands and artists who are performing \n     for other companies, at other venues or who are sponsored by \n     other stations.\n       Some of the remaining independent concert promoters have \n     alleged that Clear Channel is engaging in anti-competitive \n     behavior by using this leverage to force smaller companies \n     out of business. In particular, the mid-size promoter NIPP in \n     Denver brought suit against Clear Channel in 2001, alleging \n     that Clear Channel--which owns all three rock stations in the \n     Denver area--was not running the ads that NIPP paid for on \n     its stations to promote last year's NIPP-promoted Warped \n     Tour. There have been other allegations from bands and \n     performers--mostly off-the-record for fear of retaliation--\n     who have stated that radio station groups have pressured them \n     into playing shows for free in exchange for airplay, or who \n     have had their songs removed from playlists for playing non-\n     exclusive venues.\n       We would like to see the FCC investigate whether an \n     artist's choice to play or not to play in Clear Channel \n     venues or to use or not to use Clear Channel's promotion \n     company impacts the artist's positions on or removal from \n     Clear Channel playlists.\n\n                            Community Radio\n\n       Rampant consolidation of commercial radio and increased \n     budgetary pressures felt by non-commercial stations have led \n     to a reduction in radio play for musical genres like \n     classical, jazz, opera and bluegrass. Congress needs to \n     reevaluate the current status of non-commercial radio, \n     including exploring new strategies for sustaining existing \n     community radio stations and moving forward with full \n     implementation of community-based Low Power FM radio. After \n     an intense lobbying campaign by the National Association of \n     Broadcasters and NPR, the FCC's Low Power FM plan was scaled \n     back significantly via an Appropriations rider in 2000. The \n     FCC is currently following Congress' request for additional \n     testing of the impact of these tiny stations on existing \n     broadcasters. Once the FCC report is submitted to Congress, \n     Congress must move forward by passing legislation to \n     authorize the FCC to license these stations in urban areas. \n     If consolidation in the radio environment has stifled \n     competition and reduced diversity of programming, low power \n     radio can begin to address the lack of community-based \n     programming.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We are deeply concerned about payola and payola-like \n     practices, as well as the problems caused by radio station \n     ownership consolidation, and the vertical iintegration of \n     station ownership with venue ownership and concert promoters. \n     New rules must be written by the FCC to prohibit payments to \n     radio stations from ``independent promoters'' unless such \n     payments are announced. The FCC must seriously evaluate \n     whether a radio station is even satisfying the current \n     license requirement that sponsorship identification or \n     disclosure must accompany any material that is broadcast in \n     exchange for money, service, or anything else of value paid \n     to a station, either directly or indirectly. The FCC should \n     also consider whether radio stations are serving the public \n     interest by contributing to localism, and independence in \n     broadcasting. Finally, Congress must be vigilant in ensuring \n     that the FCC is upholding the public interest in all of these \n     matters.\n       Respectfully submitted by the following organizations:\n       American Federation of Musicians (AFM), American Federation \n     of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), Association for \n     Independent Music (AFIM), Future of Music Coalition (FMC), \n     Just Plain Folks, Nashville Songwriters Association \n     International (NSAI), National Association of Recording \n     Merchandisers (NARM), National Federation of Community \n     Broadcasters (NFCB), Recording Academy, Recording Industry \n     Association of America (RIAA).\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5472-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2600, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2600) to ensure the continued financial capacity \n     of insurers to provide coverage for risks from terrorism.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to shortly yield to my colleague, the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, for an opening statement he may wish \nto make on this bill.\n  Mr. President, just for the order of business, we will probably take \na few minutes with some opening statements this morning on the bill, \nalthough I think over the months there has been a lot of knowledge \nabout what is involved. I know the Presiding Officer has an amendment \nand is interested in the subject matter. I think Senator Kyl may have \nan amendment he wants to offer fairly soon. Senator Gramm from Texas, \nobviously, is very familiar with the bill.\n  My hope is that colleagues who have amendments would, first of all, \nlet us know what their amendments are. That would be helpful. I do know \nwhat many of them are already. There may be others. So I would ask \nstaffs of Members of both parties if they would get to the ranking \nmember or the manager of the bill the amendments from both sides so \neveryone has an idea what we are looking at over today and possibly \ntomorrow and/or however long it takes to get this done.\n  My hope is they would be relevant amendments, that we would stick \nwith the subject matter at hand rather than using this vehicle to bring \nup extraneous matters.\n  With that said, let me turn to the chairman of the full committee. I \nthank him. I will make a longer statement in a few minutes myself. But \nI certainly thank the majority leader, Senator Daschle. I want to thank \nthe minority leader. Senator Gramm has been deeply involved.\n  Certainly the chairman of the committee, Senator Sarbanes, has been \ninvolved in this issue from the very beginning. Going back to last \nfall, when we tried to sort this out, he made a Herculean effort to \nbring it together. When we do these things, it becomes difficult \nbecause we get 97 other people, as I mentioned yesterday, who all have \nsomething they want to add to the discussion and debate. As a result of \nthat, a good effort did not work out as well as we wanted initially, \nbut I think a better effort may prevail as a result of more people \nbeing involved.\n\n  So while we have lost some time, I think the product we are putting \nbefore the Senate today is actually a stronger proposal.\n  With that, I will turn to my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Maryland yield to the Senator from \nNevada to make a brief statement?\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, on behalf of Senator Daschle, alert \neveryone, as Senator Dodd has done, that we want to have ample \nopportunity for everyone to offer any relevant amendments. We think it \nis very important that if people believe this bill isn't what it should \nbe, they have an opportunity to make it better. But I hope that \neveryone understands we are not going to wait forever to move on \ncloture if it appears people are stalling, trying to kill the bill, \nthrough amendment or otherwise.\n  There will be ample time for amendments, I repeat. But we are not \ngoing to stand around here for hours at a time in wasteful time. We \nhave so much to do.\n  The last week before the July recess we have to spend on the Defense \nauthorization bill. We have to do that. And that leaves next week to \ncomplete everything else that needs to be done.\n  So I say to everyone, if they have amendments, come over and offer \nthem. Senator Sarbanes and Senator Dodd have worked on this legislation \nfor months. We almost had it done before Christmas of last year. \nSenator Dodd and I have offered numerous unanimous consent requests so \nwe could move forward on this more quickly.\n  So I repeat, for the third time, as I did when the Senate opened this \nmorning, we want to have a bill that comes out of the Senate, and we \nare going to get one, one way or the other. We hope it would be done \nwith people cooperating, trying to improve the legislation; when they \noffer an amendment, and it does not pass, or it is tabled, that they do \nnot start crying and say: Well, I am going to kill the bill then.\n  This legislative process is what it is. This legislation is \nimportant. We are going to do everything we can to move it \nexpeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Dodd, \nfor his leadership on this very important issue. I have joined with him \nin cosponsoring the legislation he has introduced, S. 2600, which is \nnow before the body. I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Reid for \nmoving the Senate to this issue, and we appreciate the willingness of \nthe other side of the aisle to cooperate in that endeavor.\n  This bill is now open to amendment, and we hope as we move forward \ntoday, in short order, that those who have amendments will be offering \nthem and that we will be able to consider them as we address the \nimportant issue contained in the legislation.\n  This legislation is designed to ensure the continued financial \ncapacity of insurers to provide coverage for risks from terrorism. It \nobviously stems from the attacks of September 11 which raised a very \nlarge question about the future availability of property and casualty \ninsurance for terrorism risk.\n  Shortly after those attacks, the administration, interacting with the \nCongress, put forward certain ideas for addressing this issue, and \nthere has been an effort to try to deal with this issue over the \nintervening months. It is a difficult and complex question. A number of \nquestions have been raised with respect to it. Hearings have been held \nby more than one committee in the Congress on both the House and the \nSenate side. The Banking Committee held hearings in late October in \nwhich the witnesses who appeared acknowledged the need for legislation \nand agreed that the future availability and affordability of terrorism \ninsurance would be placed in jeopardy absent congressional action.\n  Many have outlined the potential negative consequences for the U.S. \neconomy from the financial instability which would arise if terrorism \ninsurance were not available.\n\n  That view is reflected in the congressional findings on which the \nTerrorism Insurance Act rests. Let me quote briefly from those \nfindings. It is very important to lay the basis as to why we are trying \nto move this legislation. I quote:\n\n       Widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     including the absence of information from which financial \n     institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the \n     probability and the cost of future terrorist events and, \n     therefore, the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of \n     loss caused by such acts of terrorism.\n       A decision by property and casualty insurers to deal with \n     such uncertainties, either by terminating property and \n     casualty coverage for losses arising from terrorist events or \n     by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for \n     risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could \n     seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property \n     acquisition, and other business projects, and generate a \n     dramatic increase in rents and otherwise suppress economic \n     activity.\n\n  The findings go on to say:\n\n       The United States Government should provide temporary \n     financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to \n     the stabilization of the U.S. economy in a time of national \n     crisis, while the financial services industry develops the \n     systems, mechanisms, products, and programs necessary to \n     create a viable financial services market for private \n     terrorism risk insurance.\n\n  That basically sets out the problem we are trying to address with \nthis legislation.\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n  There is recent evidence that property and casualty insurers are \nexcluding terrorism coverage from the policies they write. The U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office recently analyzed the terrorism insurance \nmarket and found that, and I quote:\n\n       . . . some sectors of the economy--notably real estate and \n     commercial lending--are beginning to experience difficulties \n     because some properties and businesses are unable to find \n     sufficient terrorism coverage, at any price.\n\n  Furthermore, where terrorism insurance is available, it is often \nexpensive and significantly limited in both the amount and the scope of \nthe coverage.\n  The consequence of all of this is that you have a number of \nproperties currently either uninsured or underinsured. And the \npotential consequences of this situation, if left unaddressed, are \ncause for serious concern. That is why we are here today.\n  In the event of another attack, a widespread lack of insurance \ncoverage could hinder recovery efforts as property owners struggle to \nmeet the costs of rebuilding without the support of insurance. As the \nGAO noted, property owners ``lack the ability to spread such risks \namong themselves the way insurers do,'' and, as a result, I am quoting \nthe GAO:\n\n       . . . another terrorist attack similar to that experienced \n     on September 11th could have significant economic effects on \n     the marketplace and the public at large. These effects could \n     include bankruptcies, layoffs, and loan defaults.\n\n  The GAO also found that even in the absence of further terrorist \nactivity, even in the absence of it, inadequate insurance coverage \ncould have an adverse effect on the willingness of lenders to finance \nnew construction projects as well as the sale of existing property. \nAlready the GAO found:\n\n       [s]ome examples of large projects canceling or experiencing \n     delays have surfaced with a lack of terrorism coverage being \n     cited as a principal contributing factor.\n\n  The GAO concluded that ``the resulting economic drag could slow \neconomic recovery and growth,'' even if the terrorist attack does not \nmaterialize.\n  So we have a problem either way. If the terrorist attack should \nmaterialize, the lack of coverage would markedly hinder recovery \nefforts. But even if it doesn't, you have an economic drag taking place \nbecause of the unwillingness of lenders to finance new construction \nprojects as well as the sale of existing projects.\n  Most people seem to believe that in time, the insurance industry will \nbe able to underwrite the terrorist risk. But they don't now, at this \npoint, have the experience and the factual basis on which to make those \ncalculations. In the meantime, a short-term Federal backstop for \nterrorism insurance would help to stabilize the marketplace and \nforestall the potential negative consequences which I have just quoted, \nidentified by the GAO.\n  The legislation we have before us, which Senator Dodd has brought to \nthe body, works off of the proposals that were developed by the \nadministration late last year. This Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \nestablishes a shared compensation program that will split the cost of \nproperty and casualty claims from any acts of terrorism during the next \nyear between the Federal Government and the insurance industry.\n  The act would terminate at the end of the year, unless the Treasury \nSecretary determines that the program should be in place for an \nadditional year. So it is, by its very definition, short term. The \npremise of it is that over that period of time the insurance industry \nwill be able to develop the knowledge, the expertise, and the \ncapability to underwrite the terrorist risk. Under this legislation, \nthe definition of an act of terrorism will be uniform across the \ncountry. Insurance companies providing commercial property and casualty \ninsurance are required to participate in the program; voluntary \nparticipation is allowed with respect to personal lines of property and \ncasualty insurance. Participating insurance companies must offer \nterrorism insurance coverage in all of their property and casualty \npolicies for all participating lines. Each participating insurance \ncompany will be responsible for paying a deductible before Federal \nassistance becomes available. So the first dollar will come from the \ninsurance industry.\n  In the first year of the program, the amount of the deductible is \ndetermined by dividing $10 billion among participating insurance \ncompanies based on their market share. If the Secretary calls for a \nsecond year, the deductible will be determined by dividing $15 billion \namong participating insurance companies based on their market share.\n  For losses above the companies' deductibles, but not exceeding $10 \nbillion, the Federal Government will pay 80 percent, and the companies \nwill pay 20 percent. For any portion of total losses that exceeds $10 \nbillion, the Government will cover 90 percent and the companies will \ncover 10 percent.\n  Losses covered by the program will be capped at $100 billion. Above \nthis amount, it will be up to Congress to determine the procedures for \nand the source of any payments.\n  This framework provides to the insurance industry the ability to \ncalculate at the top level what they may have to cover in damage. \nTherefore, it gives them the ability to calculate what the premiums \nought to be and to structure a properly arranged financial system. We \ndo that, of course, by providing that above certain levels the Federal \nGovernment will assume 80 or 90 percent--depending on the figure--of \nthe losses.\n  I think this is a fairly simple program. We have had a lot of complex \nsuggestions made to us--some extremely complex, I may say. I think this \nis pretty straightforward on its face. It is limited in its duration.\n  One of the guiding principles in the bill that I think is important \nis that, to the extent possible, State insurance law should not be \noverridden. We seek to respect the role of the State insurance \ncommissioners as the appropriate regulators of policy terms and rates. \nWe are anxious to try to keep the State insurance commissioners in the \npicture. That is where the responsibility has heretofore been. There is \nnot an effort in this bill to make any radical change in that existing \narrangement.\n  In conclusion, I think the Congress needs to act on this issue. We \nrun the risk of serious damage to our economy. I know there are many \nsteps between now and final enactment of the legislation. We look \nforward to continuing to consult with the administration over this \nmatter, as we have been doing. But, again, I commend Senator Dodd for \nhis extraordinary work in crafting the bill that is before us and \ngetting it before the Senate.\n  Yesterday some reference was made to some of the procedural problems \nthat we encountered on the way to the floor. But through the actions of \nSenator Daschle and the concurrence of Senator Lott, we are here now \nwith the legislation before us, and the Senate now has an opportunity \nto address this very important issue. I hope we will now be able to \nconsider amendments on their merits, dispose of them, and then move to \nfinal action on this legislation.\n\n  Again, I underscore the fine work that Senator Dodd has done on this \nlegislation from the very beginning and, certainly, in bringing us to \nthis point today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland very \nmuch. As I said a few moments ago, but for his involvement as chairman \nof the Banking Committee, we would not have been able to produce this \nproduct. He is an original sponsor, along with Senator Schumer and \nSenator Corzine, of S. 2600. I would like to do this.\n  Bill Nelson, my colleague from Florida, wants to be heard on the \nbill. Senator Schumer is here as well. I gather some others are ready \nto come over to offer the lead amendment. That will be the manner in \nwhich we will probably proceed. I know Senator Schumer has an ongoing \nJudiciary Committee meeting. I want to accommodate Members.\n  I will yield to my colleague from New York, with the indulgence of my \ncolleague from Florida, to allow him to make opening comments, and then \nI will turn to Senator Nelson. I will make comments myself later so \nother Members can go back to the hearings, and then we will deal with \nthe amendment process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut. I \nwill have more to say in a general nature, and I will probably do that \nduring the amendatory process.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  First, I thank our chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator \nSarbanes, as well as Senator Dodd, and he, in particular, for his \nleadership on this issue; it has been second to none.\n  We desperately need this bill. I also thank the White House for their \ninvolvement. They have recognized the problem and have stepped to the \nplate. I recognize Senator Lott, as well as many of my colleagues on \nthe other side who see this as a problem. I will make a couple of brief \npoints.\n  First, this is vitally needed--desperately in my city. We have \nexample after example of projects not being prefinanced, several \ndefaulting, and projects delayed or not undertaken because of the \ninability of people to get terrorism insurance. Lenders will not yield, \nwill not give loans to projects of large economic agglomeration, \nwhether they be in large cities or places such as Disneyland, Disney \nWorld, and Hoover Dam, unless we solve this problem. It has already \nbegun to slow down the economy.\n  As the chairman said, construction workers are being laid off and \nconstruction jobs are declining. This is a sore on the economy. It is \nan open cut. Every day that we don't solve it, more blood comes out of \nthe wound.\n  In my city and in my State, this is essential. Obviously, we were the \nnexus of the terrorist attack on 9-11. Insurance rates are going \nthrough the roof. Some of that is not caused by the lack of terrorism \ninsurance, but some of it is. It is vital that we solve this problem. \nJust the other day we got a call from a developer refinancing an \naverage office tower on Third Avenue, with a $3 million increase in \ninsurance. Another friend owns smaller properties. A third of his \ncashflow will be eaten up by insurance. He will not build or \nrehabilitate another building. So this is an issue of jobs. It is \nvital--vital to America, vital particularly to our large cities, \nincluding New York.\n  I will make one final point, and I will make the balance of my points \nlater. Each of us has other things that we would like to do. Each of us \nmay have our own proposal--a different type of proposal. We could \nprobably come up with a hundred solutions to this problem. I had a \nproposal supported by Secretary O'Neill that would have gone much \nfurther. It would be easy to stand here and say this solution is not \nthe whole solution.\n  If each of us pushes in our own direction, we will get no bill. The \nsame is true for those who wish to make this a test of tort reform. \nPlease, please, I plead with my colleagues, do not have this proposal \nwrecked on the shoals of tort reform as so many other proposals. The \nPatients' Bill of Rights comes to mind. Yes, we can have a fight on \ntort reform. There are strongly held views. It ought not be on this \nbill. It will sink this bill.\n  I argue to my friends, anyone who tries to put the burden of tort \nreform on this proposal, this proposal's shoulders are not broad enough \nto carry that. If you do, you will sink the bill. You will hurt our \neconomy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this is a test in our post 9-11 world: \nCan this body deal in a bipartisan way with complicated issues that are \nvital to our future even if the immediate impact is not seen? That \nrelates to a whole lot of other issues as well. We have to be in a new \nframe of mind. We have to come together. This is crucial legislation, \neven though it is not on the lips of the average American citizen, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I once again thank my colleague from Connecticut for his graciousness \nin yielding me a couple of moments. I will speak at length under the \namendatory process. I thank him for his leadership, as well as our \nchairman and Senator Daschle for bringing this bill to the floor. It is \nat the 11th hour. It is not too late yet. It will be if we do not get \nthis bill done in the next few days.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York.\n  How much time does the Senator from Florida request for general \ncomment on the bill?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes, I would like to make an opening statement \nand have 10, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Why don't I say 10 minutes? The Senator from New Jersey \nwants to be heard. I need to be heard. We have other Members who want \nto be heard. This will keep the process moving. If the Senator gets to \n10 minutes and there is something that has to be said, I will add a few \nmore minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator like me to defer and let the \nSenator from New Jersey proceed? Once I get on a roll, I do not want to \nstop.\n  Mr. DODD. We do not want you to stop. We do not want you on too long \na roll. We want a 10-minute roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I understand the Senator wants to limit my \nroll, and I do not want you to limit my roll.\n  Mr. DODD. That is R-O-L-L, not R-O-L-E.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, something this important should \nnot have a limit of 10 minutes. I accept the good nature of the prime \nsponsor of the bill. Basically, we are here talking about making \ninsurance available and affordable. After September 11, we ended up \nhaving something that was neither: not available nor affordable. As a \nmatter of fact, one only has to look to the front page of the \nWashington Post today. This is chronicling what has happened:\n\n       Insurance rates rise in DC. They soar downtown. Coverage \n     more limited since September 11.\n\n  That is the headline from today's Washington Post. It points out that \nin the downtown area, there is a hiking of rates. One example given by \nthe Washington Post is 160 percent. I can give innumerable examples--\nand I will in the course of this debate--of multiple hundreds of \npercent in rate hikes, and thus that brings us to this point of \nconsidering this legislation.\n  I want the sponsor of the bill, Senator Dodd, to listen. I want to \ndirect something to him so that he knows my good faith.\n  I was sitting in the chair presiding last evening when this matter \nwas brought up. A unanimous consent request was presented. Even though \nI was seated in the chair, in my capacity as a Senator from Florida I \ncould have objected. I did not object because of the good faith he and \nI both have over the issue, that this is an issue that ought to be \nhashed out, it ought to be discussed, it ought to be thoroughly \ndebated, and then the amendatory process can work its will in the \nSenate. It is in that atmosphere of good faith that I go forward.\n  I think the bill offered by the Senator from Connecticut is \nsignificantly flawed, although I think it is a good-faith attempt. It \nis trying to address a problem, and the problem is what we all know of \nSeptember 11. But several things have happened since September 11 in \nthe insurance marketplace. The marketplace has responded. Capital is \nflowing big time into the reinsurance companies, reinsurance being an \ninsurance for insurance companies against catastrophe; in this case, \nthe terrorism risk.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, when we thought this was going to \nbe a problem endemic to the whole country on any kind of commercial \nbuilding or large structure that might be a target of terrorists, what \nwe have found in the 8 or 9 months since is that the marketplace has \nresponded. Reinsurance companies have provided the coverage, and the \ncost of that reinsurance for this kind of catastrophe has been coming \ndown and down as more money has flowed into the reinsurance \nmarketplace. As a result, we do not have to kill a bumble bee with a \nbig stinger with a sledgehammer. Instead of us having a bill that \napplies across the board, what we ought to be doing is rifleshooting \nwhere the problems are.\n  The Senator from New York just stated several examples. Certainly his \nconstituency of Manhattan is a place where they are having difficulty \ngetting insurance for tall buildings. So, too, would be large \nstructures such as a football stadium, a baseball stadium. So, too, \nwould be in my home State major identifiable high-visibility targets, \nsuch as the crowds that go to Disney World, major tourist attractions. \nAirports would clearly be another one, and I can go down the line.\n  That does not mean that every little commercial building, every \nmedium-sized commercial building, every strip mall, every air-\nconditioned mall, in fact, cannot get terrorism insurance, because they \ncan. The marketplace has responded.\n  We are coming to the floor with a bill that is fatally flawed because \nit is\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\noverreaching the problem, and the problem is certain types of buildings \nthat need coverage from terrorism. Let's examine that.\n  What kind of terrorism? Most insurance policies already have an \nexclusion for chemical, biological, and nuclear devastation. So if \nthose insurance policies are not covering chemical, biological, and \nnuclear terrorism, what kinds of terrorism are we talking about that an \ninsurance company would cover? We are talking about the use of \nconventional weapons; what we so horribly learned on September 11, \nwhich is the use of an airplane or the use of explosives as they tried \nto do in the early nineties at the basement of the World Trade Center. \nThose are the things about which we are talking.\n  When one takes the application of conventional explosives and applies \nit to commercial buildings, does the insurance marketplace today \nrespond with the coverage? My contention is, yes, it does. The \ninsurance marketplace is not going to respond to chemical terrorism, \nbiological terrorism, or nuclear terrorism because that is already \nexempted in most policies, with the result that the bill is \noverreaching because of it trying to apply to the whole country when, \nin fact, we have certain structures that are indeed threatened and the \nmarketplace cannot respond to that. That is the first flaw of this \nbill.\n\n  The second flaw of this bill is that it contains no provision to \nprotect consumers from rate gouging. It is not there. I am going to \noffer an amendment later on in the process that will limit the rate \nincreases, that will have the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the insurance commissioners of the 50 States, through \ntheir organization, the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, set a range of where the rates should be. That, by the \nway, is very similar to what the insurance commissioners do in the 50 \nStates on commercial policies. They set a range or a band of where that \ninsurance rate premium ought to be.\n  The problem with terrorism insurance is, the insurance commissioners \nhave difficulty figuring out what ought to be the rates, because the \ntraditional way of determining if a rate is actuarially sound is by \nexperience and by data, and we do not have hardly any experience except \nfor what happened on September 11. Therefore, that is why I am going to \noffer an amendment later on that is going to point out that the best \nway of determining what the rise in rates ought to be to cover the \nterrorism risk would be through the advice to the Secretary of the \nTreasury who is prominent in Senator Dodd's bill as being the place of \nlimiting the rate hikes. The fatal flaw is this bill overreaches and \nthis bill does not have any provision to protect consumers for rate \ngouging.\n  I see the Presiding Officer is starting to twist in the seat as if my \n10-minute time limit is up, which is exactly what I thought was going \nto happen, but I am just getting into my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am going to need to stop----\n  Mr. DODD. I say to the Senator, there are other Members who want to \nbe heard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I do not want to hold up the Senator from New \nJersey. Why don't I stop and I will come back after he finishes his \nstatement.\n  Mr. DODD. Fine. Any Senator can speak for as long as they want. There \nare no limits under this bill. If the Senator wants to talk, go ahead \nand talk. I am trying to move the process along. I know the Senator has \nan amendment he wants to offer on the subject matter itself, so I will \nbe glad to yield to him a few more minutes now if he would like to \nfinish up rather than break the flow of his remarks. I am trying to see \nto it that we do not delay the process any longer than we have to, so \nwe can get to amendments and vote on them and then go on to other \nbusiness.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I assure the Senator, as he knows, I am going \nto be heard on this subject. I have not even started to talk about the \namendment. I will hold that until I actually offer the amendment, but I \ndo not want to hold up the Senator from New Jersey if he needs to go \nback to committee. Why don't I sit down and I will seek recognition \nright after he finishes.\n  Mr. DODD. I must say to my colleague, I am going to be heard on the \nbill itself after he gets finished. Then I presume someone may show up \non the other side. We have not heard from anybody on the other side. We \nhave been dominating the debate, so I caution my colleague that he may \nfind himself waiting a little bit.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that I have another 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  So where are we? Why do we need a bill such as this? I think there is \na legitimate question that the risk of terrorism is something that \nheretofore among insurance companies was not covered. Basically, we \nnever anticipated what happened. Now we have this threat facing us.\n  The Senator's bill, in fact, says that because terrorism is such, as \nwe would say in the South, an odoriferous act or one that is so \nrepugnant, akin to an act of war, that the Federal Government has a \nbasis for stepping in and insuring part of the risk. Thus, the \nSenator's bill, through a process of either an 80/20 split or a 90/10 \nsplit with the higher figure of 80 or 90 percent being picked up by the \nFederal Government of the terrorism risk, thus that is then a \nprotection for insurance companies or it is another means of insuring \nagainst the terrorism risk.\n  I think that is reasonable. I think when we deal with this mass of \nlosses it is very difficult to insure against in certain areas. But if \nwe look at how this vast but strong economy, this free marketplace that \nprovides insurance, and insurance against catastrophe, has responded, \nit has responded for most cases except the ones we have enumerated.\n  Any responsible legislation should explicitly require assurances of \nreasonable premium rates, as we respond to this new kind of risk. That \nis lacking in this bill, and the evidence continues to mount that \ninsurers are unjustifiably increasing the premium prices, and they are \ngoing to continue to do so even with a substantial Government backstop \nthat is being provided in this bill.\n  I, again, call attention to a story in this morning's Washington Post \nwhere it talks about how the insurance rates have gone up in downtown \nWashington. Again, it is not because of the chemical, biological, or \nnuclear threat. The article talks about the ``dirty'' nuclear bomb. \nThat is not going to be covered under these insurance policies. These \ninsurance policies have increased rates presumably to cover the \nterrorism risk only from the conventional kinds of explosives.\n  I have received a note that Senator Corzine has to leave now, so I \nyield to the Senator so he can make his remarks.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague from New Jersey, I thank him for \ncosponsoring the bill. He has been an invaluable asset in putting this \nproposal together. Senator Corzine is a new Member of this body but, as \nall of us in this Chamber know, and his constituents know, he spent a \nvery distinguished career in the area of finance and was the leader of \none of our great leading investment banks in the world and brings a \nwealth of experience and knowledge into any subject matter but \nparticularly ones involving a subject matter as complicated as the \nissue of this bill, terrorism insurance. So I wanted to express \npublicly to him my sincere sense of gratitude for his tireless efforts, \ngoing back many months now, in dealing with this issue. He has very \nvaluable suggestions and input that has contributed to this product. We \nwould not have put together, I think, as good a bill as I think we have \nwithout his input and his involvement. So I wanted to express my \ngratitude to him and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would propose that to accommodate the \nSenator, since he has to leave, we yield some\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\ntime to him with me still retaining the floor so I can finish my \nremarks. I am trying to be accommodating, but I still have not \ncompleted my remarks.\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. With that understanding, I yield to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of S. 2600.\n  Let me begin, by applauding the majority leader and Senator Dodd for \nexerting the necessary leadership, and doing what needed to be done to \nbring this bill to the floor. Now, it is time for all Members of the \nSenate to recognize the urgent need before us, and move to act on this \nbill.\n  The tragic events of September 11 highlighted the enormous exposure \nthat insurance companies would face in the event of future terrorist \nattacks.\n  In this time, when we receive different terrorist alerts almost \nweekly, and we are faced with the uncertain nature of future attacks, \nmany insurers and reinsurance firms have concluded that terrorism is no \nlonger an insurable risk.\n  As a result, late last year, many insurers announced that they would \nno longer provide coverage for terrorism-related losses. Without access \nto reinsurance coverage, primary insurance companies now find \nthemselves subject to the full exposure of terrorism risk.\n  This issue is not new. Many of us first learned about them in October \nof last year. And it left many concerned. While we all knew that it \nwould be impossible to predict the true impact of the lack of terrorism \ninsurance on our Nation's economy, there was overwhelming agreement \namong scholars, economists, and participants in our economy--that this \nissue had the potential to pose real problems in some economic sectors.\n  The threat that loomed led to hearings in the Senate Banking \nCommittee, and it fueled discussion among Members in the Senate about \nhow to best craft a solution before the end of last year when 70 \npercent of reinsurance contracts were up for renewal.\n  There was considerable debate about how, and what, that response \nshould be. We debated the proper role of the Federal Government in \nensuring that commercial insurers could provide terrorism insurance, \nknowing that their ability to cede some of that risk to reinsurers had \nall but vanished.\n  Many Members of this body, people like Senator Dodd, Senator \nSarbanes, Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Hollings, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Enzi, Senator Nelson of Florida and myself put forth ideas on \nhow to accomplish that.\n  And let's be clear, there was a great deal of difference in the ways \nmembers thought we should approach this problem. But behind those \ndifferences, there was a singular purpose to solve the problem.\n  I think we all were determined not to engage in partisan politics or \nto undermine a possible solution by promoting pet policy priorities. \nEveryone I just mentioned didn't agree on every aspect of the product \nthat was eventually produced. I certainly didn't.\n  But, ultimately, everyone agreed that we should act to bring a \nproposal to the floor, with an expectation that amendments would be \noffered, including amendments that dealt with tort and liability \nissues.\n  The proposal that was presented late last year--late last year was \nnot simply the result of a bunch of Democrats getting in a room and \nsaying ``Voila.'' It was the result of serious discussion and \nnegotiations between Democrats and Republicans and there was \nconsiderable input from the State insurance commissioners, this \nadministration and the Treasury Department.\n  In fact, the Federal backstop provisions of this bill had more than \ninput of these folks it had their support. The bill we are debating \ntoday is that same proposal.\n  Now we have an opportunity to respond to this growing emergency.\n  If we fail to act, or if this bill becomes stalled by those seeking \nto pile their pet policy priorities onto a measure that at its core \nseeks to provide relief to American businesses, then our economy will \nbe harmed.\n  Every day that passes without our action, leaves American businesses, \ndevelopment projects, workers and vital infrastructure exposed to \npotentially devastating losses, and that's a real threat to our \neconomic recovery.\n  In fact, the lack of terrorism insurance coverage has already begun \nto create a drag on commercial lending and business activity. In April, \nthe Federal Reserve Board surveyed commercial loan officers regarding \ntheir recent lending activity and terrorism insurance. The responses \nare troubling to say the least.\n  The report indicated that 55 percent of banks had not received \napplications to finance ``high profile or heavy traffic commercial real \nestate properties.'' In fact, two national lenders have completely \nstopped making loans to these types of properties--GMAC Commercial \nHolding and Mutual of Omaha--altogether.\n  The report also states that 20 percent of banks reported weaker \ndemand for new commercial real estate financing. And while not \nreferenced specifically in the Fed report, we know that some existing \ncommercial borrowers may be in technical default on loan covenants \nbecause they lack terrorism coverage.\n  Each of these elements reflects the economic threats that are posed \nby the lack of affordable, comprehensive terror insurance coverage. The \nthreat that accompanies the decrease in commercial lending and \nsubsequently to development translates to one thing the loss of jobs.\n  But there is more. The lack of terrorism insurance coverage is also \naffecting our securities and our bond markets.\n  According to the Bond Market Association, to date, $7 billion worth \nof commercial real-estate loan activity has already been suspended or \ncancelled due to problems related to terrorism insurance, that is 10 \npercent of the commercial-mortgage-backed-securities (CMBS) market.\n  And overall, CMBS activity is down a staggering 26 percent in the \nfirst quarter of this year. That level of decline in commercial \ninvestment activity is disturbing to think of when you consider that \nthat sector was one of the ones that remained strong throughout last \nyears' recession.\n  And there is even more to illustrate the there is an economic \nconsequence that accompanies our failure to act on this issue.\n  Last month, Moody's Investors Service issued an opinion indicating \nthat it is preparing to downgrade billions of dollars of debt of large \nloan transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities, particularly \non high-risk and ``trophy'' properties in the near future if we fail to \npass this legislation.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries reports that ``there is a \nreluctance to finance [development] projects of $100 million or more, \nand some investors are reluctant to buy bonds tied to individual office \ntowers, apartment building and shopping malls.''\n  And a report issued last month by the Joint Economic Committee offers \ndata illustrating the economic drag that higher insurance costs, for \nterrorism and non-terrorism related coverage, is having on American \nbusiness. The report calls these factors ``a one-two punch'' that is \nproving harmful to America's economy.\n  That report cites data from the Commercial Insurance Market Index, \nwhich indicates that premiums for commercial insurance policies have \nincreased by 30 percent in first quarter of this year. And those \nincreased costs are in addition to the increased costs of obtaining \nterrorism insurance, a real cost burden to our businesses.\n  The report cites the example of a building in my state, New Jersey, \nwhich prior to 9/11 had an $80 million insurance policy that included \nterrorism coverage at a cost of $60,000. The new policy for that \nbuilding has a premium of $400,000 for property-casualty insurance and \nanother $400,000 just for terrorism insurance.\n  That's a dramatic increase for the same coverage. And that building's \nlucky at least they got fairly comprehensive coverage. Many others find \nthemselves facing similar cost increases for half the coverage.\n  In either case, these costs undermine productivity and any growth or \ninvestment opportunities that the owners could possibly take on. And it \nis nationwide trend.\n  I want to reiterate that point. Because this is more than a \nNortheast, an\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\nurban, or a ``big city'' issue. The inability of business and \norganizations to obtain terrorism insurance coverage is truly a \nnational problem.\n  Consider this:\n  In Cleveland, the insurer for the Cleveland Municipal School District \nhas notified the district that its new policy will exclude losses due \nto terrorism.\n  In Seattle, the Seattle Mariners baseball team had difficulty \nsecuring $1 million in terrorism insurance coverage for their $517 \nmillion stadium.\n  The St. Louis Art Museum's insurer informed that museum that it would \nno longer be covered for terrorism losses. That could well prevent \ntouring shows, and undermine tourism in that city.\n  And a collection of Midwestern airports reported that their aviation \nliability premium increased close to 300 percent post 9/11 and those \npolicies excluded terrorism losses.\n  Last year, when this issue first surfaced, we tried to move a bill \nforward, but that process didn't take hold. Many members believed this \nissue wasn't a problem for them that it wasn't in their back yards.\n  We know better than that now. At least I hope we all do.\n  The impact of the lack of terrorism insurance is being felt in cities \nand towns all throughout America. And so I say to all my colleagues \nthis is an issue that affects your state and your constituents.\n  If there's a port in your state, your affected. If there's a bridge \nor a tunnel in your state, you are affected. If you have an airport or \nrailway system in your state, you are affected. If you've got an NFL, \nNBA, NHL or Major League Baseball stadium or arena in your State, \nyou're affected. If you've got a college football stadium in your \nState, where tens of thousands of people gather on Saturdays to root \nfor their team and sing their alma mater, you're affected.\n  It is time to stop the stalling, stop the games and time for us to \npass an interim federal backstop to ensure against future acts of \nterrorism.\n  It is time for us to pass this bill, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his efforts and persistence \nin this endeavor. I look forward to helping him as this process goes \nforward.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Florida for being generous and \nrespectful, giving me the opportunity to present my remarks.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course, the Senator from New Jersey is one \nof the great new bright lights of this body. What a privilege it is for \nme to serve with him. What a privilege it is to have the value of his \nopinion.\n  I agree with everything he said. Now the question is, how do we get \nfrom here to there, to protect everybody and protect the consumer as \nwell from being gouged with the price hikes, because even though the \npeople who pay these premiums in fact are the owners of these large \ncommercial structures, guess what happens when they have to pay the \nincrease of a premium hike. That is passed on to the consumers.\n  That is the case I am making, that we have to have this insurance \navailable--and we are in large part doing that by the mechanism of this \nbill, so the Federal Government provides the insurance for the risk to \nthe tune of 80 percent or 90 percent. But in the process of what we are \ngoing to charge for the portion that is covered by the insurance \ncompany, that is going to be passed on to the consumers.\n  Ultimately, I will offer an amendment that will call for a range, as \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, as to what can be charged, \nwhere that premium, going into an insurance company, will be separated \nfor accounting purposes, it will be segregated, so it will not be mixed \nup with all the other premiums for a slip and fall and dog bites and \nall kinds of liabilities. It will be separate, so it will be under the \nglare of the full light of day as to how much premium is there, and \ntherefore the Secretary of the Treasury, with the advice of the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, can determine what is \na range--not a specific amount, but what is a range that is fair and \naffordable. That is the place I am going.\n  The only effective way to guarantee that the rates will be stabilized \nunder this circumstance is to federally regulate the premium rate for \nthe risk of terrorism. Why Federal? Because the 50 insurance \ncommissioners do not have the data to do this. And the Federal \nGovernment is picking up the biggest part of the risk under this bill. \nRemember, it is only the risk, basically, from conventional kinds of \nterrorism because chemical, biological, and nuclear terrorism is exempt \nfrom most commercial insurance policies. So that is not a risk we are \ngoing to be protecting.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is in the best position to consult with \nthe actuaries and to determine the actual financial risk insurers would \nassume under the bill. If the Congress commits billions of taxpayer \ndollars and mandates no real rate protection, we will have shirked our \nresponsibility to the taxpayers and to the consumers.\n  We gnash our teeth around here on politically charged issues such as \nraising taxes. Let me tell you, as an insurance commissioner for 6 \nyears, there is an issue that is more explosive to the consuming public \nthan the raising of taxes, and that is the raising of their insurance \npremiums.\n  So I call to the attention of the Senate that as you consider a bill \nsuch as this that has no mechanism by which to stop those rate hikes, \nyou had better think twice, and hopefully you will think very favorably \nabout the amendment I will be offering later on.\n  We can only rely on the States to monitor rates. State insurance \ncommissioners traditionally do that. That has been carved out under \nFederal law as a regulation of insurance reserved to the States. State \ninsurance commissioners in fact, however, do not have the data nor do \nthey have the experience of the data with which to be able to judge \nthese rates. On the contrary, in some States they do not regulate the \nrates of commercial policies at all. In other States, such as my State \nof Florida, the State of Florida Department of Insurance sets a range \nof the commercial policies' rates, as to what they may be, without the \napproval of the Department of Insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will conclude my opening remarks. I look \nforward to the debate. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nbringing this important legislation to the floor. I thank the Senate \nfor this opportunity to be heard on a most important issue, important \nnot only to the businesses of this country but to the consumers of this \ncountry as well.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act.\n  The September 11 tragedy has affected our Nation in innumerable ways. \nOne of the economic impacts has been that the availability and \naffordability of terrorism insurance has been severely limited.\n  Uncertainty in the market is freezing commercial lending, preventing \nreal estate transactions from going forward, and slowing various \nconstruction projects. Therefore I believe that we should move quickly \nto enact a federal terrorism insurance backstop.\n  I have heard from businesses throughout Missouri--from various \nsectors of our economy--that are being adversely impacted by current \nmarket conditions. But the lack of terrorism insurance is hurting \nworking families as well.\n  As President Bush pointed out, ``If people can't get terrorism \ninsurance on a construction project, they're not going to build a \nproject, and if they're not going to build a project, then someone's \nnot working.''\n  This legislation will promote investment and provide the certainty \nnecessary to reinvigorate commercial lending activities.\n  I have supported each of the unanimous consent requests that have \nbeen offered since December to bring a terrorism insurance bill before \nthe Senate.\n  I am pleased that we have finally been able to take up this bill. \nThis meaningful Federal backstop is long overdue, and I hope that we \ncan enact it expeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I see my friend from Kentucky. I will take a few minutes to\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nmake an opening statement. I see he is here. I do not want to delay him \nany longer. I will truncate my remarks and then my anticipation is we \nwill turn to the Senator from Kentucky to offer an amendment to get the \nprocess going.\n  Let me take a few minutes, if I may. We have now heard from a number \nof my colleagues. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues, \nparticularly those of Senators Sarbanes, Corzine, and Schumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent the junior Senator from New York, Mrs. \nClinton, be added as a cosponsor of this bill as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the leadership for their efforts on this bill. This \nis a complicated area of law. This is a thankless task. When you get \ninvolved in something such as terrorism insurance, there are other \nmatters that may attract and galvanize the attention of the American \npublic, but this is a subject matter that can glaze over the eyes of \neven the most determined listener, when you get into the arcane world \nof insurance, particularly of terrorism insurance, the reinsurance \nindustry dealing with commercial loans and lending practices, and how \nit affects the market at large.\n  I beg the indulgence of our colleagues when we go through this, to \nunderstand what we have tried to do here in as much a bipartisan \nfashion as possible, with the advice and consultation of organizations, \nfrom the AFL/CIO to major banks and lending institutions, insurance \ncompanies, the Department of the Treasury, and others in crafting \nsomething that will get us out of this particular situation.\n  Let me just preface my remarks by saying this is a problem. I know \nthere may be some who will argue this is not an issue. It is a massive \nissue and a growing one. I wish it were otherwise. I wish this were not \nthe case. But the data that is coming in indicates that we have a major \nblockage, if you will, in the normal flow of commerce, and that is the \ninability to acquire terrorism insurance, which has a very negative \nimpact when it comes to lending institutions putting their resources on \nthe table, where the exposure could be significant.\n  Just to put it in some perspective for people, the calculation of the \ncasualty and property loss--I am obviously not going to talk about the \nloss that goes beyond that we can put a dollar sign on. But for the \nloss to which you can put a dollar sign in the property and casualty \narea on September 11, the estimates run no less than $50 billion, just \nin property and casualty.\n  If you start adding others, obviously the numbers go up. To give you \nsome idea, if you had a September 11-like event somewhere in the United \nStates and an accumulation of events like September 11, the \navailability of resources today to pay the property and casualty losses \nis about 20 percent of that number. That is the situation we are in.\n  You can understand, while people may wish that it somehow were done \nby just the Federal Government writing a check and the people providing \nthis kind of coverage, that in a free market you have to encourage or \ninduce people to stay involved. There is no requirement under law that \nthey provide this kind of coverage.\n  The idea of how we can keep commerce moving, and major construction \nprograms underway--by the way, based on the accumulated evidence we \nhave, most every State can demonstrate some serious problem they have \nin a major commercial or real estate development.\n  This morning's newspaper headlines in the Washington Post that my \ncolleague from Florida has raised, I think, point out the problem we \nare facing. I will talk about properties in the District of Columbia. \nObviously, the attack on the Pentagon on September 11, and the news the \nother day about so-called ``dirty'' bombs that might have been used--\nand I gather this was somewhat shaky information, but put that aside \nfor a second--the Nation's Capital certainly is a target of \nopportunity.\n  We see rates already going up for properties located in the District \nof Columbia. That is the subject matter of the Washington Post article \nthis morning. In fact, the Washington Post itself is having a difficult \ntime getting coverage for workman's compensation, and the National \nGeographic building has a similar problem, and there are similar \nproblems around the city.\n  I will not go into all of the details in the article, suffice it to \nsay that this is a significant story and my colleagues ought to take a \nlook at it. It highlights some of the difficulties we are facing.\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation. Obviously, many of us \nmight have written this somewhat differently than proposed. But, \nobviously, in a body like this with 100 Members, with a lot of \ndifferent ideas and thoughts, you try to come together with what you \ncan to make some sense and move the product forward.\n  There are differences of opinion on the substance of this \nlegislation. We are going to hear some of them raised with the \namendments that will be brought up and debated. My hope is that the \nsubstance of this legislation will prevail.\n  The provisions that deal with the creation of a temporary Federal \nbackstop for terrorism insurance represent a very hardcore compromise \nnegotiated with Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nSchumer, myself, Senator Enzi, as well as the State insurance \nregulators, White House, and the Treasury Department. This is a \nmodified version of what we agreed to last fall. Senator Gramm is not a \nsponsor of the bill which I introduced for the reason I am sure he will \nexplain himself when he comes to the floor.\n  There is a lot in this bill that is very similar to what we worked \nout last fall, but it would not move along at that time for reasons I \nwill not bother to go into again.\n  Who is supporting what we are trying to do?\n  I am troubled by our delay in enacting this legislation because of \nthe tremendous demand that we act and act precipitously. There is a \nbipartisan letter from 18 Governors from across the country \nrepresenting every region of the country, which I ask unanimous consent \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Republican Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Gephardt,\n     House Democrat Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressional Leaders: As a result of the events of \n     September 11th, the nation's property and casually insurance \n     companies have or will pay out losses that will exceed $35 \n     billion dollars. Since the first of January, many insurance \n     companies, self-insurers and states have been faced with a \n     situation where they are unable to spread the risk that they \n     insure because of the unavailability of reinsurance \n     protection. In the event of another major attack, some \n     companies or perhaps a segment of the industry would face \n     insolvency. While most states have approved a limited \n     exclusion for terrorism with a $25 million deductible, \n     exclusions for workers' compensation coverage are not \n     permitted by statute in any state. The present situation \n     poses a grave risk to the solvency of the insurance industry, \n     state insurance facilities, economic development initiatives, \n     and the ability of our states to recover from impacts of the \n     September 11th attacks.\n       In the months after the attack on our nation, legislation \n     passed in the House and was introduced in the Senate to \n     create a backstop for the Insurance industry so they could \n     continue to provide protection to their customers. The \n     Administration has also supported this concept. Currently, \n     there is broad bi-partisan agreement for providing an \n     Insurance backstep. Governors believe this is an important \n     goal that should be inhibited by other issues.\n       Since late December, the lack of a financial backstop has \n     started to ripple through the economy and will continue to do \n     so. This will further impact the ability of the economy to \n     recover from the current recession.\n       As Governors, we are facing many critical issues resulting \n     from the September 11th crisis. The emerging problem in \n     insurance coverage only serves to exacerbate our recovery \n     efforts. In view of this, we, the undersigned Governors, \n     respectfully urge the Congress to quickly complete its work \n     on the terrorism reinsurance legislation in order to return \n     stability to U.S. insurance markets.\n           Sincerely.\n         Jim Hodges, Governor, South Caroline; Mike Johanns, \n           Governor, Nebraska; Paul E. Patton, Governor, Kentucky; \n           Judy Martz, Governor, Montana; Don Siegelman, Governor, \n           Alabama; Bob Holden, Governor, Missouri; Mark R.\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\n           Warner, Governor, Virginia; John G. Rowland, Governor, \n           Connecticut; Angus S. King, Jr., Governor, Maine; Mike \n           Huckabee, Governor, Arkansas; Jim Geringer, Governor, \n           Wyoming; George H. Ryan, Governor, Illinois; Bill \n           Owens, Governor, Colorado; Scott McCallum, Governor, \n           Wisconsin; Jeb Bush, Governor, Florida; Frank O'Bannon, \n           Governor, Indiana; Jane Swift, Governor, Massachusetts; \n           Bob Taft, Governor, Ohio.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, they lay out their concerns about what is \ngoing on in their own States.\n  We have letters from 30 of our Senate colleagues representing a broad \narray of the political spectrum. I ask unanimous consent that those \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, Senate.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, Senate.\n       Dear Majority Leader Daschle and Minority Leader Lott: We \n     are writing to urge prompt Senate passage of short-term, \n     terrorism insurance backstop legislation that would stabilize \n     the insurance market for policyholders and provide financial \n     security in the event of future terrorist acts. As you both \n     know, members of this body quickly responded with a \n     legislative package in the wake of September 11 to ensure the \n     continued availability of insurance for terrorist-related \n     acts. The proposal provided a short term, financial backstop \n     so that private markets for terrorism coverage could be \n     reestablished.\n       While the House passed H.R. 3210, the ``Terrorism Risk \n     Protection Act'' late last year, the Senate was unable to \n     bring a legislative package to the floor before our \n     adjournment in December. Since that time, we have heard from \n     the financial services industry, the building and \n     construction sectors, the labor community, small businesses, \n     and other impacted parties that there is currently either no \n     insurance against acts of terrorism or inadequate levels of \n     insurance. This problem is having a delirious impact on our \n     economy, including with respect to the financing and \n     construction of new real estate projects. A host of \n     additional parties, including hotels, convention centers, \n     hospitals, local municipalities, and professional sports \n     teams are also pressing for needed action. Particularly \n     troubling is the evidence that insurers cannot provide needed \n     workers compensation coverage where there are large \n     aggregations of individuals. As you know, these claims are \n     bolstered by a recently released study by the General \n     Accounting Office and by testimony provided recently to the \n     House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight.\n       The Senate should be proud of its work following the tragic \n     events of September 11. We passed numerous pieces of \n     legislation to address the security of our country and the \n     viability of key sectors of our economy. We should also try \n     to prevent severe economic dislocation and should certainly \n     not fall short in helping to ensure that employers and their \n     workers have adequate levels of insurance in the event of \n     additional terrorist acts.\n       We urge you to bring a terrorism insurance bill to the \n     Senate floor expeditiously.\n           Sincerely,\n         Judd Gregg; Jim Bunning; John Breaux; E. Benjamin Nelson; \n           Dick Lugar; Jesse Helms; Wayne Allard; Mike DeWine; \n           Susan Collins; Mike Enzi; Jack Reed; George V. \n           Voinovich; Debbie Stabenow; Mary L. Landrieu; Zell \n           Miller; Max Cleland; Dianne Feinstein; Lincoln Chafee; \n           Chuck Hagel; John Ensign; Olympia Snowe; John F. Kerry; \n           Ted Kennedy; Orrin Hatch; Daniel K. Inouye; Evan Bayh; \n           Joe Lieberman; Jon Corzine.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have had repeated letters from the \nPresident, Secretary O'Neill, and others in the administration which \ncertainly point out the difficulty.\n  I will quote the President's comments during the White House \ngathering back in April. He said:\n\n       If people can't get terrorism insurance on a construction \n     project, they are not going to build the project. If they are \n     not going to build the project, then someone is not working. \n     We in Washington must deal with it, and deal with it in a \n     hurry.\n\n  Secretary O'Neill commented:\n\n       There is a real and immediate need for Congress to act on \n     terrorism insurance legislation. The terrorist attacks on \n     September 11th have caused many insurance companies to limit \n     or drop terrorists risk coverage from their property and \n     casualty coverage, a move that leaves the majority of \n     American businesses extremely vulnerable. The dynamic, in \n     turn, threatens America's jobs, and will wreak havoc on \n     America's economy.\n\n  Just this week, Secretary of Treasury O'Neill, Larry Lindsey, \nDirector of the National Economic Council, Mitch Daniels, Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, and R. Glenn Hubbard, Director of \nthe Council of Economic Advisors, wrote Senate leadership outlining \nagain the significance of moving forward with this bill.\n  The labor unions as well have called for action here--a rare \noccurrence when you get this kind of symmetry between both labor and \nmanagement.\n  I quote from Ed Sullivan, president of the Building Construction \nTrades Department of the AFL-CIO. He says:\n\n       President Bush, like all of us, realize that as long as \n     terrorism is a threat, new job-creating projects are being \n     delayed or canceled because we do not have adequate insurance \n     coverage, or workman's compensation coverage available.\n\n  The Union Building Trades:\n\n       Our members join in urging the U.S. Senate to pass \n     terrorism risk insurance legislation without delay.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners from across the \ncountry, which is made up of State insurance regulators, which \ncontinues to strongly urge the creation of a Federal backstop for \nterrorism insurance, has to its displeasure begun the process of \nexcluding terrorism insurance from standard casualty property policies.\n\n       On behalf of the national insurance regulators, I strongly \n     urge the Senate to quickly pass legislation that will make \n     insurance affordable and available to all American consumers \n     and businesses. Only the Federal Government has sufficient \n     resources at this time to help restore adequate levels of \n     risk measurement and financial certainty to our markets.\n\n  Finally, a broad coalition of small and large businesses and \nconsumers of terrorism insurance have called for Senate action as well. \nThere are some who believe there is no reason for the Federal \nGovernment to act. They cite a few press articles which suggest \nterrorism insurance is available in some areas and wonder why the \nCongress should step in with legislation such as we are proposing.\n  Terrorism insurance is available, it is true, in limited areas. \nHowever, it is not available in many buildings, powerplants, shopping \ncenters, and transportation systems that are perceived as high risk for \nterrorism acts--hence, the article this morning in the Washington Post \nabout our Nation's Capital. In those cases where terrorism insurance is \navailable, it is often unaffordable and very limited in its scope and \namount of coverage.\n\n  There are plenty of examples. Also, again, the Washington Post story \nthis morning is the one that comes to mind immediately. I mentioned the \nNational Geographic headquarters in town dropped its workman's \ncompensation because it received threats to large concentrations of \nemployees and joined with the District of Columbia government's insurer \nas a last resort.\n  The Washington Post is trying with inability to secure its own \nworkman's compensation insurance. Workplaces around the Nation's \nCapital have either been denied coverage or have offered reduced \ncoverage.\n  Why is this going on? When you have a $50 billion event, you can \nunderstand.\n  If I could wave a magic wand and say, whether you like it or not, you \nhave to be there, you have to have premiums--the law requires them to \ncollect premiums so they can provide the kind of resources they need to \npay out if an event occurs. The law requires it.\n  The question is how do you know how big an event is going to be. We \nhad a $50 billion one. That is at least a floor of what we know it \ncosts. That is without including workman's compensation, life insurance \nand others. Just in property and casualty, that is the number.\n  If you are going to have the industry be out and the private sector \ndo this, they have to cost it out. I wish it could be for nothing. I \nwish it wouldn't cost anything at all. That is a mythical world. The \nreality is that banks don't lend money unless they can have some \ncoverage to protect their exposure. If you are not going to give the \ncoverage to protect the exposure, they don't lend the money.\n  It is not complicated. If you look at the commercial mortgage-backed \nsecurity business, which covers all but about $1 billion of all \ncommercial lending that goes on, already in the first quarter it is \ndown $7 billion--10 percent. You are already finding a stall going on \nin that area.\n  Most of my colleagues understand that it is like residential \nmortgage-backed securities. Security in the commercial area is where \nthey go out and bundle them together and have a secondary market to \ncover it. Right now,\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\n10 percent in the first quarter is already down in that area.\n  I am not making the numbers up to highlight the significance of what \nwe are talking about. George Washington University's downtown campus \nthree blocks west of the White House has cut the school's former $1 \nbillion property and casualty policy in half, and its premiums have \nbeen raised 160 percent, and advise that renewing terrorism coverage \nwould cost 15 times more. That is what we are up against here.\n  I can rail against it. Obviously, there is no great wisdom here to \nattack the insurance industry. That is a pretty safe bet out there \npolitically.\n  But the fact is, when you end up with institutions like George \nWashington University, the National Geographic, private sector people \nhere in the Nation's Capital, it would be difficult to say we are going \nto go out and cover this after we had a $50 billion loss, to just jump \nback in somehow; and for people to say, by the way, don't raise your \npremiums to do it, and you better have the resources to pay for it. I \ndo not know where people acquired their math knowledge, but this does \nnot work out, unfortunately.\n  So what we are trying to do is get this industry back in because we \ncannot require them to do it. So we have come up with a backstop idea \nthat says: Look, the first $10 billion of losses you are on the hook \nfor. When it gets beyond that, we are going to work out a system that \nallows us to help in that kind of cost, for 2 years, by the way, with a \nsunset provision.\n  Some would like it longer. I think we could make a good case for it \nbeing longer because it is awfully difficult, with some major real \nestate development going on that has more than a 2-year lifespan. But I \nam not sure how much this institution will tolerate in terms of time, \nso it has to be abbreviated to some extent. Then, hopefully, as the \nmarket develops, the costing out can be calculated, and we can get the \nFederal Government out of this altogether.\n  I know of no one who wants to turn the Secretary of the Treasury into \nan insurance regulator. I am afraid that is what some of my colleagues \nare suggesting. That is not what this is about. That is a separate \ndebate. Maybe someday we are going to have a debate around here that \nsays the Federal Government ought to become an insurance company. That \nis a debate, but I don't think that is the debate we want to have here \ntoday.\n  The debate here today is whether or not we are going to set up a \nprogram that is going to cause the flow of commerce to get reignited in \nareas where we have a significant stall.\n  Let me stay to my colleagues--and my colleague from Florida raises \nthe issue--our bill does require that there be an accounting here \nseparating out the premiums collected for terrorism insurance from the \nnormal course of business. We do not go as far as my colleague from \nFlorida would like, but in our bill that we have proposed there is an \naccounting requirement that says you must at least have a separate \naccounting for the premiums collected for terrorism insurance.\n  So there is a long list here of projects that I could talk about that \ngo all across the country that highlight everything from the Golden \nGate Bridge to the Dolphin Stadium in Florida that are having \nproblems--the United Jewish Appeal, the Hyatt Corporation, the Steve \nWynn's operation in Las Vegas our colleague from Nevada has already \ntalked about, Amtrak, the Cleveland Municipal School District, Baylor \nUniversity. The list goes on and on and on.\n  Again, we are not making these stories up. This is the evidence we \nare receiving from across the country, that there is a problem, and it \nis a growing one. We probably should have acted earlier, but I don't \nthink it is too late for us to be moving forward.\n  So that is the background of it. Every perspective homeowner, of \ncourse, needs insurance to obtain a mortgage from a bank. Similarly, \nindustry as diverse as commercial real estate, shipping, construction, \nmanufacturing, and retailers require insurance to obtain credit loans \nand investments necessary for their business operations. Additionally, \nthe creation of new construction projects require business loans. I \nthink most people understand that.\n  If you ever bought a home, you know you don't get the mortgage unless \nyou have insurance. That is what the law requires. That is just as true \nin the commercial areas. So if there isn't insurance available, the \nbanks are not going to lend you money to buy a house. Maybe some people \ncan buy a house by just writing out a check. Most Americans need a \nmortgage. And most Americans understand that the banks want to have \nsome insurance on that property to cover their potential loss. So that \nis why you have to be able to get that.\n  That is true in commercial areas as well. If you can't get the \ninsurance, then the banks don't lend you the money to build the \nprojects, and people lose jobs. Those are the dots you connect, and \nthat is what is going on all across the country as one of the effects \nof 9-11. It is a more complicated subject matter, but it is a serious \none that the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, organized labor, \nand others have highlighted.\n  Some critics will argue, Why should we do anything to help the \ninsurance industry? Quickly, let me add, this is not about the \nfinancial health of the insurance industry at all. It is about the \nfinancial well-being of nearly every individual and company in America \nthat requires this industry to be healthy enough to be in business.\n  If you end up being put out of business because you don't have the \nresources, your solvency gets wiped out, as it would be today with a 9-\n11-like event. As I mentioned earlier, there are only about 20 percent \nof the resources to cover a similar kind of event that occurred 9 \nmonths ago on the 11th of September. So this is not so much about their \nhealth and well-being as it is those who rely on this industry for \ntheir own health and well-being.\n  As I said, the industry is paying off losses from the September 11 \nattacks estimated to be roughly $50 billion. The industry has made \nclear that despite this unprecedented loss, it remains very strong and \nsolvent.\n  The question that many will ask is why we need to help an industry \nthat is financially sound? And I think I have laid that out. The answer \nis we are not protecting insurance companies, we are protecting policy \nowners and businesses and workers.\n  This legislation makes sense because it is based on three principles \nthat must be included in any bill that reaches the President's desk.\n  First, it makes the American taxpayer the insurer of last resort. We \ncould do what we did in World War II. In World War II, the Federal \nGovernment insured everything. We just paid all the claims. I don't \nneed to tell you what could happen if that happened today. But that is \na point of view: Just let the Federal Government pick up the claims of \nthis stuff, and don't worry about having a private sector insurance \nindustry being involved at all.\n  But I don't think most Americans think that is a wise solution \nnecessarily given the potential exposure we have. So I think it makes \nsense to have the industry be the ones that are going to be on the \nfront lines responsible to do what is best, to calculate the risk, to \nassess premiums, to pay claims. I don't necessarily believe we want to \nset up another agency of Government, maybe under homeland security. Now \nthat we are reorganizing Government, maybe someone would like to add a \nbranch to become an insurance company. I don't think so.\n  Secondly, the legislation should promote competition in the current \ninsurance marketplace. Competition is the best way to ensure that the \nprivate marketplace assumes the entire responsibility for insuring \nagainst the risk of terrorism without any direct Government role as \nsoon as possible. That is why this bill has the very short lifespan we \nare talking about. This is not setting up something in perpetuity. It \nis setting up a very short lifespan.\n\n  Right now it is 24 months in the bill. And I think there will be \nsuggestions to extend that, which may have some merit, by the way, I \nsuggest, to those who may be offering them. But it is going to be \nlimited, in any case.\n  Thirdly, the legislation ensures that all consumers and businesses \ncan continue to purchase affordable coverage for terrorist acts.\n  Without action, consumers would be unable to get insurance, or \ninsurance that is available would be totally unaffordable for them.\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\n  Very simply, and lastly, I will just explain briefly--Senator \nSarbanes has done this already--but let me just take another minute or \nso for those who may not have heard his comments to briefly describe \nhow S. 2600 actually works.\n  It will provide Federal terrorism insurance in the event of another \nsignificant terrorist attack. This legislation is designed to maximize \nprivate sector involvement and minimize the Federal role. The bill does \nnot create a new Federal insurance regulator; rather, it promotes the \nauthority of existing private sector mechanisms.\n  The Federal backstop is temporary, lasting only 1 year unless \nextended for an additional year by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The bill envisions that the private sector alone would respond to \nsmall-scale attacks, such as car bombs, arson fires, and the like.\n  The Government intervention only occurs in insured losses in excess \nof a specific trigger. The amount each insurance company must pay \nbefore the Federal participation begins is determined by a statutory \nformula based on each company's market share. Larger companies pay more \nthrough the resulting individual company retentions.\n  Individual company retentions are calculated based on each company's \nmarket share of $10 billion in the first year, and $15 billion in the \nsecond year if the program is extended, meaning that large companies \nwould sustain hundreds of millions of dollars in losses before the \nbackstop is triggered.\n  In addition, once the backstop is triggered, each insurance company \nremains responsible for 10 to 20 percent of every claim dollar paid.\n  Lastly, I would say as well, regarding the States, we require that \nthese actions be brought in Federal court, that there be a venue that \nis closer to where the action may have occurred.\n  But let me quickly point out, we have tried very strongly to retain \nthe role of the State insurance commissions. There are 40 States right \nnow that allow for rates to go into effect, and then the State \ncommissioners can determine whether or not those rates are excessive or \nnot. And 10 States require that rates be approved before they go into \neffect. That is in commercial property.\n  In this bill, we say the rates could go into effect, but we do not \ndeny, as exists in 40 States, the State insurance commissioners to then \nrule on those rate increases. So we are not setting a Federal regulator \nin that regard. We are still keeping that in the States, and the State \ninsurance commissioners do not lose that power.\n  The State insurance commissioners have the responsibility, obviously, \nto keep an eye on the rates, but they also have an obligation to see \nthat the insurers are solvent so they can pay claims, if, God forbid, \nsome event occurs. So the responsibility is dual, both to the insurer \nto make sure they have the assets and, of course, to the policyholder \nto make sure their rates are not too high and coverage will be there, \nif needed. We make it very clear in this bill that we want to keep the \nrole of the State insurance commissioner viable.\n\n  We don't want to get in the business of setting up some massive new \ngovernment program with a new regulator with a whole bunch of new rules \nestablished at the Federal level to start regulating this industry. \nThat is a debate that will occur to some degree down the road, but \ntoday is not the day. This is not the place or time for that debate. \nThis is an emergency. It should have been dealt with a long time ago.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will offer their amendments, we will \nget through this, and vote it up or down. Maybe our colleagues will \ndecide this bill is not necessary; they don't want to be a part of it. \nThen we ought to say so. Then end the debate entirely and go about our \nbusiness. I suspect that a majority of our colleagues think this has \nvalue and is important. My hope is we can get it done sooner rather \nthan later.\n  I turn to my colleague from Kentucky who, I know, has a very \nimportant amendment. We will try to deal with that and move the process \nalong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3836\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Connecticut. I certainly agree \nwith him that this is legislation we should have passed quite some time \nago. The principle sticking point with which I am concerned is the \nliability issue.\n  Under the underlying bill, punitive damages are available against \nvictims of terrorism. Let me repeat that. Having just been attacked by \nthe terrorists, the victims of that terrorist act are subject to \npunitive damages under the underlying bill.\n  The only concession that those advocates of this kind of litigation \nhave made is to take the taxpayers off the hook for punitive damages. \nBut the way the thresholds are allocated under the balance of the bill, \nit is highly likely that the taxpayers will be liable under any attack, \nand all other kinds of damages other than punitive damages will be \navailable against the taxpayer.\n  We are talking about a bill that while certainly in concept is \ndesirable, it has a number of significant flaws, one of which I would \nlike to begin to try to fix this morning by laying down the amendment I \nwill lay down shortly.\n  While many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \ntalking about the need for a terrorism insurance bill, my Republican \ncolleagues and I have been busily preparing for action. Two weeks ago, \nSenator Gramm and I broke a month-long logjam by informally offering a \nproposal for a base text that establishes a responsible program for \nFederal assistance and assures that we don't punish the victims of \nterrorism for the criminal acts of the terrorists.\n  For months now, the Senate has been locked in a debate about whether \nan American victim of a terrorist attack, whether it is Walt Disney \nWorld, the Mall of America, Giants Stadium, or the Las Vegas MGM Grand, \nshould be held liable for punitive damages.\n  Remember, punitive damages are intended to punish bad actors. That is \nwhat punitive damages are about. In all other ways, defendants are \ncompensated. Punitive damages are designed to punish the defendant. \nThey are not designed to compensate victims.\n  Nothing in the Republican proposal for a base bill has sought to \nlimit damages to compensate victims. There are no efforts on our part \nin the Senate to limit damages to compensate victims. What we are \ntalking about is punitive damages which are designed to punish \ndefendants.\n  We are talking solely about whether American victims of a terrorist \nattack should be punished not once but twice, attacked first by the \nterrorists, attacked second by the lawyers.\n  In pondering this question our colleagues who disagree and their \nallies have raised an interesting point--that there are some victims of \nterrorism whose conduct may be so flagrant, indeed so criminal, that as \na matter of public policy, we should not let it go unpunished. So to \naddress that concern head on, Senator Gramm and I offered a new \ncompromise for a base bill that I fully expected my Democratic \ncolleagues would embrace, at least I had hoped they would. Our proposal \nwould permit punitive damages against any defendant who has been \nconvicted of a crime in State or Federal court. Using our criminal \njustice system to determine what conduct is worthy of punishment is a \nsimple, commonsense solution to ensure that no criminals avoid punitive \ndamages in civil cases.\n  Let me state that again: In an ideal world, we would not have any \npunitive damages available against a victim of a terrorist attack. But \nto help address the concerns of those on the other side that punitive \ndamages might lie in some extraordinary circumstance, the amendment I \nam about to offer provides a punitive damage opportunity against \nvictims of terrorism who themselves have been convicted of a criminal \nact. That makes sense because if you have been convicted of a criminal \nact, punitive damages ought to lie because of the nature of the \nconduct.\n\n  Although Senator Gramm and I informally offered this proposal before \nthe Memorial Day recess, we did not formally offer it on the floor \nbecause we wanted to give the other side plenty of time to consider \nthis approach as a compromise for a base bill.\n  Actually our proposal was the second compromise supported by many on \nthis side of the aisle. The first compromise from the House-passed bill \nincluded a\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nstripped down liability section agreed upon by Senators Gramm, \nSarbanes, Dodd, and Enzi. But that compromise was later undone in \nDecember by others on the other side of the aisle.\n  After months of inaction, Senator Gramm and I came back to propose \nthis second compromise in the hopes that our colleagues on the other \nside would agree to these protections.\n  Sadly, the opposite appears to have taken place. Our colleagues on \nthe other side rejected our idea by proceeding to a bill that would \nallow American victims of a terrorist attack to be held liable for \npunitive damages. Under this underlying bill, American victims of a \nterrorist attack could be held liable for punitive damages.\n  This approach to punitive damages does not compensate plaintiffs, \ndoes not prevent the double punishment of American companies who are \nvictims of a terrorist attack, and does nothing to prevent insurance \nmoney intended to rebuild homes and reopen American business from being \ndiverted to pay lottery-sized litigation awards.\n  The message this sends to the American people is that some of our \ncolleagues are not truly concerned with guarding against criminal \nconduct. Instead, they appear more concerned with guarding the rights \nof personal injury lawyers to seek punitive damages against American \nvictims of terrorism, protecting the opportunity for American lawyers \nto seek punitive damages against American victims of terrorism.\n  On Saturday, the New York Times, certainly a publication I am not \nfrequently allied with on any matter, asked Senate Democrats to move \ntoward our liability proposal. This is the New York Times talking:\n\n       Senate Democratic leaders eager to pass their own bill must \n     compromise, even if it means offending trial lawyer groups.\n\n  This is the New York Times.\n\n       Senate Republicans appear willing to accept far more modest \n     curbs on terrorism-related litigation than their House \n     brethren. Their proposals provide the basis for an eventual \n     reconciliation of House and Senate efforts.\n\n  This is in the New York Times, the liberal New York Times, in an \neditorial entitled ``Insuring Against Terrorism,'' June 8, 2002, just a \nfew days ago.\n  The home office of the New York Times, of course, is in New York City \nwhere this problem is the most apparent. They would like to see some \naction, and they think having some reasonable limits on punitive \ndamages makes sense in the context of moving this legislation along.\n  On Monday, four top administration officials, including Treasury \nSecretary O'Neill, National Economic Council Director Larry Lindsey, \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels, Council of \nEconomic Advisors Director Glenn Hubbard, announced they would \nrecommend that the President veto legislation that ``leaves the \nAmerican economy and victims of terrorist acts subject to predatory \nlawsuits and punitive damages.'' They sent a letter to Senator Lott, \ndated June 10. Let me say it again. All four of these top officials in \nthe Bush administration say they would recommend the President veto \nlegislation that ``leaves the American economy and victims of terrorist \nacts subject to predatory lawsuits and punitive damages.''\n  That gives us some parameters or outlines here if we are serious \nabout making a law and not simply playing legislative games. We ought \nto pass a bill that has a chance of being signed. I think it is pretty \nclear that the President's top advisers in this area would recommend \nthat he veto legislation similar to the underlying bill. So we have an \nopportunity, if we are serious about this legislation, to fix it up and \nget rid of this outrageous punitive damage provision that subjects \nvictims of terrorism to these awards, unless they themselves have \nengaged in criminal conduct, in which case I must say I think they \ndeserve punitive damages in that unlikely eventuality.\n  Interestingly, for those who say liability protections are not an \nimportant part of terrorism insurance, let me share with you a quote \nfrom a recent report by the Joint Economic Committee:\n\n       Liability costs are estimated to constitute the largest \n     single cost of the 9-11 attacks and could easily exceed the \n     property damage, life insurance, and workers compensation \n     payments combined.\n\n  That is from the ``Economic Perspectives on Terrorism Insurance,'' \nprepared by the Joint Economic Committee in May of this year.\n  With this backdrop, I send the amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Gramm, and Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McCONNELL], for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 3836.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for procedures for civil actions, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 29, strike line 1 and all that follows through page \n     30, line 17, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 10.

Mr. President, this amendment replaces the liability \nsection of the underlying bill with the liability section proposed in \nthe compromise bill sponsored by Senator Gramm and myself.\n  The compromise has three principal elements. First, consolidation of \nall claims in a single Federal district court; second, approval of \nsettlements by the Secretary of the Treasury; third, a ban on punitive \ndamages, unless the defendant has been convicted of a criminal offense \nthat is related to the plaintiff's injury.\n  The first two provisions should not spark any controversy. The \nproponents of the underlying bill themselves have agreed to Federal \njurisdiction over these claims, and the approval of settlements by the \nSecretary of the Treasury simply protects the taxpayer dollars that \nwill be exposed to potentially enormous lawsuits under this program. \nAnd since the underlying bill now--unlike an earlier version--prudently \nbans punitive damages against the Federal Treasury, this approval \nprocess ensures that a party does not attempt to casually circumvent \nthat ban through a settlement.\n  So, again, this is a debate about whether we should expose American \nvictims of terrorism to punitive damages--damages that heap additional \npunishment on American victims, even after the plaintiff has been fully \ncompensated for his or her injuries.\n  Let me make a very important point to those of my colleagues who are \ntraditionally wary of liability protections. Lawsuits arising out of \nterrorist attacks will be a wholly different animal. They will not \nfeature the traditional small, sympathetic plaintiffs against the \ncrotchety, arrogant big business that makes for such effective \ntelevision movies and plaintiffs' lawyers' tales. No, these lawsuits \nwill pit victim against victim--victim against victim--both of whom \nhave been devastated by a coldblooded terrorist attack, and both of \nwhom will be faced with traumatic physical, emotional, and financial \nrecovery.\n  While it is important to ensure that an injured plaintiff be \ncompensated for his or her injuries--and this amendment does just \nthat--it is absurd, immoral, and it is un-American to impose additional \npunishment on an American victim of terrorism.\n  For those who remain concerned about punishing egregious conduct, my \namendment does not extend the punitive ban to any defendant who is \nengaged in criminal conduct. History reminds us that punitive damages \nhave always been about punishing bad actors, not about compensating \nvictims. Punishment has long been a hallmark of our criminal justice \nsystem. Indeed, punitive damages draw their origins from the English \ncommon law cases of assault and battery, where the criminal law \nprovided an inadequate remedy. So it only makes sense that we should \nrely on our criminal justice system to determine whether additional \npunishment is warranted against American victims of terrorism.\n  If American defendants have engaged in criminal activity, maybe \npunitive damages are appropriate in those limited circumstances. But \nwhat we cannot and must not do is take the punishment reserved for the \nterrorists who seek to destroy our buildings, our transportation \nsystems, our fire and rescue personnel, and our way of life and \ntransfer that punishment to American victims of terrorism who bear no \nrelation to the hijackers and suicide bombers, or the terror that they \nunleash on America.\n  To be perfectly candid, my amendment does not do enough to protect \nliability costs from skyrocketing out of control and to protect against \nrunaway lawsuits against terrorist victims. Indeed, this amendment \nmoves along way off the litigation management provisions in the House-\npassed bill. If I had my own way, I would be offering something a good \ndeal more comprehensive than what I have offered a few moments ago. \nIndeed, I think it is important for everybody to remember what kind of \nawards are still possible, even if my amendment is adopted, as I hope \nit will be. There is no limit to the amount of damages an American \nplaintiff can receive as compensation for physical or economic loss. \nLet me say that again. I am not proposing any kind of limitation on the \namount of damages an American plaintiff can receive as compensation for \nphysical or economic loss.\n  No. 2, I am not proposing to limit the amount of damages an American \nplaintiff can receive as compensation for noneconomic damages--pain and \nsuffering losses. There is no limitation under my amendment on recovery \nfor pain and suffering.\n  In addition, there is nothing to prevent American defendants and \nvictims of a terrorist attack from having to pay for the pain and \nsuffering caused by terrorists. I could have gone a lot further, but \nthere is no limitation under this amendment on recovery for pain and \nsuffering against the victims of terrorism or the taxpayers of the \nUnited States. And there is no limit on the amount of money an attorney \ncan take from the plaintiff's award. I must say, I hated not putting \nthat in.\n  This is very similar to the Federal Tort Claims Act which has been on \nthe books since the late forties. If you sue the United States under \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, all the cases are in Federal court. There \nare no punitive damages, and there is a 25-percent limit on lawyer's \nfees, which seems to me is entirely appropriate. A limitation on \nlawyer's fees puts more money in the hands of the victim.\n  I know what a sensitive subject that is for many in this body, so \nthat is not in this amendment. I did not even limit the lawyer's fees \nwhich would have been a very provictim provision. I did not do that. \nYet remarkably, this is not enough for some people. Even after a \nplaintiff has been fully compensated for all his or her fiscal, \neconomic, and noneconomic damages, the underlying bill demands the \nright to seek additional punitive damages to punish American property \nowners, American shopkeepers, and American air carriers who are also \nvictims of terrorism.\n  Under this amendment, no victim is going to be denied the right to \nfully recover under every other provision. The only thing that is being \ndenied is to get punished for the second time. First, you have been \nattacked by the terrorists, and then you are going to be attacked by \nthe lawyers if we do not pass this amendment.\n  Just yesterday this body voted, regrettably, to impose double \ntaxation on American families afflicted by the death tax--double \ntaxation. You get taxed once during your life, and then you get taxed \nagain when you die. Almost immediately afterwards, our colleagues moved \nto proceed to a terrorism insurance bill that would impose double \npunishment. Yesterday they voted in favor of double taxation, and today \nthey are advocating double punishment on American victims of \nterrorism. First, you get attacked by the terrorist, and then you get \nattacked by the lawyers for punitive damages.\n\n  I hope our colleagues will join me in curing the latter error by \nsupporting this amendment. If not, they should be prepared to explain \nto the American people why--why--in the aftermath of a terrorist attack \nit is somehow permissible in this country to punish American victims of \nterrorism for the harm caused by the terrorists. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  Let me reiterate before relinquishing the floor that all other kinds \nof damages are available to victims of terrorism, to the plaintiffs--\npain and suffering, economic compensation--but the only thing that \nwould be denied would be the opportunity to get punitive damages which \nare, in effect, damages allowed for criminal-type behavior from the \nvictim of a terrorist attack. I have even modified that to allow \npunitive damages against a victim of terrorism if that victim has been \nconvicted of a crime. That is the category of behavior which \nhistorically has made available punitive damages.\n  This is a very modest amendment. I would have loved to have gone a \nlot further. I find it outrageous that it is possible for any lawyer in \nAmerica in any one of these lawsuits to get more than a fourth. I think \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act would have been a perfect way to limit the \nlawyer's compensation and provide more assistance for\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nthe victim, but I have not offered that because I know there is \nsubstantial reluctance in this body, as we have seen time and time \nagain, to impact the compensation of the plaintiff's bar. So I have not \ndone that in an effort to make this more attractive.\n  This is a very modest step in the direction of protecting the victims \nof terrorism from being attacked twice. I hope it is something we can \npass overwhelmingly in the Senate whenever we get around to having a \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and hope that whenever this is voted \nupon, it will be adopted overwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me talk just a moment about the bill \nand where we are, and then talk about this amendment. This is the third \nbill now where we have not written a bill in committee, where we have \nbrought a bill to the floor, basically a partisan bill, for no purpose. \nI do not think I am saying anything others will not agree with in \nsaying Senator Dodd and I have pretty consistently been the two most \ncommitted people toward passing a bill. But rather than sitting down \nand trying to work out the provisions of this bill on a bipartisan \nbasis, we have a bill that has been brought to the floor of the Senate \nwhich has never been passed by a committee, much less the committee of \njurisdiction. We basically are converting this into a partisan issue \nwhich I think makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Let me give a little bit of history so my colleagues understand how \nwe got to be where we are and what the two overriding issues are. There \nwill be many other issues raised, I am sure, but I want people to know \nwhat the two overriding issues are.\n  Way back last fall, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Dodd, Senator Enzi, and \nI met with the Secretary of the Treasury in the wake of 9-11 to try to \nput together a bipartisan bill. In fact, we agreed to a bill. The \nSecretary of the Treasury endorsed the bill on behalf of the \nadministration. All four of us had a press conference and announced the \nbill. That bill worked as follows:\n  It was a 2-year bill with a possible extension to the third year. The \nfirst year there was an industry retention, and I want to define this \nterm because we are going to be hearing it now for an extended debate. \nThere was an industry retention whereby the industry had to pay $10 \nbillion in the case of a terrorist attack before the Federal Government \nwould begin to pay the bills, the idea being that the insurance \ncompanies are selling insurance, they are collecting premiums, and they \nshould have a stake in the process and the Federal Government should \ncome in in those events that are so large and so costly that the \ninsurance industry could not sustain it, and that the market for \ninsurance and reinsurance potentially would not develop with the risk \nas large as it might without the Federal backing.\n  Our bipartisan bill had a retention of $10 billion the first year, \n$10 billion the second year, and if the Secretary of the Treasury \nconcluded that a third year was required, he could extend the bill for \na third year with a retention of $20 billion. Above these retention \nlevels where the private insurance company would pay, the taxpayer pays \n90 cents out of every dollar of the claim.\n  Why did we have an industry retention rather than an individual \ncompany retention? We had an industry retention because our purpose is \nnot to get the Government into the insurance business permanently, but \nto build a bridge to transition from where we are today in the wake of \n9-11 to a period when, hopefully, we will do a better job of managing \nthese risks at the national level in terms of our antiterrorist policy \nand, secondly, over time, we can develop the insurance structure to \nbuild the risk that remained into the term structure of insurance \nrates.\n  If we do not have an industry retention, the incentive for companies \nto spread the risk is reduced.\n  If my risk as the Gramm Insurance Company is only some portion of $10 \nbillion based on my size in the industry, then once I am above that \nlevel of exposure, the Federal Government is picking up 90 percent of \nthe cost.\n  What we are trying to do is to get insurance companies to syndicate \nso that no insurance company insures the Empire State Building. They \nmight join 10, 20, or 30 other insurance companies in doing it and, in \ndoing so, spread the risk. We want to develop reinsurance so that these \nrisks can be disseminated.\n  Having an industry cap or an industry retention, rather than an \nindividual company retention, puts pressure on companies to enter into \nreinsurance. It provides an incentive and in fact a profitability for \nreinsurance to emerge. The purpose of the bill is to develop \nreinsurance and syndication.\n  Having reached that agreement, we also agreed on a set of provisions \nrelated to lawsuits in the wake of terrorist attacks. We agreed that \nall lawsuits had to be brought in Federal court because this was a \nFederal program. We agreed that the cases could be consolidated. We \nagreed to require that the Treasury would have to sign off on any out-\nof-court settlement in these cases. And we agreed there would be no \npunitive damages in the case of a terrorist attack. This was a \ncompromise.\n  Treasury wanted a lot more in the way of protection. The House had \npassed far more comprehensive protections, but this was a compromise we \nworked out. As we all know, there was an objection to the liability \nparts of the bill and the bill died.\n  Then we got into December. In December, in trying to write a bill, we \nwere literally faced with a situation where the bill was going to go \ninto effect within 3 weeks of the day we were writing it, when we tried \nto put together a compromise. With 3 weeks before supposedly the vast \nmajority of insurance policies were expiring, we believed there was not \ntime for a reinsurance market to emerge, that there was not time for \ncompanies to be able to lay off this risk by syndication. So the \nproposal was made that we have individual company retention levels.\n  Might I say that the day we announced a bipartisan compromise with an \nindustry retention level of $10 billion, virtually every insurance \ncompany in America supported that bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask this with some trepidation because I know that every \nday I hear my good friend from Texas speaking, it is one less day I am \ngoing to have the opportunity to hear him. And I mean that sincerely. I \nreally do enjoy his statements. I wonder if he has some idea how much \ntime he needs?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think I should be through within, say, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So the day we introduced the bill with a $10 billion \nindustry retention, based on the logic that we wanted to encourage \nreinsurance, that we wanted to encourage syndication, there was broad \nsupport in the insurance industry and in American business for that \ncompromise.\n  We got to December, 3 weeks away from--at least as we are told, and \nas I believe actually did happen--tremendous numbers of insurance \npolicies expiring on January 1. So recognizing we were writing a bill \nwhere the industry would have only 3 weeks to try to respond to it, the \nbill that was put together had not an industry retention but an \nindividual company retention that would produce a situation where, with \nas little as $50 million of cost, the Federal taxpayer could be pulled \ninto the process, a far cry from the $10 billion retention we had had \nin the original compromise. The logic of it, as of December 10, was \nthat we were 3 weeks away from the beginning of the year and there was \nnot time for this syndication to occur, there was not time for \nreinsurance to occur.\n\n  Now it is 7 months later. Insurance companies have sold terrorism \ninsurance, not at the price we might have chosen, not to the people we \nmight have chosen they sell it to, but the point is at inflated rates, \nbecause things changed, the market changed, and we expected rates would \ngo up. It was, in fact, required that they go up economically. Now \ninsurance companies have sold all these policies based, at that point, \non no Government backstop. To come back in now with an individual \ncompany retention that could put the taxpayer at risk, when the costs \nare as small as $50 million or $100 million, makes absolutely no sense.\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\n  What has happened, as we might expect it to happen, is that if I were \nrunning an insurance company and I had a choice between having \nGovernment backup begin at $100 million versus $10 billion, I would not \nbe running an insurance company long if I did not decide that $100 \nmillion was better than $10 billion. So now we are having this debate \ndriven by insurance companies that want the low retentions.\n  In December, when we were writing a bill to go into effect in 3 \nweeks, there was not any other choice, but once that marker got out \nthere and people saw it as a possibility, then they decided this deal \nthey were willing to sign on in October, which protected the taxpayer \nby having insurance companies pay the first $10 billion, that that was \nno longer acceptable. Seven months later, premiums collected, risks \ntaken to come in with an individual company retention level at the \nlevel that is being discussed now in this bill, would grant a huge \nwindfall. I think it is not justified and not good public policy, and \nthat is an issue that has to be dealt with. We have to decide, are we \nrepresenting the taxpayer or are we representing some other interest? \nIt seems to me to put the taxpayer at risk, to back up policies that \nhave already been sold, with no Government backup, where premiums have \nalready been collected on the basis that there would be no Government \nbackup, to now come up with a backup that is in the tens of millions \nrather than $10 billion, is to basically have the taxpayer enter into a \nsituation where the initial risk is borne largely by the taxpayer and \nnot by the insurance company.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that if this were World War II instead of \na new kind of war, we could have had a Government insurance program. We \nhad one in World War II. We had two kinds. We had one for international \nshipping and we had one for domestic assets. Both companies made money. \nBoth companies, when we signed the peace treaty on the Missouri, faded \nout. The problem now is this war will not end with a peace treaty on \nthe Missouri. It will end with the scream of some terrorist. But there \nwill not be a signed agreement that it is over, nor will we know that \nis the last terrorist in the world.\n\n  We have to decide if this is a transition bill that is trying to \nbuild these risks into the structure of insurance rates, or are we \ngetting the Government permanently in the insurance business in \nAmerica. That is a fundamental question. When we decided in October, we \nanswered the question. When this bill was written in December, we were \nforced into this low deduction by having only 3 weeks. Seven months \nlater, that makes no sense.\n  This is the issue that needs to be dealt with. I hope it can be \ncompromised on a bipartisan basis. As I said earlier, from the \nbeginning I have believed we needed a terrorism insurance bill.\n  Finally, I turn to the liability question, and I will be brief. We \nhave before the Senate the most modest proposal related to punitive \ndamages that has been discussed thus far in this bill. We had a \nbipartisan agreement that banned punitive damages outright, a complete \nban. The House adopted a bill that had extensive protections from \npredatory lawsuits in a terrorist attack. In my mind, to unleash \npredatory lawsuits after a terrorist attack is like piracy on a \nhospital ship. It is outrageous and unacceptable.\n  Now, the Senator from Kentucky has given a very watered down \ncompromise and, I think, a reasonable one, and to me acceptable--though \nI like the House provisions better; I like the proposal of the \nPresident better. What his compromise says is that you cannot sue \nvictims of terrorism for punitive damages. You can sue the terrorists, \nbut you cannot sue the victims, the people who were in the attack, the \npeople whose buildings and lives were destroyed, unless they have been \nconvicted of a felony related to the attack. In other words, they had \nsome measure of criminal culpability.\n  I don't know how anyone can be against this proposal. If you are \nagainst this proposal, you are basically willing to unleash predatory \nlawsuits on anyone--in this case, including victims of terrorism.\n  Let me conclude and yield the floor by urging my colleagues to vote \nfor the McConnell amendment. The President has said in a letter, \nthrough four spokesmen, including the Secretary of the Treasury, that \nhe will not sign a bill that does not protect people from predatory \nlawsuits that arise from a terrorist act. I hope my colleagues will \nvote for the McConnell amendment.\n  Second, I hope we can work out a compromise on this retention issue. \nWe should be able to work out a compromise. I commend to my colleagues \nthat we do it. If we do it, we can immediately transform this bill into \na bipartisan bill. We can get an overwhelming vote for it. We could end \nthe debate on it. If not today, certainly early next week.\n  There is work that has yet to be done. I hope we can do it together. \nThere is no reason we cannot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I will not be long. I rise in support \nof the McConnell amendment. I pick up on where the Senator from Texas \nleft off: This should be a bipartisan bill. There is no reason why in \ndealing with such a serious issue as this that we should not be able to \nwork in a bipartisan way with our colleagues in the Senate. That \napplies also to the House of Representatives and the President.\n  Everyone realizes this is a piece of legislation that must be done. \nWe are hearing from folks back home in the business and insurance \ncommunity as to the impact of not having any kind of terrorism \ninsurance fallback for these coverages, and the Federal Government does \nhave a role to play.\n  I serve on the Banking Committee, and I have expressed to my ranking \nmember some of my concerns for us being involved at all. However, I am \nconvinced there is some action we need to take in the short run to \naddress this crisis of businesses not being covered by terrorism \ninsurance, projects not moving forward because of the lack of terrorism \ninsurance. Obviously, there is a need to do this.\n  There are some areas that, frankly, that I do not believe belong in a \nbill dealing with this issue. The one that I believe is the most \negregious is a concept that is remarkable; that is, that victims of \nterrorism, who have been either physically or financially and certainly \nemotionally hurt by terrorists, will be liable to be sued.\n  Senator McConnell takes a very small part of this liability. I have a \nproblem with any victim being sued for anything. Think back to the days \nwe were at war. Can anyone imagine in previous years if someone in \nAmerica had been killed as a result of World War II, the Germans or the \nJapanese bombing someplace in America, that people in America would \nhave rushed to the lawyers and then to the courtroom to sue the \nrestaurant they worked in that was hit by the bomb? Can anyone imagine \nthe Senate, in 1941-42, passing a bill saying people who worked in a \nrestaurant in Hawaii when a bomb was dropped, that the waitress who \nworked in the restaurant could sue the restauranteur whose place was \ndestroyed for damages? On top of that, this bill says not just for any \ndamages but for punitive damages. In other words, damages having to do \nwith any kind of pain, suffering, injury, or loss of wages, but simply \nto punish the victim.\n  We will allow people who were injured economically, emotionally, \nphysically, as a result of an act of war--and this terrorist act was an \nact of war--to be sued under this bill.\n  Look back in history. I do not know that there is a precedent for \nallowing this during a time when we are at war. This was an act against \nAmerica. This is a very bad and dangerous step we are taking in the \nSenate.\n  What Senator McConnell is trying to do is a very small piece of the \noverall structure of this bill that allows, if the McConnell amendment \npasses, the restaurant owner of the World Trade Center, whose business \nwas destroyed--he may have escaped; maybe he was not there that day; \nhis business was destroyed, his employees were killed, maybe even \nfamily members were killed--will now be in court. Under this bill, he \nwill be in court defending himself from lawsuits. After going through \nwhat he has gone through, he now has to defend himself from lawsuits. \nBut worse, he has to defend himself from lawsuits that will seek to \npunish him because he was a victim. Imagine that.\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\n  One can make an argument--and I would not agree--he would have to pay \ncompensation for pain and suffering or wages, but now we will say he \nwill be liable to be sued, to be punished, and he was a victim of \nterrorism.\n  Victims of terrorism should not be punished. Victims of terrorists \nshould not be punished by the Senate. It should not be permitted. It is \nan outrage to every victim who suffered on September 11; if every \nvictim who suffered in September 11 owned anything that was destroyed, \nand had anyone working for them, they are now going to be on the firing \nline, again. It is not bad enough that they were hurt physically, \nemotionally, and economically as a result of terrorist acts. We are now \ngoing to put them through another act of destruction in the courtroom.\n  Even if this amendment is agreed to, that is going to occur. All we \nare saying is, Members of the Senate, don't allow lawyers--who \ncertainly will do so and certainly have done so already with past \nterrorist acts--come into court and attempt to punish victims. That is \nover the top. It is over the top. It is not necessary. It is inhumane.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After making this argument a week or so ago, the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers Association said there could be some \ncircumstances under which the defendant himself engaged in criminal \nbehavior. So I modified this amendment to include, if the victim of \nterrorism himself were convicted of a crime in connection with that \nevent, then punitive damages would lie because that would warrant \npunishment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But there are no other circumstances--I agree with my \nfriend from Pennsylvania--under which punitive damages ought to lie \nagainst the victim of terrorism. I thank the Senator for his \nobservations. I think he is right on the mark.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for further \nclarifying his own amendment. I think it is important to say if someone \nis, maybe, in complicity with a terrorist or did something with respect \nto his business that was, as the Senator from Kentucky said, criminal \nin nature, that would be prosecuted. Then I think it is a reasonable \nrecourse for some sort of civil damages to be awarded.\n\n  But to have a blanket provision that says every victim is a potential \ndefendant in a lawsuit, where the lawyer is saying you should be \npunished because you were a victim in a terrorist act, I find that to \nbe almost something that is so absurd; it is remarkable to me that we \nare even debating the existence of this provision.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator agree that if punitive damages were \navailable, they would be sought in every instance?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am a lawyer. I did practice law before I came here, \nbut not as much as many here. But I do know, one of the things that \nhappens when you file lawsuits is, you do not leave anything out. If \nyou have damages available to you, you file for them and you let those \nwho are responsible for making the decision as to what your plaintiff \nshould receive--whether it is the jury or judge--you let them decide \nwhat the plaintiff is permitted to receive.\n  There is no question in my mind. Imagine, that victims of terrorism--\n--\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me finish my statement, and then I will be happy \nto.\n  There is no question in my mind that there will be hundreds, if not \nthousands, of lawsuits where victims of terrorism will be sued for \npunitive damages in order to punish them because they were victims.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator has the floor and of course \ncan speak as long as he wishes. I do not mean to suggest otherwise.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was just about to finish.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We had an informal understanding that originally I was \ngoing to follow the Senator from Texas. If not, I will pass it on to \nthe Chair. I just wondered how much longer he might be.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was about to finish. I am happy to do so.\n  I encourage my colleagues, No. 1, as I said before, to see if we can \nwork out some sort of bipartisan agreement. This should not be a \npartisan bill. This should be a bill on which we work together in the \nSenate.\n  No. 2, I encourage, as a good starting point for that bipartisan \narrangement, to support this very minimalist amendment, with all due \nrespect to my colleague from Kentucky. It is a minimalist amendment to \neliminate the most egregious aspects of lawsuits available to \nplaintiffs who want to sue victims of terrorism; that they at least \nshould not be punished, pay compensation as a punishment, unless there \nwas some sort of criminal behavior attached to the victim.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I must oppose this amendment by my good \nfriend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to add controversial so-called \n``tort reform'' measures to the terrorism insurance bill. This \namendment would limit the legal rights of future terrorism victims and \ntheir families. That is not fair or just.\n  I have worked with the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Sarbanes and others to craft a balanced compromise in the \nsubstitute amendment on legal procedures for civil actions involving \nfuture acts of terrorism.\n  The underlying Dodd bill protects the rights of future terrorism \nvictims and their families while providing Federal court jurisdiction \nof civil disputes involving acts of terrorism and excluding punitive \ndamages from Government-backed insurance coverage under the bill. These \nprovisions do not limit the accountability of a private party for its \nactions in any way.\n  Further, the underlying Dodd bill fully protects Federal taxpayers \nfrom paying for punitive damages awards. Under the Dodd bill only \ncorporate wrongdoers pay punitive damages, not U.S. taxpayers as some \nhave incorrectly claimed on the Senate floor.\n  But the McConnell amendment would prohibit punitive damages in almost \nall civil actions covered by the bill. This latest offer excuses \nwanton, reckless, and even malicious conduct by a corporate wrongdoer. \nThe amendment provides that a corporate wrongdoer must have engaged in \ncriminal conduct and must have already been convicted under State or \nFederal law before it can held liable for punitive damages.\n  This is a ridiculously high standard that excuses and immunizes all \nsorts of bad acts that should be punished and deterred.\n  The McConnell amendment, for all practical purposes, eliminates \npunitive damages, which in turn, completely undermines the civil \njustice system. There is no effective punishment, and consequently no \nreal deterrent, for misconduct. Right now, the threat of punitive \ndamages makes would-be wrongdoers think twice.\n  Without the threat of punitive damages, callous corporations can \ndecide it is more cost-effective to continue cutting corners despite \nthe risk to American lives. This would let private parties avoid \naccountability in cases of wanton, willful, reckless or malicious \nconduct. That is outrageous and irresponsible.\n  Punitive damages are monetary damages awarded to plaintiffs in civil \nactions when a defendant's conduct has been found to flagrantly violate \na plaintiff's rights. Under this amendment, those plaintiffs will be \nvictims of terrorism and their families.\n  The standard for awarding punitive damages is set at the State level, \nbut is generally allowed only in cases of wanton, willful, reckless or \nmalicious conduct. These damages are used to deter and punish \nparticularly egregious conduct. Eliminating punitive damages totally \nundermines the deterrent and punishment function of the tort law.\n  The threat of punitive damages is a major deterrent to wrongdoing. \nEliminating punitive damages would severely undercut this deterrent and \npermit reckless or malicious defendants to find it more cost effective \nto continue their callous behavior without the risk of paying punitive \ndamage awards.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  For example, this amendment would permit a security firm to be \nprotected from punitive damages if the private firm hired incompetent \nemployees or deliberately failed to check for weapons and a terrorist \nact resulted. This amendment fails to protect the interests of victims \nof terrorism and their families.\n  I helped author the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund to take \ncare of any terrorism victim suffering physical injury or death. As a \nresult, I was open to public interest retroactive liability limits up \nto insurance coverage for the September 11th attacks, such as limits \nfor the airlines industry to keep them out of bankruptcy and limits for \nthe owners of the World Trade Center to rebuild.\n  But liability limits for future terrorist attacks are irresponsible \nbecause they may restrict the legal rights of victims and their \nfamilies and discourage private industry from taking appropriate \nprecautions.\n  Restricting damages against the wrongdoer in civil actions involving \npersonal injury or death, for example, could discourage corporations \nfrom taking the necessary precautions to prevent loss of life or limb \nin a future terrorist attack.\n  There is no need to enact these special legal protections and take \naway the rights of victims of terrorism and their families.\n  At a time when the American people are looking for Congress to take \nmeasured actions to protect them from acts of terror, these ``tort \nreform'' proposals are unprecedented, inappropriate and irresponsible. \nAt the very moment that the President is calling on all Americans to be \nespecially vigilant, this amendment is calling on all American \nbusinesses to avoid their responsibility for vigilance under existing \nlaw.\n  I am disappointed that some may be taking advantage of the situation \nto push ``tort reform'' proposals that have been rejected by Congress \nfor years. This smacks of political opportunism.\n  I cannot support rewriting the tort law of each of the 50 states for \nthe benefit of private industry and at the expense of future terrorist \nvictims and their families. I urge my colleagues to defeat this \namendment.\n  Madam President, the distinguished Presiding Officer has been as \ninvolved in getting compensation to victims of terrorism as anybody \nhere.\n  I raise these points on the floor that we all want to help victims of \nterror, and we will, but we don't want to give a wish list to anyone.\n  Medical laboratories specializing in nuclear medicine might know that \ntheir security system is broken. They say: Well, you know, it will take \na few hundred dollars to fix it, and we are not going to bother. So it \nstays broken for months. At the same time, even though they might put \nhigh-security locks on the room that houses its vault, they don't put \nsecurity locks on the storage room that houses nuclear materials.\n  Say during this period when it is operated without a functioning \nsecurity system a lab discovers various containers of nuclear matter, \nincluding dozens of vials containing radioactive iodine, are missing, \nand it fails to report that fact to local, State, or Federal \nauthorities and doesn't take any action to repair its security system. \nThis is not a far-fetched example.\n  Let us say that nuclear material is traced back to the laboratory and \nit is later used to fuel a ``dirty'' bomb that exposes American cities. \nUnder this amendment, you can't go back and prosecute that corporation. \nThey have no criminal prosecution. You can't go back. Come on. What is \ngoing to be the incentive for that corporation that failed to fix their \nsecurity system and to fix the locks on their doors? It is just another \nexample.\n  I see the distinguished acting majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, indicating \nwe will move to table. I have been told that the Republican leader may \nspeak before we do that. That being the case, I certainly don't want to \nmove to table if the Republican leader wishes to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the quorum call is called off, I be \nrecognized. I alert everyone that I will move to table. As everyone \nknows, the Republicans have their policy luncheons on Wednesdays, and \nwe have ours on Thursdays. I would really like to get the vote out of \nthe way before that time, if we could. We are going to go into a quorum \ncall awaiting the Republican leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following the calling \noff of the quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank Senator Reid for making sure I \nhave this opportunity to express myself before we go to a vote on this \nimportant issue.\n  I do think we need to move this legislation forward. I have met with \nindividuals, insurance companies, the construction industry, hotels, \nand others. As Senator Reid has pointed out, they are concerned about \nthe growing problem in this area in terms of coverage. I wish we could \nhave moved it earlier. There have been a lot of efforts on both sides \nto make it happen. We were not successful.\n\n  Now we do have it on the floor. Obviously, there are going to be some \nimportant amendments that will be offered to change some of the \nprovisions in the legislation. But I think this is one of the most \nimportant ones. The liability provisions in this legislation, or lack \nthereof, is a critical point. I am very much concerned about \njurisdiction and venue, where these actions might occur arising out of \nterrorism. I would be very concerned about the preemption of State \ncauses of action provisions that would be included.\n  But the most important point is, how would you deal with the punitive \ndamages issue? I have real concerns and problems with punitive damages \ncoming out of the U.S. Treasury as a result of an action involving a \nterrorist attack. So I hope we can find a way to resolve the problem.\n  Senator McConnell has been very diligent in staying behind this and \nworking to find an appropriate solution. I think he has come up with \none, and this is the key part of it. It says that to the extent \npunitive damages are permitted by applicable State law, punitive \ndamages may be recovered against a defendant in a civil action \ninvolving an act of terrorism only if ``the harm to the plaintiff was \ncaused by a criminal act or course of conduct for which the defendant \nwas convicted under Federal or State criminal law, including a \nconviction based on a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere.''\n  This is the right solution. This is a fair solution. It does not set \na precedent saying that there can be no punitive damages; it just says \nit can only occur under these conditions that were outlined where there \nwas a criminal act or course of conduct that led to the situation where \na terrorist could make this kind of attack or hit.\n  The President has made it clear that if we do not deal with this \nappropriately, he will not sign this legislation. So rather than trying \nto find a time to deal with it later, or to deal with it in conference, \nor, in effect, try to call either side's bluff, this is the right \nsolution. It does not set the precedent; it does provide for damages \nunder these certain circumstances where there has been neglect or \negregious action that led to the terrorist attack.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell proposal that I have \ncosponsored, and oppose the motion to table this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Chafee) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous \n     consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To restrict insurance rate increases for terrorism risks)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INSURANCE RATE INCREASES FOR TERRORISM RISKS.\n\n       (a) Calculations of Terrorism Insurance Premiums.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing parameters for insurance rate \n     increases for terrorism risk.\n       (2) Consultation.--In developing the regulations under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the NAIC and \n     appropriate Federal agencies.\n       (3) Modifications.--The Secretary may periodically modify \n     the regulations promulgated under paragraph (1), as necessary \n     to account for changes in the marketplace.\n       (4) Exclusions.--Under exceptional circumstances, the \n     Secretary may exclude a participating insurance company from \n     coverage under any of the regulations promulgated under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Separate Account Required.--If a participating \n     insurance company increases annual premium rates on covered \n     risks under subsection (a), the company--\n       (1) shall deposit the amount of the increase in premium in \n     a separate, segregated account;\n       (2) shall identify the portion of the premium insuring \n     against terrorism risk on a separate line item on the policy; \n     and\n       (3) may not disburse any funds from amounts in that \n     separate, segregated account for any purpose other than the \n     payment of losses from acts of terrorism.\n       (c) Limitation on Rate Increases for Covered Risks.--\n       (1) Existing policies.--Any rate increase by a \n     participating insurance company on covered risks during any \n     period within the Program may not exceed the amount \n     established by the Secretary under subsection (a).\n       (2) New policies.--Property and casualty insurance policies \n     issued after the date of enactment of this Act shall conform \n     with the regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection \n     (a).\n       (d) Refunds on Existing Policies.--Not later than 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, a participating \n     insurance company shall--\n       (1) review the premiums charged under property and casualty \n     insurance policies of the company that are in force on the \n     date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) calculate the portion of the premium paid by the policy \n     holder that is attributable to terrorism risk during the \n     period in which the company is participating in the Program; \n     and\n       (3) refund the amount calculated under paragraph (2) to the \n     policy holder, with an explanation of how the refund was \n     calculated.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield? I inquire, it is a \nquarter after 1, so we can give our colleagues an indication of time, \nhow much time would my colleague like?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. About 3 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while some Members are still in \nthe Chamber, I want them to understand an essential truth that a public \nwhich is averse to raising taxes is all the more averse to hiking \ninsurance premiums. Let me repeat that.\n  We all know that the consuming public is averse to raising taxes, and \nwe are sensitive to that fact, but equally or more sensitive is the \nissue of passing legislation that hikes insurance premiums, and that is \nwhat we are facing.\n  We have an underlying bill that is trying to solve a problem. The \nproblem is that terrorism has now become an insurance risk. In large \npart, this bill takes that risk off individual insurance companies and \nhas the Federal Government assume a large part of that risk, so much so \nin one computation, it is 80 percent of the risk; in another \ncomputation it is 90 percent of the risk.\n  In the very complicated formula of the bill, it has the \nresponsibility of each insurance company with a de minimis amount that \nit would pay out in the case of a terrorism incident and, mind you, \nthis is only a terrorism incident which is using conventional \nexplosives. It does not include--because they are exempt from almost \nall insurance policies--the terrorism risk when the terrorist uses \nchemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.\n  As a result, we are talking about a risk, as we learned on September \n11, in the totality of the picture of the risk, to the whole country \nand risk to individuals, businesses, owners of high-rises and large \nbusinesses, medium-size businesses and small businesses. We are talking \nabout a risk that, albeit still a substantial risk, it is a risk that \nin large part is being picked up by the Federal Government.\n  I do not object to that, and I will restate what I said this morning \nto my good friend and colleague and the sponsor of this legislation, \nSenator Dodd. If I had objected to that, we would not be on this \nlegislation because I was in the Chamber when the unanimous consent \nrequest was propounded last night, and I could have easily entered an \nobjection. I did not, and that is why we are on the bill.\n  I do not object to the Federal Government picking up a major part of \nthe terrorism risk, albeit only the conventional risk; it is not \nchemical, nuclear, or biological. What I do vigorously object to is \nthat in the underlying bill of the Senator from Connecticut, there is \nno process in place that can limit the rate hikes of the insurance \ncompanies with regard to the terrorism risk.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, what we do is leave all the State \ninsurance commissioners--and under the present scheme, and my colleague \nis a former commissioner and knows this better than I do, there are 40 \nStates that allow for rate increases to go into effect, and then the \ncommissioners can overturn those rate increases. In 10 States, the \nrates have to be approved before they go into effect.\n  In this bill we apply the standard used in the 40 States, but the \nState insurance commissioners do not lose their power to turn down that \nrate increase. We do not have anyone in the Federal Government doing \nthat, but we leave it at the State level for those rate determinations \nto be made at the local level. That is what the bill requires.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I was glad to yield to my colleague, and I \nhope he\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nwill interject these comments so we can have an honest and fair debate \nabout this issue because the very point that the Senator from \nConnecticut has made is the flaw of this bill. The 50 insurance \ncommissioners of this country usually do not set the rates on \ncommercial policies, and the ones who do, such as the State of Florida, \nset a range for rates, but that is with regard to all the conventional \ntypes of risk--theft, dog bite, slip and fall, and so forth.\n  The fact is that the 50 insurance commissioners, if they were to do \nwhat the Senator from Connecticut says, do not have any actuarial data \non which to make a judgment about whether or not a rate hike is \nactuarially sound for the de minimis terrorism risk that the insurance \ncompany is now assuming.\n  Wait, wait. Let me finish.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield so I may comment further?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will not yield. I will finish the answer and \nthen I will yield to the Senator.\n  My amendment sets a process in place. We have the Secretary of the \nTreasury. Now why would we go to the Secretary of the Treasury? Because \nthe insurance commissioners of the 50 States determine if rates are \nactuarially sound on the basis of an experience or on the basis of data \ncoming from an experience, and the fact is that the insurance \ncommissioners of the 50 States do not have that data and experience.\n  So in the Nelson amendment what we do is put into place a process by \nwhich actuarially sound judgments can be made on whether or not the \nrate hike is just right or whether the rate hike is too high or whether \nthe rate hike is not high enough. You mean it could not be high enough? \nIn fact, that is something we ought to know. We ought to know what is \nthe appropriate hike to cover the insurance risk that is being assumed \nby the insurance company since most of the terrorism risk is being \nassumed by the Federal Government.\n  For example, under the Nelson amendment, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall promulgate regulations establishing parameters for \ninsurance rates for terrorism risk. That says ``parameters.'' It does \nnot say he sets the rate. It says he sets the parameters.\n  Then what does it say? It says the Secretary of the Treasury is going \nto consult in developing the regulations of setting those parameters. \nThe Secretary shall consult with the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners and appropriate Federal agencies. Then we go on to give \nan escape valve, a safety valve. The Secretary may periodically modify \nthe regulations promulgated, as necessary, to account for the changes \nin the marketplace.\n  What do we give further on a safety valve? Then we say, under \nexceptional circumstances the Secretary may exclude a participating \ninsurance company from coverage under any of the regulations \npromulgated. So we give all kinds of leeway and exceptions, and yet we \nset up a process by which we can determine if rates are actuarially \nsound.\n  Now, why is this important? It happens to be important because guess \nwho is going to pay? If there is not an actuarially sound rate, guess \nwho is going to pay. The consuming public. You say, oh, no, this is \njust on tall buildings. So it is going to be the owner of a tall \nbuilding, a big business. Not so. That is a cost of doing business that \nis passed on to the consuming public.\n  So whether it is a football stadium, a shopping mall, a tall \nbuilding, a short building, wherever it is, a small business, a large \nbusiness, that cost, that rate hike that so many in the real estate \nindustry have decried because, in fact, they have experienced those \nrate hikes, as chronicled by this morning's Washington Post, in \ndowntown DC, rate hikes of 160 percent and above since last September, \nwhere do we think that is going and who do we think is going to pay it? \nIt is going to be the consuming public.\n  Because of that is why the Consumer Federation of America has \nendorsed this legislation. This is dated today. They say it would \nrequire the Secretary of the Treasury to set parameters for terror \ninsurance rates. This is the Consumer Federation of America. It would \nrequire insurers to issue rebates for terror insurance premiums \nalready, and I will explain that in a minute. It would require insurers \nto separately itemize terrorism rates on the insurance bill.\n\n  Let's talk about those two provisions. Why would we want to \nseparately itemize terrorism rates on an insurance bill? So the \nconsumer will know how much of their premium they are paying is going \nto pay for the terrorism risk. It is all a matter of mathematics. It is \nall a matter of calculations. It is all a matter of what is supposed to \nbe a determination to know if a rate is actuarially sound. If it is, as \nI hope it will be under the process that we are putting in place in \nthis amendment, then the consumer ought to know how much it is they are \npaying.\n  If one has a bank statement and they have an extra charge by the \nbank, certainly they want the consumer to know how much extra that bank \nis charging and for what. And so, too, with this. We set up a process \nwhich says they shall identify the portion of the premium insuring \nagainst the terrorism risk on a separate line item on the policy.\n  What we do also, as an accounting mechanism, is we cause the \ninsurance company to deposit the amount of the terrorism rate increase \nin a separate, segregated account so it does not get mixed in with all \nthe other premiums, so we can keep it highlighted, so we know what it \nis. Then when funds are disbursed to pay if a terrorist strikes and \nthere is an obligation on the part of the insurance company to pay, \nthen those funds would be distributed from that separate account. The \nconsumer would know how much of their premium they, in fact, are \npaying.\n  The other thing the Consumer Federation of America pointed out is \nthat this Nelson amendment would require insurers to issue rebates for \nterror insurance premiums already collected. What do we do there? This \nis a little complicated, but the essence of it is, if there is a policy \nin existence and we know that rates have been jacked up already, as has \nbeen indicated by this morning's Washington Post story, under the \nNelson amendment, if law, the Secretary of the Treasury would say that \nthe rate hike should not be this, which has already been imposed, but \ninstead should be this high. What about the difference over the \nremaining life of that policy--it may be only a few months left because \npolicies are issued on an annual basis, 1-year policies--that that \ndifference is going to be rebated to the consumer. What does that mean? \nThat means if the insurance company, as so many have already, hiked the \nrates, as indicated by this morning's newspaper story, up here, but the \nSecretary of the Treasury comes along and says after evaluating and \nconsulting that the rate hike ought to be here, not here, that for the \nremainder of the months of that policy the difference is going to have \nto be rebated to the consumer or to the policyholder, in this case \nmostly commercial policyholders.\n  So what we have is a commonsense amendment. It is an amendment that \nnot only will help the big real estate properties that have been \nputting the pressure on the majority leader to bring this to the \nfloor because they are feeling the heat of all these increased rates. I \ndon't blame them. I sympathize with them.\n\n  They need to understand what we are trying to do. Instead of letting \nit operate in the sphere of the insurance company determining what the \nrate should be, the real way to regulate what those rates would be is \nto collect data through the Secretary of the Treasury that determines \nif the rate is accurate.\n  This affects the big properties, but it affects little properties as \nwell. This underlying bill applies to commercial property and casualty. \nMany of these policies are held by small businesses whose insurance \npremiums have increased exorbitantly, significantly raising the cost of \nrunning their business. Commercial policyholders will ultimately pass \ntheir premium cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices for \nproducts and services. Offering rate protection will allow businesses, \nlarge and small, to obtain reasonably priced insurance, eliminating the \nneed to pass their cost on to consumers.\n  Discussing the question of whether or not insurance companies have \nhiked rates since September 11, we saw in this morning's paper:\n\n       Property insurance for the firm that manages the office \n     building at 1700 Pennsylvania\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\n     Avenue will cost twice as much as last year's $2 million \n     premium.\n\n  That is the first paragraph of the story in the newspaper.\n  The second paragraph:\n\n       At George Washington University, insurers have cut the \n     school's former $1 billion property and casualty policy in \n     half.\n\n  They cut the coverage in half, and they raised the premium at the \nsame time 160 percent. That is the second paragraph.\n  The third paragraph:\n\n       The National Geographic has been dropped by its workers' \n     compensation provider because of the perceived threats to \n     large concentrations of employees that are in the D.C. area.\n\n  This story, as well as many others, can give example after example of \nhow insurance rates have been hiked, which in large part has caused a \nnumber of real estate trade associations to start sounding the alarm \nthat the rates have gone up so much, they need some relief.\n  What has been said about this in the insurance industry? I am sad to \nsay what has been said is quite revealing. At the end of November, in a \nstatement quoting a Lloyd's of London investor newsletter quoted in the \nWashington Post, they said, when talking of the effects of September 11 \non the insurance industry premiums:\n\n       [There is a] historic opportunity [to make profits off of \n     9/11. Disaster insurance premiums have shot up to a level \n     where very large profits are possible.]\n\n  Doesn't that make your blood boil, that there would be people in the \nboardrooms of insurance companies who are considering the tragedy of \nSeptember 11 as an excuse to hike insurance premiums big time? Doesn't \nthat make your blood boil?\n  Another quote from the CEO of Zurich Financial Services from a \nReuters story at the end of November as well:\n\n       As respects to the terrorist attack of September 11, the \n     industry ``needed it to operate efficiently. The players who \n     are strong, in a responsible manner, and are aggressive, will \n     be the winners of the next 15 years.'' In other words, the \n     industry will profit from the price hikes they are now \n     trying to put in place.\n\n  Does that concern Members?\n  I come to the floor to offer an amendment on a bill that I question \nthe need for but I did not block because I thought it ought to be aired \nand discussed and voted on. I come to offer an improvement to that bill \non its fatal flaw. The fatal flaw is that it does not have a provision \nto protect consumers from rate hikes and rate gouging.\n  When dealing with insurance, consumers have to have two provisos: \nInsurance has to be available, and it has to be affordable. Part of the \nreason for the bill coming to the floor is that the perception is out \nthere, particularly among large real estate properties, that it is \nneither available nor affordable. What this amendment tries to do is, \nin making it available as the underlying bill does, in a huge Federal \nsubsidy--in other words, the Federal Government taking over most of the \ninsurance risk for terrorism risk--we are making it affordable by not \nletting the hikes go through the roof and all the way to the Moon.\n  Organizations such as the Consumer Federation of America, which point \nout they endorse this amendment to protect businesses and consumers \nfrom being gouged with unjustifiable rates, have endorsed this \nlegislation.\n  The underlying legislation I did not block because I thought it ought \nto come here, but I question whether this is the way we ought to \napproach it. It is using a sledgehammer in what otherwise ought to be a \nmuch more delicate procedure to solve the problem. What is the problem? \nThe problem is, some 8 or 9 months after September 11 certain \nproperties are still having difficulty getting insurance. Where are \nthose properties? They are generally in highly identifiable trophy \nproperties such as tall buildings, such as highly visited facilities \nlike stadiums, such as tourist attractions, such as ports that have \ncruise traffic. But there is a large part of America that is not like \nthat. Most of America does not have high-rise buildings. Most of \nAmerica is not highly, densely urbanized. Most of America is not the \nfinancial district of the country; namely, Manhattan in New York \nCity. Most of America is not the seat of Government of the United \nStates, Washington DC. Most of America has found its commercial \nproperties to be insured. Why? Because in the last 6, 7, 8 months, the \nmarketplace has responded.\n\n  In the last half year, money, capital, investments are flowing into \nthe reinsurance industry. Reinsurance is insurance for insurance \ncompanies to insure against catastrophe, such as the terrorism risk.\n  As a result of there being more supply of this money going into the \nreinsurance marketplace, the price of reinsurance has started to come \ndown. As a result of the price coming down, because there is more \ncapital available, it has started to ease the price that is being \ncharged to most of America.\n  So here we are, coming along with an underlying bill that says \nbasically we are going to hold the insurance company on any future \nconventional weapons terrorism risk only a little bit responsible. \nInstead, we are going to shift most of that terrorism risk over to the \nFederal Government of the United States.\n  For certain properties, I agree there is a legitimate need for the \nFederal Government to backstop insurance companies. Those are primarily \nyour trophy properties. But because the insurance marketplace has \nresponded over the last half year, we do not need to respond with this \nkind of legislation, and we surely do not need to respond with this \nkind of legislation which, in fact, has no ability to limit the rate \nhikes that will occur.\n  Thus, I offer my amendment as a means of process.\n  Let me close by saying this: Let's get it to its bottom line. Let's \nget it to its political raw. I am afraid if you vote for this without \nthe Nelson amendment, you or any Senator vote for this without the \nNelson amendment, a legitimate charge can be made that the Federal \nGovernment took over the biggest portion of the insurance terrorism \nrisk without a limitation on the insurance premium hikes.\n  I do not think any Senator wants to be accused of that. I say again, \nthe American public does not like you to vote for tax increases, but \nlet me tell you there is something they do not like even more. They do \nnot like people to vote on jacking up their insurance rates. You can \nmake this a much better bill by adopting the Nelson amendment, which \nwill put in place a process whereby the Secretary of the Treasury will \ndetermine if the rate is actuarially sound or if it is not. The \nSecretary of Treasury could be determining maybe it is not enough. But, \nthen again, he could be determining that maybe it is way too much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nthis amendment. Let me start out speaking for a moment about the \nunderlying legislation. Then I want to speak about the Nelson \namendment.\n  I am glad the Senate is finally acting on the whole question of \naffordable terrorism insurance. Over the past 6 to 8 months, I have \nheard from developers, lenders, and retailers in my State who are \nsaying this is getting very expensive. Basically a lot of construction \nprojects have been stalled or have fallen through the cracks. Some of \nthe major landmarks in Minnesota, such as The Mall of America, have had \ntrouble with their lenders. So I want to be honest with my colleagues, \nto me this is really about jobs. If the insurance is not there or it is \ntoo expensive, then the projects do not get built and planned \ndevelopment may not happen; jobs are lost. Therefore, I think the \nunderlying bill is important.\n\n  That is why I support the Nelson amendment. What the Nelson amendment \nsays is if the Federal Government is basically going to assume the \nfinancial risk of a terrorist act, then we should ensure that the \ninsurance industry is passing on this reduced risk in the form of lower \ninsurance premiums to businesses.\n  The background of my colleague from Florida is in this very area, and \nhe can speak about this with more expertise, but he is saying we do not \nwant to end up giving private insurance companies a blank check to \ngouge businesses. That is the real danger.\n  In other words, if the problem the Senate is trying to address is the \nskyrocketing costs of terrorism insurance, and we address it by \nreducing the liability of the insurance industry to acts of terrorism, \nthen we should make\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nsure the loop is closed and businesses are not charged exorbitant rates \nfor insurance the United States taxpayers are actually providing. I \nbelieve that is what the Nelson amendment says. Therefore, I think it \nis common sense. I think it will make terrorism insurance more \navailable. I think it will prevent the gouging of businesses. I think \nit will prevent us from giving just a blank check to this insurance \nindustry. That is why I support the amendment.\n  I think this amendment is good for our businesses. I also think this \namendment is in the spirit of the underlying bill. I think it does not \nin any way, shape, or form--I say to my colleague from Florida--negate \nor undercut this legislation. I just think it strengthens it. I think \nit closes a loophole and provides the additional protection we need to \nhave, to make sure that we, the taxpayers, are not underwriting the \ninsurance business which then gouges business. I believe that is what \nthis is about--strong probusiness and strong proconsumer.\n  If I could just take another minute or two, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may take 5 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2617 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that I believe the Senator \nfrom Florida is to some degree correct about his concern. I think his \nremedy is wrong, and I am not going to support it. But I believe there \nis a problem. I wish to try to set out what I think the problem is and \nwhy I don't think this is the remedy.\n  The problem is that, beginning in January of this year, huge numbers \nof insurance policies expired. We tried last year without success to \npass a bill. That effort went into mid-December. I am familiar with it \nbecause I was involved in it. Insurance companies sold policies \nbeginning in January, and we are in June. Policies have been sold. \nRates have gone up, as they had to go up because risks have gone up.\n  But if we come in now with a bill that has a very low retention, \nwhere the taxpayer is going to become the net payer before there is a \nsubstantial or mega loss--I remind my colleagues that when we first \nstarted debating this no one proposed that we go into business with the \ninsurance companies. No one has proposed--I don't think anybody \nproposed. Maybe I had better be careful because for every bad idea \nthere is a constituency. But I don't think anybody has proposed that we \nset up a Government insurance program.\n  The proposal has been that, once there is a cataclysmic loss, the \nFederal Government be the backup for insurance companies. The word that \nhas been used throughout the debate is the Federal Government would be \nthe ``backup.'' In October, when we were putting together a bill that \nhad a retention rate of $10 billion, which meant that private insurers \nhad to lose $10 billion before we stepped in and started to pay 90 \npercent of the costs, $10 billion is a cataclysmic loss.\n  What happened as the bill evolved in December, and when we were only \nweeks away from the bill going into effect, that $10 billion retention \ngot changed to individual company retentions. So the level at which the \ntaxpayer starts paying has gone down and down. Now we find ourselves in \na position where various interests that would have been delighted in \nOctober to have gotten the $10 billion retention now oppose it, wanting \nindividual company retentions.\n  The Senator from Florida is simply pointing out that to come in now \nwhere the Federal Government is going to pay out money before there is \na mega loss is going to create a situation where people have charged \npremiums and sold policies based on one set of circumstances.\n  We are about to change those circumstances. In doing so, you are \ngoing to have a net wealth effect. There is no question about it.\n  I think the solution is to change the bill before us and require a \nhigher level of loss--a higher level of ``retention,'' as it is called \nin the industry--so we simply move back to insure the kind of loss that \nno one was able to insure against in any case.\n  But I wanted to make it clear that there is some validity to the \nSenator's argument and concern about equity.\n  Having said that, I am very loathe to getting the Federal Government \nin the business of setting insurance rates. We have never done it \nbefore. It is something that has been done by the States. Those State \nregulations are still in place.\n  I know our distinguished colleague from Florida has been a State \ninsurance commissioner, and he understands how difficult it is to set \nthese rates. As difficult as it is for Florida and Texas, it would be \nmore difficult for the Federal Government because we have never done \nit.\n  I simply, again, make the point that I made earlier; that is, I think \nthere are two problems with this bill as it exists now. One is we are \nleaving victims of terrorism unprotected against predatory lawsuits. On \na straight party-line vote a minute ago, we decided to do that.\n  The second problem is that we have a retention level in this bill now \nthat is so low that it doesn't take into account the fact we have had 7 \nmonths where insurance has been sold with no Federal backup. Also, the \nmost critical point is that, if we want a reinsurance market to emerge, \nif we want to encourage syndication, you don't do that with individual \ncompany retention. I am afraid we are creating a hothouse plant here \nwhich will never get out of subsidization. We will never get out of \nthis business if we leave the bill the way it is now.\n  I am not saying that the $10 billion retention solves every problem \nin the bill. It doesn't. But at least it forces companies to syndicate, \nand it forces companies to be willing to purchase reinsurance. That \ncreates the profits to bring it into existence.\n  I intend to vote against the amendment of the Senator from Florida, \nbut I wanted to make it clear that he has raised an issue that the \ncurrent bill does not deal with. If this amendment is not successful, I \nhope we will find a way for dealing with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Senator from Florida, \nthe sponsor of this legislation. At approximately 3:15--he thinks that \nwould give everyone enough time to say what they have to say, and we \nhave a presentation to be made by Governor Ridge at 2:15--I alert \neveryone that we probably will have a vote at about 3:15 this afternoon \non this matter.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does that mean we will continue in session \neven while Governor Ridge is speaking?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Clinton \nbe a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3839\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on December 5, 2001, the Senate ratified \ntwo extremely important international treaties, the International \nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the \nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of \nTerrorism, both of which further our efforts in the worldwide war on \nterrorism.\n  Under the terms of these treaties, which were negotiated under the \nauspices of the United Nations, the United States and the other \ncountries who are signatories to the treaties, have obligated \nthemselves to prohibit acts of terrorism, or in support of terrorism, \nwithin their national borders. The signatories to these treaties are \ncommitted to fighting the global war against terrorism.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that would implement the terms of \nthese treaties by creating new criminal offenses for terrorists who \ndetonate bombs in public places, and for those individuals who aid \nterrorists by providing or collecting funds for use in terrorist \nactivities. I had hoped that\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nthere would be no need for such an amendment today. There is bipartisan \nsupport for passing implementing legislation.\n  I commend Senator Leahy for supporting almost identical legislation \nthat I am presenting and attempting to pass such legislation just last \nnight. The bill was cleared on the Republican side. However, I \nunderstand that the Democrats refused to pass it. That is most \nunfortunate, and I am disappointed in the Senate's failure to act.\n  This is critical legislation that we must enact promptly. As I have \nalready stated, the Senate already ratified these treaties on December \n5, 2001. the House of Representatives acted soon thereafter, on \nDecember 19, 2001, to pass a bill, H.R. 3275, which is identical to the \namendment I am offering today. There has been overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport for this legislation. H.R. 3275 was passed by a vote of 381-36. \nFor one reason or another, however, the bill has been stalled in the \nSenate.\n  I urge my colleagues to give their unanimous support to this \namendment. The President of the United States, as well as Treasury \nSecretary Paul O'Neill, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft, have all voiced support for this implementing \nlegislation. Indeed, we have an obligation under the treaties we \nratified to enact this legislation.\n  Here is what my amendment would do. It would meet our obligations \nunder the two treaties by prohibiting certain acts within our borders. \nWith respect to the Terrorist Bombings Convention, the legislation \nwould prohibit delivering or detonating an explosive or other lethal \ndevice in a public place, a transportation system, or a State or \ngovernment facility. With respect to the Terrorist Financing \nConvention, the legislation would prohibit providing or collecting \nfunds with the knowledge or intent that such funds be used, in full or \nin part, to finance an act of terrorism.\n  Mr. President, it is essential--now more than ever--that the United \nSates maintain its position at the forefront of nations in opposition \nto terrorism. This legislation fulfills our obligations under the \ntreaties we already have ratified. Identical legislation has already \npassed the House of Representatives. So I sincerely hope that we will \nadopt this amendment here today, and on its own, so that we can deliver \nit to the President to sign and thereby continue to lead the world in \nthe fight against terrorism.\n  Now, could I ask the Parliamentarian, is it possible for me to offer \nthis amendment as a second-degree amendment to the Nelson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Nelson amendment is subject \nto a second degree.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I will call up the amendment and offer it as a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't you just ask it be set aside and offer yours as \na first degree?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, instead of doing that, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we set aside the pending amendment, and I will offer this \nas a first degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah retains the floor during \nthe unanimous consent request.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I renew my request to set aside the Nelson \namendment, and send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATCH. Excuse me?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for such purpose.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from Utah \nhas asked--and everyone has agreed--that the Nelson amendment be set \naside, and his amendment would stand separate from that.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:15 today Senator Dodd or \nhis designee be recognized to offer a motion regarding the Nelson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would ask that you amend that unanimous \nconsent request so that I have 5 minutes to close before the vote on my \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. That would be fine that you would have 5 minutes and also \nthat the minority would have 5 minutes. So we would begin that at 5 \nafter 3 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3839.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 2600, the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Act of 2002. Naturally, I supported the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. I am very \ndisappointed I was unable to speak on the McConnell amendment before \nthe premature motion to table. I think most of us agree that something \nneeds to be done in this area. What we need to agree on is how to \nresolve the issue in a prudent and responsible manner that provides the \nappropriate stability to our economy without exposing our taxpayers to \nan unreasonable financial burden. Let me begin by stressing the \nimportance of this issue. Insurance plays a vital role in this country, \nnot just in helping in the recovery after a tragedy, but in the day to \nday operation of our national economy. We all know the devastating \nimpact the events of September 11th had on our Nation--the human cost \nalone. What some do not realize is the economic impact that has \nresulted and which will continue to have a negative effect on business, \nthe normal flow of commerce, and especially the jobs of everyday \nAmericans if we do not act and if we do not act responsibly. Insurance \nis necessary to the operation and financing of property and the \nconstruction of new property. Without insurance, our economic growth is \nin jeopardy, businesses will fail, and jobs will be lost. My \nconstituents have come to me on multiple occasions, imploring that the \nSenate act on this issue. They are genuinely concerned about the \nnegative impact lack of coverage will have on their businesses and on \ntheir employees.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated June 10, 2000, from the Treasury Department and signed \nby not only the Secretary of the Treasury but the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the Director of the National Economic \nCouncil and the Director of Economic Advisors--all urging that the \nCongress act to address this issue, but, most importantly, all noting \nthat it must be addressed in a reasonable and responsible manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The War on Terrorism must be fought on \n     many fronts. From an economic perspective, we must minimize \n     the risks and consequences associated with potential acts of \n     terror. No measure is more important to mitigating the \n     economic effects of terrorist events than the passage of \n     terrorism insurance legislation.\n       Last November 1, the Administration publicly agreed to \n     bipartisan legislation negotiated with Chairman Sarbanes, \n     Chairman Dodd, Senator Gramm and Senator Enzi. While the \n     House of Representatives quickly responded to this urgent \n     need by passing appropriate legislation, the Senate did not \n     act\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n     and has not passed any form of terrorism legislation in the \n     intervening seven months.\n       The absence of federal legislation is having a palpable and \n     severe effect on our economy and is costing America's workers \n     their jobs. In the first quarter of this year, commercial \n     real estate construction was down 20 percent. The disruption \n     of terrorism coverage makes it more difficult to operate, \n     acquire, or refinance property, leading to diminished bank \n     lending for new construction projects and lower asset values \n     for existing properties. The Bond Market Association has said \n     that more than $7 billion worth of commercial real estate \n     activity has been suspended or cancelled due to the lack of \n     such insurance. Last week, Moody's Investors Service \n     announced that 14 commercial mortgage-backed transactions \n     could be downgraded due to a lack of such insurance.\n       Without such insurance, the economic impact of another \n     terrorist attack would be much larger, including major \n     bankruptcies, layoffs and loan defaults. While we are doing \n     everything we can to stop another attack, we should minimize \n     the widespread economic damage to our economy should such an \n     event occur.\n       One important issue for the availability of terrorism \n     insurance is the risk of unfair or excessive litigation \n     against American companies following an attack. Many for-\n     profit and charitable entities have been unable to obtain \n     affordable and adequate insurance, in part because of the \n     risk that they will be unfairly sued for the acts of \n     international terrorists.\n       To address this risk at least two important provisions are \n     essential. First, provisions for an exclusive federal cause \n     of action and consolidation of all cases arising out of \n     terrorist attack like those included in the Air \n     Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, are \n     necessary to provide for reasonable and expeditious \n     litigation.\n       Second, the victims of terrorism should not have to pay \n     punitive damages. Punitive damages are designed to punish \n     criminal or near-criminal wrongdoing. Of course such \n     sanctions are appropriate for terrorists. But American \n     companies that are attacked by terrorists should not be \n     subject to predatory lawsuits. The availability of punitive \n     damages in terrorism cases would result in inequitable relief \n     for injured parties, threaten bankruptcies for American \n     companies and a loss of jobs for American workers.\n       It is also clear that the potential for massive damages \n     imposed on companies that suffer from acts of terror would \n     endanger our economic recovery from a terrorist attack. \n     Indeed, the added risks and legal uncertainty hanging over \n     the economy as a result of last September 11th are major \n     factors inhibiting a business willingness to invest and to \n     create jobs. It makes little economic sense to pass a \n     terrorism insurance bill that leaves our economy exposed to \n     such inappropriate and needless legal uncertainty.\n       The bipartisan public agreement reached between the \n     Administration and Chairman Sarbanes, Chairman Dodd, Senator \n     Gramm and Senator Enzi last fall provided these minimum \n     safeguards. We would recommend that the President not sign \n     any legislation that leaves the American economy and victims \n     of terrorist acts subject to predatory lawsuits and punitive \n     damages.\n       The American people and our economy have waited seven \n     months since our public agreement on legislation. The process \n     must move forward. Prompt action by the Senate on this \n     vitally important legislation is needed now.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n       Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Mitchell E. Daniels,\n       Director, Office of Management and Budget.\n     Lawrence Lindsey,\n       Director, National Economic Council.\n     R. Glenn Hubbard,\n       Director, Council of Economic Advisors.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. My colleagues from Kentucky and Connecticut have already \nreferred to this letter, but I would like to highlight a few of the \nspecific points conveyed in that letter.\n  Quoting the letter:\n\n       In the first quarter of this year, commercial real estate \n     construction was down 20 percent. The disruption of terrorism \n     coverage makes it more difficult to operate, acquire, or \n     refinance property, leading to diminished bank lending for \n     new construction projects and lower asset values for existing \n     properties. The Bond Market Association has said that more \n     than $7 billion worth of commercial real estate activity has \n     been suspended or cancelled due to the lack of such \n     insurance.\n       Without such insurance, the economic impact of another \n     terrorist attack would be much larger, including major \n     bankruptcies, layoffs and loan defaults.\n\n  This letter really underscores the serious ramifications to our \neconomy that have resulted from a lack of coverage for terrorist acts \nand supports congressional action in this area. However, it seems to me \nwe ought to do it in a responsible manner. The letter goes on to state:\n\n       One important issue for the availability of terrorism \n     insurance is the risk of unfair or excessive litigation \n     against American companies following an attack. Many for-\n     profit and charitable companies have been unable to obtain \n     affordable and adequate insurance, in part because of the \n     risk that they will be unfairly sued for the acts of \n     international terrorists . . . It makes little economic sense \n     to pass a terrorism insurance bill that leaves our economy \n     exposed to such inappropriate and needless legal uncertainty.\n\n  In the event of a terrorist attack it is contrary to commonsense to \nplace unlimited exposure on companies--who are themselves victims of \nthat attack--for the criminal acts of third parties, the terrorists. I \ndo not suggest that we should limit the recovery of economic damages of \nan injured victim if there is culpability on the part of a business. \nHowever, we must provide some stability in the litigation process by \nstreamlining a Federal cause of action and not allowing punitive \ndamages unless criminal conduct is proven, as the distinguished Senator \nso aptly argued in the prior amendment. Punitive damages are designed \nto punish the defendant, not compensate the victim. I ask my \ncolleagues, is it fair to punish a defendant business for the criminal \nacts of a third party?\n  The President may well veto any measure that unreasonably exposes \ntaxpayers and fails to provide stability to our economy. We need to act \nin this area, but if we fail to do so in a responsible manner, \nlegislation may never be enacted and we will have failed in our \nresponsibility.\n  My colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, has offered an \namendment that I think is both reasonable and necessary to ensure that \nwe address this issue in the proper and most effective manner. His \namendment provides for a Federal cause of action and consolidation of \nmultiple actions relating to the same event by the panel on \nmultidistrict litigation. When we are dealing with a catastrophic \nevent, it makes sense to have a process in place that avoids \ninconsistent judgments in multiple courts which could result in \ndisparate treatment of victims.\n  This amendment of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky does not \nban punitive damages. Let me restate, it does not ban punitive damages. \nIt ensures that punitive damages are not counted as an insured loss \ncovered by the Government backstop, as does S. 2600. Senator \nMcConnell's amendment goes on to provide that punitive damages will be \navailable to a claimant, if State law so provides, but only if criminal \nconduct by the defendant is proven. This is reasonable and just. \nWithout this limitation, then we are in effect punishing victims of \nterrorism and lining the pockets of the trial lawyers, not the victims. \nMy colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to think that if they \nmerely provide that the Government will not cover punitive damages that \nis all that is necessary. I submit that the provision regarding \npunitive damages in S. 2600 actually compounds the problem. Insurance \ncompanies do not generally cover punitive damages, so those that are \nreally at risk of bearing the brunt of the terrorist attacks are the \ninsured businesses, businesses that provide jobs. Do we really want to \nundercut the real purpose of enacting Federal terrorism insurance \nlegislation?\n  Senator McConnell's amendment has another important aspect--\nsettlement approval by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the Government \nis going to act as a backstop for insurance, then we must ensure that \nthe Government's generosity is not abused. An approval mechanism such \nas that proposed by Senator McConnell will work to ensure that any \nsettlement of a claim is justified and supportable by the underlying \nfacts and not a rush to the courthouse so that the trial lawyers can \ncash in and the defendants can reach their, what is in essence a \ndeductible limit, resulting in the Government responsibility kicking in \nprematurely.\n  We are seeking to provide stability to our economy, but S. 2600, as \ncurrently written, will actually hurt those we are trying to help. If \ngiven the opportunity I would have urged my colleagues to support this \namendment so that we can provide the necessary stability to our economy \nin an appropriate manner.\n  I hope before this debate is over we can return to this issue and \nresolve it. It is hard for me to support a bill such as this if we \ndon't resolve this type of problem, because we are creating problems, \nnot resolving them. Frankly, it is\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nabout time that we do what is right around here rather than what is \npolitically important to one side or the other.\n  This is a very important bill. I want to vote for it. I want to \nsupport it. I want to see that our businesses are protected. I want the \nFederal Government to step to the plate. But I want them to do it under \nthe right circumstances with well-written laws that will make a \ndifference in the fight against terrorism but will not destroy \ncompanies or businesses or jobs, which is what I think this current \nbill will do.\n  I appreciate the leadership of those who are trying to resolve this \nproblem and who have brought this bill to the floor. I want to support \nthem, but we have to start worrying about what works economically, what \nworks legally, what is fair legally, what really should be done. We \nhave to punish the perpetrators and not punish those who are the \nvictims.\n  In many cases, the bill as written does not solve those problems. I \nthink we should spend a little more time in trying to find some common \nground to help resolve these problems.\n  Good trial lawyers don't need punitive damages. If they are really \ngood, they can still get tremendous judgments and awards against those \nwho are negligent, those who haven't done what is right. But when you \nallow punitive damages, that can lead to runaway juries and other \nproblems. As an example, States such as Nevada have had so many medical \nliability cases brought now that they are losing their obstetrician-\ngynecologists, neurosurgeons, and other surgeons. Physicians are going \nto other States or they are just getting out of the business. That is \nstarting to happen all over America because we are not approaching \nthese problems in ways that really make sense. On this bill, we ought \nto approach it in a way that makes sense.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe Senator Leahy from Vermont will \ntalk with the Senator from Utah about his amendment which, except for \nthe word ``terrorism,'' is unrelated to the substance of the underlying \nbill. I think the effort was to make that a freestanding proposal to \ndeal with implementation of a convention dealing with terrorism. My \nhope is that the members of the Judiciary Committee will work on this \nto see if they can't resolve that matter to have it be dealt with as a \nfreestanding proposal rather than as an amendment.\n  The reason I say that to my friend and colleague from Utah is that if \nwe begin to open up this bill to matters unrelated to the subject \nmatter, we will delay enactment of this bill. It may die here on the \nfloor. If Members are interested in seeing us get something done on \nterrorism insurance, we need to stick with amendments related to the \nsubject matter.\n  My friend from Florida has offered an amendment related to the \nsubject matter. I may disagree with him on the amendment, but I \nappreciate the fact that we are offering language that relates directly \nto what is before us.\n  I know Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is \nworking his way over here to talk with the Senator from Utah. Maybe \nthey can resolve this matter and there can be a way to deal with this \nrather than having us necessarily get caught up in extensive debate on \nthe implementation of a convention in the midst of the terrorism \ninsurance bill, which is of concern to me, that we would end up off on \na tangent and not get the matter before us considered properly.\n  I see my colleague standing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be happy to work with the \ndistinguished Senator and listen to any suggestions that are made.\n  I think it is very pertinent to this bill. I would like to work with \nhim. I am open and will be happy to get our two staffs together.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Utah. I hope \nmy other colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have heard his \nstatement. That seems to leave the door open for some possible \nresolution of the matter.\n  Let me address the Nelson amendment. My colleague from Florida has \noffered an amendment that comes in several parts. I will emphasize to \nhim that the first parts of it deal with basically having the Secretary \nof the Treasury, as I read it, becoming an insurance regulator, a \nFederal insurance regulator.\n  I will hold some hearings, as the chairman of the Securities \nSubcommittee, with the permission and approval of the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Sarbanes. But we want to hold hearings at some point \non the whole issue of a Federal regulator of insurance. That is a very \nimportant debate and discussion.\n  I know the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has a significant \ninterest in that subject, as does my colleague from New Jersey. It is a \nvery divided constituency within the insurance constituency as to \nwhether there ought to be a Federal regulator or not. That is going to \nrequire a number of hearings as to whether or not we want to make that \nstep and move forward.\n  I do not have an opinion on that issue one way or the other.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senator raised a very \nlegitimate question. I think that ought to be hashed out. However, the \nSenator's bill does self-destruct at the end of year 2002, unless it is \nextended by the Secretary for 1 more year.\n  Mr. DODD. That would be 1 year. The bill before us is only a 2-year \nbill. So it is 1 year and a second year if the Secretary of the \nTreasury agrees to it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is correct. Therefore, we are not talking \nabout this Senator's amendment having any kind of permanent regulation \nof rates at the Federal level. Rather, we are looking at a process to \naffect this specific bill having to do with terrorism rates of which \nthe Federal Government is picking up 80 or 90 percent.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will concede that point because this is a \n2-year bill that sunsets. Obviously, we are talking about if all of a \nsudden the Department of the Treasury--is going to set rates and engage \nin all of the activities that a normal insurance commissioner would, on \na Federal level it is going to require a rather significant step \nforward.\n  Let me address this. The one point the Senator from Florida has \nraised with which I agree--the language is different, but I think the \npoint is the same. In the underlying bill, on page 12, lines 7 through \n12, paragraph 2, under conditions for Federal payments:\n\n       No payment may be made by the Secretary under subsection \n     (e) unless . . . (2) the participating insurance company \n     provides clear and conspicuous disclosure to the policyholder \n     of the premium charged for insured losses covered by the \n     Program and the Federal share of compensation for insured \n     losses under the program.\n\n  In effect, it is separate accounting so that we have a very clear \naccounting procedure which allows that whatever premiums are collected \nfor terrorism insurance would be accounted for separately from other \npremiums collected. The language the Senator from Florida has is even \nmore explicit. It requires segregation of the funds and the like. I \ndon't disagree with him on that part of his amendment, that we ought to \nhave separate accounting.\n  Secondly, in response to some comments made by my colleague from \nFlorida, there are significant reporting requirements. Let me remind my \ncolleagues again, what we have done with the underlying bill is \nmaintain the important role of State insurance commissioners. Rates \nwill be set by insurance commissioners at the State level. Now they are \ndone differently.\n  I will repeat the point. Under existing law in the 50 States, 40 \nStates presently allow rates on property and casualty in the commercial \nfield to go forward, and then the commissioner can rule that the rate \nis too high. In 10 States, the State law prohibits any rate increase \nprior to approval by the State commissioner's office.\n  Under this bill, we do a number of things. One of the things we do \nhere is follow what 40 States do. In other words, under this, we will \nallow for rate increases to occur, but we in no way undercut the \nhistoric role of State commissioners then to oppose a rate increase. So \nwe maintain a very strong role for the insurance commissioners.\n  Why? Because, obviously, the expertise is there. They have the shops \nand the personnel to do it. To all of a sudden allow one Federal \nregulator, the\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nDepartment of the Treasury, to do that would be asking too much, and it \nwould be very difficult for the apparatus to be set up.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a series of \nquestions?\n  Mr. DODD. At some point I will, but let me get through my statement. \nLet me tell you some of the reporting requirements we have here and why \nthis would be.\n  The Senator's amendment does set up the Secretary of the Treasury to \nbe the regulator. There may be Members who believe that is a \nprogressive step. I think it is dangerous.\n  Secondly, it would have the effect of a price control, trapping \ncapital for many issues that do not experience a loss attributable to \nacts of terrorism. I don't think we want to do that. We are not trying \nto facilitate a clogging up of the commercial process that is ongoing.\n  Thirdly, with regard to the reports, the Secretary must report to \nCongress 9 months after date of enactment on the availability and \naffordability of the insurance for terrorism and a reflection on the \nimpact on the U.S. economy.\n  The Secretary must report to Congress 9 months after the date of \nenactment on the availability of life insurance and other lines of \ninsurance coverage. We only deal with property and casualty. There is a \nlegitimate issue being raised about other forms of insurance that we do \nnot cover in this bill.\n  Also, participating insurance companies must report their terrorism \npremium rates to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \nevery 6 months. These reports will be forwarded from the NAIC to the \nTreasury Department, the Commerce Department, the Federal Trade \nCommission, and the General Accounting Office. These agencies would \nsubmit a joint report to Congress summarizing and evaluating the data \nthey receive from the NAIC. The GAO will report to Congress on its \nevaluation of the agency reports. We are trying to get as much internal \ninformation as we can coming through here so we can provide additional \ndata when it comes to rate increases.\n  There is a very important point to make about insurance \ncommissioners. Insurance commissioners not only set rates, what \npremiums can be charged, but in every State they bear the \nresponsibility of seeing to it that insurance companies that do \nbusiness in their States are solvent. That is a critical issue for \nconsumers. In fact, if they hold policies under an insurance company \nand that company lacks solvency, then obviously those consumers are in \njeopardy of not having their claims paid if some event occurs. I am not \njust talking about terrorism insurance here. So the dual responsibility \nof insurance commissioners is to not only set rates, but also to make \nsure that the companies themselves are solvent.\n  Again, this is not terribly complicated when it comes to the \npolitical questions. It doesn't take a lot to attack an insurance \ncompany. That is a safe bet politically. People don't like rate \nincreases, and they know the difficulties they can have when claims are \nfiled.\n  The problem is, if you are opposed to the idea of insurance \ncompanies, vote against the bill. I guess that is a simple answer; it \nis probably a safe bet if that is your concern. If you are worried at \nall, as you ought to be, about the fact that banks are not providing \nthe loans to major commercial enterprises because of the absence of \nterrorism insurance, and you hear, as we have, from the AFL-CIO, as \nwell as others, that there is a growing job loss over this, it is \ncausing a problem economically, and when you already have 10 percent of \nthe commercial mortgage markets and the secondary-market-backed \nsecurities already in the first quarter not forthcoming in the bond \nmarket, these are signals that we have a problem economically.\n\n  If you want the Federal Government to be an insurance company, you \nought to vote for the amendment of the Senator from Florida. That is \nwhat we did in World War II. If you believe it makes sense in the \nlonger term to have the private sector involved in insurance and not \nthe Federal Government, then it seems to me you ought to vote against \nthis amendment and vote for the underlying bill. That is a choice you \nhave to make. In a few hours, you can make that choice.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Florida runs the risk of providing \na program that I don't think is workable, except for the point I \nmentioned earlier. I don't disagree with my colleague about having an \naccounting process that makes it possible for us to distinguish between \npremiums collected for terrorism insurance and for nonterrorism \ninsurance.\n  I hope that when this amendment comes up for a vote in about an hour, \nor less than that, my colleagues will do what I think is the \nresponsible thing to do here, and that is reject this amendment. I have \ntold my colleague from Florida I am happy to work with him on the \nprovision dealing with the accounting question because I agree with him \non that. I think we want to have clear accounting so we know what is \ngoing on.\n  With all due respect--and he is a good friend, and I have great \nrespect for him, and I admire the work he did as insurance commissioner \nof the State of Florida--providing the Secretary of the Treasury the \nability to become an insurance regulator goes too far, in my view. To \nrequire segregation of these accounts entirely would run the risk of \ninsurance commissioners at the local level being able to guarantee the \nsolvency of these companies to do business in their States, which you \nknow, as a former insurance commissioner, is a critical part of the \nfunction of an insurance commissioner at the State level.\n  For those reasons, I strongly urge that my colleagues reject this \namendment.\n  I see my friend from Massachusetts. I am wondering what is on his \nmind. Let me suspend for 1 minute, Mr. President.\n  Our colleague from Massachusetts informs me there is a markup of a \nbill that may require the presence of both the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will be happy to run downstairs with the \nSenator from Connecticut to make a quorum if we can come back and \nresume and I can ask the Senator a series of questions.\n  Mr. DODD. I am always glad to do it. I will be happy to hear the \nquestions. I do not know how well I can respond to them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have completed my remarks in response to \nthe amendment of my friend from Florida. He has a series of questions, \nso I will be happy to yield to my colleague for the purpose of asking \nsome questions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Again, \nthis was another experience where we had to temporarily suspend the \ndebate in order to go downstairs to the Foreign Relations Committee to \nprovide a quorum so we could vote out a very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  First, I wish to ask a couple of questions about which we agree.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has a provision in his bill that says:\n\n       The participating insurance company provides clear and \n     conspicuous disclosure to the policyholder of the premium \n     charged for insured loss covered by the program.\n\n  ``Provide clear and conspicuous disclosure.'' Listen to the language \nin my amendment with regard to the same issue, and see if the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Connecticut does not think that the \nlanguage I have would not be something of an improvement by making it a \nlittle more specific. I am referring to page 2 of my amendment, line \n18. The lead into it is:\n\n       If a participating insurance company increases annual \n     premium rates on covered risks under subsection (a), the \n     company--\n       (2) shall identify the portion of the premium insuring \n     against terrorism risk on a separate line item on the policy \n     . . .\n\n  The reason we put that there is it is my experience that if you do \nnot nail down general language and be very specific, it will not end up \non the policy on a separate line so that the consumer\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\ncan see how much they are being charged for the insured risk, in this \ncase the terrorism risk.\n  I ask the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut if he would \nconsider that later on as a perfecting amendment to his language on \npage 12, the paragraph starting at line 7?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as a procedural matter, obviously we are not \nin a position to do that. I told my colleague in conversations we have \nhad about his amendment that I will be happy to work with him to \ntighten up, if he believes it is necessary, the language in the \nunderlying bill. Obviously, what is before us is a much larger \namendment that covers a lot of other subject matters other than just \nthe issue of separation of accounting.\n\n  I will state for the record as well, he may prevail with his \namendment. If he does, then obviously all of his language gets \nincluded. If his amendment fails when voted upon, then I will be happy \nto work with him to see if we cannot tighten up the language to such a \ndegree that will satisfy him and satisfy our concerns as well.\n  At this point, for me, in the midst of a floor action, to work on \nlanguage is not the most appropriate setting for doing that, and \nprocedurally it is awkward, obviously, with an amendment pending. We \nhave to set that aside and take language, and I prefer we do it in the \nway I suggested.\n  If the amendment of the Senator from Florida prevails, the issue \nbecomes moot. If he does not prevail, he has my commitment to work on \nlanguage to tighten up and do what he wants to do and what we are \ninterested in doing as well, and that is getting a very clear \naccounting, have a very clear understanding of the difference between \npremiums collected for terrorism insurance and premiums collected for \nnonterrorism insurance, so we can have a better understanding over the \nnext 2 years or 3 years, depending on how long this program is going to \ngo if other amendments are adopted.\n  The Senator already made note of the fact that we are dealing with a \n24-month bill, and that is only the second 12 months if the Secretary \nof the Treasury decides to extend the program for an additional year.\n  As it is presently worded, this will expire, assuming it is enacted \nover the next week or two and signed into law, let's say, sometime \naround the middle of July. Twelve months from now this whole program \nwill be over.\n  Our fervent hope is that by that time, the costing of this product \nand the other issues we talked about today will kick in and get the \nFederal Government out of this entirely and let the private sector deal \nwith this issue as they have historically. But for the events on 9-11, \nwe would not be here. The fact that there was a $50 billion event, \nwhich vastly exceeded what the reinsurance industry could calculate \nwould be the cost, has understandably caused the industry to back up in \nterms of its willingness to provide insurance coverage for events they \nno longer can cost out, at least effectively in their minds, absent, of \ncourse, a series of other events which no one knows will be the case.\n  That is how costing out occurs with natural disasters. After a number \nof years when you have certain hurricanes, as my friend from Florida \nknows, it is easier for them to cost events when there are a series of \nevents they can judge over a series of years.\n  Because this is such a unique event, what happened here--and we hope \nthis is the last time it ever occurs--but in the absence of having a \nseries of events, it is very difficult for them actuarially to \ndetermine what costs are in order to set premiums.\n  I will be happy to work with my colleague from Florida under the \ncircumstances that I have described.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut yield for a further series of questions?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does the Senator's bill require terrorism \npremiums to be held in a separate account?\n  Mr. DODD. No, it does not.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator want to propound why it \nshould not be in a separate account?\n  Mr. DODD. If we look at the accounting and start setting up separate \naccounts, then in a sense capital is being trapped, and I do not think \nwe want to do that. At least I do not want to do that; others may want \nto do it. That is one of the issues, solvency.\n  As a former insurance commissioner, the Senator from Florida knows \nthat no company can do business in his State unless they are solvent, \nunless they have in reserve adequate enough resources to respond to the \nclaims that can occur from a natural disaster or other types of \ninsurance that may be provided. So solvency is critically important.\n  If we start segregating accounts, we get into the issue of capital \nadequacy. So I think I would be unwilling to require segregation of \naccounts. I think if we have an accounting of them, we would achieve \nthe same result.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will merely respond before I ask my next \nquestion by saying that we have clearly a separate matter because all \nthe other premiums with regard to all the other risks--be it wind, \nhail, dog bite, slip and fall, construction malfunction, whatever the \nrisk is--is not subsidized by the Federal Government as we are doing \nwith this bill where the Federal Government is taking a part of the \nrisk.\n  It seems to me that it makes common sense that since the Federal \nGovernment is getting into the business of terrorism insurance in such \na big-time way, that we ought to separate out the premiums in a \nseparate account, purely from an accounting function, so there is no \nquestion that those terrorism premiums get commingled with all the \nother premiums and suddenly we do not know how much that is.\n  I further ask the distinguished Senator, does the Senator's bill \nrequire that premiums collected for terrorism risk be used for \nterrorism losses only?\n  Mr. DODD. Responding to my colleague, first, we are dealing with a 2-\nyear bill. This is not in perpetuity. It is over 24 months. To all of a \nsudden require a whole bunch more segregation of accounts and setting \nup apparatuses to do it, seems to me, an overreaction. If we were \ntalking about a permanent program, then my colleague's case may have \nmore validity.\n  If we look back at the language of the bill in our accounting, it \nrequires in the language, as he read, a very clear and conspicuous \ndisclosure to the policyholder of the premium charged for insured \nlosses covered by the terrorism insurance program. Now, clear and \nconspicuous seems to be about as clear and conspicuous as language \ncould be.\n  For a 24-month bill, my point would be that we are overreacting by \nrequiring the separate accounting. And not getting into the business of \nsegregating accounts and all of the costs associated with that seems to \nme to satisfy and should satisfy a majority of us. I think people have \nlooked at this and have the same kind of concerns that our colleague \nfrom Florida has raised.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will allow me to continue with \nanother couple of questions, I would merely respond to the \ndistinguished Senator's comments, that here is an example today on the \nfront page of the Washington Post, that we are talking about rates \nbeing hiked using the terrorism risk as an excuse. Therefore, I clearly \nimplore the Senate that it makes common sense, if rates are going to be \nhiked for terrorism risk, make sure it is those rate premiums that are \npaying the terrorism losses, and not going into the general fund and \nsuddenly all of the premiums get jacked up. If we are going to jack \nrates higher than the Moon, then let us at least segregate them so they \nare there for what they are purported to be there for, and that is to \npay for a terrorism loss. That is what I would propound to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. In response, I think the story in the Washington Post this \nmorning, in fact, makes the case of why we are here. Those rates are \ngoing up on the National Geographic building and on the Washington Post \nitself. There were several other enterprises. George Washington \nUniversity, for instance, is mentioned in the article. That is done in \nthe absence of this bill.\n  As I described apparently not very well a few minutes ago, costing \nthis kind of an event, 9-11, is very difficult. So the insurance \nindustry is out there and it is going to protect itself. We believe \nwith this bill being a backstop for a couple of years we could help put \nthe\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nbrakes on exactly the kind of story the Senator is reading from the \nWashington Post.\n  If my colleague is worried about premium rate increases, it seems to \nme that while our bill is not perfect, there is a greater likelihood we \nare going to be able to protect consumers more against rate increases \nhaving passed this bill, making the case that now there is a backstop \nso that the kind of exposure that they would be subjected to in the \nabsence of this bill would be less.\n  If we do not pass this bill, if it is voted against, or a Federal \nregulator is created and there is a lot of other unnecessary \nbureaucracy, then we run the risk of not only what happened in \nWashington happening elsewhere--in fact, it is happening. We already \nknow that terrorism insurance is not available in a lot of places, and \nwhere it is, it is very costly. We want to do what we can to stop the \ntremendous increase in that cost. That is what brings us here. That is \nwhy, as well--I made the point earlier and I make it again--we require \non page 12 of our bill that there be a very clear disclosure of what \npremiums are being charged. We put that right in the bill, clear and \nconspicuous to policyholders, what the premiums are and what the \ndistinction is between premiums collected for that and premiums \ncollected for other forms of insurance.\n  We do not go as far as my colleague from Florida does by requiring \nsegregation of accounts, but we think that provision for 24 months is a \ngood consumer protection provision, and it will give us the kind of \ninformation we need to have.\n  The three reports I have mentioned are rather extensive involving the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, the GAO, the Commerce \nDepartment, the Treasury Department, the Federal Trade Commission, all \nrequiring information be gathered so we can get, within 6 months, some \nclear indication of how this is working.\n\n  In conclusion, I say to my colleague from Florida, I will be the \nfirst to admit I cannot tell him that the Senator from New Jersey; the \nSenator from Maryland; the two Senators from New York, Mrs. Clinton and \nMr. Schumer; and I have written a perfect bill. If the Senator is \nasking me to say that, I cannot say that because we are in uncharted \nwaters in many ways. So we are trying to respond to a problem that \nexists.\n  We know for a fact that there is a major slowdown in our economy \nbecause major projects have either been cancelled or stalled because \nthey cannot get the financing necessary to go forward. The reason they \ncannot get the financing is because they cannot get the insurance. \nEvery homeowner in America knows what I am talking about. If they \ncannot get insurance, then their banker is not going to lend them the \nmoney for the mortgage. That is a fact of life. That is just as true in \ncommercial enterprises as it is in residential.\n  With the absence of insurance, the banks do not lend the money. The \nprojects do not go forward and there is higher unemployment and a \nslowdown of the economy.\n  If my colleague is looking for perfection, I cannot give it to him. \nAll I can tell him is we are trying our best to frame something for 24 \nmonths that will reduce the spike in premium costs and have as a \nbackstop the Federal Government, but let the private sector try to \nsolve these crises or problems in the interim, with us getting out of \nthe business as soon as we can.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator has made much of the fact that \nthis would suddenly be the Federal Government getting into ratemaking. \nOf course, the Senator would concede, would he not, that this is the \nfirst time the Federal Government would be getting into big time \ninsuring an insurance risk?\n  Mr. DODD. I disagree. Facts will show after World War II we were the \ninsurance company for acts of war. Acts of war occurred in World War \nII. The Federal Government was the party that paid the claims.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And acts of war are exempt on every insurance \npolicy that I know of as a covered risk. It is exempt.\n  I say to the distinguished----\n  Mr. DODD. I get nervous when he keeps calling me ``distinguished.''\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. You not only are distinguished, you look \ndistinguished.\n  Mr. DODD. You have a looking point, as well.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. You sound very distinguished, too, but I want \nyou to answer my questions.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The question is, since we have the Federal \nGovernment involved big time under your bill, 80, 90 percent of the \nrisk is going to be borne by the Federal Government----\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague has not read the bill. We are talking about \n$10 billion as the deductible level.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator concede under that \ncomplicated mathematical formula, often it is a fraction of a \npercentage of the total annual premium of a company that they will \nactually pay in an individual company in any one year?\n\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague is getting away from the amendment. That is \nnot part of the amendment. Are we are talking the amendment or the \nunderlying bill?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Underlying bill.\n  Mr. DODD. It is a formula, a debate.\n  Senator Gramm may offer an amendment on how you prefer to do it. On \nmost cases, you have a consolidation. You do not have one insurance \ncompany covering one building.\n  Let me finish. You asked a question and I will respond.\n  Under the bill, you cannot have all of a sudden some fictitious \ninsurance company getting set up. It is only the companies in existence \nas of September 11. The rate structures have to be what they were at \nthe time. You cannot have someone taking advantage of this bill to \ncreate the phony entities allowing them to take advantage of the \nsituation.\n  In the State of Florida, talking about something such as Disney \nWorld, start talking about the stadiums in Miami, for instance, there \nis not one insurer that covers those events. There is usually a \ncollection that do. The idea of maintaining solvency which laws require \nin each State--you could have a smaller company, obviously as part of \nthat. If you get levels where their percentage of the overall amounts \nare exceeded and the solvency of the company goes under, we have \ndefeated the purpose of the legislation.\n  There is that distinction between industry-wide and company caps. \nThat is why we drew that distinction.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Maybe I can ask a question of the \ndistinguished Senator to which he could give a yes or no.\n  First, I merely point out the fact with the Federal Government being \nso involved in assuming the terrorism risk, what will be charged for \nthat risk is clearly a legitimate issue for the Secretary of the \nTreasury with the consultation of the States to determine what you \nought to charge for that risk. Particularly given the fact that since \nthis is only a 1-year bill and maybe a 2-year bill by the time you get \nto the end of that time, the 50 insurance commissioners of the country \nwould not have even had a chance to determine if a rate was actuarially \nsound. Usually that is done only when the insurance companies file \nthose rates, when, in fact, these rates are already in effect as \nindicated by this morning's newspaper.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague, we are doing here what is done \nin 40 States. My colleague is right; in 10 States they do it \ndifferently. We tried to set up a system that made some sense. That is, \nyou are right, the rates go into effect but we still retain the strong \ninvolvement of your State insurance commissioners to go forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter be printed in the Record that I \nreceived from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on \nthis amendment and their concerns about the amendment of distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Insurance Commissioners,\n\n                                   Kansas City, MO, June 13, 2002.\n     Hon Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I am writing to respond to your request \n     regarding the amendment offered by Senator Nelson of Florida \n     regarding terrorism insurance rates.\n       While the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \n     (NAIC) has not taken a formal position on the Nelson \n     proposal, I do believe state regulators would have the \n     following concerns:\n       To our knowledge, the Treasury Department does not have the \n     infrastructure needed to monitor insurance rates as the \n     amendment proposes. Putting such a monitoring mechanism in \n     place could be cost prohibitive particularly when the \n     underlying federal legislation is short-term in nature;\n       The provisions on refunds of premiums would be very \n     difficult to enforce. Given the uncertainty of risk and the \n     lack of pricing experience, the revised rates could be \n     attributable to a host of other factors related to past or \n     prospective loss cost (the cost of reinsurance, or poor \n     return on investments in recent months), not the potential or \n     historical acts of terrorism, but rather to past and \n     prospective loss costs;\n       The separate accounting could cause reporting difficulties \n     and added expense for insurers, insurance regulators, and \n     presumably the Treasury Department. The marginal benefits and \n     costs associated with collecting the information could \n     outweigh the benefits that could be derived from the \n     information. For instance, Section (b) requires a separate \n     account for the ``premium increases'' and it cannot be used \n     for anything but to pay for terrorism losses.\n       There is no discussion about what happens to the funds \n     after the law sunsets.\n       At this time, state regulators already have the ability to \n     address this issue, making additional federal oversight \n     unnecessary.\n       I hope this responds to your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Terri Vaughan,\n\n                                  Commissioner of Insurance, Iowa,\n                                                  President, NAIC.\n\n  Mr. DODD. The key paragraphs deal with the underlying issue; that is, \nthe Treasury Department does not have the infrastructure needed to \nmonitor insurance rates as the amendment proposes. Putting such a \nmonitor mechanism in place could be cost prohibitive, particularly when \nthe underlying Federal legislation is short term in nature.\n  These are the State commissioners. They say:\n\n       The separate accounting could cause reporting difficulties \n     and added expenses for insurers, insurance regulators and \n     presumably the Treasury Department. The marginal benefits and \n     costs associated with collecting the information could \n     outweigh the benefits that could be derived from the \n     information.\n\n  Lastly they say:\n\n       At this time, state regulators already have the ability to \n     address this issue, making additional Federal oversight \n     unnecessary.\n\n  Mr. President, does my colleague have additional questions?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes, I do. Is the Senator aware as a matter of \npractice insurance commissioners of the States basically do not set \nrates for commercial policies?\n  Mr. DODD. I understand how it works in different States. My point is, \nwithout getting into the minutiae of it, 40 States, as I understand it, \nallow in the commercial property and casualty area for rates to go \nforward if a rate request is made. They then retain the right to decide \nwhether or not that rate is one they will accept. In 10 States, as I \nunderstand it--and my colleague is a former insurance commissioner so \nhe may have more detail on this--and Florida could be one--do not allow \nthe rate increase to go forward without there being permission by the \ninsurance commissioner ahead of time. That is a general breakdown. \nWithin some States they have ranges of rates, but the point being, the \nState insurance commissioner is the one that ultimately, one way or the \nother, decides rates. How each State does it may vary a little bit here \nand there, but we do nothing in this bill to undermine the ability of \nthe State insurance commissioner to ultimately set the rates if they do \nit differently. We defer to the States on this issue historically, and \nwe did so again in this bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If I may respond, the NAIC, National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, has formally adopted a new \nversion of the property and casualty energy rate and policy form model \nlaw which essentially encourages the optional use and file system, \nwhich is a system where the companies file what they want without the \ninsurance commissioner having to approve that rate ahead of time.\n  That is what I am trying to get across to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut. That, in fact, there is not this closely held tight \nreign out there in the 50 States by the insurance commissioners over \nwhat are the rates on commercial policies. When you use that as an \nexcuse to justify not having some kind of mechanism by which we control \nthe rate hikes on terrorism insurance under a bill that the Federal \nGovernment is basically going to support, the terrorism risk, it has \nthe potential of taking the rates to the Moon.\n  Mr. DODD. I defer in some ways because my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Florida served as an insurance commissioner for the \nState of Florida. We asked the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners to respond to the proposal. All I can tell you is that in \nthis letter from the NAIC, the last line of their letter to me says:\n\n       At this time--\n\n  Again, they are working on the issue. My colleague has conceded that \npoint--\n\n     the State regulators already have the ability to address this \n     issue, making additional Federal oversight unnecessary.\n\n  I don't know what else you do. I do not always agree with them on \nevery point. But it seems to me if the State insurance commissioners \nare satisfied that they are in a strong enough position to deal with \nthis, whether or not they do in each State, I don't know what else you \ndo. I know my colleague knows there may be some who are less strong \nthan others on this point. But the choice is either relying on the \nexisting structure to set rates or set up a new operation of the \nDepartment of the Treasury, for maybe 12 months--and we all know how \nlong that could take--even if you wanted to defer to the Department of \nthe Treasury. We could spend months with them putting together an \napparatus to do so.\n  Again, if the intention here is perfection, I am not the guy. This is \nnot the right bill. If you are asking those of us who sat down to try \nto work and fashion something that we think would be the right step \nforward, then I think we have done it here. If we have not, we are \ngoing to have to come back to this issue.\n  All I can say to my colleagues in good faith is we think we have done \nthe right job. It is not all inclusive. We don't deal with workers' \ncompensation in this bill. That is a huge issue. My colleague from \nNebraska, the other Senator Nelson, has an amendment requiring some \nstudies on life and other issues we do not cover in this bill that, \nfrankly, are major gaps. But we just did not believe we could take on \nall of that under these circumstances. We tried to keep as focused as \nwe could, knowing that the cost was, on September 11, a minimum of $50 \nbillion. We know today that reserves could only accommodate about 20 \npercent of that event. That is a fact. And we know there are projects \nand jobs being lost every day in the absence of some kind of a backup, \nwhich is what we tried to craft.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand we have put together what we \nthink is the best proposal. We urge them to be supportive of it.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Florida and his passionate \nconcern. He rightly points out the sense of people's anger, \nfrustration, and anxiety over rate increases that go on all the time. \nIt is terribly frustrating.\n  Certainly for people in Washington, DC, already we know the costs are \ngoing up. I wish I could wave a magic wand and make it go away. I think \nthe best we can do, as I said, is to pass this bill, and then the \njustification for those cost increases, at least of the magnitude we \nmay be seeing, is certainly going to be minimized by providing some \nbackup to this issue.\n  For those reasons, I urge the rejection of this amendment at the time \nthe vote occurs.\n  I see my colleagues from Nebraska and New Jersey. I do not know if \nthey have any comments they want to make on this bill. If not, I can \nnote the absence of a quorum. But if they want to be heard, I will be \nhappy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nputting together, with the assistance of a lot of folks, a bill that I \nthink can help take off some of the pressure.\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I made a mistake. We do deal with workers' compensation \nhere. I am sorry. We do not deal with life.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague for a very able job, \nputting together a bill with the assistance of a lot of individuals who \nhave had a lot of experience dealing with these issues.\n  S. 2600 is a bill that I think can help bring some balance to the \nwhole area that we today recognize as being imbalanced because of the \nevents of September 11. The effects on our economy, our society, and \nour national psyche can never be overstated. They have adversely \nimpacted the Nation's sense of security and stability, and our lives \nhave been permanently changed in so many different ways that we could \nnot have anticipated.\n  One cannot overstate the effects upon the families who lost their \nloved ones or those affected in other ways by the actions of the small \nnumber of terrorists, terrorists sworn to the destruction of the \nAmerican way of life and for all that we stand.\n  There is not any way to return to the days before September 11, nor \ncan we return the stability of our lives simply on the basis of \neconomic decisions we make today. But I think we can begin the process \nof slowing down the impact, the adverse impact on our economy.\n  Congress can now act to help stimulate the weak economy and further \navoid the negative consequences with this Federal backup, this \n``backstop'' for catastrophic losses resulting from acts of terrorism \nin the future. By enacting this legislation, I think we can in fact see \na turnaround in our commercial real estate market, mortgage lenders, \nthe construction industry, and other segments of our economy.\n  This is a jobs bill, pure and simple, to make certain that our \neconomy will in fact respond appropriately and positively rather than \nbe adversely affected by the continuing lack of availability and a \ngrowing lack of availability of the property and casualty and workers' \ncompensation coverages that are so important to the future of our \neconomy. We must in fact respond to that.\n  I have learned firsthand the necessity of insurance in the commercial \nworld. As a former insurance regulator, as someone who has been \ninvolved in the insurance business, or the field of insurance \nregulation, virtually all of my working life, with the exception of my \npublic service as Governor and here in the Senate, this is not so much \nabout----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote is to occur \nat 3:15 on the amendment, with 10 minutes equally divided prior to that \nvote. We are at that point now.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will yield my 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska in opposition to the Nelson \namendment. I have already spoken about it. Then Senator Nelson will \nhave 5 minutes in support of his amendment.\n  I yield my time to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, what I am concerned about is \nif we adopt the current amendment to the underlying bill, while there \nis a temptation to try to control rates, it is absolutely antithetical \nto try to control rates at a time when we are not going to control the \nissuance of the coverage. We get the odd effect of not saying you must \nwrite it--and I hope we never get to the point of saying you must write \nthis insurance, this line of coverage, that we never get to the point \nwhere that has to be required--but at the same time, if we say the \nrates are controlled, this market I do not think will continue to \nrespond or have the opportunity to respond as if we passed the \nunderlying bill without this amendment.\n  I respect a great deal my colleague from Florida, my namesake, who \nhas had similar experience to mine. But my experience has been \ndifferent. That is, if we try to control the rates, if we try to create \na quasi-Federal rate control structure for a very short period of time, \nor for a long period of time, we will not enhance the availability of \ninsurance, we will get just the opposite result.\n  Therefore, I hope as we look at this amendment today--and it pains me \nto take issue with my friend from Florida, but I must in fact say \nthis--it will not enhance the availability of insurance, in my opinion \nand from my experience, but it will in fact deter the growth of the \nmarket. It will help reduce the availability of the coverage and not \nenhance it, as does the underlying bill as it is right now.\n  Whereas it may be amended by other amendments, and I intend to offer \none that in fact will enhance the availability of more terrorist \ncoverage in the commercial lines in those areas that are currently \nbeing so adversely affected and impacted by the absence of this \nbackstop, it is about jobs, it is about the economy, less so about \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, in the interest of time, I yield my time \nand leave the remaining time to the proponent of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I would like to close on my \namendment.\n  This has been a good debate. Again, although I have serious \nreservations about this legislation, I did not prevent it from coming \nto the floor, which I could have done last night.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Connecticut engaging in \nthe colloquy, the series of questions and answers. I hope it is better \nunderstood. Now I would like to make a couple of points before we vote \non the amendment, and I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  First of all, I want to correct something the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska said.\n  In fact, terrorism insurance under this bill is mandatory. That is \nthe whole point of setting the system up whereby the Federal Government \nis coming in and backstopping insurance companies. It is mandatory for \nall commercial property and casualty insurance. The insurance is there. \nThe Federal Government is picking up most of the tab. If the loss \noccurs, who is paying? The consumer is paying through the premiums that \nhave already been hiked as chronicled daily over the last 6 months, \nincluding this one in today's paper talking about a 300-percent \nincrease in the last 6 months. That, in fact, is what has happened.\n  What should we do about it? We have to make insurance available. That \nis part of the reason for the underlying bill. But we also have to make \nit affordable.\n  When rates get hiked 300 percent, you are getting to the precipice of \nwhether it is affordable.\n  Don't just think it is the big real estate conglomerates that are \nhaving trouble getting this insurance. This affects small businesses as \nwell. Whatever the size of the business, these rate hikes are going to \nbe passed on to the consumers as a cost of doing business. The huge \nrate hikes are going directly to the consumers.\n  I reiterate that consumers and taxpayers do not like to have their \nSenators voting to increase their taxes. Let me tell you what they do \nnot like even more: They do not want their Senators approving \nlegislation that causes rate hikes to be etched into law.\n  I come forth humbly and respectfully with an amendment that says we \nare going to put a process in place--that we are going to put this \nprocess in place that says the Secretary of Treasury is going to \nconsult with the NAIC and other Federal agencies as to what ought to be \nthe range of a rate hike or rate decrease, whatever is warranted; and, \nfurthermore, where there has been the huge increase already, but then \nthe Secretary says the rate increase ought to be there or not there for \nthe remainder of that policy, that difference has to be rebated to the \npolicyholder.\n  Naturally, this is stepping on some toes because it not only puts a \nprocess of logic in the handling of rates, but it causes rebates to go \nback where the rates have been determined to be excessive.\n  Senators, hear me. This is a dangerous vote. Watch out what you are \nvoting on as you vote on the Nelson amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know my colleague from Nevada wants to \nbe heard for a few minutes as in morning business. I will make an \nappeal here, as I see the leader on the floor. I only know of a couple \nmore amendments at this point. Maybe there are more. If there are, I \nwould like to know about them so I can have some idea and let the \nleader know, or give the leader an idea as to how we are going to be \nproceeding.\n  I know Senator Gramm may have an amendment. I gather that Senator \nHatch's may be withdrawn. I know there is an amendment by Senator \nLeahy. There will be a colloquy between Senator Collins and Senator Ben \nNelson. My colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, has an interest in an \namendment as well. Senator Nelson of Florida also has an amendment we \nmay try to take up.\n  Those are the parameters at this point. There may be other \namendments. If there are, let's get some sense of it so the leader can \nset a schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if it is possible to go to third \nreading tonight or tomorrow morning, I would like to entertain that. \nThe sooner we can do that, the better. Colleagues are interested in \ntaking up the Defense authorization bill. That is something we hope we \ncan take up very quickly. There are other issues out there that have to \nbe addressed. So if it is possible to go to third reading tonight, I \nwould like to be able to do that very much. If there are additional \namendments, this is the time to offer them, or we will move to third \nreading shortly.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and dispose of their \namendments so we can bring this bill to closure and move on to other \nmatters of great priority before we leave for the Fourth of July \nrecess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I am here to express very strong \nsupport for S. 2600, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. I know \nwe have had debate and a couple of votes, but I want to underscore how \nimportant this legislation is to the State of New York and to the \nongoing economic challenges we confront because of September 11.\n  This legislation provides a temporary Government-industry program for \nsharing property and casualty insurance losses; in short, what is \ncalled a Government backstop. The loss sharing program would run for \njust 1 year, although it could be extended for an additional year.\n  We are only talking about a temporary fix until the marketplace gets \nback on its feet and we get a reinsurance industry that is willing to \nbackstop the insured and their losses. I hope all of my colleagues \nunderstand how significant this legislation is to so many industries \nand particularly in the State of New York.\n  Under the legislation, if there were a terrorist attack that results \nin more than $5 million in insured losses, insurance companies would \ncollectively cover total losses of up to $10 billion. Companies would \ncontribute to that $10 billion amount based upon their individual \nmarket shares.\n  If the losses exceeded $10 billion, but were less than $20 billion, \nthen the Federal Government would pay 80 percent of the losses and the \ninsurance industry would cover 20 percent. If the losses were more than \n$20 billion but less than $100 billion, the Federal Government would \npick up 90 percent and the industry would cover 10 percent. And if \nthere were more than $100 billion in losses, the Secretary of the \nTreasury would notify the Congress, and we would then determine how \nlosses over that huge amount would be covered.\n  All property and casualty insurance, except crop and mortgage \ninsurance, would be covered. The bill would also cover not just \ninsurance companies, but also those which self-insure, which includes \nmany businesses in New York and across the country.\n  I have heard so many concerns expressed by businesses in New York. I \nhave heard it from the real estate industry, from the Association for a \nBetter New York, which is the equivalent in many ways of the Chamber of \nCommerce in New York City, from New York City Partnership, which also \nacts to bring businesses, large and small, from all different sectors \nof the economy together to speak with one voice. But throughout New \nYork City and throughout New York State, throughout certainly the \nlarger New York area, which includes New Jersey and Connecticut, the \nproblems associated with obtaining terrorism insurance have become a \nmatter of great immediacy and urgency.\n  In fact, the department of insurance superintendent, Gregory Serio, \nhas recently met with me to confirm that it is not just individual \ncompanies that are running into problems, it is a systemwide challenge \nto the fundamental concept of being able to provide insurance for our \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3839 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I want to give one example. I could literally give so \nmany examples in this Chamber because they have flooded into my office \nand come to my attention and to my counsel's attention for weeks now. \nFrancis Greenberger of Time Equities, Inc., a real estate investment \nfirm, has confirmed to me that the insurer they had before September 11 \nrequired their company to buy terrorism insurance for four properties: \nthree in New York and one in Madison, WI, an apartment building.\n  They were required to insure the property in Madison, WI, against \nterrorism, despite the fact that it is clearly not near New York City. \nIt is not an area where there have been a lot of threats, but, \nnevertheless, in order to get the terrorism insurance where it was \nneeded in New York, the four properties were lumped together.\n  The cost of the insurance premiums for these properties rose from \n$191,500 pre-September 11 to $664,300, an increase of 347 percent. Even \nwith these\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\nexorbitant premiums, the amount of terrorism insurance coverage that \nthe company received for these much higher premiums was actually 50 \npercent less than the amount of coverage it had previously received.\n  In addition, the new policy excluded bioterrorism and nuclear attacks \nand had a deductibility of more than $1 million. By any standard, that \nis a terrible burden to try to absorb, especially during an economic \ndownturn in the wake of the terrorist attack on New York.\n  That is not by any means a unique story. I have heard many like it \nfrom not only real estate holders but construction contractors, stadium \nowners, sports teams, amusement park owners, banks, and not just in New \nYork but people who do business, literally, all over the country.\n  The lack of insurance has affected the ability of many developers to \nclose real estate deals, to complete old ones and to start new ones. So \nat least in our part of the world new offices, residential buildings, \nnew hotels, and new entertainment centers are either on hold or being \nforced to expend much more money than any reasonable assessment of the \nrisk should call for.\n  In addition, we know the reinsurance market ends on July 1, so there \nis urgency for us to act. I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who are working to get this legislation passed. It is not \nonly the private sector; it has also been a real challenge for \nhospitals. Again, the New York insurance superintendent has reported \nthat hospitals were the first New York business to experience \nsignificant difficulties in obtaining adequate and affordable property \ncoverage for their facilities.\n  We also have problems with our major philanthropic organizations. \nThey operate hospitals. They operate museums. We have an across-the-\nboard problem in getting the kind of insurance that is required, and, \nin many instances, what has been offered is far from adequate. Many, as \nI said, exclude certain kinds of terrorism. They tighten up the \ndefinition of occurrence. Then they jack up the prices so that it is \nnot affordable anyway, even though it is not very good coverage. In \nmany cases, the insured has no choice.\n\n  I do hope we are not only going to pass this and pass it as soon as \npossible, but that we will recognize another area of difficulty, and \nthat is with respect to workers' compensation coverage. Under New York \nlaw, primary insurers providing workers' compensation coverage cannot \nexclude terrorism coverage. Therefore, many primary insurers are \ndropping their insureds and refusing to offer workers' compensation \nanymore at all.\n  I understand it was the intention of Senator Dodd that workers' \ncompensation insurance would be covered by this bill under the general \nrubric of commercial lines of insurance. I have some concern, however, \nbecause a number of types of insurance are specifically defined, but \nworkers' comp is not. I understand, though, that Senator Dodd will \naddress this issue and will make it explicitly clear that workers' \ncompensation coverage is also covered by this legislation. I wish to \nthank Senator Dodd and his staff for recognizing this potential \noversight and moving to remedy it.\n  In conclusion, I am delighted that this bill is finally being \ndebated. Many of us have been urging that it arrive as soon as it \ncould. We are now right in the crunch period because reinsurance in \nmost instances disappears in just a few weeks on July 1. Workers' \ncompensation is not even being written right now in New York in many \ninstances, so we must move.\n  I have said from this floor many times in the last months that when \nNew York was attacked, it was an attack on America. The economy of New \nYork is absolutely crucial to the full recovery of America, and there \nis no more important legislation than the one we are considering now to \nensure that economic activity resume at the highest possible level and \nthat we not only put New Yorkers back to work but that, because of the \ndynamism of the New York economy, we send out that energy that will get \nour national economy moving in the right direction as well.\n  So I thank the sponsors. I look forward to the vote on this, and I \nappreciate support for this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the majority leader is on the floor, I \nwant to certainly recognize the fact that this is an important piece of \nlegislation. We have been told that people have wanted this for months, \ngoing back to last December. Here it is, Thursday afternoon and there \nis no one else on the Senate floor.\n  As the majority leader said and as I have tried to say in \nrepresenting what the majority leader has said to me, really we have to \nmove this legislation along. There is so much left to do without our \nbeing here doing nothing.\n  I would say as the leader said this morning, if there are no \namendments, maybe we should move to third reading, if people do not \nhave amendments to offer. The majority leader has been very generous \nsaying people should have the opportunity to offer all the amendments \nthey want. There will certainly be no rush to filing a motion for \ncloture.\n  But I just say to the majority leader, I hope everyone heard what the \nmajority leader said earlier today, that we have to move ahead. Here it \nis Thursday afternoon and nothing is moving.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. He is absolutely right. I have indicated to the \ndistinguished Republican leader it was not my intention to file cloture \ntoday, even though obviously that is the prerogative of the majority \nleader. We have no designs to do that. But we also recognize that we \nhave a lot of work to do. It is not my intention to file cloture today. \nI hope colleagues who have amendments will offer them and we can have \nvotes on them. If there are no amendments, we will move to third \nreading sometime very soon.\n  If there are objections to moving to third reading, our colleagues \nare going to have to come over and physically object. We cannot waste \nwhat is valuable time on the Senate floor waiting for Senators to offer \namendments if there are none. So we will make our best effort to \ndetermine the degree to which there are Senators who still wish to \noffer amendments. Time is running out. We will move to third reading \nshortly if no amendments are offered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5501-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5501-S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GRANDPA DASCHLE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with great pleasure, I call attention to a \nnew Democrat's having been brought forth in this Congressional election \nyear. With even greater pleasure, I point out that our distinguished \nmajority leader has become a grandfather for the first time.\n  This new Democrat, Henry Thomas Daschle, arrived with the angels last \nFriday. Being a Democrat, I always welcome a new member to our party. \nBeing a grandfather, I know the joy and pleasure that a grandchild \nbrings.\n  There is nothing so wonderful as cradling in your arms a swaddled \nbaby. It awakens in one so many emotions. It is a one-of-a-kind \nexperience. A newborn fairy glows with freshness and the promise of the \nlife to come.\n  But a grandchild is beyond special, and the birth of one's first \ngrandchild is an experience nearly beyond verbal description.\n  The birth of one's own child is tempered by a certain apprehension. \nWith this fragile baby, there also comes the responsibility of \nprotecting and molding a tiny, dependant creature until adult status \narrives. Parenthood is truly a delicate balance of bounteous love and \nserious responsibility.\n  But to become a grandparent and to see oneself being projected on, on \ninto the eons in the future, one has really reached his first plateau \nof immortality. It is a higher plateau. It is a completely different \nkind of experience. It is pure joy. As a grandparent,\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\nthe diapers that one changes will be because one volunteers to change \nthem. Won't have to do it. Somebody else can do it. But one volunteers \nto do it.\n  Shameless spoiling can be the order of the day without guilt. You can \nspoil those grandchildren and then let the parents take them home. \nElder wisdom can be meted out with the sure, certain knowledge that \nadmonishments will follow to ``listen to Grandpa. He is wise.''\n  The first grandchild, so delicate, and yet so determined to join this \nturbulent but wonderful world, stirs the heart and vividly demonstrates \nman's enduring link to the eternal. A grandchild is the sweetest, most \nprofound measure of time's passage. In innocence and promise, that tiny \nbeing links generation to generation and embodies mankind's persistent, \nstubborn hope for a brighter future in spite of the difficult lessons \nof the past. As Carl Sandburg said: ``A baby is God's opinion that life \nshould go on.''\n  A grandchild is living, breathing proof that significant components \nof the fortunate grandparents' DNA will still be in evidence hundreds \nof years hence. Grandpa's dimples or Grandma's curly hair will most \ncertainly be remarked upon by future family members as they compare \ntheir own likenesses with treasured old photos in the family album.\n  Grand babies and great grand babies are part of the long continuum of \nmankind's collective experience on this lovely sun-washed planet. They \nare the reason we occupants of planet earth strive to make life better \nand commit our resources to alleviate suffering and disease. The entire \nrationale for every effort to improve our world, and the millions and \ntens of millions of good works toward that end performed by homo \nsapiens across the whole panoply of history, can be understood in an \ninstant when one hears the tenuous first cry of a newborn child. It is \na wonder beyond wonders; an affirmation of God's love; and a tangible \ndemonstration that hope is not a futile emotion. And so today, I would \nlike to dedicate these few beautiful lines by William Wordsworth to \nHenry Thomas Daschle and to Grandpa Daschle:\n\n     Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\n     The soul that rises with us, our life's star,\n     Hath had elsewhere its setting,\n     And cometh from afar;\n     Not in entire forgetfulness,\n     And not in utter nakedness,\n     But trailing clouds of glory do we come\n     From God, who is our home:\n     Heaven lies about us in our infancy!\n\n  I extend my heartiest congratulations to Senator Daschle on his first \ngrandchild, and I wish the best to his son, Nathan and wife Jill, who \nalso had an important role in last Friday's grand happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from West Virginia, the \ndistinguished senior Senator, how much I personally appreciate these \nkind remarks about Senator Daschle being a grandfather.\n  On the floor is my friend from Vermont. We have spent so many \npleasant months, spending hours, I am sure, talking about our own \nchildren and how we look forward to being able to visit with our \ngrandchildren. Senator Daschle will be a great grandfather. It takes \nthose who are grandparents to really tell Senator Daschle, it will take \na little while before he really appreciates what it means to be a \ngrandfather, to see those beautiful children. No matter how calculated \nyou try to be, you see those children as you.\n  I also congratulate my friend, Senator Daschle, on the birth of Henry \nThomas Daschle. I have seen a picture of him, and as Senator Daschle \ntold me, as far as I am concerned, he looks just like him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President if I might add, I saw the same picture. \nActually, Henry Thomas Daschle is better looking than our distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  We have so often rancorous debate, we are always so busy, it seems \nour dear friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, knows best when \nto come to the floor and bring us back to the human side of the Senate. \nHe, knowing the Senate better than all of us, brings us back to the \nhuman side with poetry. My late mother used to read the Congressional \nRecord every day looking for poems by Robert Carlyle Byrd.\n  And today to have those who are grandparents, as Senator Reid, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Nevada said, to pass on this wisdom \nto our majority leader. He is going to get this wisdom from us about \nbeing grandparents whether he wants it or not, but we will pass it on. \nIt is the most wonderful time of your life. This will be the first of \ntwo this year, and that makes it even better.\n  I might say to my dear friend, the majority leader, this is a very \nfortunate grandchild to have him as the grandfather, just as the \nparents are very fortunate to have Tom and Linda Daschle to love and \nhelp this child.\n  The Leader will find there will come a time as the child gets a \nlittle bit older and is able to come to you with unreserved love, \nwanting to be with grandfather, as busy and as peripatetic a life as \nhave the busiest people, with the greatest responsibilities of anyone \nin this country, all of that will come to a screeching halt when that \nchild--my dear friend from West Virginia and dear friend from Nevada \nknow--climbs on to your lap and says, grandpa, can you read me this \nbook or read me this story. It has probably been read a dozen times \nbefore. I don't care whether your hotline is ringing, I don't care \nwhether 99 Senators are calling, I don't care whether the President of \nthe United States is calling, I don't care who it is, you will find, of \ncourse, that book that you read 10 times already naturally, to get it \nright, you have to read it again. Your whole universe will go around \nthat.\n  I congratulate you. Those who have been there know it truly is the \nbest part of life. It goes beyond all the things you have accomplished, \nwhich are so great. And it was your children who did the accomplishment \nfor you. It is the best of all possible worlds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am humbled and extraordinarily grateful \nfor the generous words of my colleagues. Senator Byrd has honored me \nonce several years ago when he was gracious enough to nominate me for \nthe position of majority leader. Oftentimes his words are repeated in \nintroductions all over the country, and I have not forgotten that \nspecial moment. I will be forever grateful to him for those words on \nthat day.\n  But I must say I am equally honored this afternoon that Senator Byrd \nwould come to the floor and honor my grandchild as he has. This is a \nvery joyous occasion for my family. I must say, I believe that the \nwords just spoken will probably be read and spoken and reiterated and \nkept and treasured longer than the words spoken about my nomination as \nmajority leader. They will probably terminate when I pass, but the \nwords spoken to my grandchild will go on for generations. So his \nwillingness to come to the floor and speak as he has means so much to \nme.\n  I would also say, as much as I have learned from him as a Senator, \nthat may pale in comparison to what I think I may learn from him as a \ngrandfather. So I thank him for his kindness and for his willingness to \nmake this moment in our lives even richer.\n  I do not have two dearer colleagues in the Senate than I do in \nSenator Reid and Senator Leahy. They are like family to us--to my wife \nand my children. For them to join Senator Byrd on this glorious day \nmeans so much to me. I am grateful to them for their generous words and \nfor their willingness to join in this colloquy.\n  I had a special day today that I shared with Senator Byrd. Just this \nmorning my daughter called very excitedly to say our second grandchild \nwill be a daughter. She will be born sometime in late October or early \nNovember. So we will have one grandson and one granddaughter this year. \nI cannot be more blessed. I cannot feel more hopeful and happy than I \ndo today--first, to have the recognition for our grandchild and, \nsecond, to know that this joyous occasion will be extended by yet \nanother grandchild, who will be a granddaughter, later this year.\n  One of my friends once said that our children and grandchildren are \nmessages to a future we will not see. I thought a lot about what that \nmeans, the kind of message we are sending. I can only imagine the \nmessage the Byrd grandchildren and the Reid grandchildren and the Leahy \ngrandchildren\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nwill be sending to that generation, that future we will not see. They \nwill send a message of love, a message of stability, and hope, a \nmessage that they have taken from their grandfathers and grandmothers \nwith such abundance.\n  It is a message about this country that is embraced in these three \nSenators and passed on to their children and grandchildren, a message \nthat I think makes this such a special country. It is a country that \nfor so many reasons gives hope and new faith to future generations \nthrough our children and our grandchildren.\n  I hope we can send a strong message to those future generations \nthrough our grandchildren--by reading them books, by loving them, by \ngiving them the attention they deserve, by changing their diapers--when \nwe want to, and by recognizing what a glorious miracle life is, in the \neyes and faces of those tiny grandbabies who grow up to be the leaders \nof a wonderful nation.\n  I, again, thank my colleagues for their generous words and for making \nthis such a special moment for me as a Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I be so bold as to close this pleasant interlude with \nthese words to Henry Thomas Daschle:\n\n     First in thy grandfather's arms, a new-born child,\n     Thou didst weep while those around thee smiled;\n     So live that in thy lasting sleep,\n     Thou mayest smile, while those around thee weep.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5503-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5503-S5513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask to address the House--I mean the \nSenate. I am still used to the House, I am sorry. I had 18 years there. \nI ask to address the Senate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I spoke briefly a bit earlier on this legislation, but \nnow that we are getting pretty close to try to tie the final knot and \nget the bill done, I do want to address it once again.\n  First, again, I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \nwho has worked so long and hard on this legislation. I also thank the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, who has been a \ngood, careful guider, and Jon Corzine, my colleague, as well.\n  The four of us have been laboring on this proposal for a very long \ntime. I hope we can actually pass legislation tonight.\n  This is extremely important legislation. But it is deceptive. We are \nnot getting many calls. When you walk into your local townhall \nmeeting--or if I go into one of my favorite places, McGillicuddy's Pub, \non Quentin Road, they don't say: Hey, Charlie, what's doing on \nterrorism insurance? It is not an issue on the lips of the average \ncitizen. But it affects the average citizen, and greatly.\n  The reason is very simple: Without terrorism insurance, large numbers \nof construction projects will not go forward. Banks will not lend \nunless they can have terrorism insurance. And insurance companies, \nwhile they are offering terrorism insurance in many cases, are offering \nthat insurance at such a high rate that many projects are simply not \ngoing forward.\n  What does this mean for the national economy? It is a slowly bleeding \ncut on the arm of our economy. But every day, when a new project is not \nrefinanced, when a new proposal to build something large and grand does \nnot go forward, is a day our economy is hurt.\n  The reason is very simple. Since 9-11, we fear terrorist attacks, and \nwe fear them on large concentrations of economic power, of economic \nwealth. They could be in cities--my city, of course, has many of \nthese--but they could also be not in cities, Disney World or Disneyland \nin Florida and California. The Hoover Dam, every stadium, no matter \nwhere it is in the country, is suffering effects. We have heard from \nthe owners of baseball and football about how their costs are \ndramatically rising. And it will continue to occur. In fact, it will \nspread. The dramatic increases in costs, the failure to do new projects \nwill continue unless we do something.\n  I know there are some who believe: Well, the Government should not be \ninvolved. I strongly disagree.\n  The Government has always been involved in cases of war. We have \nalways been under the rule that in cases of war the Federal Government \nwill step in.\n  Well, since 9-11, the rules of war have been redefined. Terrorism is \nwar. So if I had my druthers, I would have a one-page bill, something \nsimilar to what I worked out with Secretary O'Neill, that would say: \nShould, God forbid, the next terrorist incident occur, the Federal \nGovernment will step in.\n\n  That is what we would do in the case of war. If, during World War II, \nthe Germans or the Japanese had hurt the American homeland, that is \nwhat would have happened; the same thing with Korea, and the same thing \nwhen we faced the cold war with Russia. I don't know why it is any \ndifferent now, but some have had objections. They don't want to see the \nFederal Government's role expand, even though if there was ever a place \nthat role should be needed, and make sense, it is here. They have \nopposed that.\n  So we came up with a compromise. The Senator from Connecticut, \nactually, the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and myself had a \ncompromise that was put on the floor in late December. We tried to have \na balance between those of us who believed the Government should be \nfully involved and those of us who felt--on the other side, mainly--the \nGovernment should not be involved at all. We came up with a proposal.\n  Unfortunately, it did not come forward, not because of objections to \nthe proposal but, rather, it ran up against the age-old whirlpool, if \nyou will, of tort reform.\n  It ran up on the shoals of tort reform, as many other proposals have \nin this body in recent years, and nothing got done. I was delighted to \nsee the McConnell amendment defeated for the main reason that had it \npassed, we would not have had a bill. It seems we have stepped past \nprobably the greatest impediment to the proposal, and now we have other \nissues. I want to talk about one of those.\n  Before I do, I want to make a few points. First, I want to talk about \nmy city of New York and give people some examples. Examples could occur \nin their cities as well. I have talked to my friend from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin. The same thing is happening in Chicago. I have talked \nto real estate leaders in Dallas and Houston and San Francisco and Los \nAngeles. In all of our large cities, the same thing is occurring.\n  Let me cite some examples: 4 Times Square, one of our newest, most \nbeautiful buildings known as the Conde Nast building, is in litigation \nwith its lender due to the absence of terrorism insurance coverage. The \nlender, La Salle Bank and CIGNA, had threatened to invade the lockbox \ninto which rents are deposited in order to buy $430 million in \nterrorism insurance, the amount of the mortgage. The insurer for the \nportfolio held by the owners of 4 Times Square has refused to write \ncoverage for this building claiming it is high profile. Even if the \n$430 million of coverage was available, it wouldn't cover any of the \nenvironmental risks, nor would the owner's equity of $450 million on \nthis $880 million be covered.\n  In downtown New York, a 1 million-square-foot office building could \nnot obtain refinancing for the underlying mortgage of approximately \n$200 million because terrorism insurance was unavailable. Finally, a \nlender agreed to go forward if the owner committed to pay $1 per square \nfoot for stand-alone terrorism insurance coverage. At the same time \nthat the owner faced that additional $1 million drain on cashflow, he \nhad to absorb an increase in his regular insurance from $110,000 to \n$550,000. That additional cost did not cover mold or biological or \nnuclear or chemical events whether terrorist-generated\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nor otherwise. The owner now has a $1,440,000 additional expense.\n\n  A major REIT with properties in central business districts from New \nYork to California can get only $250 million of insurance for the \nentire portfolio. And if there is one more terrorist incident--God \nforbid--it is likely that even this limited terrorism coverage will be \nlost given its not uncommon 30-day cancellation clause.\n  A major residential and mixed use owner-builder renewed their all-\nrisk insurance a few months earlier than the expiration date for that \ncarrier and was about to lose its treaty agreement for reinsurance and \ncould only write $5 million. The list can go on and on and on of \nbuildings that couldn't get terrorism insurance, that had to pay so \nmuch that it virtually made them noneconomic, of new projects not \nstarted.\n  To simply and blithely say the market will come in and cover this is \nnot true. Just last Friday, another drain on the body economy of my \ncity, but this is happening in other cities as well, Moody's put 12 \nbuildings in New York City on watch for possible downgrading of their \nbonds, the whole cost of financing, because of terrorism insurance. \nThese include some of the premier properties in New York, including the \nExxon building, the Bankers Trust building, Celanese building, the \nConde Nast building, Rockefeller Center, the Marriot Marquis Hotel--the \nlist goes on.\n  So anyone who thinks this is not a problem, anyone who thinks the \nmarket is solving this problem on its own is simply not understanding \nwhat is occurring.\n  I am not the only one who thinks this. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint quotes from others in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Economic Dislocation Resulting From the Terrorism Insurance Market \n                                Turmoil\n\n       President Bush Calls For Action:\n       ``If people can't get terrorism insurance on a construction \n     project, they're not going to build a project, and if they're \n     not going to build a project, then someone's not working.

I have quotes from President Bush who stated last month \nhow important this was; from the Joint Economic Committee of the \nCongress, ably chaired by our Presiding Officer, from May 23; from FBI \nDirector Robert Mueller; from Vice President Cheney; from Secretary \nDonald Rumsfeld; from Larry Lindsay; from Secretary Paul O'Neill; from \nReserve Chairman Greenspan. All of these people are not known as people \nwho believe the Government ought to come in and solve the problem at \nthe drop of a hat. In fact, philosophically most of them are of the \nopposite view. They all felt the need to talk about terrorism \ninsurance.\n  We have to move this legislation. We have to move forward. Again, \neach of us could have our own idea on how to make it better, how to \nchange it. We know things will fall apart. My guess is, if we don't \nsolve this problem now, we are not going to solve it until a crisis is \ntruly upon us, until this slow drain on the economy, which the lack of \nterrorist insurance is causing, becomes not a flow but a cascade. Then, \nof course, the damage will have been done, and it will be almost too \nlate.\n  Finally, I want to talk a little bit about the per-company cap which \nI know is an issue that Senator Gramm and I are debating. As you know, \nI fought hard to have this cap put in. The Senator from Connecticut, \nwhom I mentioned while he was out of the room, has done a great job. He \nunderstood the position and put it in. It was at that point supported \nby the Senator from Texas in the final proposal that was made. This did \nnot stand in the way. It was tort reform that stood in the way.\n  Let me explain why this is so needed and why so many people are for \nthis on both sides of the aisle. In the bill, as you know, there is a \n$10 billion industry-wide benchmark for triggering individual company \nretentions in the first year. It goes to $15 billion in year 2, if the \nprogram is extended by the Treasury Secretary. That benchmark would \nresult in substantial private insurer losses before the Federal \nbackstop is triggered.\n  We didn't want the Federal Government in the compromise that came \nabout--this was not to my liking--but it was intended to have the \nprivate sector step in first until they were so limited because of the \nextent of the damage, God forbid, that they couldn't do it anymore. \nWell, if we didn't have this cap for a number of companies, the larger \ncompanies, the companies that concentrated, again, on the big economic \nproperties, the losses that they would incur before the Federal \nGovernment's involvement was triggered would equal those losses. They \nwould be comparable to the losses incurred on September 11. And for \nalmost every insurer, they would exceed the losses sustained in any \nprevious natural disaster.\n  In order for insurers to sustain such significant losses without \nrisking insolvency, each company must be able to determine with some \ndegree of certainty the outer bounds of terrorism exposure in actuarial \nterms, its probable maximum loss. And since January, the Coalition to \nInsure Against Terrorism, which is a broad-based business group, has \nstressed the need for this kind of insurance that will bring the \ninsurers back into high-risk property insurance. Per-company retentions \nare the way to do so. They are the best way to assure that the company \nis temporary because they will facilitate a quick transition to the \nprivate sector as insurers and reinsurers begin to develop underwriting \nrelationships with even the highest risk policyholders.\n  This experience will make it easier to develop actuarial models for \nuse after the Federal program expires because, as you know, unlike the \nwishes of many of us, this expires in a few years, depending on whether \nthe Treasury Secretary does an extension.\n  The per-company retentions will also minimize Federal involvement \nsince there is no need for Treasury to develop a formalized allocation \nprocedure for determining each company's share of the aggregate \nindustry retention or the quota share payment. Because the insurance \nindustry comprises more than 3,000 competing firms, private insurers \ncannot otherwise get together\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\nand agree on a loss-sharing formula that would bind the industry as a \nwhole. So inclusion of the per company retention in the legislation \nprovides some certainty as to when the backstop is triggered for each \ninsurer, without an elaborate Federal bureaucracy to allocate the \nlosses.\n\n  The bottom line is that we need this bill. We need the per company \ncap to make it work--particularly for large properties, particularly \nfor areas of high economic risk. I urge the Senate to pass S. 2600, \nincluding these retentions. It is the right solution to an ongoing \nproblem that threatens insurers, policyholders, and the economy at \nlarge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nMissouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending legislation \nconcerning terrorism reinsurance. Last December--December 13, I \nbelieve--I spoke here urging the leadership to bring up bipartisan \nlegislation that was at the time being negotiated between the White \nHouse and the Senate Banking Committee. Unfortunately, the legislation \nbefore us today does not reflect those discussions. At that point, I \nthought we had a good start on a bipartisan terrorism reinsurance \neffort.\n  The availability and affordability of insurance is vital to the \nstability of our Nation's economy. Now that we know terrorists can and \nhave struck in the United States, and have struck against major \nbuildings, insurance is going to have to change because the insurance \nis going to have to cover risks that were never before recognized as \nbeing legitimate in this country.\n  We hear reports from all over that many insurance and reinsurance \ncompanies are no longer able to provide the insurance coverage that is \nnecessary for builders of buildings, for those owning buildings, to get \nthe kind of financing they need or to have the protection they need for \nthe resources they put into those buildings.\n  At this moment, affordable terrorism risk insurance is not attainable \nby many businesses, both small and large--apartment and condominium \nbuildings, shopping centers, as well as many cultural institutions. \nRecently, the St. Louis Art Museum was identified by the Joint Economic \nCommittee as not being able to afford terrorism insurance. As a result, \nthe museum is not covered. I am positive there are many entities across \nthe country facing the same situation as the museum. I know major \nsports facilities, including ones in my State, are in a position where \nthey cannot get the terrorism risk insurance they would need to add new \nconstruction, or even to continue their operations. The fact that \nterrorism has struck our country has a double impact now that we are in \na position where insurance companies are not able to write and insure \nagainst and to ascertain the level of insurance risk that might be \nbrought about by terrorist acts. It is unacceptable that we hold large \nsegments of our economy hostage to the acts of terrorists.\n\n  Right now, many small business and small property owners are at \ndisadvantages. They face the prospect of doubling and tripling \ninsurance premiums. They are not only faced with increased property \ninsurance costs, but they are facing workers' compensation insurance \ncosts, health insurance costs; and without affordable insurance, many \nsmall businesses and property owners are simply forgoing insurance. \nThat is bad business. Those that have elected to pay much higher \ninsurance costs are finding they have to pass this cost along to their \ncustomers, renters, leaseholders, and others. This could have a \ntremendous impact on our economy.\n  We are hearing about major construction projects coming to a halt \nacross the country as lenders and major financing institutions are \nseeking, but unable to get, terrorism risk insurance. The Bond Market \nAssociation has stated that more than $7 billion worth of construction \nprojects are on hold or have been canceled due to the lack of \naffordable terrorism risk insurance.\n  Rating organizations have issued warnings in the past 2 weeks that \nlarge securitizations are in jeopardy of being downgraded. We are \ntrying to get out of a recession. The economic recovery that we expect \nand that we need is in grave danger if we do not provide a means of \nreinsuring the risk that has now become a reality in this country with \npossible terrorist acts. This is an unknown at this point, and this is \nthe time, and this is something in which the Federal Government could \nplay a very significant role. That is why good terrorism risk \nreinsurance legislation must be provided.\n  I also agree with my colleague from Kentucky that businesses that are \nvictimized by terrorist attacks should not be subject to punitive \ndamages. Now, unfortunately, on a party line vote, we rejected the \nstandard my colleague proposed. I hope we can find other means of \ncompromise to ensure that a business owner or a business that is struck \nby a terrorist act is not also struck by a punitive damage action that \ncould be economically as devastating as a terrorist act.\n  We cannot and should not hold our major economic engines hostage to \nthe threat of punitive damages on top of a terrorist act. I hope we can \nagree on a means of avoiding this kind of risk to those who have \nbusinesses or property that might be subject to a terrorist attack. As \nI said back in December, this is a potential problem. I believe now it \nis a problem. I think our recovery from the economic downturn, the \nrecession, has been slowed because the business community--especially \nsmall businesses from which I hear--are really in a position where they \ncannot go forward and, in many instances, they cannot get financing \nwithout terrorism insurance, and most insurance companies are not in a \nposition to offer that.\n  So I hope we can move with a good piece of legislation that will \nprovide the temporary reinsurance by the Federal Government to allow us \nto get back to the normal business of building facilities, building \nshopping centers, operating cultural facilities, and conducting \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues. I hope \nwe can get a good product, and I hope we can do it very quickly so we \ncan get our economy moving again.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3842\n\n(Purpose: To implement the International Convention for the Suppression \n of Terrorist Bombings to strengthen criminal laws relating to attacks \n on places of public use, to implement the International Convention of \nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, to combat terrorism and \n   defend the Nation against terrorist acts, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 3842.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, a clarification for Members. This is the \nsame amendment that Senator Hatch proposed earlier today. I understand \nSenator Hatch engaged in some conversation with Senator Leahy about \nwithdrawing his amendment. I think it is vitally important for the \nSenate to vote on this amendment. It is an important amendment. It is \nan amendment that is relevant to this bill because it deals with \nterrorism.\n  We had the same agreement yesterday, I understand, to vote on this \namendment. We had consent to do so, and there was an objection filed at \nthe last minute. We are now going out of session and will not be back \nuntil next week, and I think it is important we have a record vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have just been informed--and this may be something of\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nwhich the Senator is not aware--Senator Hatch and others have been \nworking on this in the last few minutes, and we have something we \nbelieve can be completed in wrapup this evening that takes care of the \nmatter.\n  I suggest my friend take a look at this. I do not know the subject \nmatter very well, but I assume Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy have \nworked it out.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to deal with this as a separate matter \nas long as we get a vote on it. I am just looking for a vote. This is \nan important piece of legislation that deals with terrorism, the \nimplementation of a treaty on terrorist bombing. It is an important \nvote. It is the implementation act of a treaty that we passed last \nyear. There are criminal code sections dealing with terrorist bombings, \nas well as people who are financing terrorism. It is important \nlegislation. I think it is something on which we should vote.\n  I am not being critical of what Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch did. \nI just think it is important legislation that should be voted on in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator wants a vote, we can and should have a vote. \nIt is my understanding Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy have worked out \na substitute. It will be passage of S. 1770, the Terrorist Bombing \nConvention Implementation Act of 2001.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Right.\n  Mr. REID. We were going to do this by unanimous consent this evening \nin wrapup. I assume it will be easy to work out a vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If we can work out a vote on this legislation, that \nwill be amenable to me. I will be happy to put us back in a quorum call \nand see if we can arrange that.\n  Mr. REID. What I suggest--and I will be happy for the Senator to \ncontinue his statement--maybe in the near future he can look at this \nand see that Senators Hatch and Leahy agree to have a vote on this \nissue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My concern is to have a vote. I would be comfortable to \nhave a vote on that legislation which, while I understand it is not \nidentical to the amendment I offered, is legislation that accomplishes \nthe same purpose.\n  Why don't I suggest the absence of a quorum, and we can see if we can \nwork this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Senator is in the Chamber, and we \ncan certainly talk about this, there is no reason not to do this. I \nthink the chairman and ranking member would like to do this separate \nand apart from this bill. This way, we can send a freestanding bill to \nthe House so they can work on this issue, and it will not be tied up in \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Again, I am fine with that. My concern is we get a vote \non it. I am happy to do it that way, but my concern is we vote on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, we will try our very \nbest to work with him. We have Senator Leahy's staff here. Senator \nHatch's staff is not here, but they will be here shortly. We will work \non trying to do this separate and apart from this legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is now after 5 p.m. We are hoping to get \nthis done. It could go into the end of next week. I know the majority \nleader is trying to bring up the Defense authorization bill. I am more \nthan happy to consider other amendments. If people have them, bring \nthem up and see if we cannot finish this legislation. It is possible we \ncan get it done this evening. The majority leader has indicated if we \ncan complete this bill this evening, there will be no votes tomorrow. \nWe will then complete the process and next week, I guess, move--I do \nnot want to speak for the leadership--but I gather there is a strong \nindication we will move to the Defense authorization bill. We will move \nto other legislation, if not Defense authorization.\n  I was hoping in the next hour or so we could get some time agreements \non amendments. Otherwise, my fear is we will end up into next week, and \nif that is the case, then people will be slow-walking this bill.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Missouri. He made a \nfine speech about the importance of this legislation. There is a \nconsensus that we need to do something on terrorism insurance. It is \ncausing economic problems for our country, for all the reasons I \nidentified.\n  Certainly I am happy to entertain and debate relevant amendments that \ndeal directly with this bill and move on them, either accepting them or \ndefeating them. Let's see if we cannot get this bill done. We started \nit early this morning. We have already dealt with a couple major \namendments. We have accepted some colloquies that have been offered as \nan alternative.\n  We are going to end up in a conference with the other body. There are \nsubstantial differences between both of these bills. It is going to \nrequire continued work and labor. Those who are concerned about getting \nsomething done, let it be known I am fully prepared to entertain \namendments. I will offer time agreements to try to wrap them up early, \nbut if this goes on much longer, I presume the leader will consider \nhaving to file cloture, and then we will have to limit amendments, at \nleast limit them to relevant amendments.\n  It is now almost 5:30, and I hope we might get a couple more \namendments done, particularly some of those that are outstanding that I \nknow need to be debated and considered. The quicker that is done, the \nmore rapidly we can conclude work on this bill and vote it either up or \ndown, but we will have dealt with terrorism insurance.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut with whom I have \nbeen on this floor when considering major pieces of legislation--we do \nnot have a better manager in the Senate than Senator Dodd. He does a \nwonderful, outstanding, exemplary job. He is here ready to work.\n  Yesterday afternoon, we finished the estate tax debate. The majority \nleader at that time wanted to move to this legislation, but Members who \nwere interested in this legislation said: We have had a hard couple \ndays; why don't you wait until tomorrow?\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut, it appears to me that this is an \neffort to slow down this legislation. We wanted to move to it last \nnight, allow Members to make opening statements and offer amendments, \nbut the majority leader said: No, they say they do not want to; go \nahead and agree with that.\n  Now here we are today, not much happening all afternoon, and if the \nmajority leader did decide to file cloture today people would yell and \nscream saying this is the first day.\n  It is not really the first day. We wanted to do it yesterday. \nTomorrow is Friday. Monday is already a scheduled no-vote day, but that \ndoes not mean it is a no-amendment day. Tomorrow we may not work a full \nday as we normally do with votes all day, but this body will stay in as \nlate as anyone wants to offer amendments.\n  So the Senator is absolutely right. We are going to finish this \nlegislation. I say to my friend, and I think he is aware of this, all \nof the industry groups all over America that are interested in this \nhave sent letters and e-mails to anyone who will pick them up, saying \nthey support cloture on this.\n  Everybody is tired of this. We have danced since late last year on \nthis legislation. We are going to complete this legislation. It is only \na question of whether we do it tonight or whether we do it next week \nsometime. Will the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with that.\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n  Obviously, it helps the work of the Senate if we can complete it this \nevening, but tomorrow morning would make more sense. We still have a \nlot of work to do in conference to get this done. I know the \nadministration is interested, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe President, and many others. My colleague from Nevada mentioned the \nvarious business groups that are interested. I should also note that \nthe building trades, the AFL-CIO, have sent a strong letter in support \nof this legislation. It is one of those rare occasions when groups that \nsometimes are antagonistic to each other on a legislative effort have \ncome together and have, for months now, asked that we respond to this. \nSo we are hopeful to get this done.\n  Again, I will stay here as late as anyone wants. I will make time \ntomorrow. I will make time next week. We are going to get the bill done \none way or the other. It serves everyone's interest to try to complete \nthis work sooner rather than later.\n  I merely wanted to make those points to our colleagues who are \nwondering what the schedule will be. Obviously, the leadership will \nmake up its own mind about how to proceed, but it certainly would be in \nour interest--we have been here a couple of hours with really no \namendments. I know there are some. If people have them, come over and \noffer them. We will happily consider them. I do not include in that \ngroup the Presiding Officer, who offered a very strong amendment, who \nis now working with us and is working on another amendment trying to \nwork things out, but it is relevant to the subject matter of the bill.\n  I hope those who have amendments will offer them, withdraw them, or \noffer some alternative we can consider as we go into the conference, if \nthe bill is passed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, \nwill be here momentarily and will ask to set aside the pending \namendment in order to offer an amendment on terrorism to obtain \njudgments from frozen assets of terrorists, terrorist organizations, \nand state-sponsored terrorism, and others.\n  I thought since we had a moment I would address this issue. As I \nunderstand it, the majority leader will be coming out shortly to make \nannouncements, and I will be happy to yield the floor at that time.\n  I am hopeful we can take up this issue on the floor and that it can \nbe considered before the body, allowing people to be able to consider \nthis. There are a number of people who have been harmed greatly, and \nfamily members have been killed by terrorist organizations. We need to \nprovide a means for satisfaction. This is one way that it could be \ntaken care of.\n  If I may reply to those who say this particular bill is not the \nappropriate vehicle, we have a limited number of vehicles left in front \nof this body. This is the appropriate point in time for us to be able \nto bring this forward.\n  I understand the Senator from Virginia will be bringing it forward so \nit can be worked out, and the administration and Congress is coming \nforward with other ways and means of dealing with it. Yet I am still \nhopeful that we can get this taken care of on this particular bill.\n  I note there has been a lot of pressure to get this bill wrapped up.\n  I understand the Senator from Virginia has been caught in traffic and \nis trying to get here to offer his amendment. I would like to see us \ntake up this amendment and have it considered and moved forward.\n  He asked me, through his staff, if I would bring up this amendment. \nIf we could consider this important piece of legislation in front of \nthis body, I think this would be very valuable. If we could allow this \nto take place, I think it would be a positive note.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3838\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself, Mr. Burns, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire and Mr. Warner, proposes an \namendment numbered 3838.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for satisfaction of judgments from frozen assets \n     of terrorists, terrorist organizations, and State sponsors of \n                   terrorism, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENTS FROM FROZEN ASSETS OF \n                   TERRORISTS, TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND STATE \n                   SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, and except as provided in subsection (b), in every case \n     in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist \n     party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism or for which \n     a terrorist party is not immune under section 1605(a)(7) of \n     title 28, United States Code, the blocked assets of that \n     terrorist party (including the blocked assets of any agency \n     or instrumentality of that terrorist party) shall be subject \n     to execution or attachment in aid of execution in order to \n     satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory \n     damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged \n     liable.\n       (b) Presidential Waiver.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), upon determining \n     on an asset-by-asset basis that a waiver is necessary in the \n     national security interest, the President may waive the \n     requirements of subsection (a) in connection with (and prior \n     to the enforcement of) any judicial order directing \n     attachment in aid of execution or execution against any \n     property subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \n     Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n       (2) Exception.--A waiver under this subsection shall not \n     apply to--\n       (A) property subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \n     Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations that \n     has been used by the United States for any nondiplomatic \n     purpose (including use as rental property), or the proceeds \n     of such use; or\n       (B) the proceeds of any sale or transfer for value to a \n     third party of any asset subject to the Vienna Convention on \n     Diplomatic Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular \n     Relations.\n       (c) Special Rule for Cases Against Iran.--Section 2002 of \n     the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of \n     2000 (Public Law 106-386; 114 Stat. 1542) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii), by inserting after ``July \n     27, 2000'' the following: ``or before October 28, 2000,'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(2)(B), by inserting after ``the date \n     of enactment of this Act'' the following: ``(less amounts \n     therein as to which the United States has an interest in \n     subrogation pursuant to subsection (c) arising prior to the \n     date of entry of the judgment or judgments to be satisfied in \n     whole or in part hereunder).'';\n       (3) by redesignating subsections (d), (e), and (f) as \n     subsections (e), (f), and (g), respectively;

Mr. President, I rise to present this amendment, No. 3838, \nwhich is a measure that has to do with allowing those who are victims \nof terrorist acts in the past who have judgments, to collect those \njudgments against the assets of the terrorist states or the state-\nsponsored terrorist states involved in these acts. I thank the \ncosponsors of the basic bill that has been introduced, which is the \nbasis for this amendment.\n  The cosponsors include Senator Warner; the lead of this on the \nDemocrat side, Senator Harkin of Iowa, Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator \nBayh, Senator Cleland, Senator Collins, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Miller, Senator Schumer, Senator Torricelli, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Burns, Senator Clinton, Senator Craig, Senator \nHollings, Senator Mikulski, Senator Nickles, and Senator Bob Smith.\n  I particularly want to thank Mr. Harkin for the leadership he has \nshown on this issue. He has stood strong for making terrorists \nresponsible for their actions and for justice. I'm grateful for Sen. \nHarkin's tireless efforts in making this proposal a reality. Now, this \namendment would permit the blocked assets of terrorists, terrorist \norganizations, and state sponsors of international terrorism, to be \nused to compensate American victims of terrorism.\n  A little history: In 1996, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act, which, in section 221, expressly amended \nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow American victims of \nterrorism to seek justice through the courts against foreign terrorist \ngovernments. In 1998, Congress again amended the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act, stating explicitly that any property of a terrorist \nstate that was frozen by the U.S. Treasury Department was subject to \nexecution or attachment to satisfy the victim's court judgments.\n  However, in response to bureaucratic interference, Congress again, in \n2000, as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection \nAct, endorsed the policy of using blocked assets to impose a cost on \nterrorism and provide justice to victims.\n  Currently, there are at least $3.7 billion in blocked or frozen \nassets of seven state sponsors of terrorism. However, the executive \nbranch bureaucracy is once again preventing these funds from being used \nto compensate American victims who have brought lawsuits in our Federal \ncourts, won their cases, and secured court-ordered judgments--victims \nsuch as Edwina Hegna of Virginia.\n  In the 1980s, Mrs. Hegna's husband, Charles Hegna, was an employee of \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development. In 1984, his flight from \nKuwait City to Karachi, Pakistan, was hijacked by Hizbollah, an \nIranian-backed organization. The terrorists demanded that all Americans \nreveal themselves. Mr. Hegna stepped forward. The terrorists then beat \nand tortured him. Upon landing, they forced him to kneel. Witnesses \nheard Mr. Hegna praying for his life. He was then shot in the stomach \nand thrown 20 feet to the tarmac below while still alive, breaking \nnearly every bone in his lower body. He didn't die. He laid in agony \nfor about an hour. As an ambulance arrived, the terrorists leaned out \nof the airplane door and shot him repeatedly. He died in the ambulance \nat the age of 50, survived by his wife and their 4 children.\n  Mrs. Hegna currently has a multimillion dollar judgment, but is \nunable to receive any compensation.\n  In another equally brutal case in which I prefer not to mention the \nname of the family, but nevertheless it was a case in Kuwait. A pastor \nwho now lives in Richmond, VA, was held captive while he and his \nchildren were forced to watch--and his children at the time were 10 and \n13 years old--the terrorists sexually assault his wife. He currently \nholds a $1 million court judgment but is unable to satisfy that \njudgment.\n  The United States must say today to the executive bureaucracy that \nMrs. Hegna and this pastor from Richmond and all the victims--and they \nare not all from Virginia; they are from Iowa, New York, New Hampshire; \nthey are from States across our Nation--for all these victims who have \nsuffered at the hands of these ruthless terrorists we ought to say they \ncan be compensated from the blocked assets of these terrorists and \ntheir sponsors.\n  Indeed, this measure talks about terrorism reinsurance and who ought \nto be sued, the obligations of insurance companies and how should we \nback up those insurance companies. In these cases where someone has a \njudgment and where there are assets that have been seized, it is the \nterrorists and their state sponsors, not the American taxpayers, who \nshould be held accountable for these heinous crimes.\n  This amendment will accomplish three salient principles: \nResponsibility, justice, and punishment and deterrence.\n  Responsibility: At least financial responsibility for the injuries \nand damages from those who are culpable for the terrorist criminal \nacts.\n  Justice: Justice for the victims and the victims' families.\n  Punishment and deterrence: Those who sponsor these terrorist acts \nshould be punished and deterred.\n  Therefore, I ask that my colleagues stand with the victims, stand \nwith their families, and allow them to get some satisfaction, albeit \nonly financial satisfaction.\n  I request that we move forward with this terrorism reinsurance bill, \nbut also add to it this opportunity for the Senate to take a stand and \nallow those folks who have had these injuries and these damages and \nloss of life, in some cases, to have those judgments satisfied, maybe \nsatisfied in part, but satisfied against the assets that have been \nseized from primarily two countries that have been involved--Iran and \nIraq.\n  Some say we should be worried about what Iraq and Iran might do about \nall this. But sitting back and worrying about what they might do is not \ngoing to help these families and is not going to help this country. I \nam going to stand with these families, these victims, and our judicial \nsystem. Let these victims get after these assets. Let them try to \nrebuild their lives in some part.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAMM. What are we seconding?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is requesting the \nyeas and nays on his amendment. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to support \nSenator Allen's amendment to provide justice to American victims of \ninternational terrorism.\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\n  It is appropriate that today we are debating legislation to provide a \nFederal backstop to existing and future insurance policies covering \nterrorist acts. That legislation provides economic protection for the \nU.S. economy for acts of terrorism. I believe that this legislation \nshould be amended to address the issue of Americans held hostage and \ntortured by terrorists to specifically hold liable nations that provide \nfinancial and other support for terrorist that target the symbols and \ncitizens of America. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the The \nTerrorism Victim's Access to Compensation Act of 2002 that Senator \nGeorge Allen and Senator Tom Harkin have introduced.\n  That bill provides redress for victims of terrorism to receive \ncompensation from nations that sponsor terrorism. I appeared with \nSenators Harkin and Allen at a press conference with Americans who have \nexperienced first hand the despicable and evil use of terrorism that \nevery American can understand as a result of the tragic events of \nSeptember 11 2001.\n  What right does a citizen have to fight back against a terrorist \nnation? The only power that individual has is to sue that terrorist \nnation in court to gain access to seized assets from terrorist nations. \nOur Nation is in a war against terrorism and this amendment provides \nanother tool in the war against nations that sponsor terrorism. This \namendment requires that compensation be paid from the blocked assets of \nterrorist nations provided that the American victims of terrorism \nsecure a final judgment in our Federal courts.\n  Victims of terrorism have many sad stories, and I want to bring to \nyou attention the sad plight of a man who had a residence in New \nHampshire during the toughest time of his life.\n  In November of 1989, William Van Dorp was sent by his employer from \nhis home in Kingston, NH to Kuwait City to teach the Kuwaiti Air Force \nEnglish. On August 2, 1990, Kuwait was invaded by the forces of Saddam \nHussein.\n  Let me use William Van Dorp's own words to describe what happened:\n\n       On August 4, I heard loud rumblings coming from the road \n     and, when I looked out my window, I saw seventeen trucks, \n     filled with Iraqi troops, and three tanks driving toward the \n     beach. It became apparent to me that I was still in the \n     middle of a combat zone and in immediate danger of \n     encountering enemy fire.\n\n  William Van Dorp attempted to escape the Iraqis who were rounding up \nAmerican hostages. Mr. Van Dorp was attempting to leave the \nIntercontinental Hotel in Kuwait City. Mr. Van Dorp describes the event \nas follows:\n\n       When I reached the lobby, I saw a U.S. Embassy official \n     yelling at an Iraqi colonel and trying to convince him not to \n     take the Westerners away. I was being taken into custody by \n     heavily armed Iraqi soldiers. Later that evening I was packed \n     into a military truck with roughly 23 American citizens and \n     transported to an army camp about an hour from Kuwait City.\n\n  William Van Dorp was held hostage by the Iraqi government for months. \nDuring the Persian Gulf war Iraqi used American hostages to be \nimprisoned at sites where the Iraqis thought the United States would \ntarget during the Persian Gulf war.\n  The nations of Iran and Iraq have committed unspeakable acts against \nAmerican and against citizens of my state of New Hampshire. Those \nnations deserve to be punished. Recently, Iraqi President Saddam \nHussien pledged increased Iraq's payments to the families of \nPalestinian suicide bombers from $10,000 to $25,000.\n  The press has reported in the past that Iran may be harboring \nterrorists from the Al-Qaida network and Taliban. I don't know that to \nbe true, but it has been reported by the press that Iran and Iraq have \nnot been allies in the war against terrorism. Our diplomatic efforts to \nchange these countries has fallen on deaf ears and these countries are \nsupporting terrorism throughout the globe. Iran, Iraq, and North Korea \nare the ``Axis of Evil.''\n  I am sure that every Member of this body remembers the Iran hostage \ncrisis. Americans who worked in the U.S. Embassy of Iran were held \nhostage by the Iranian government more than 20 years ago. Those \nhostages sued the government of Iran. The Iranian Government did not \nmake an appearance in the U.S. court to defend themselves, but as iron \nwould have it, lawyers, not from Iran, were in the U.S. courtroom to \ndefend the interests of government of Iran.\n  Does anybody in this Chamber know what lawyers were in court \ndefending the interests of the Iranian government? It was our own \nJustice Department and the U.S. State Department. How do you think the \nU.S. hostage felt about the U.S. Government, using tax dollars from \nthese same U.S. hostages, defending the interests of the Iran \ngovernment.\n  The Washington Post, on October 16, 2001 reported that:\n\n       U.S. Government lawyers went to Federal court yesterday \n     seeking to vacate a judgment against Iran in a lawsuit filed \n     by 52 Americans have were held captive in that country more \n     than 20 years ago. The timing of the government motion, \n     nearly a year after the lawsuit was filed and two months \n     after the judgment was entered, drew sharp criticism from \n     some of the former hostages, who accused the Bush \n     administration of trying to mute their claims because of the \n     current conflict in Afghanistan. ``The State Department and \n     the Justice Department are doing this only to curry favor \n     with Iran at this juncture of history,'' said Barry M. Rosen, \n     a former hostage who is now director of public affairs at \n     Columbia University's Teachers College. ``I was outraged.''\n\n  Another former hostage retired Army Col. Charles W. Scott who had \nthree teeth knocked out during brutal interrogations, said, ``In \ncombat, you have a weapon and can fight back. Here, we were defenseless \nand brutalized. For the first time I understood what the people of the \nHolocaust went through.'' Americans who are the victims of terrorist \nacts sponsored by nations that are deemed by the State Department to be \nstate sponsors of terrorism should be punished.\n  I urge the Senate to support the Allen amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is in error. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will work to attempt to vote on the \nAllen amendment tomorrow as well, but we have been working over the \ncourse of the last several hours--and I thank those of our colleagues \nwho have been involved--to accommodate a unanimous consent request that \nI understand has now been cleared on both sides. In order to ensure we \ncan inform our colleagues of the schedule for the remainder of the \nevening and tomorrow, I propound this unanimous consent request so that \nat least this can be scheduled.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe terrorism insurance bill on Friday, June 14, at 9:35 a.m., the \nSantorum amendment No. 3842 be withdrawn; that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3275 and that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; that Senator Leahy, or \nhis designee, be recognized to call up the Leahy-Hatch substitute \namendment at the desk; that upon reporting by the clerk, the Senate \nvote on the adoption of the amendment; that following adoption of the \namendment, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate \nvote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate; \nfurther, that upon the disposition of H.R. 3275, the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1770; that the \nSenate proceed to its consideration; that the Senate consider the \nLeahy-Hatch amendment at the desk; and that upon reporting the \namendment, the Senate vote on the adoption of the amendment; that \nfollowing the vote, the bill, as amended, be read three times and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all \nwithout intervening action or debate; further, that any statements \nrelating to these items be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like to \nhave considered at some point. I would like to see it considered. It is \na very narrow issue, and I would like to see if we can get this in the \nqueue of items. It is not under consideration. If my colleague, the \nmajority leader, can consider it, I would like to be able to put it \nforward. If not, I believe I will need to object to proceeding under \nthis unanimous consent request.\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kansas be \nrecognized to offer his amendment following the disposition of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, may I inquire of the \nsubstance of the amendment of the Senator from Kansas?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is an issue on patenting, and it is an issue that I \nthink is a very important one for us to consider. I want to bring it up \nand press it. It is a narrow one. I think we ought to consider it. I \nwould like to offer it.\n  Mr. DODD. Further reserving the right to object, is this the cloning \namendment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is patenting of human beings. It is the issue of \npatenting of humans which I would like to put forward at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with all due respect, as someone trying to \nmanage a bill, I regretfully object to consideration of that amendment \nat this point. I am trying to deal with the subject matter at hand. It \nis going to be impossible----\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the majority leader is in the Chamber, \nwe have worked now for several hours to get a vote for Senator \nSantorum. I cannot understand why the Senator from Kansas would prevent \nus from having this vote. He has an opportunity on this legislation at \na subsequent time to offer an amendment. No one can stop him from \noffering an amendment.\n  I think the majority leader will announce shortly that there will be \nample opportunity tomorrow and Monday to offer amendments. So I do not \nknow why the Senator from Kansas would hold up a vote that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has been trying to get for several hours.\n  I also say to the leader that while he was proffering his unanimous \nconsent request, the Senator from Virginia said he would have no \nproblem voting on his amendment tomorrow morning. That will give anyone \nwho has any objection to the amendment of the Senator from Virginia the \nchance to speak tonight for as long as they want. We can set this up \nfollowing the vote on the Santorum amendment, whatever we want to call \nit, the one on which we asked unanimous consent.\n  I ask the Senator from Kansas to kindly reconsider allowing us to \nvote on the Santorum amendment and, following that, vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia, and then the floor is open and \nanybody can offer an amendment. The Senator from Kansas or the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania can offer another amendment, or the Senator from \nanyplace can offer any amendment they want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will renew my request in a moment. I do \nnot know that any Senator can be denied the right to offer an amendment \nas long as cloture has not been filed and achieved. It is not my desire \nnow to file cloture. At some point, if we cannot bring this debate to a \nconclusion, I will be forced to do so. Until that time, of course, the \nSenator has every right to come to the floor to offer an amendment.\n  We are going to be in session tomorrow and on Monday, even though \nthere are no votes on Monday. So I hope Senators will use that time to \ncome to the floor to offer what I would hope will be relevant \namendments.\n  We certainly cannot prohibit the Senator from offering other \nlegislation. So I would renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to make sure I do get an opportunity to \nbring this issue forward, so I ask unanimous consent that before the \nconclusion of this bill I have the opportunity to put forward and have \nthis amendment considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Senator do this tomorrow morning or Monday?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. All I am doing is asking unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to offer this amendment sometime during the pendency of this \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. That seems somewhat unfair. We have all day Friday, all day \nMonday. Anytime before the end of the bill could be a long time from \nnow.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator does not need that consent. \nHe can offer that amendment, as the Senator from Nevada has noted, \ntomorrow, Monday, or any day. That does not require a unanimous \nconsent. I have no objection to his request, but it does not take a \nunanimous consent. He is entitled to that until cloture is obtained. If \ncloture were invoked, he would probably be denied the right. We are not \nanticipating a cloture vote, at least in the foreseeable future. So the \nSenator is certainly entitled to his right to offer this amendment \nwhenever he chooses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have had difficulty at times being \nable to get the floor, as people maybe would say, well, we do not want \nto consider this at this particular time. I want to make sure we can.\n  Unfortunately for me, I will not be present tomorrow. As many of my \ncolleagues know, we have had in the Philippines the death of a Kansan \nwho is being buried tomorrow, Mr. Burnham, and I will be at that \nfuneral tomorrow morning. But I want to make sure this issue can come \nup and can be heard before the end of this bill. I do not think that is \nan inappropriate request.\n  I renew the request that I be allowed to bring up this amendment \nsometime during the pendency of this bill. I ask unanimous consent that \nI be allowed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I did not understand the request. I have not modified my \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader made a unanimous consent \nrequest to which the objection was heard from the Senator from Kansas. \nSo the question is, Will the majority leader modify his unanimous \nconsent request to include the unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Kansas?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I said, that does not require a \nunanimous consent request, but I would not object to the request made \nby the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. My concern is we are providing the Senator from Kansas \nsomething that has been provided to no one else. We could have every \nMember demand a unanimous consent on totally irrelevant amendments to \nthis bill. If we go down that road and if the Senator wants to kill \nthis bill, that is fine, filibuster the bill, but to bring up totally \nextraneous amendments, it seems to me, is unwarranted.\n  I have talked a number of our colleagues out of offering amendments \nthat had nothing to do with this bill, no matter how meritorious their \nproposals. Certainly, the majority leader has indicated the Senator has \nthe right precloture to bring up an amendment. Cloture has not been \ninvoked. If we can move this bill along, there is no reason for it to \nbe invoked, but to cut out one exception for one Member to make a \nunanimous consent request, after I have talked other people out of it, \nI do not think is terribly fair.\n  I urge my colleague from Kansas to withdraw the request. If we can \nagree to move this bill along, we are dealing, then, with the Santorum \namendment tomorrow. We have tomorrow, next Monday, next Tuesday. We can \nspend all next week on this bill if Members are so inclined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me reiterate something I think \neverybody understands. Obviously, the consideration of an amendment \ndoes not mean the disposal or the resolution of the issue. The Senator \nis only asking for consideration of the amendment. It could be second-\ndegreed. It could be debated. I do not know that he has asked that it \nbe brought to some final conclusion.\n  I will say this: If cloture is invoked, if the amendment has not been \ndisposed of and it is not a germane amendment, then it would fall, but \nthat certainly would not disallow the consideration of an amendment. \nSo, again, I would pursue my request.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the majority leader yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If the Senator will yield, I think I have perhaps a \nsolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask the amendment I have be considered after the \nAllen amendment tonight. I am prepared to put it forward this evening, \nif it would be acceptable to the leader to do that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am hopeful that at some point we are going to work out a \ncompromise and move this bill forward. It seems to me the position we \nare in is we want to set this vote up for tomorrow. The Senator has the \nright to object to doing that, pending getting the opportunity \nguaranteed that he can offer his amendment. If he is here--and he has \nthis problem with this funeral apparently--no one can prevent him from \ndoing it. I am hopeful if we work out a compromise that we might talk \nhim out of offering the amendment. So I think we should accept the \namended unanimous consent request of the majority leader. I do not see \nthat we are giving him anything that he would not have if we were not \nhere. It seems to me, pending trying to work out a compromise, that we \nwould be better off not having it offered tonight. He could offer it as \na second-degree amendment tonight--it is perfectly within the rules--\nby objecting to setting up the vote for tomorrow. So I think the \nlogical thing to do is to take the majority leader's proposal.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will the majority leader yield for one question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I would make a parliamentary inquiry. If there is a \nunanimous consent request which is agreed to, for the consideration of \nan amendment that would otherwise fail in a postcloture environment, \ndoes that amendment still prevail if cloture is invoked? Or at least \nwill that amendment be considered without being violative of the rules \nof cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If that is the intent of the unanimous consent \nrequest, then it would be in order.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, if I may ask the distinguished majority \nleader a question, so I understand the procedure as he originally \noutlined it. May I inquire as to when the vote on my amendment would \noccur? As far as I am concerned, the amendment having to do with \ngetting after terrorist assets for those who obtain judgments in this \ncountry has broad bipartisan support. Is there any reason why we could \nnot vote on that tonight or, in accommodation to a lot of people who \nwill be gone, vote on it on Tuesday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was entertaining the possibility of \nvoting on the Allen amendment, as well as on the Santorum amendment, \ntomorrow morning. If the discussion of the amendment has been \ncompleted, we could lay it aside temporarily to allow the Brownback \namendment to be laid down and then return to the Allen amendment \ntomorrow morning. That would be fine with me. I will say that this will \ngenerate other amendments. The Brownback amendment will not be the only \namendment offered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. All right.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We will then be able to dispose of the Allen amendment \ntomorrow morning. So I have no reservations or objections to doing that \nif our colleagues would be interested in taking that approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. A further inquiry of our leader. The point is, as I \nunderstand it, at some point tomorrow morning the earliest vote would \nbe a vote on the Santorum amendment. Let us assume the vote on the \nSantorum amendment is at 9 or 9:30. Thereafter, say 10 minutes later, \nthere would be a vote on my amendment tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have not propounded the request, but \nit would be my intention to vote on it immediately after the \ndisposition of the Santorum amendment.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If there is no disagreement, I would then again amend my \nrequest in the following manner: In addition to the request as it was \noriginally propounded, I ask that we vote on the Allen amendment \nimmediately following the disposition of the Santorum amendment \ntomorrow morning. I would further ask that the Allen amendment be set \naside to accommodate the amendment to be offered by the Senator from \nKansas, and that amendment be the pending business this evening; that \nwe return to the Santorum amendment tomorrow morning, to be followed \nthen by the Allen amendment, after its disposition.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just for clarification, when I refer to \nthe Santorum amendment, I refer to the legislation as it was referred \nto in the unanimous consent request. It is more than an amendment. It \nis now a freestanding bill under the request. I think all of my \ncolleagues understood that, but I want to ensure that people know that \nwould be the order of business tomorrow morning.\n  With this request, there will be no further rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. President, I ask further unanimous consent that no amendments be \nin order to the Allen amendment prior to the vote on the Allen \namendment tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if there are no Senators wishing to be \nrecognized, I have a statement to make, for which I will use leader \ntime, with regard to the Middle East.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5513-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5513-S5514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, too often, the crush of daily business \nhere in the Senate leaves us little time to discuss important issues \nthat are not directly and immediately before us.\n  Among the many issues that deserve greater attention, none is more \nimportant than the need for peace in the Middle East, and the security \nof our friend and ally, Israel. The urgency and importance of this \nissue couldn't be more stark. In this past week alone, a suicide \nbomber--the 68th in the last 21 months--blew up a fast food restaurant \nin Israel, killing a 15-year-old girl. Another bomb, placed near a road \nnear Hebron, injured three Israeli teenagers. A third bomb, detonated \nnext to a bus outside Tel Aviv, killed 17 Israelis. A fourth attack--\nthis one with guns, not bombs--killed a pregnant mother. Less than a \nweek: three bombs; several attacks. The targets in each--civilians: \nfathers, mothers, teenagers, young children.\n  Given the steady stream of terrorist acts, the historic enmity \nbetween the parties, and the stakes involved, the situation could \nhardly be more difficult. But we cannot turn our backs or allow the \nspecter of violence to diminish our commitment. Our unique relationship \nwith Israel, and the strategic importance of the Middle East, demand \nthat the United States play a leading role in helping to end the \ncurrent crisis.\n  The President recognizes this dynamic, and has spoken out forcefully \non the importance of the leaders in the region taking steps to end the \nviolence. There can be no mistaking the indignation he feels about what \nis happening in Israel or his appreciation for the strategic importance \nof the entire region to our national security. In fact, he and his team \nhave undertaken an effort to sound out leaders in the region in order \nto fashion a new way forward. I understand that as early as next week\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nhe will outline the results of those efforts. Like all Americans, I am \neager to hear the President's plan.\n  If there is one message in our success so far in the global war on \nterrorism it is this: When we stand together, terrorism cannot win. \nRight now, at this very moment, Afghanistan's new leaders are meeting \nin Kabul to choose a new government, a government that will represent \nAfghans of all ethnic backgrounds. They are sending a message of hope \nthat the Taliban and al-Qaida never could: Terrorists can only destroy, \ndemocracies build. We want the Palestinian people to know that if their \nleaders will take the necessary steps to end the violence in their \nregion, we are ready to build in the West Bank and Gaza too.\n  This afternoon I want to talk briefly about three principles that I \nbelieve should guide our efforts to help bring security, stability, \nand, ultimately, peace to this troubled region.\n  First, after 68 homicide bombings, the debate over whether Chairman \nArafat is unable or unwilling to stop terrorism is unproductive and \nirrelevant. It is no longer important. What matters is that Chairman \nArafat has clearly and consistently failed the test of leadership. If \nChairman Arafat would take consistent, decisive actions against \nterrorist violence, circumstances would be different. But he has been \nunwilling to exercise this basic authority that is required of his \noffice and required by the agreements he has signed and the commitments \nhe has made on behalf of the Palestinian people. He has undermined his \nown credibility as the leader of the Palestinian people.\n  The second principle that should guide our efforts is this: Words \nalone are not enough. Reform demands results. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and \nJordan are all pushing for reforms of the Palestinian Authority. Their \nefforts are commendable. Unfortunately, their demands--and the demands \nof the Palestinian people--seem to be falling on deaf ears. Chairman \nArafat has put a figurehead in control of the security services, \nleaving the power in his own hands. He signed the Basic Law but has \ndone nothing to implement it. He added five new faces to his Cabinet, \nnone of whom has the power to affect real change. And he announced new \nelections but set no date for them.\n  It is time to demand results, beginning with a democratic Palestinian \nleadership that confronts corruption and provides security for the \nPalestinian people and their neighbors. We want the Palestinian people \nto know: Such changes will garner support--in this country and in this \nCongress. America's people and political institutions will help rebuild \nthe West Bank and repair the infrastructure of Palestinian society when \nthe Palestinian leadership rejects violence and moves toward real, \ndemocratic reform. Such leadership, I am convinced, will also find a \nwilling partner in Israel, which has time and again taken risks for \npeace. Rabin did it at Oslo, Netanyahu at Wye, and Barak at Camp David. \nAnd earlier this week, in this very building, Prime Minister Sharon \nmade it clear he would be willing to make the sacrifices necessary to \nadd his name to this distinguished list of warriors who fought for \npeace, if he is convinced there is a committed partner on the other \nside of the peace table.\n  The third and final principle is this: America's commitment to peace \nin the Middle East must be clear and consistent. It must never wane. \nPresident Harry Truman recognized Israel as a valued ally 6 minutes \nafter Israel was created. Every American President since Harry Truman \nhas known that the best hope for peace and positive reform in the \nregion lies in sustained and decisive American engagement.\n  Every President since Harry Truman has made such engagement a \ncornerstone of American foreign policy. The current violence in the \nMiddle East does not diminish the importance of U.S. engagement, it \nincreases it. If there is to be any lasting peace, any chance for \nregional stability, Israel must be secure enough to make peace and \nstrong enough to enforce it. That is a commitment the United States has \nmade--and will keep. But there is another commitment we must honor as \nwell, and that is our commitment to stand by Israel when she takes \nrisks for peace, and stand with all parties who embrace peace as their \ngoal--Israelis and Palestinians.\n  The United States is, and will remain, Israel's best friend. We are \nalso the best hope for bringing all of the parties in the region \ntogether at the peace table. No other country in the world is in a \nbetter position to facilitate a dialog. We must remain actively and \nconsistently engaged in the search for peace. We do not, for one \nminute, underestimate the difficulty of this task. The challenges, and \nthe risks, are enormous. But the probable cost of doing nothing or \nvacillating from our historic course is far greater. It is too great a \nprice to even consider.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5514-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5514-S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Under the previous unanimous consent agreement, I send \nan amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3843:\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. UNPATENTABILITY OF HUMAN ORGANISMS.\n\n       Section 101 of title 35, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``Whoever''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Unpatentability of Human Organisms.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `human \n     cloning' means human asexual reproduction, accomplished by \n     introducing nuclear material from one or more human somatic \n     cells into a fertilized or unfertilized oocyte whose nuclear \n     material has been removed or inactivated so as to produce a \n     living organism (at any stage of development) that is \n     genetically virtually identical to an existing or previously \n     existing human organism.\n       ``(2) Unpatentability.--A patent may not be obtained for--\n       ``(A) an organism of the human species at any stage of \n     development produced by any method, whether in vitro or in \n     vivo, including the zygote, embryo, fetus, child or adult;\n       ``(B) a living organism made by human cloning; or\n       ``(C) a process of human cloning.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, we are going to open a debate in the \nU.S. Senate on the future of humanity. I asked the clerk to read the \nentirety of the amendment because I wanted people to know what is \npending now. The issue is a very narrow and a very clear one. It is \nabout whether or not we allow the patenting of people.\n  This is an issue that is pending. There are at least three different \npatents in front of the Patent Office. The issue of whether you can \npatent human life or the process of creating human life is a question \nthat is a live one in front of our Government, in front of our people. \nAs I mentioned, there are three pending today. There are likely to be \nmany more.\n  This is a narrow subsection of the overall issue on human cloning. \nThis is not the issue about a moratorium on cloning. It is not the \nissue about a ban on human cloning. It is not the issue about \ntherapeutic cloning. This is about whether or not we as a government \nwill allow a person, a human in any stage or age of its development and \ngrowth, to be patented.\n  Currently, the Patent Office is rejecting these patents, saying they \nhave that authority under the 13th amendment to the Constitution. That \nis the amendment that bans slavery. I happen to think the Patent Office \nis on good ground to be able to say that they cannot allow these \npatents because this would be slavery.\n  There are others who are contending that the young human at various \nstages--an embryo--is not a person, therefore is patentable; that a \nperson can be patented because it is a piece of property. It is, in \nessence, livestock.\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\n  It is alive, we know that. But they would contend or say that it is \nnot a person, so therefore we are putting this forward to make it clear \nto the Patent Office, for the people of America, the people around the \nworld, that you can't patent a person at any stage or age of its \ndevelopment and growth. That is the entirety of the amendment. The \nclerk read the entire amendment.\n  Ultimately, the question that will be put before this Senate and this \ncountry, indeed the world, will be this: Shall we use human life for \nresearch purposes? Shall we use human life for commercial purposes? We \nare taking this as a narrow issue now on the issue of patentability.\n  In this debate we will have to answer whether or not the young human \nat his or her earliest moments of life is a person or is a piece of \nproperty. That is the narrow and the focused issue that is in front of \nus.\n  Cloning proponents will argue that the young human is a piece of \nproperty that can be created or destroyed at the whims of society for \nthe benefit of others. I will argue that the young human is a person; \nthat it is wrong to treat another person as a piece of property that \ncan be bought and sold, created and destroyed, all at the will of those \nin power.\n  I think we all understand that human cloning is an issue of vast \nimportance to our society and for humanity. This issue, unlike others, \nreveals the value we hold and the worth we place on human life. It is a \ndecision that one generation of mankind will be making for all future \ngenerations of mankind.\n  I would also argue it is an issue that will determine what kind of \nfuture we will give to our children and grandchildren and their \nchildren and their children's children. The essential question is \nwhether or not we will allow human beings to produce, to preordained \nspecifications for eventual implantation or destruction, dependent upon \nthe intentions of the technicians who create them; whether or not we \nwill allow life to be created just to be destroyed and researched upon.\n\n  The question and its corollary must be addressed before the \ntechnology overtakes our public discourse. Indeed, today we have many \nof these capacities to do this to us now. We are doing it to animals \nand mammals. We can do this in humans. The question is, Should we do \nthis? Is it right for us to do this? Is it the point in time that we \nwant to make this decision to do this? Do we want to make this decision \nfor all future mankind or do we want to pause? Do we want to stop here \nfor just a moment and say, Wait? We should really think about such a \nmonumental step and such a monumental move.\n  I would like to begin by making a few observations.\n  First, as we debate the issue, we need to debate the science along \nwith the biological reality of the human embryo from his or her \nearliest moments of life. We all know that the human embryo is a life. \nBut some question whether it is a life or a person.\n  Clearly, the human embryo--whether brought into being in a woman, \nwhether artificially created in a test tube by fertilization, or by \ncloning--is seen by observation to be a new being of human genetic \nconstitution and a unified life principle that in all normal \ncircumstances of implementation and development will grow into an adult \nwho will one day die. Because we call the adult a human person and \nbecause there is an essential, unified, biological continuity between \nhim or her--by that I mean once you are alive you grow along that \ncontinuum until you die--and the initial one-celled embryo, it is clear \nthat the one-celled embryo is an inviolable human person.\n  If you allow it to survive and to grow, it becomes a full-scale human \nbeing under anybody's definition. As some have attempted to discount \nthis clear understanding of the biological continuity of the human \nperson in order to justify some human experimentation in some \ncircumstances, I note that the people who support this are supporting \nit for reasons that are very good, true, altruistic, to try to find \ncures for others' debilitating, terrible diseases, for which I want to \nfind a cure. But I don't want to find that cure at the cost of somebody \nelse's life. I don't want to find that cure at the cost of my life or \nSenator Specter's life or Senator Reid's life or at the cost of anybody \nelse--or young people yet to come and to be born. That is why I believe \nwe should start with some basic definitions.\n\n  Human cloning is human asexual reproduction. It is accomplished by \nintroducing nuclear material from one or more human somatic cells into \na fertilized or unfertilized oocyte whose nuclear material has been \nremoved or inactivated so as to produce a human living being--at any \nstage of development--that is genetically virtually identical to an \nexisting or previously existing human being--the human being from whom \nthe nuclear material was taken.\n  In essence, if we take nuclear material from the Presiding Officer or \nfrom myself and put it inside an egg and start the egg growing, there \nis a human of identical genetic material to me, to the Presiding \nOfficer, and to anybody else in this room.\n  Roughly, the debate over human cloning has fallen into two \ncategories, misleading as those categories may be: reproductive cloning \nand so-called research or therapeutic cloning.\n  Two-thirds of the American public, the President of the United \nStates, a large majority of the House of Representatives, Senator \nLandrieu, and myself hold the position that all human cloning should be \nbanned. It is a position based in large part on the principle that you \nshould not create human life as a means of something else, especially \npurposely to destroy it, the point being--and the President put it very \nwell--we should not be creating life just to destroy it or do research \non it.\n  Some in the Senate don't want a full ban. They want a limited ban--\nwhat they refer to as ``preproductive cloning,'' but not on so-called \nresearch or therapeutic cloning.\n  All cloning is, of course, reproductive; that is, all human cloning \nproduces new human life. That is the very nature of it. If you produce \na human clone, it is a young human something. It is a human person; it \nis a human life. If you allow it to grow, it is not going to grow into \nan elephant or a tomato. It is going to grow into a human, if you allow \nit to grow.\n  I think the notion that human cloning can be therapeutic is both \nmisleading and disingenuous. ``Therapeutic'' cloning, as some \nproponents of cloning refer to it, is really the process by which an \nembryo is specially created for the directly intended purpose of \nsubsequently killing it for its parts. Some proponents of human cloning \nclaim an embryo created in this manner will have cells for a genetic \nmatch to the patient being cloned and thus would not be subjected to \nthe patient's immune system. I will address this issue of \ntransplantation rejection later. Let me say that this particular claim \nis not scientifically true.\n  To describe the process of destructive human cloning as \n``therapeutic'' when the intent is to create a new human life destined \nto its virtual destruction is misleading. However, one would like to \ndescribe the process of destructive cloning, it is certainly not \ntherapeutic for the clone that has been created and them disemboweled \nfor the purported benefit of its twin.\n\n  All human cloning is reproductive, regardless of the intention of the \nresearchers and the technicians who have created that life or copied \nit.\n  I do not believe we should create human life to be used by others \nand, in the process, destroy it. Yet that is exactly what is being \nproposed by those who support cloning in limited circumstances. And \nhowever they might name the procedure--whether they call it nuclear \ntransplantation, therapeutic cloning, therapeutic cellular transfer, \nDNA regenerative therapy, or some other euphemism--it is simply \ndestruction.\n  The cloning of a human embryo is wrong in all circumstances, whatever \nit is called. Human cloning is wrong. Yet proponents of so-called \ntherapeutic cloning claim that with the use of this controversial \ntechnique we will be able to cure a whole host of dread diseases that \nplague humanity--diseases that I want to cure, diseases that I helped \ndouble the funding for at the National Institutes. I am cochairman of \nthe cancer caucus in the Senate. I want to see these cured. Cancer runs \nin my family. I want to see these things cured, but not at the cost of \nother people's lives.\n  I wish to take a minute to explain why some of the claims of those \nwho support cloning are overhyped.\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\n  First, the argument that so-called therapeutic cloning will solve the \nimmuno-response rejection problem is questionable.\n  Second, the reliance on this type of cloning as a treatment for those \nwho are suffering will ultimately only be realized by heavily relying \non the exploitation of women.\n  We should also not forget that this practice would be available only \nto the rich.\n  First, the myth of therapeutic cloning: It is becoming increasingly \nobvious that the so-called therapeutic purposes lack the evidence to \nback up their claims for the purpose of their technique of supposedly a \n``regenerative'' type of medicine.\n  The promise that some have held out that the use of cloning \ntechnologies produce rejection-proof cells is starting to crumble under \ncloser scrutiny.\n  This is the argument. If we just clone a person, they will have cells \nthat are genetic matches and you will be able to put those back into \nyour body and the body itself will not reject them because it is saying \nthese are my cells. It would get around this immune-repressive problem \nwe have with heart transfers or other organs or tissue transfers that \nhave immuno-repressive problems. The problem is that under closer \nscrutiny, cloning does not work that well.\n  We know that cells derived from clonal embryos created for the \npurpose of stem cell transplantation contain mitochondrial DNA--that \nDNA passed through the maternal contribution to the zygote.\n  In other words, this is from outside the genetic material. To say the \nPresiding Officer provided it encased in mitochondrial material that is \nfrom a different person, it is a different person. Therefore, it is not \ngenetically identical to the donor/recipient. This nonidentity can \ntrigger an immune-response rejection.\n  If you take an outside egg, take your genetic material, put it in \nthis egg and grow the cells up to a certain age, and kill this embryo \nfor those cells, then you put it back in you, the problem is the egg \nisn't your matching genetic material. Some of that carries over to the \ncharacteristic of this genetic material of test cells that you are \nputting into your body. It still triggers the immune-response problem. \nThat is one problem.\n  Further, there is not one animal model that shows this is not the \ncase. In other words, we don't have an animal model that says if you \njust clone a person you can inject it right back into the person. We \ndon't have a single animal model that says we get around this problem--\nnone. Yet we are going to move forward on this theory that this works \nwhen we don't even have a single model that that works?\n\n  In fact, Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, one of the leading vocal proponents of \ncloning admits that his study into the therapeutic value of cloning in \nanimal models ``raise[s] the provocative possibility that even \ngenetically matched cells derived by therapeutic cloning may still face \nbarriers to effective transplantation.''\n  This is one of the leading advocates who is saying, early on, we \ndon't get around immuno-suppressant problems, one of the leading claims \nof the cloning advocates.\n  In addition, it is now known that there are problems with gene \nexpression and gene imprinting that can cause cell deterioration as \nwell as other abnormalities in the clonal embryos.\n  Also, there are practical considerations, considerations that have \nled many of the advocates of cloning to concede the impracticality of \nefforts to custom make stem cells. That is what cloning is really \nabout: Custom making stem cells for me, the Senator from Nevada, the \nSenator from Washington, and others. It is saying: OK, we are going to \nmake some cells just for me. These are going to be custom made to fit \nwhat I need.\n  In an article by Peter Aldhous, entitled ``Can They Rebuild Us?'', \npublished in Nature Magazine, the author notes that:\n\n       [I]t may come as a surprise that many experts do not now \n     expect therapeutic cloning to have a large clinical impact--\n     many researchers have come to doubt whether therapeutic \n     cloning will ever be efficient enough to be commercially \n     viable. It would be astronomically expensive, says James \n     Thomson of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who led \n     the team that first isolated E[mbryonic] S[tem] cells from \n     human blastocysts.\n\n  For the advantage of my colleagues, I yield the floor so that \ncolleagues can take advantage of some of their time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3844\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \namendment of the Senator from Kansas.\n  We deal with issues around this body often. We deal with issues that, \nfrankly, sometimes don't seem very important. But this issue is an \nissue of critical importance. This issue is really what the human \nspecies is all about.\n  I am a veterinarian by profession. I have studied embryology, as all \nveterinary students do, as all medical students do. We study it in \ndetail. As a matter of fact, we study it in species after species.\n  I have studied the cloning of the famous Dolly clone that we are all \nfamiliar with, Dolly the sheep. When that first happened, there was \nsomething very disturbing that went off in my brain. It was not because \nof the cloning of an animal, it was because cloning put people in the \nfuture.\n  When Dolly was first announced, everybody said: No, we cannot clone \npeople. We will never go there.\n  Last year, during the whole issue dealing with embryos that people \nwere talking about, they were saying: No. You know what. We will not \nhave cloning. We will ban cloning.\n  Everybody agreed, at that time, it seemed, that we were going to ban \ncloning. But now, as some of the research has gone forward, people are \nstarting to say: You know what. Now we are just going to do therapeutic \ncloning. We are not going to do reproductive cloning.\n  Well, as the Senator from Kansas has pointed out, we are not dealing \nwith just therapeutic cloning. It is all reproductive cloning. Dolly \nwas produced by the same technology that therapeutic cloning will be \nproduced from. It is the same, exact technology. It is cloning.\n  You can call it by any name you want to call it, but it is cloning.\n  I know there are other Senators who want to talk tonight, so I will \nnot talk too much more on this.\n  But, Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3844 to amendment No. 3843.\n\n       Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \n     reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the patentability of human organisms, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     UNPATENTABILITY OF HUMAN ORGANISMS.\n\n       Section 101 of title 35, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``Whoever''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Unpatentability of Human Organisms.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `human \n     cloning' means human asexual reproduction, accomplished by \n     introducing nuclear material from one or more human somatic \n     cells into a fertilized or unfertilized oocyte whose nuclear \n     material has been removed or inactivated so as to produce a \n     living organism (at any stage of development) that is \n     genetically virtually identical to an existing or previously \n     existing human organism.\n       ``(2) Unpatentability.--A patent may not be obtained for--\n       ``(A) an organism of the human species at any stage of \n     development produced by any method, whether in vitro or in \n     vivo, including the zygote, embryo, fetus, child or adult;\n       ``(B) a living organism made by human cloning; or\n       ``(C) a process of human cloning.''.\n       ``(3) Effective date.--This section shall become effective \n     30 days after the date of enactment.''\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, the issue of human patenting in this \nwhole issue of cloning. And the whole cloning debate is really an \negregious one because the idea of being able to patent a human being or \nthe making of a human being is probably one of the most egregious parts \nof this whole issue.\n  This really is a time when we are confronting a brave new world. The \nprospect of people in corporate America owning people and trading and \nbuying and selling people as if they were\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\nproperty is something that should give us all a chill.\n  So, Madam President, I think all of us should support the Senator's \namendment, and the second-degree amendment as well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3843\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I want to proceed to the discussion \nof this issue on the overall patenting because that is the narrow issue \non which we are focused and it ties in, very closely, with this issue \nof cloning.\n  I was mentioning the Nature Magazine article about whether this will \nwork because the issue of patents will be that people are seeking to \ncreate these humans, and then own them through the patenting process; \nthat people will research and invest commercially in them. It should \nreally send a chill through all of us.\n  I think the question one should be asking, even ahead of that, is: \nWill this even work? If we are going to allow this to take place, one \nmight advocate, well, OK, this is going to work and create all these \ncures for diseases; therefore, maybe we ought to risk this to humanity.\n  I say, even on the science of this, the very basic science of this, \nthe science says this isn't going to work either, so that we would be \nsubjecting humanity to the notion that you can patent people, when it \ndoes not even work. And it is not going to proceed.\n  Here is the quote I was talking about by Peter Aldhous, entitled \n``Can They Rebuild Us?'' in Nature Magazine, dated April 5, 2001:\n\n       It may come as a surprise that many experts do not now \n     expect therapeutic cloning to have a large clinical impact--\n     many researchers have come to doubt whether therapeutic \n     cloning will ever be efficient enough to be commercially \n     viable. It would be astronomically expensive, says James \n     Thomson of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who led \n     the team that first isolated E[mbryonic] S[tem] cells from \n     human blastocysts.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       [M]ammalian cloning is inefficient, even in the hands of \n     the most skilled scientists. Of the 277 cells from Dolly's \n     mother that were fused with donor egg cells--\n\n  This is 277 eggs. And then because you had to make 277 of these, 277 \neggs--\n\n     less than 30 developed to the blastocyst stage.\n\n  That is the early stages of development.\n\n       At the time experts believed efficiency would improve. But \n     despite feverish efforts by groups worldwide, progress has \n     been disappointing. We don't at the moment have any real \n     handle on how to greatly increase the efficiency, admits Alan \n     Coleman of PPL Therapeutics near Edinburgh, the company \n     involved in the Dolly experiments.\n\n  So 277 eggs, to get to 30 developed to the blastocyst stage, to \neventually get to one Dolly. So 277 to one, that is how many eggs we \nare going to have to have from women to be able to start these, to be \nable to get some sort of development moving along. You are talking \nabout a very inefficient process, and one where you have to have a lot \nof women superovulating, collecting these eggs so we can get more of \nthese clones going. At what price to women? At what price to humanity?\n  Also, in a recent LA Times interview--this is from May 10, 2002, \nabout a month ago--Thomas Okarma of Geron Corporation said that cloning \nfor customized stem cell treatments would take, ``thousands of [human] \neggs on an assembly line'' to produce a custom therapy for a single \nperson. He says, ``This proceeds as a non-starter commercially.'' The \nodds favoring success ``are vanishingly small.'' He said this. He is \none of the lead researchers from Geron Corporation. The possibilities \nof success ``are vanishingly small.'' Yet we want to take this step for \nhumanity on the science where the science says the opportunities, the \npossibilities ``are vanishingly small''? We want to go ahead and step \nforward and say: Yes, we should do research, we should patent people on \nan opportunity that is ``vanishingly small''?\n  That is not a wise step to take on the science of it, let alone how \nyou view the human person, whether or not you should allow patenting of \npeople on the science of it. It argues we should not.\n  This leads me to my second point which is, in order to be effective, \ntherapeutic cloning must rely on the exploitation of women and the \npractice will be available only to the rich. This practice will have to \nrely upon the exploitation of women and will be available only to the \nrich. Aside from being highly impractical, the claim that therapeutic \ncloning will lead to cures is one that can ultimately only be realized \nwith the blatant exploitation of women.\n  In order to conduct so-called therapeutic or research cloning on a \nscale that would yield just a portion of the benefits cloning advocates \npromise, one would need to harvest a vast number of human eggs. The \nonly place you get those is from women.\n  As noted by Dr. David Prentice, a stem cell researcher at the \nUniversity of Indiana:\n\n       More than 100 million people in the United States suffer \n     from medical conditions for which embryonic stem cell \n     therapies are being promoted as promising--Parkinson's \n     disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, \n     juvenile diabetes, ALS, and more. If 20 percent of cloning \n     attempts succeeded in reaching the blastocyst stage of \n     development--the success rate in animal cloning--and stem \n     cells are derived from 10 percent of these clon[al] embryos--\n     a rate consistent with such success rates in deriving \n     embryonic stem cell lines from non-cloned embryos--how many \n     eggs will we need?\n\n  Based on these assumptions, just his assumptions, saying OK, let's \ntake our animal models on cloning, that we are going to say we can be \njust as successful with human cloning as we can in our animal models, \nand we will try to derive stem cells for just 10 percent of the people \nwho suffer from one of these diseases, based on these assumptions it \nwould take 800 million human eggs to treat just 16 percent of the \nAmericans who suffer from conditions for which these therapies \ninvolving embryonic stem cells have been promised, to be able to \naddress the treatments needed for just 16 percent of Americans \nsuffering.\n  I am just saying, only the rich can afford this. It is going to be \nvery expensive. Let's just say the top 16 percent of those who suffer \ncan afford to do this. We will be able to treat those. With current \nknowledge and our ability, and even including a factor of favorability, \nsaying we will be able to get this done efficiently from being a human \negg to being a clone, because you to have make that transition, you \nwill need 800 million eggs from women. Where are you going to get \nthose? If 10 eggs are harvested per woman, then 80 million women of \nchild-bearing age would have to submit to the risk of drugs and \nhyperovulation and surgical extraction procedures, providing the eggs \nthat would be needed to develop therapies for just a fraction, 16 \npercent of those who are suffering from these conditions.\n  The egg dearth is a mathematical certainty and is one reason \nresearchers say therapeutic cloning will not be generally available for \nmedical treatment.\n  For example, a year ago biotech researchers Jon Odorico, Dan Kaufman, \nand James Thompson admitted the following in the research journal Stem \nCells. They said: The poor availability of human eggs, the low \nefficiency of the nuclear cell procedure, and the long population-\ndoubling time of human embryonic stem cells make it difficult to \nenvision this, therapeutic cloning to obtain stem cells, becoming a \nroutine clinical procedure, even if ethical considerations were not a \nsignificant point of contention.\n\n  James Thompson is the person who developed the embryonic stem cell, \nfirst found those in humans. He is saying that even if you didn't have \nethical considerations, you will not be able to do this on a regular \nbasis. That is aside from the overall issue. That is just the science \nof it. That is not questioning whether a human person should be \npatented or not. That is the question of whether you could do it, \nwhether you have sound science based upon being able to do it.\n  Concerns such as these as well as others have led a group of \nprogressive scientists, virtually all of whom support abortion rights, \nto state in their letter of support for a ban on all human cloning \nthat:\n\n       Although we may differ in our views regarding reproductive \n     issues, we agree that a human embryo should not be cloned for \n     the specific intention of using it as a resource for medical \n     experimentation or for producing a baby. Moreover, we believe \n     that the market for women's eggs that would be created by \n     this research will provide unethical incentives for women to \n     undergo health-\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\n     threatening hormone treatment and surgery. We are also \n     concerned about the increased bio-industrialization of life \n     by the scientific community and life science companies, and \n     shocked and dismayed that clonal human embryos have been \n     patented and declared to be human ``inventions.''\n\n  This is a very real concern. As I am sure many of you are aware, the \ntypical in vitro fertilization procedure involves a collection of eggs \nfrom women who seek to become pregnant in this manner. The \nsuperovulatory drugs typically used in this procedure will result in \nanywhere from 10 to 40 eggs. The use of superovulatory drugs has \nalready been linked to ovarian cancer and other health risks. Some \npeople choose to go ahead with that risk because of other concerns and \ndesires they have.\n  The market for women's eggs is not just a fiction. In fact, the \nmarket for women's eggs has already developed. For example, the company \nAdvanced Cell Technology of Massachusetts paid women up to $4,000 per \negg donation. This is the group that claimed already to have cloned \nhuman beings in the United States. They paid women up to $4,000 per egg \ndonation. There is another issue we should consider: Whether or not we \nare going to allow companies to pay for women's eggs, to create this \nmarketplace, to allow this marketplace to take place.\n  Such a market for women's eggs will be a true threat to the health of \nmany women. Women undergoing the health risks associated with egg \ndonation for the purpose of having children is certainly one thing in \nthat they choose and the life comes forward. That they would be induced \nby some to undergo these health risks for money is another issue.\n  It is striking, as I watch this debate unfold, that corporate \ninterests in the biotech community want us to countenance the idea that \nsociety will be able to solve the health care problems of the world on \nthe backs of poor women. Asking us to do so is an assault not only on \nthe dignity of the human embryo created and destroyed in this process \nbut also on the dignity of the woman who sells her body parts to \naccomplish it.\n  The commodification of women and their eggs is a very real concern \nthat we all share and is yet another reason on a long list for why we \nmust outlaw all human cloning and why we must do so now.\n  That is not the issue in front of us today. The issue today is \nwhether we should allow patenting of human embryos, patenting of \npeople. There are alternatives, however, that do not use controversial \nand unproven techniques to improve health. Many of you who follow this \nissue already know the advances being made, and the adult nonembryonic \nstem cell research continues to show great promise. Not only are we \nbeginning to treat the myriad diseases which plague humanity, but we \nare continuing to find we can do so without the use of controversial \ntechniques or research which relies on the death of another human \nbeing.\n\n  As to the adult stem cell area, I want to spend some time on this \nbecause I want to solve these diseases as well. I think we have an \navenue that is being proven in science today that we should pursue \naggressively, fund aggressively, fund at the Federal level, and get \nthese cures to the people.\n  In fact, to date there is no clinical application of embryonic stem \ncells in people, much less those derived from cloned embryos, that are \nused with humans, whereas there are many diseases already being treated \nin humans with adult nonembryonic stem cells. We already have human \nclinical trials with adult stem cells.\n  I would like to list just a few of these recent advances. I am \ncomparing clones, cloned embryonic stem cells, no human trials or \napplications. It is fully legal today to clone humans in the United \nStates, fully legal. It has been going on; companies are claiming to \nhave done it. There are no human applications, none. Adult stem cells \nare these repair cells in each of our bodies--Senator Specter's body, \nmy body, right now. We have them in all parts of our body, these repair \ncells that go to a particular area and help it build back up and build \nmore cells where they are needed. It is the maintenance crew in the \nbody. These adult stem cells go places and help where there are needs.\n  What we are finding is that we can pull those out, grow them outside \nthe body, put them back in with amazing results in cures in some of \nthese terrible, debilitating areas.\n  There was one reported in the paper just today about liver stem cells \nbeing converted into pancreatic stem cells that were insulin secreting \nto be able to cure diabetes. That was just reported in the paper today.\n  Adult bone marrow stem cells: These are in us now, grow extensively, \ntransformed into functional liver cells.\n  Dr. Catherine Verfaillie's group in Minnesota continues to show more \nand more uses for the multi-potent adult progenitor cells from bone \nmarrow. These are adult bone marrow stem cells. The team has now shown \nthat these can transform into functional liver cells. The adult stem \ncells also were grown in culture for over 100 generations of the cells, \ntwice the length of time previously thought possible with adult cells.\n  This was in a recent journal, May 2002--adult liver stem cells from \npancreatic cells.\n  Researchers at the University of Florida have transformed highly \npurified adult liver stem cells into pancreatic stem cells. Now they \nare taking liver stem cells and making them into pancreatic cells. The \ncells self-assemble in a culture and form three-dimensional islet \nstructures--that is where you get the secretion of insulin--express \npancreatic genes, produce pancreatic hormones and, best of all, secrete \ninsulin--to be able to cure diabetes. When you implant it into diabetic \nmice, the transformed cells reverse their hyperglycemia in 10 days.\n  Ammon Peck, one of the team leaders, said:\n\n       Adult stem cells appear to offer great promise for the \n     production of an almost unlimited supply of insulin-producing \n     cells and islets of Langerhans . . .\n\n  A particular type of cell that produces insulin.\n\n       The ability to grow insulin-producing cells from liver stem \n     cells shows the remarkable potential of adult stem cells into \n     for future cell therapy.\n\n  This was in a June 4, 2002, online edition of Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  Adult stem cells successfully treat Parkinson's. Think about that--\nsuccessful treatment for Parkinson's. Has the Chair even heard of this? \nOn April 8, Dr. Mike Levesque at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los \nAngeles reported a total reversal of symptoms in the first patient \ntreated, a 57-year-old former fighter pilot. The patient is still \nwithout symptoms 3 years after adult neural stem cells were removed \nfrom his brain, coaxed into becoming dopamine-producing cells, and then \nreimplanted. So here they took this 57-year-old former fighter pilot, \ntook these adult neural stem cells, nerve stem cells, removed them from \nhis brain, coaxed them into becoming dopamine-producing cells, and \nreimplanted them. This was in a human trial, not animal.\n  ``I think transplantation of the patient's own neural stem cells and \ndifferentiated dopaminergic neurons is more biologically and \nphysiologically compatible--more efficacious and more elegant,'' said \nLevesque. The results show that adult stem cells from a patient's own \nbrain can aid in treatment of Parkinson's. This was all accomplished \nwithout the requirement for immuno-suppression since the patient's own \nadult stem cells were used. Again, it is your own stem cells. There is \nno immuno-suppression problem since the patient's own adult stem cells \nwere used. In addition to its use for Parkinson's, the technique is \nunder study for juvenile diabetes, stroke, brain tumors, spinal cord \ninjury, and other conditions. The results were presented at the meeting \nof the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.\n  Think about that. Three years after these were taken, were coaxed \ninto becoming dopamine-producing cells and were reimplanted, they are \nshowing a total reversal of symptoms in the patient. Incredible.\n  Adult stem cells can form potentially all tissues. Injection of a \nsingle adult bone marrow stem cell can reform the entire bone marrow of \na mouse, forming functional marrow and blood cells and saving the life \nof the mouse. The transplanted bone marrow also could form functional \ncells of liver, lung, gastrointestinal tract--esophagus, stomach, \nintestine, colon--and skin, as well as other cells in heart and \nskeletal\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\nmuscle. The experiments also provided evidence that adult stem cells \n``home in'' to sites of tissue damage. This was from Dr. D.S. Krause on \nMay 4, 2001, in the publication ``Cell.''\n  Fifth, adult stem cells repair heart damage. I am talking, again, \nabout human clinical trials. Heart damage. Listen to this:\n\n       Researchers at NIH and the New York Medical College-\n     Valhalla used mice to show that injecting adult bone marrow \n     stem cells into damaged hearts could rebuild heart tissue and \n     help restore heart function. Newly formed heart tissue \n     occupied over two-thirds of the damaged portion of the heart \n     9 days after the transplant. In other experiments, \n     significant repair of heart damage was achieved by simply \n     stimulating the production and release of stem cells from \n     bone marrow, with the cells migrating to the heart and \n     repairing damage. The studies indicate that adult stem cells \n     can generate new heart tissue, decreasing the damage of \n     coronary artery disease.\n\n  That was in a magazine called Nature on April 5, 2001. This was a \nmouse trial, not human.\n  The notion that we have to kill one person in order to find cures for \nothers is a false trade-off that has been presented to the American \npublic in what seems to be a total disregard of the advances made in \nthe promising fields of alternative nonembryonic sources of stem cells. \nIf we want to talk about regenerative medicine, this is where we should \nfocus; this is the area of regenerative medicine. We are doing it today \nin human clinical trials.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I may complete this point, then I will yield for a \nquestion. Why would we contemplate going to the point of creating a \nhuman life and patenting this human life in an area where we are \nshowing no results taking place, and it has all these ethical \nquestions, and you have one generation of humanity saying, okay, we \nthink there are some possibilities here to research in this cloning \narea? Therefore, we are going to allow the creation of human clones, \nwhich we allow freely in the United States to take place today; it is \ngoing on right now. We are going to allow them to be patented so that \nyou can own this creation of a human being. We don't have to go there. \nI would say, at a minimum, we ought to contemplate at least pausing on \nthis until we see how all of this would grow and develop before we \ncontemplate creating humans just to research them. We have a better \nalternative that is working today.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Senator from Kansas, in his \nintroductory comments, announced what his amendment was not about, and \nthen he proceeded to talk extensively about nuclear transplantation, \notherwise referred to as therapeutic cloning, and about embryonic stem \ncells, and about adult stem cells.\n  But coming back to the core issue on what the Senator from Kansas is \noffering on nonpatentability, my question is whether the Senator from \nKansas is aware of a release by the Patent Office on April 1, 1998, \nwhich reads, in pertinent part:\n\n       The Patent and Trademark Office is required by law to keep \n     all patent applications in confidence until such time as a \n     patent may be granted. However, the existence of a patent \n     application directed to human/non-human chimera has recently \n     been discussed in the news media. It is the position of the \n     PTO that inventions directed to human/non-human chimera \n     could, under certain circumstances, not be patentable \n     because, among other things, they would fail to meet the \n     public policy and morality aspects of the utility \n     requirement.\n\n  Now, this position by the Patent Office obviously, on its face, \nrenders totally unnecessary the amendment that is being offered. My \nquestion to the Senator from Kansas is, Was he aware of this position \ntaken by the Patent Office?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I am very familiar with that. The Patent Office \nhas continued to articulate that position. That is why I stated that \nthere is a question on this, because the Patent Office is stating that \nissue based upon the 13th amendment of the Constitution, which is \nagainst slavery. But they are being challenged by attorneys, and they \nhave been challenged in the court often about whether they can deny a \npatent.\n  What I am providing by this amendment is clarity by the legislative \nbody acting and saying that we will not allow the patentability of this \nissue. I ask my colleague if he agrees with that and maybe with my \namendment and would agree to support this amendment. It is just a \nclarification of what the Patent Office has currently stated.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be glad to expound, Madam President. The \namendment which the Senator from Kansas has offered was offered without \nany notice to this Senator, which came as a surprise, since the Senator \nfrom Kansas and I have been debating this subject very broadly for the \npast year or two.\n  Having seen this amendment for the first time this evening, I was \nsurprised that when I walked out for a telephone call, that opportunity \nwas used by the Senator from Nevada to offer a second-degree amendment \nto foreclose this Senator from offering a second-degree amendment, \nalthough that may still be possible under certain procedural \napproaches.\n  The arguments which I have heard the Senator from Kansas offer \ntonight, almost his entire presentation has not been about the patent \nissue but has been about therapeutic cloning, and embryonic stem cells. \nThe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services had \nsome 14 hearings on the issues relating to stem cells and nuclear \ntransplantation. There has been no hearing at all on this subject.\n  Again, it is a little surprising to find it come up on a very \nimportant bill regarding Federal guarantees on insurance. The \ncommercial world has been waiting for action on this bill and, to find \nthis amendment here, again I say, is surprising.\n  The core question which is raised by the Senator from Kansas has been \nanswered by the Patent Office. I took from his comment that he had \nmentioned that I did not hear him refer to that at all, but I think his \namendment is totally unnecessary in light of what the Patent Office has \nhad to say.\n  If the Senator from Kansas wanted to have hearings on his amendment \nin the regular course of business, he is a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee--the Senator from Kansas is a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, as is this Senator--that would be an appropriate place to \nhear it.\n  When the Senator from Kansas talks about the future of humanity, I \nagree with him about that. Nuclear transplantation offers an \nopportunity to save lives, to find a cure for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \nand heart disease, so that we really are on the threshold of some \nremarkable scientific achievements.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, if I may reclaim my time, if we are \ngoing to go into the speech of the Senator from Pennsylvania, I would \nlike to answer his comments and finish up my comments, unless he has \nanother question to ask. Again, I would like to go ahead and finish my \nstatement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I had not finished answering the question of the Senator \nfrom Kansas. I have been sitting here patiently listening to him at \nsome length and again express a little surprise at having the Senator \nfrom Nevada take the floor when I step out for a minute and then ask \nunanimous consent not to have the amendment read, which is customary, \nbut then the Senator always explains it.\n  While I was up at the desk getting a copy of the amendment, the \nSenator from Kansas took the floor again. I do not think there has been \nany shortage of time for the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I do have the floor, I say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I am willing to yield for a question on this issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Senator from Kansas has asked me a \nquestion, and I am in the process of responding to the question.\n  The last comment I will make and will give the floor back--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas does have the floor \nand can reclaim the floor when he wishes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to have the Senator from Pennsylvania \nrespond, but if it is his speech, I would like to finish up my comments \nand then yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The last part of my response, Madam President, would be \nto take strenuous issue with the statement by the Senator from Kansas \nthat those who have talked about therapeutic cloning, really nuclear \ntransplantation, are misleading and disingenuous. There has never been \nany\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nchallenge by this Senator to the Senator from Kansas about his being \nmisleading or disingenuous.\n\n  As strenuously as I may disagree with what he has had to say, there \nhas never been any challenge to his being forthright and his integrity \non the point which is strongly suggested by the characterization of \n``misleading and disingenuous.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, reclaiming the floor, I would like to \nput forward a couple of issues in response to the Senator from \nPennsylvania. No. 1, this issue on the patenting of humans has been out \nthere about a month now since a group discovered several applications \nof patents for the patenting of a process to create a human embryo. It \nhas been out there, and a number of us stated we wanted to ban this \nprocedure of patenting.\n  No. 2, as we were going forward in this negotiation process to get \nthe competing cloning bills forward, we were required to exchange a \nbill, and in our base bill was the issue of banning the patenting of \npeople. That was exchanged this week. It has been out in the hands of \nSenator Specter's staff or others during this week. We have had this \nissue of patenting banned. Whether the Senator knew about it or not, it \nwas in the base bill we put forward.\n  On the issue of questioning his integrity, I did not, and I do not \nhere. I stated earlier in my comments that those who are putting this \nforward do so, when they put forward the issue of cloning people, under \nlaudable purposes: to cure debilitating diseases, the same diseases \nthat I seek to cure. What I call disingenuous is the term ``therapeutic \ncloning.'' It is certainly not therapeutic to the clone, and as I have \nbeen going through the science, it is not going to work for the people \nwho are trying to do it. If it did work for the people who were trying \nto do this, they are going to have to harvest a lot of eggs from women. \nIt is not going to be therapeutic to the women from whom the eggs are \nharvested, and as far as I know, it is not going to be therapeutic to \nthe clone, and, I might also add, it is not therapeutic to mankind to \ndo this, to start at some point in the life chain, in the life cycle, \ncreating life as livestock and be able to do research on them.\n  Moving forward with this, and the reason this patent is a central \nissue, as I noted at the very outset, the whole issue in front of the \nPatent Office--they are claiming one way and others are claiming \nanother--is the status of the clone. Is the clone a person, thus \nsubject to protections under the 13th amendment against slavery or is \nit property, is it livestock to be owned and dealt with as its master \nchooses? That is the central question that is involved at the Patent \nOffice.\n  That is what I was saying at the outset of the speech, and that is \nwhy the issue is in front of us, because we need to resolve the issue: \nIs this a person protected under the 13th amendment against slavery? Is \nit livestock; go ahead and patent it, a new type of livestock.\n  I am saying that what we should do is move forward with clarity for \nthe Patent Office. They are claiming this is a person. It is subject to \nprotection under the 13th amendment against slavery, and I am saying we \nshould clarify that.\n  I hope many of the Senators in this body will join me and say: Yes, \nthat is right, we should clarify that. Even if it is a questionable \nissue, we should weigh on the side of, yes, this is probably life and \nwe should not enslave it to a patent. I hope most of the Members of \nthis body will agree and say: Yes, we are going to deny these patents. \nThese are not going to be allowed to go forward.\n  The notion that we have to kill one person in order to find cures for \nothers is a false tradeoff. It has been presented to the American \npublic in what seems to be disregard for the advances being made in \nthis promising field of alternative nonembryonic stem cells. This is \ntrue regenerative medicine.\n  As our national bioethics debate progresses, we must continue to \nclosely monitor the advances being made in the field of adult stem cell \nresearch, and we need to fund it and fund it aggressively.\n  It is important to remember that we do not have unlimited resources \nin our battle to prolong and improve the quality of life. Throwing \nmoney at unproven, controversial, and novel treatment regimes is \nfoolhardly. It is better to invest where progress is being shown and \nprogress charted.\n  I wish to address a final point, and that is on the issue of people \nsaying this is about your view of religion, your view of science. The \npoint I wish to make is some have charged religion is attempting to, \nonce again, block important scientific discoveries. This is not true.\n  What I have argued in the past, and I will argue today, as well as \nwhat I will continue to argue in the future, is based directly on \nbiological data, statements by those in the field of biology, the data \nof common observations, an objective, logical, reflective thinking \nabout the data available. I have not once mentioned an argument based \nupon religion.\n  Certainly many traditional religions, dependent on their respective \npositions, coincide with many of the points that have been made in the \npast. The Christian tradition, in particular the Catholic and much of \nthe Evangelical, says everything relevant to this debate depends on the \nhumanly accessible data and the logical conclusions that can be drawn \nfrom it, not on theology. Authentic religion hands this over to \nauthentic science.\n  The difference of view, in my judgment, depends on knowing the \nbiological and human truth or not knowing it. It is not about a \ndifference of religious view or the difference between religion and \nscience. Every argument I have put forward has been based upon science, \nbiology, and reason. To me, the present debate is about good or bad \nscience and good or bad reasoning. Many, however, seem to be wanting to \nmake this a debate about religion when it is not.\n  What makes this argument so strange is that I cannot think of one \nSenator who does not believe in God. Indeed, we have printed above the \nmain door when we come in, ``In God We Trust.''\n  The question for my colleagues to ponder may be put the other way: \nDoes God trust us? Does he love us? And if so, when did his love start \nfor us? I would suggest it starts very early.\n  In closing, I think it is important that as we continue to engage \nthis national dialogue, we strive to do so in a way that shows the \nprofound mystery and inviolable worth of every human being from the \nmoment of conception until natural death. It is a debate well worth \nhaving, and as a brave new world draws ever near, it becomes clearer \nthat our own humanity in fact may depend upon it.\n  As a final thought, I think it is unlikely that Senators today will \nultimately be remembered by history for their votes on tax bills or \neven on bills that are pending right now--budget, trade--all of which \nwill be important. They are important, but I think when we look back 50 \nyears to this period of time, that may not be what history remembers.\n  There is something truly unique about the debate on this issue, on \nwhether you treat a person as patentable or not. The action we take \ntoday, tomorrow, and next week on this issue will have far-reaching \nimplications and will be of great historical consequence. It is what \nhistory will ultimately remember us for during this time. I think that \nis why we clearly have to address this issue. That is why we have \nnarrowly addressed the point that is in front of us.\n  I hope that in the end we get unanimous consent in this body that we \nshould not allow patenting of human life in any stage of its \ndevelopment, whether it is asexual reproduction or human reproduction.\n  Today, yes, indeed, we in the Senate open a debate on the future of \nhumanity and whether we shall use human life for research purposes. Let \nus pause and do something most of us agree on and not allow human life, \nwhether created by a clone, in a clone, by a biotechnician or in the \nwomb, to be patented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have a lot of respect for the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas. He is a good man. He is very \nsincere, and he believes in what he is doing. He fights for what he \nbelieves in. I have a lot of\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nrespect for him, and I have a lot of respect for his attitude.\n  Up until this point, the debate on cloning has been considered in an \norderly and responsible fashion. I am greatly concerned that in filing \nthis particular amendment, our opponents in this debate are resorting \nto tactics that will not result in the careful consideration that this \nimportant issue merits. We all know that the great issue in this debate \nis whether an unfertilized blastocyst, or an unfertilized egg that is \nused in the somatic cell nuclear transfer process and becomes a \nblastocyst in 5 or 6 days, is a person? We will have that debate in \nthis body, I presume. I think it would be a worthwhile debate.\n  The amendment being offered tonight is something of a red herring. \nTrue, there are issues that should be examined in addition with patents \nwhich may be issued on living cells. In fact, Chairman Leahy and I are \npursuing that matter in the Judiciary Committee with the Patent and \nTrademark Office and other interested parties. We are trying to learn \nmore about patent No. 6,211,429, issued to University of Missouri \nresearcher, Dr. Randall Prather. We are trying to learn if the issuance \nof this patent is consistent with the 1987 PTO policy statement with \nrespect to the non-patentability of human beings.\n  However, let's be fair, the crux of the issue in this debate has \nlittle to do with patents. It has to do with whether or not we will \nallow important research to proceed, research that holds the promise of \nimproving upwards of 100 million-plus lives in our society in America \nalone. That does not even mention the millions of others throughout the \nworld who might benefit from what I refer to as regenerative medicine.\n  This body can look at issues around the margin--and trust me, there \nare literally hundreds of them that we could consider--and patenting is \ncertainly a concern but it does not go to the heart of the issue.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office, the PTO, has already made abundantly \nclear in its 1987 policy statement that human beings are not \npatentable, as the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has aptly \npointed out. This policy states, in part, ``A claim directed to or \nincluding within its scope a human being will not be considered to be \npatentable subject matter.''\n  It seems to me that it might prove beneficial for PTO to reexamine \nthe claims of the University of Missouri patent in light of prior art.\n  In any event, human beings are not patentble. That has been the law \nof the land, as it should be. To get into a somewhat arcane, \ncomplicated debate about intellectual property on a totally unrelated \nbill merely sidesteps the real debate and confuses the issue. The \npatent issue is an issue that most appropriately should be examined, \nbut I believe should be examined by the Judiciary Committee, of which \nSenator Brownback is a member. So the distinguished Senator from Kansas \nwill have every right to have his thoughts considered.\n  We need to know how far the Brownback Amendment reaches. Does it \nextend to cell lines derives from unfertilized blastocysts? Does the \namendment destroy the patentability of any process that could be used \nin nuclear transplantation involving human cells? We need to know what, \nif any, tensions, exist between the Brownback Amendment and the Supreme \nCourt's holding in the famous Chakrabarty decision?\n  The 1987 PTO policy cited Chakrabarty ``as controlling authority that \nCongress intended statutory subject matter to `include anything under \nthe sun that is made by man.' '' The PTO went on to say that it ``now \nconsiders nonnaturally occurring non-human multicelluar living \norganisms, including animals, to be patentable subject matter within \nthe scope of 35 U.S.C. 101.''\n\n  We need to think how the Brownback Amendment squares with the \nposition taken in the memo written by then-HHS General Counsel Harriet \nRaab with respect to the relationship embryos and pluripotent cell \nlines.\n  But I want to emphasize that what we really have to resolve in this \ndebate is the legal and moral status of an unfertilized blastocyst that \nwill not be implanted into a mother's womb and can never develop into a \nhuman baby. That is a key issue. Let's be honest, there is little \ninterest in patenting a unfertilized blastocyst because the promise is \nnot in the unfertilized blasotcyst but in the stem cell lines that may \nbe derived from this artificially created cells.\n  I have been following the recent debate on the patenting of human \nlife very closely. My interest is twofold. As a policy matter and of \ncourse as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have a special \nresponsibility for considering any policy issues that touch on \nintellectual property laws. In addition, my longstanding interest in \nbiomedical research and ethics compels me to understand ramifications \nof intellectual property policy which have such far-ranging public \nhealth consequences. So I am very concerned about both of those issues. \nThey are important issues and should not be helter-skelter considered \non the floor without hearings, without appropriate consideration. These \nare complex and difficult issues.\n  Throughout my career, I have always taken a strong pro-family and \npro-life stance, especially on issues relating to biomedical research. \nI have also spent considerable efforts to see that the United States \nremains the world's leader in biomedical research so that our citizens \nmay continue to benefit from revolutionary breakthroughs in science.\n  Patenting human life involves novel and difficult issues. I believe \nthere is widespread agreement that patenting human life, per se, is \nundesirable. Moreover, it may have serious constitutional implications \nunder the 13th and 14th amendments as well. However, in approaching \nthese issues, we must take care not to rush to judgment and \nunnecessarily make unwise policy decisions that would hinder, and \nperhaps halt, important biomedical research.\n  Having said that, I jotted down a few notes put forth by the \naccomplished patent attorney, Al Engelberg. I agree with Al and other \nexperts who do not believe that changing the patent law is the \nappropriate vehicle for exercising governmental control over the \nmultitude of issues relating to cloning. Patents do not create an \naffirmative right to make, use, or sell the patented subject matter. \nThey only give the owner the right to exclude others from doing so. For \nexample, a patent on a new drug does not create any right to \nmanufacture, use, or sell. An approval from the FDA is an absolute \nprerequisite.\n  Similarly, a patent on a slot machine does not give the owner the \nright to use or sell it in a State where gambling is illegal. It would \nbe a big mistake to leave the important broad societal moral, ethical, \nand public health issues to PTO experts applying technical patent laws. \nThat would be a terrific mistake to make, and I believe that the \nambiguities in the Senator's amendment will thrust PTO into an improper \nrole.\n  Do we really want to get involved in parsing patent claims in order \nto decide what is ethically permissible in the real world of cutting \nedge biomedical research? I think not. Let us settle the policy issue \nthrough a direct, frontal debate rather than approaching the matter \nthrough the back door of patentability.\n  I do not think springing, unannounced, this type of amendment on this \nbill in this fashion is the most constructive manner in which to hold \nan informed debate.\n  But on the substance of the amendment, we should take the view that \nthe existence of the patent is not determinative of what is legal or \nillegal to make, use, sell, or permit within commerce. The value of the \npatent should rise or fall on the basis of independent legislative \ndeterminations regarding the legality or illegality of certain \nactivities.\n  That is what Senators Specter, Feinstein, Kennedy and I have done in \nour legislation by making the independent legislative determination \nthat clearly outlaws the cloning of human babies by criminalizing the \nimplantation of unfertilized blastocysts.\n  The right to engage in such activities should be divorced from the \nissuance of patents.\n  Now, as Mr. Engelberg argues, one advantage of proceeding in that \nfashion is that it maximizes the incentives for those who make new and \npotentially new discoveries to disclose them in the\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\nhope that over the 20-year life of the patent, the definition of \n``legally permissible'' activities may be altered, thereby breathing \neconomic value into a discovery that cannot be commercially exploited \nat the time of the recovery. If research in a particular area is \neliminated, no patent applications can be filed without effectively \nadmitting to a crime. Therefore, legislation regarding the scope of \npatents is not a good way to get at the underlying questions that are \nbeing debated.\n  I hope the Senator would withdraw his amendment. I believe it is \ngrossly premature. It is very dangerous for us to adopt such a measure \nwithout appropriate hearings and a complete review of this matter.\n  In the end, it does not help us decide, what seems to me the central \nissue of the debate: whether or not we should go forward with this very \nimportant research?\n  In the weeks ahead, the Senate is going to debate these issues of \nextreme importance to many Utahans and many Americans. There are \nupwards of 128 million people in our society who are suffering from \nvarious difficulties and diseases that may benefit from regenerative \nmedicine research. I am talking about heart disease, cancer, ALS, \ndiabetes and many others.\n  I, personally, believe we ought to do everything in our power to help \nconsistent with sound ethics. I, personally, believe--because experts \ntell me this is the case--that regenerative medicine holds great \npromise of curing many diseases.\n  I acknowledge the distinguished Senator has quoted some scientists, \nbut I am going to stand with the 40 Nobel laureates who have said this \nresearch should go forward because it holds great promise in expanding \nbiomedical research to find treatments or cures. This science may also \nbe used to examine disease so we can get to the bottom of the causes of \ndisease and hopefully find treatments and cures for the millions and \nmillions of Americans and people all over the world who need our help.\n  Regenerative medicine has the great potential to save lives and to \nalleviate pain and suffering. I have come to this position after many \nmonths of study, contemplation, talking with all kinds of scientists \nand others on both sides of this issue, including some of the leading \nauthorities in science, religion, and ethics. I have spent a lot of \ntime on biomedical research issues during my entire Senate career. I \nhave analyzed this from a pro-life, pro-family perspective, with the \nview that being pro-life means helping the living.\n  A 4-year-old boy, Cody Anderson, from West Jordan, UT, came to visit \nme this last June. Cody Anderson's mother almost fell apart when she \ndiscovered at the age of 2 Cody Anderson got the very same diabetes \nthat his grandfather had. His grandfather lived until he was 47 years \nof age but lived through 28 different operations, the loss of his left \nleg below the knee, the loss of his right toes, a colonoscopy, all \nkinds of other travails, difficulties and problems, and ultimately was \non dialysis for the loss of his kidneys for the last 10 years of his \nlife before he died, in a miserable, painful condition, at 47 years of \nage.\n  When Cody's mother discovered that her son, at the age of 2, had \nexactly the same disease that killed her father at age 47, after all \nthat miserable, wretched existence, she almost fell apart. She came to \nme and said: You have to do something about it.\n\n  Not only did the grandfather go blind, he had pressure behind one of \nthe eyes, and it had to be removed.\n  Now, why wouldn't we do everything in our power to help Cody and \nothers suffering from life-debilitating diseases? It seems to me we \nshould.\n  Let me state my total agreement with my dear friend and colleague \nfrom Kansas that we should ban absolutely reproductive cloning of human \nbeings. There is no question that ban would pass 100 to 0 in this body, \nand I think 435 to 0 in the House. There are only a few people in our \nsociety today who believe we ought to follow through and try to \nexperiment with and reach a position of cloning human beings. Those \npeople would be shut off automatically. They basically would be \noutcasts if they tried to do something like that. By banning that \ntotally, we would solve most every problem with which most people are \nconcerned.\n  It does not solve the problem that my dear colleague is concerned \nwith because he considers the unfertilized egg, once a nuclear transfer \ntakes out the 23 mother's chromosomes, and insert the DNA of a skin \ncell or other somatic cell through the nuclear transplantation process. \nThis process inserts the 46 chromosomes into the unfertilized egg that \nwill remain unfertilized.\n  Some believe that the product of nuclear transplantation is a human \nbeing. I don't agree with that. It is a living, human cell, but it \ncertainly is not a human being, nor does it have a chance in the world \nof becoming a human being unless it is implanted in a human womb, and \neven then probably will not become a human being because it is \ntheoretically possible but nobody is absolutely sure if that can \nhappen.\n  During this period of time, the unfertilized egg can be grown to a \nblastocyst stage in a lab and develop to the point where special cells, \ncalled embryonic stem cells, can be extracted and replicate themselves. \nThe stem cells are undifferentiated but, scientists believe, they can \nbe differentiated into as many as 200 different forms of human tissue \nwhich might save lives, which might treat disease, which might bring \ncures, which certainly will help study disease and the origins of \ndisease.\n  I don't mean to go into all of the details this evening. But I am \nvery concerned in the end that if we do not continue this research, the \nrest of the world is going to leave us behind. They will do so under \nmoral and ethical standards that will not be good--at least in some \nparts of the world. If we help set the moral and ethical standards, it \nseems to me, we can benefit everybody around the world, first and \nforemost U.S. citizens. It will mean they will conduct this research on \na highly ethical and morally upright manner.\n  If we do not do that, this research is going to go on through the \nrest of the world, and it will not be with our influence.\n  Second, it seems to me, if we do not go ahead with this research \nunder very stringent moral and ethical standards, it will be gone ahead \nwith no matter what happens because many of our leading scientists \ntoday may leave our country and go where they can pursue this research. \nAnd I say again--according to at least 40 Nobel laureates and almost \neveryone else I know, except a few--this is very promising research.\n  This is important. I am totally in favor of adult stem cell research, \nand almost every scientist I have talked to is also supportive of this \nline of research. But almost every scientist I have talked to, and I \nhave talked to a lot of them, will tell me that it is very difficult to \nget enough adult stem cells, and when you do they are not as able to \nmaintain and differentiate into the various forms of human tissue as \nembryonic stem cells are. That is why many in the scientific world, \nexcept for a few, believe this research, this positive, very important \nresearch, should go forward.\n  I understand the sincerity of those who believe that somatic cell \nnuclear transfer results in the creation of a human being but I do not \nsee it that way. If you have an unfertilized egg that is never \nimplanted into a mother's womb, I do not think we have a human life. It \nis a living human cell. It is something that should be given respect, \ncertainly, but we should give it respect by studying, learning, and \nhelping alleviate human pain and suffering if we can. At least that is \nmy viewpoint.\n  I respect those with viewpoints that are different from mine but I \nthink they are in the minority and as this debate unfolds I think that \nmore and more Americans will agree with us that this important research \nshould go forward. But I do not agree with it.\n\n  There are a lot of very fine people who feel the same way the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas feels. But there are a lot of fine \npeople, who are very religious and very decent, and who are pro-life, \nwho believe that regenerative medicine is moral and that we ought to do \nall we can to help the living, too.\n  From where are these eggs going to come? First, that egg is \nunfertilized. It remains unfertilized right up through this blastocyst \nstage. Those eggs are probably going to come from in vitro clinics \nthemselves, in many cases.\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nUnder our proposal they are going to be voluntarily given. Nobody is \ngoing to profiteer on these eggs. There will be eggs that you cannot \nfreeze readily because they are not fertilized. So they will have to be \nused in a relatively short-term fashion, to create these embryonic stem \ncells, generally in 4 to 6 days or so.\n  The fact is, they are going to be eggs that are voluntarily given.\n  Some of my friends on the right and left of me say every one of those \neggs ought to be used and implanted in a woman so they can have babies. \nThat is not reality. It can be, to a limited number of people who \nchoose to do that, but some will volunteer eggs for this research.\n  During the Olympics I had a woman come up to me and she said: \nSenator, I appreciate your stand on stem cell research. She said: My \nhusband and I have twins from in vitro fertilization. We are so \ngrateful for that process.\n  I remember when that process came forward, many of the arguments that \nare being used today were used against that process.\n  And she said: Senator, we are grateful for those twins. But I don't \nwant any more children and I don't want my eggs implanted in somebody \nelse. I want them used for research.\n  She ought to have the right to do that, and women like her. If you \nare a mother and your child has just gotten a very virulent form of \ndiabetes, or your parents are drifting into Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, \nwhat woman, who is really concerned about her parents, would not be \nwilling to do what she could to help them, if in fact this research can \nprove efficacious? And if adult stem cell research has a chance of \nbeing efficacious, can you imagine what the undifferentiated state of \nstem cells, which can be so easily differentiated, in the eyes at least \nof these scientists, can you imagine what good that will do?\n  I believe these 41 Nobel laureates, the leading scientists in our \nsociety, ought to be listened to in this debate. To a person, they do \nnot believe this is a human being at this stage. There is good reason \nfor that.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from these Nobel laureates, with \ntheir names, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The American Society\n\n\n                                             for Cell Biology,\n\n                                                     Bethesda, MD.\n       Two National Academy of Sciences expert committees, as well \n     as noted national and international organizations, have \n     evaluated current scientific and medical information and have \n     concluded that cloning a human being using the method of \n     nuclear transplantation cannot be achieved safely. Such \n     attempts in other mammals often have catastrophic outcomes. \n     Furthermore, virtually nothing is known about the potential \n     safety of such procedures in humans. Consequently, there is \n     widespread and strong agreement that an attempt to clone a \n     human being would constitute unwarranted experimentation on \n     human subjects and should be prohibited by legislation that \n     imposes criminal and civil penalties on those who would \n     implant the product of nuclear transplantation into a woman's \n     uterus.\n       Unfortunately, some legislation, such as that introduced by \n     Senator Brownback (R-KS) would foreclose the legitimate use \n     of nuclear transplantation technology for research and \n     therapeutic purposes. This would impede progress against some \n     of the most debilitating diseases known to man. For example, \n     it may be possible to use nuclear transplantation technology \n     to produce patient-specific embryonic stem cells that could \n     overcome the rejection normally associated with tissue and \n     organ transplantation. Nuclear transplantation technology \n     might also permit the creation of embryonic stem cells with \n     defined genetic constitution, permitting a new and powerful \n     approach to understanding how inherited predispositions lead \n     to a variety of cancers and neurological diseases such as \n     Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.\n       A critical element of the Brownback bill would prevent the \n     importation into the United States of medical treatments \n     developed in other parts of the world using nuclear \n     transplantation. It seems unbelievable that the United States \n     Senate would deny advanced medical treatment to hundreds of \n     millions of suffering Americans because of an aversion to a \n     technology that was used in its development.\n       By declaring scientifically valuable biomedical research \n     illegal, Senator Brownback's legislation, if it becomes law, \n     would have a chilling effect on all scientific research in \n     the United States. Such legal restrictions on scientific \n     investigation would also send a strong signal to the next \n     generation of researchers that unfettered and irresponsible \n     scientific investigation is not welcome in the United States.\n       We, the undersigned, urge that legislation to impose \n     criminal and civil sanctions against attempts to create a \n     cloned human being be enacted.

We can debate \nall night about it. I am sure there will come a time for this debate, \nwhere we can discuss all these matters.\n  But, you know, I am concerned that we not lose this opportunity to \nhelp mankind. I remember in the early 1970s, mid-1970s, when \nrecombinant DNA was so heavily lobbied against, the research, and it \nwas another type of cloning research. It was not the same as this, it \nis not cloning a living mother's egg, but nevertheless, it involved \ncloning. Similar arguments were made against recombinant DNA research.\n  I have to tell you that we went ahead anyway, the research was done, \nand today we have over 60 mainline drugs that came from recombinant \nDNA--cloning--research, not the least of which is human insulin which \nis saving millions of lives today in this world.\n  In fact, virtually every major scientific breakthrough through \nhistory has had those who have argued against it. And there have been \nsome which have not proven efficacious, such as fetal tissue research.\n  I made the arguments on the floor against fetal tissue research at \nthe time. So far, I believe that science has not been able to derive \nthe projected benefits from fetal tissue research. I am not saying I \nwas right; I am just saying the fact is, it did not prove as \nefficacious as originally thought.\n  But the scientists, one of the latest ones I chatted with at the \nUniversity of Utah, Mario Capecchi, one of the leading experts in the \nworld on mice stem cell research--it was an absolutely fascinating hour \nand a half I spent with him. You can't believe how very deeply he \nbelieves that embryonic stem cell research, of the type I have been \ntalking about, is absolutely crucial for the well-being and care of \nhumankind and that, really, this research has to go forward.\n  We have already lost one of the truly great scientists in this \ncountry, Dr. Peterson, I believe, who just threw his hands in the air \nand gave up because he believes this research is going to be ultimately \nhurt in this country--although I do not think he is right. He has \nalready left and gone to England. Can you imagine how many more would \nleave if we, the most free country in the world, the most \nscientifically oriented country in the world, the country where most \nbiomedical research progress has been made, the country that has the \nbest Food and Drug Administration in the world, the country that has a \ncaring nature about living human beings--not meaning to demean other \ncountries, but I think this country cannot be beat in biomedical \nresearch. Can you imagine what a demoralizing thing it would be if we \nbanned this highly promising research that can help alleviate the pains \nof mankind?\n  I have talked enough about it. I am just saying I hope my dear \ncolleague will withdraw his amendment because it is premature. We will \nbe happy to debate tomorrow, if he is unwilling to withdraw it, or \nwhenever--but it is premature. I think it is dangerous to do it this \nway. We should study this because it is a complex, very difficult area. \nThere are so many things about this whole debate that are very complex \nand very difficult.\n  I am sure I cannot convince my colleague of my point of view, and I \ndo not believe he is going to convince me of his. But the fact is, I \nbelieve we ought to do everything in our power, within moral and \nethical constraints and standards, to try to come up with treatments \nand cures that might alleviate the pain, suffering, and yes, even \npremature death of our fellow human beings on this planet.\n  I hope before this year is out that we will be able to resolve this \nissue because I think it needs to be resolved. I will certainly work \nwith my dear colleague to try to find ways we can resolve this. But I \nbelieve it has to be resolved, and I hope we can have that full-time \ndebate at a later date and that we will be able, at that time, to let \nthe Senate vote and let the Senate make the determination, as well as \nthe House, and go from there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I would like to respond to a few \nissues raised by my friend and colleague from Utah. I have great \nadmiration and respect for him. He is a senior Member of this body. He \nhas done excellent work over the years. We have a disagreement on this \none, although I don't know that we actually have a disagreement on the \nbill that is pending.\n  I continue to note the bill that is pending is about a patenting \nissue. It is about banning patents, and it is not about banning patents \non unfertilized eggs. The bill is on the zygote, embryo, fetus, child \nor adult; a living organism made by human cloning or a process of human \ncloning. That is the operative part.\n  The zygote is the very young, fertilized egg. I agree that the \nunfertilized egg is not a person, to maybe clarify that in the debate. \nI don't think the unfertilized egg is a person and it is not protected \nunder what we are proposing on this issue about patenting. The issue in \nfront of us is patenting.\n  I also respond to my dear colleague from Utah that what we are \nproposing does not ban research on human cloning, that he would like to \nproceed. I disagree with that, but the pending issue is not about \nbanning human cloning. It says that what we should do is not allow \npatenting of human clones or of young people. It is a narrow issue.\n  I want to make sure that it is clear to the body overall that the \npending issue before this body is not about banning human cloning, it \nis not about a moratorium on human cloning; it is an issue that we \nshould not patent the young human at any stage in the life continuum, \nwhen it is a young human.\n  That is when you have an entity. Whether it is a clone or a natural \nhuman, if you nurture it and it grows into a person, you should not be \nallowing patenting of this person. That is the pending issue.\n  I don't believe a number of scientists and Nobel laureates speak to \nthe issue of patenting. They speak to the issue of human cloning, which \nis going on in America and which continues to go on this day in \nAmerica. I don't think it should. That is not the pending issue, and \nthat is not the issue the scientists address.\n  The issue that we are bringing up is about patenting. The good \nSenator from Utah knows this is the time and the right place. I brought \nthese issues up in the past year. If not now, when? This is the time. \nThese issues are pending. Some say it is not a real issue because the \nPatent Office has already declared that you can't patent a person.\n  I want to draw the attention of the Members of the body to when this \ndebate broke open. Here is a May 17, 2002, piece in the New York Times, \n``Debate on Human Cloning Turns to Patents''--just this past month.\n\n       The University of Missouri has received a patent that some \n     lawyers say could cover human cloning, potentially violating \n     a longstanding taboo against patenting of humans.\n       The patent covers a way of turning unfertilized eggs into \n     embryos.\n\n  That is covered by the amendment we have put forward.\n\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\n\n       . . . the production of cloned mammals using that \n     technique.\n\n  And it could be used on humans. That is the issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the New York Times, \nand a similar one covering it from the Washington Post, and the \nWashington Times, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 17, 2002]\n\n                Debate on Human Cloning Turns to Patents\n\n                          (By Andrew Pollack)\n\n       The University of Missouri has received a patent that some \n     lawyers say could cover human cloning, potentially violating \n     a longstanding taboo against the patenting of humans.\n       The patent covers a way of turning unfertilized eggs into \n     embryos, and the production of cloned mammals using that \n     technique. But unlike some other patents on animal cloning, \n     this one does not specifically exclude human from the \n     definition of mammals; indeed, it specifically mentions the \n     use of human eggs.\n       Those opposed to cloning and to patenting of living things \n     say the patent is a further sign that human life is being \n     turned into a commodity.\n       ``It is horrendous that we would define all of human life \n     as biological machines that can be cloned, manufactured and \n     patented,'' said Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the \n     International Center for Technology Assessment, a Washington \n     group that has long opposed patenting of living things and \n     also wants to ban all human cloning.\n       The patent was issued in April 2001, but attracted no \n     attention until Mr. Kimbrell's group ran across it recently.\n       Senator Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican who has been a \n     leading opponent of human cloning, said he intended to \n     introduce a bill to prohibit patents on human beings and \n     human embryos, which he said were ``akin to slavery.''\n       ``I think the patent office will appreciate having that \n     clarity, given the applications that are coming into the \n     patent office,'' Mr. Brownback said.\n       That bill would be separate from a bill the senator is \n     already sponsoring that would prohibit all human cloning. The \n     Senate is debating how extensively to ban human cloning, but \n     none of the bills it is considering deal with the patent \n     issues.\n       The patent also illustrates the tricky legal and ethical \n     issues the United States Patent and Trademark Office is \n     confronting as scientists race to develop cloning and to grow \n     human tissues to treat disease. Mr. Kimbrell said he had \n     found a few other patents that had been applied for but not \n     granted that might cover human cloning.\n       The United States has been more liberal than most other \n     countries in granting patents on living things, ever since a \n     Supreme Court decision in 1980 that allowed the patenting of \n     a microbe genetically engineered to consume oil spills. There \n     are patents on complete animals, like a mouse genetically \n     engineered to be prone to cancer. There are patents on human \n     genes and human cells. The University of Wisconsin has a \n     patent on human embryonic stem cells, which are cells taken \n     from human embryos that have the ability to turn into any \n     other type of tissue.\n       But the patent office has drawn the line on patenting of \n     humans or human embryos themselves, saying it would not be \n     constitutional. Many experts say this is because such patents \n     would violate the 13th Amendment ban on slavery. Brigid \n     Quinn, a spokeswoman for the patent office, said the agency \n     was not using the 13th Amendment argument anymore but was not \n     granting patents on humans because it had not received any \n     guidance from Congress or the courts saying it should do so.\n       The result has been that many patents that conceivably \n     could cover humans--like on cloning animals or on genetically \n     engineering animals to produce drugs in their milk--\n     specifically exclude humans.\n       A spokesman for the University of Missouri, Christian Basi, \n     said that it believed its patent covered human cloning \n     because it applied to all mammals. The university has \n     licensed the patent to BioTransplant, a Massachusetts \n     biotechnology company that is working on creating pigs that \n     can be used as human organ donors. But the license, Mr. Basi \n     said, covers only the use in pigs.\n       ``We have absolutely no interest in using this to research \n     humans and we will not license this technology to anyone for \n     use in humans,'' Mr. Basi said, suggesting that the patent \n     could actually help stop human cloning. ``This gives us \n     control of this particular technology so we will know that \n     this technology will not be used in humans.''\n       Ms. Quinn said the patent office did not comment on \n     individual patents but had not changed its policy of not \n     issuing patents ``drawn to humans.''\n       Randall S. Prather, a professor of reproductive technology \n     at Missouri whose work was the basis for the patent, said the \n     mention of human eggs ``was put there by the attorneys and \n     they wanted to cover all mammals.''\n       Charles Cohen, who wrote the patent when he was a lawyer at \n     a St. Louis law firm, declined to comment.\n       Some lawyers who have looked at the patent, No. 6,211,429, \n     say it is not clear that it covers human cloning and that \n     interpreting patents requires careful analysis of the \n     patent's history, that the patent office did not appear to \n     have problems with it could be a sign that the agency \n     believes that the patent does not cover humans.\n       ``You'd have to go through line by line, word by word,'' \n     said Gerald P. Dodson, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster in \n     Palo Alto, Calif., who read the patent and said he could not \n     reach an immediate conclusion.\n       Mr. Dodson and others noted that the specifications and \n     examples of how the patent could be used dealt with pigs and \n     cows.\n       Even if the patent does cover human cloning, some lawyers \n     say, it would be a stretch to say it covers humans \n     themselves, although the abstract of the patent says it \n     covers the ``cloned products.''\n       But even a patent on the process of cloning humans could \n     give the patent holder some rights over people, some lawyers \n     said. Conceivably, for instance, the university could bar \n     people created overseas by its cloning process from entering \n     the country.\n       ``It definitely is a patent for cloning a human, and under \n     the laws we have right now, it might actually cover the \n     human,'' said Richard Warburg, a patent lawyer at Foley & \n     Lardner in San Diego who represents Infigen, an animal \n     cloning company.\n       Dr. Rochelle Seide, a New York patent lawyer who heads the \n     biotechnology practice at the law firm of Baker & Botts, said \n     the lack of the nonhuman disclaimer in the Missouri patent \n     was surprising.\n       ``Looking at it,'' Ms. Seide said, ``I can see where people \n     who are against cloning would have a big problem with it.''\n       Advanced Cell Technology, a company that wants to clone \n     human embryos to obtain stem cells for disease treatments, \n     licensed a patent from the University of Massachusetts on its \n     method of cloning. But the patent is on only nonhuman embryos \n     produced by the process, though it does seem to cover human \n     cells.\n       It might be difficult to draw the line on what constitutes \n     a human. George J. Annas, professor of health law at Boston \n     University School of Public Health, said it was unclear \n     whether the anti-slavery amendment would be a basis for \n     denying patents on human embryos, because courts, in cases \n     like those involving custody of frozen embryos, have said an \n     embryo is not a person.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 21, 2002]\n\n         University's Cloning Patent Raises a ``Mammal'' Issue\n\n                             (By Amy Fagan)\n\n       Adding another layer to the contentious debate over cloning \n     in Congress, a patent watchdog group said last week that the \n     University of Missouri at Columbia has received a patent for \n     technology that can be used to clone human beings.\n       The patent covers laboratory procedures for creating cloned \n     mammals, but it extends to the direct products of those \n     cloning processes, including humans, said Peter DiMauro, \n     director of Patent Watch.\n       ``It says `mammals' and it doesn't have a disclaimer for \n     humans,'' said Mr. DiMauro, whose project tracks patents for \n     the International Center for Technology Assessment.\n       University officials said the patent, issued last year, was \n     never intended to apply to human beings. It was issued to a \n     university researcher and applied to technology that allows \n     the cloning of swine.\n       ``The intent of the patent was to allow for research on \n     swine,'' said Missouri spokeswoman Mary Joe Banken, who said \n     school officials are meeting today to discuss narrowing the \n     patent's language to exclude humans. ``It was never the \n     intent of the university to use the technology on humans.''\n       Mr. DiMauro said he respects that, ``but the flaw is in the \n     law.''\n       The Senate is awaiting a debate on the human-cloning issue. \n     Sen. Sam Brownback, Kansas Republican, has a bill to outlaw \n     the cloning of human embryos for any purpose, including for \n     medical research. The House has passed an identical bill and \n     the president is pushing for it.\n       Mr. DiMauro said his group has found three pending patents \n     similar to that in Missouri. He called on Congress to clarify \n     in law that patents cannot apply to human beings--including \n     human embryos or fetuses.\n       Mr. Brownback said he will introduce legislation this week \n     to do so.\n       ``The central point in the debate over human cloning \n     revolves around our view of the human embryo and whether or \n     not the human embryo is a person or a piece of property,'' \n     Mr. Brownback said. ``If we allow the patenting of human \n     embryos, we will be sending the message that humans are \n     property and that they can be exploited and destroyed for \n     profit.''\n       A bill competing with Mr. Brownback's cloning ban, by Sens. \n     Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania Republican, Dianne Feinstein, \n     California Democrat, and others, would outlaw the \n     implantation of a cloned human embryo in a uterus but would \n     allow the human-cloning procedure to be done for medical \n     research, including the extraction of stem cells. Advocates \n     of this approach say the cloning procedure does not produce a \n     human embryo, since no sperm is involved.\n       Patent Watch's DiMauro said the Specter-Feinstein cloning \n     bill contains ``nothing to address the large scale \n     commercialization of human embryos created through cloning.''\n       He said it ``seems to permit the status quo of the law, \n     which is to allow the patenting of human embryos.''\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\n       When asked whether scientists would be able to obtain \n     patents on their human-cloning research under her bill, Mrs. \n     Feinstein said she did not know because her bill does not \n     deal with the patent issue.\n       ``I do not know, I cannot answer that,'' she said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                     A New Call for Cloning Policy\n\n                           (By Justin Gillis)\n\n       An advocacy group said yesterday it had uncovered a year-\n     old patent that it interprets as applying to cloned human \n     beings, and the group called on Congress to clarify the law \n     to specify that no patents can be issued on human life.\n       The patent holder, the University of Missouri at Columbia, \n     said it is still studying issues raised by the group but had \n     no intention of asserting ownership of human beings or of \n     cloned human embryos. The patent was obtained by a Missouri \n     researcher working to develop pigs whose organs could be \n     transplanted to save human patients. Cloning might be a way \n     of creating many such pigs.\n       What the patent, No. 6,211,429, actually covers is somewhat \n     unclear. It is mostly a description of specific laboratory \n     techniques for making cloned mammals, but a subordinate \n     clause in a section of the patent also lays claim to ``the \n     cloned products produced by these methods.''\n       Other recent patents of this type have included explicit \n     language saying the mammals in question do not include human \n     beings, but this patent, issued April 3, 2001, to Missouri \n     researcher Randall S. Prather and an associate, includes no \n     such language.\n       Read in conjunction with relevant law, that means Prather \n     has staked a claim on cloned humans whether he meant to or \n     not, said Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the \n     International Center for Technology Assessment, the \n     Washington activist group whose ``PatentWatch'' project \n     raised the issue.\n       Some details of the patent appeared yesterday in the Wall \n     Street Journal.\n       No one has ever made a cloned person, but many scientists \n     believe it has become possible, raising profound ethical \n     questions, including what rights of ownership the creators of \n     a clone might have in their creation.\n       ``I would say that the patent office should rescind this \n     patent as grossly unethical and contrary to any kind of \n     public policy,'' Kimbrell said. ``I also feel that in order \n     to clarify this, Congress needs to come in.''\n       His group also raised concerns about three pending patents \n     that it said could also be read as covering human life.\n       The University of Missouri disclaimed any pernicious \n     intent. Prather ``has absolutely no interest in doing \n     research on humans,'' said Mary Jo Banken, a spokeswoman for \n     the school. ``I would say it would be impossible that we \n     would attempt human reproductive cloning. It would never be \n     approved'' by the university.\n       Brigid Quinn, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office, said she could not discuss any individual \n     patent and could not comment on Kimbrell's interpretation of \n     the Missouri patent. But she said the patent office had made \n     no change in its longstanding policy that human life cannot \n     be patented.\n       ``Our policy has not changed,'' Quinn said. ``It is not \n     changing. We do not patent claims drawn to humans.''\n       However the Missouri patent is ultimately interpreted, the \n     case does point up what some experts see as a gap in U.S. \n     law. The policy to which Quinn referred is just that--a \n     statement of intent issued by the patent office 15 years ago. \n     It is subject to change, to court challenge and to simple \n     oversight by patent examiners.\n       There is no specific law that excludes clones or other \n     genetically modified human beings from being covered by \n     patents. Some legal experts feel that constitutional law, \n     particularly the 13th Amendment's prohibition of slavery, \n     would rule out human patents. But others are doubtful and \n     they argue that Congress should make the prohibition \n     explicit.\n       Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), who has led a contested effort \n     in Congress to ban all types of human cloning, said yesterday \n     he would introduce separate legislation to clarify the patent \n     laws. ``If we allow for the patenting of human embryos we \n     will be sending the message that humans are property and that \n     they can be exploited and destroyed for profit,'' Brownback \n     said.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wanted to note to the Members of \nthis body that this is the current issue. Indeed, one group that is \nlooking and studying this issue believes that there are three patents \neither pending or already granted that could or are being used by the \npatent people or the process to create a human clone already.\n  Madam President, my point is that it is a live issue, and what we are \ndoing here does not ban human cloning. It simply says you can't patent \nthe human clone because there is a person; that if you allow this \nperson to grow it is going to become a full-scale human being. It \nappears as if we are not going to be able to take this up in front of \nthis body--the overall issue of cloning. Negotiations on that have \nbroken down. Yet here is one to which I was hopeful we could get \nactually 100 percent of the Members of the body to agree.\n  I want to point to a couple of other issues that the Senator from \nUtah mentioned.\n  One is the unfertilized egg. We continue to speak about the \nunfertilized egg, which I believe is not a person. I want to state that \nclearly. The unfertilized egg he spoke about is not covered by the \namendment. We do not cover the unfertilized egg.\n  He notes the position of a number of scientists on the issue of \ncloning. I would agree that there are differences in the scientific \ncommunity on the issue of cloning. I also note that there are \ndifferences in the public. Two-thirds of the American public is opposed \nto human cloning.\n  I want to give you some examples of people who are opposed to human \ncloning and some of the reasons they are opposed to human cloning, and \nshow you some pictures.\n  Two-thirds of the American public is uncomfortable about the issue of \ncloning. It kind of makes their skin crawl. It is that natural law \nwithin us that causes us to bristle when we think about creating life \njust for the purpose of destruction.\n  Here is a gentleman who wrote to me. He is from Granbury, TX. His \nname is James Kelly. He is in a wheelchair.\n  He said:\n\n       For the past five years I've lived in a self-imposed cocoon \n     that includes a computer, a phone, and the world of medical \n     research. In 1997 I fell asleep while driving interstate and \n     a resulting spinal cord injury left me paralyzed below the \n     chest. Because of what I've learned through reading medical \n     journals and speaking to leading scientists, and because my \n     life's focus is to support the safe, efficient development of \n     cures for many medical conditions (including my own), I \n     recently left my cocoon and journeyed to Washington to \n     support your proposed ban on all forms of human cloning.\n       My reasons for supporting this ban are simple. Huge \n     obstacles stand in the way of cloned embryonic stem cells \n     ever leading to cures for any condition. To overcome these \n     obstacles crucial funds, resources, and research careers will \n     need to be diverted from more promising avenues for many \n     years to come. These obstacles include tumor formation, short \n     and long-term genetic mutations, tissue rejection, \n     prohibitive costs, and the need for eggs from literally \n     hundreds of millions of women to treat a single major \n     condition (such as stroke, heart disease, or diabetes). \n     However, every condition that cloned embryonic stem cells \n     someday may address is already being addressed in animals or \n     humans more safely, effectively, and cheaply by adult stem \n     cells and other avenues. And since money spent on impressive-\n     sounding, but hugely problematic research such as cloning \n     cannot also be spent on research that really offers cures, \n     I'm in favor of a total ban on human cloning.\n       I knew all this before I went to Washington. That's why I \n     went there. Please allow me to share with you what I learned \n     while I was there.\n\n  He goes ahead and talks about his discussion.\n  I want to show another person who has written to me who has studied \nand looked into this issue.\n  This is Julie Durler from Wright, KS. That is a nice-sounding \ncommunity name.\n\n       I am writing this letter in support of legislation that \n     would ban the creation of all cloned embryos. I understand \n     the cloning of human embryos is being proposed for research \n     purposed to help in finding a cure for different diseases \n     including diabetes.\n       I am an insulin-dependent diabetic having been diagnosed \n     with type I diabetes 17 years ago. I know personally the \n     financial costs of having diabetes and also the health risks \n     involved. As I have worked hard to keep my diabetes under \n     control, I have been blessed in that I do not currently have \n     any major complications as a result of having diabetes. \n     However, I am also aware that in the future such \n     complications may very well develop. Along with many others \n     in our nation, I, too, would like to see a cure found for \n     diabetes and know that research is necessary to accomplish \n     that goal. However, the proposed use of cloning of human \n     embryos for research or other purposes concerns me, \n     especially since this creation of the cloned embryos for \n     research purpose would result in their deaths.\n       I do not believe it is necessary to destroy life at any \n     stage of development for research purposes. I believe their \n     are other avenues of research that should be explored, most \n     specifically the use of adult stem cells which has already \n     produced some promising developments.\n\n  These are a few of many letters that we received from people who are \nsuffering from some of these diseases who say there is a better way to \ngo, as I have noted earlier.\n  I want to make another point on this Record.\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\n  The Senator from Utah, who has worked with me on many issues, says \nthese are just a few cells. They are just a few cells. They are just a \nfew cells.\n  I want to show you Hannah when she was just a few cells. This is \nHannah. She is age 28 months, on April 1.\n  This is Hannah earlier. This is Hannah in the womb at 21 weeks. It is \na fairly good picture of her. This is Hannah transferred to mom on \nApril 11, 1998. Hannah was conceived. She was frozen. She was adopted \nas a frozen embryo.\n  That is interesting.\n  On March 5, 1998, she arrived at a clinic. On April 10, Hannah was \nthawed. Here she grows outside the womb. And, on April 11, she is \ntransferred to mom. And then she goes on down the process.\n\n  If you destroy Hannah here, you have destroyed Hannah there. It is \nthe same person. Looks different. When she gets older, she is going to \nlook different.\n  Madam President, myself, I was once one of these. You were one of \nthese. The Senator from Nevada was one of these. If we had been \ndestroyed at this stage, we would never have gotten to this stage.\n  It is a life continuum that exists. If you destroy me here, I never \nget there. That is a biological fact. There is no theory involved. \nThere is no theology involved. This is a biological fact.\n  Hannah was a few cells. We all were a few cells at some point in \ntime. If you destroy us here, you destroy us there. If you destroy a \ncaterpillar, you never get the butterfly, as much as we may want it.\n  My point in continuing this description for people is because this is \njust a few cells, it is true--it is just a few cells--but if you \ndestroy those few cells, Hannah is destroyed.\n  At what point in time do you put any value to this life? Do we put \nvalue to Hannah when she is 28 months? I would say everybody in this \nbody would agree. What do you put as Hannah's worth on December 31, \n1998, when she came out of the womb? Everybody in this body agrees you \nput value to her at that point. Do you put value to her at 21 weeks in \nthe womb? Some people in this body would question that, whether you \nwould put worth to her at that point. How about April 11, when she is \noutside the womb? Some people would raise questions about that.\n  My point is, if you value her here, you have destroyed her here in \nthe process that we are talking about.\n  That is not the issue in front of us. What I am talking about is the \npatenting. What I am saying here is, what is this? Is it a person or a \npiece of property at this point in time? Patentwise, what is this? Is \nit a person or a piece of property? The argument that is being \npresented to the Patent Office by some lawyers is that it is property \nand can be patented. But others are saying, it is life; it cannot be \npatented. That is the position of the Patent Office.\n  This body needs to decide that issue. And we are going to have to \ndecide, then, if it is property at this point, at what point in time \ndoes it become a person that it cannot be patented?\n  My submission to you is, you should start at the moment of inception \nor that creation of the clone and say, you cannot patent the person. It \nis against the 13th amendment abolishing slavery. That is the only \nclean spot you can go in here and declare this is the spot we should \nstart.\n  This should be a relatively easy and straightforward issue. It does \nnot stop cloning research from taking place. It does not stop the \nfunding of cloning research from taking place. It does not stop our \nscientists from working on the issue. It simply says, you cannot patent \na person. It clarifies that issue for people who desire and seek to do \nthat.\n  For those reasons, I think we should be able to vote on this, bring \nit up. And I am hopeful all my colleagues will join me in voting for \nthe amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, following the tragic events of September \n11, 2001, the insurance industry faced an unprecedented situation. The \nfinal costs and impact on the insurance industry and its consumers have \nyet to be determined.\n  Although secondary insurers will help to cover some of the expenses \nassociated with the September 11 attacks, it is critical for the Senate \nto consider and pass legislation to address the risks of future \nterrorists attacks.\n  The administration, the insurance industry, and policy holders \nthroughout the various and diverse sectors of the economy, state the \ncritical importance of passing legislation in a timely manner.\n  The attacks in September dealt a detrimental blow to an already \nsluggish economy leaving the health and stability of the economy very \nuncertain. Although the economic outlook is improving, further delay in \npassage of a terrorism insurance measure will adversely affect economic \nprogress and growth.\n  Since September we have passed the September 11 Victims Compensation \nFund, the Air Transportation Safety and Stabilization Act, and the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act.\n  The insurance industry is also facing a potential crisis. It is now \nJune 13, 2002, and we still have not passed a bill. Every day that we \nfail to do so, the growing uncertainty in the market threatens the \nability of businesses to obtain adequate and affordable insurance.\n\n\n                  Need to Address Group Life Insurance\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the bill that we are debating today \ntakes critical steps to address the problems arising from the September \n11 tragedy that are being experienced by the commercial property and \ncasualty insurance industry. I understand however, that the group life \nbusiness has also been impacted by the tragic events of September 11. \nGroup life insurance covers nearly 160 million Americans and represents \n40 percent of all life insurance in force in the United States, or, $6 \ntrillion of protection to Americans--most of whom are average working \nAmericans. Group life insurance is a highly efficient and inexpensive \nway to deliver much needed security to people who might otherwise have \nlittle or no coverage. This product is inexpensive because it is sold \nas a single contract between an insurance company and a corporate \nbuyer, the employer, and covering a great number of lives. This greatly \nsimplifies and reduces costs of marketing and administering of the \nproduct. It is typically a staple of the employee benefits package \nprovided by employers to their employees.\n  While I support the terrorism insurance bill that we consider today, \nI am concerned that it fails to address issues that threaten the \ncontinued vitality of group life insurance providers. And so I am \npleased to have the opportunity to engage in a colloquy on this issue \nwith the Senator from Nebraska, a true expert on insurance matters, the \nsenior Senator from Maine, and three key members of the Senate Banking \nCommittee.\n  I understand that the primary problem, both for the property and \ncasualty insurers, as well as the group life insurers, is the \ndifficulty in obtaining reinsurance after the disaster. Am I correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator's understanding is correct. Reinsurance is \nimportant to the property and casualty insurers as well as to the group \nlife insurance industry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, who has \nplayed such a key role in bringing this important bill to the floor. I \nalso thank the Senator from Maine for raising the profile of this issue \nin the Senate.\n  It is my understanding as well that the group life industry is \nexperiencing difficulties in obtaining reinsurance. I understand, for \nexample, that one group life insurer covered four corporate groups in \nthe World Trade Center, with over $150 million in losses. All but $6 \nmillion was paid by reinsurance. Had that insurer not had reinsurance, \nits financial security would have been severely compromised. It is not \nunusual for group life insurance losses to be 96 percent covered by \nreinsurers. Now, however, the catastrophic reinsurance market has \nchanged. For those companies that use reinsurance, I understand that \npremiums have skyrocketed with 10- to 13-fold increases and, in many \ninstances, reinsurance may not be available at all. Much of the \nreinsurance that is being written excludes acts of terrorism and \nbiological, nuclear and chemical claims. And, while reinsurers are \neither declining to pay for certain claims or simply not \noffering reinsurance for certain occurrences, the group life insurers \nare not allowed by their State insurance commissioners to have the same \nexclusions. And so I ask the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nBanking\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\nCommittee, does the bill that we are currently debating address the \nproblems being faced by group life insurers?\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for raising this \nimportant question. I believe that this bill does not speak \nindividually to the issues now confronting the group life insurance \nindustry. I would note that the bill does contain a provision that \nrequires the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the \nNation of Association of Insurance Commissioners and representatives of \nthe insurance industry and other experts, to study the potential \neffects of acts of terrorism on the availability of life insurance and \nother lines of insurance coverage.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the senior Senator from Texas for his remarks. I \nam concerned that the study may not be completed in sufficient time to \nhelp the group life insurers avail themselves of the help that the \nproperty and casualty companies are getting in this bill. I would \ntherefore ask the Senator from South Dakota, a senior member of the \nSenate Banking Committee, if he believes the needs of group life \ninsurers are adequately addressed in this bill or its companion \nmeasure, passed by the House last November?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the senior Senator from Maine for her question. \nI believe that the needs of group life insurers are not adequately met \nby this bill. I find this problematic because of the role that group \nlife insurance plays for the majority of American families. I am \nparticularly concerned about the families of firefighters and other \nfirst responders. We ask firefighters and other first responders to \nrisk their lives for us in the event of a terrorist attack. We have to \nmake sure that basic group life insurance is there for them. I am also \nconcerned about families whose wage earners are at the lower end of the \npay scale. These families often find that they are able to secure more \nlife insurance than they could otherwise afford because their employer \nis subsidizing it.\n  Finally, I am concerned about those families with a spouse who has \nhad a serious medical problem. These families often find that the only \nlife insurance they can afford or even find is group life.\n  We need to make sure that this industry remains highly competitive \nand able to pay all of the claims that might be made in the event of a \nfuture terrorist attack.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleagues for participating in this \ncolloquy, which has added measurably to the debate on the underlying \nbill. I thank particularly the distinguished senior Senators from Texas \nand Connecticut, without whom this bill would not be before us today, \nand I would like to ask them if they would commit to doing all they \ncould to ensure that the legitimate needs of group life insurers are \naddressed in the conference on this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would say to the gentlelady from Maine that this is an \nimportant issue that was brought to our attention only after the basic \nlegislation was drafted. For that reason, I have every intention of \nmaking sure that, in conference, we give full consideration to the \nproblems faced by the group life industry.\n  Mr. DODD. I concur with the senior Senator from Texas and will do all \nI can to address the legitimate needs of group life insurers in \nconference. To that end, I would invite the group life industry to \ncontinue to work with us so that we can better understand the problems \nthat it now faces.\n  Mr. GREGG. I share the concerns of my colleagues regarding this issue \nand would add that we should facilitate insurance coverage for \nbuildings subject to terrorist attacks, as well as for the people who \nwork inside them. I look forward to addressing these issues in \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5528-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise today to respond to remarks by \nthe senior Senator from Idaho on the Senate floor procedures outlined \nin the Nuclear Waste Policy Act regarding Yucca Mountain. And I come to \nthe floor today out of great respect for the traditions of the U.S. \nSenate. I am a freshman Senator. I have only been here a year. But one \nof the first things I did when I arrived was to seek the advice of the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd,  our very own Senate \nhistorian. I asked him for a copy of his history of the Senate which I \nhave turned to often. I haven't had the opportunity to speak to him \ndirectly on this matter, but I turned to his books for guidance.\n  Madam President, when you have the chance, turn to Volume II page \n191, and see what Senator Byrd says about the powers of the majority \nleader. He says the majority leader . . . ``determines what matters or \nmeasures will be scheduled for floor action and when.'' The Senator \nfrom Idaho is planning to change that by asserting that it would be \nalright for any member to determine when the Yucca Mountain resolution \ncomes to floor. he said that, ``the Nuclear Waste Policy Act provides a \nspecial statutory authority to make exception to contemporary \npractice.'' That is not the case. I have the act right here.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 does state that it shall be in \norder ``for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the \nconsideration of such resolution.'' But the act also states that the \nprocedures outlined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act ``supersede other \nrules of the Senate only to the extent that they are inconsistent with \nsuch other rules.''\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act provision permitting any Member to move \nto proceed to the consideration of the Yucca Mountain resolution is \nconsistent with Senate rules, therefore it does not supersede the rules \nof the Senate. In the modern history of the Senate, no Member, other \nthan the majority leader (or a designee), has successfully made a \nmotion to proceed to a matter or measure.\n  Here are the facts:\n  CRS indicates there are six statutory expedited procedures in current \nlaw which explicitly state that ``any Member of the Senate'' may offer \nthe motion to proceed: Executive Reorganization Act; Atomic Energy Act; \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990; Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act; Balanced Budget Emergency Deficit \nControl Act; Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  According to a March 28, 2002 CRS memorandum, the language in these \nsix statutes which states that ``any Member of the Senate'' may offer \nthe motion to proceed is ``consistent with the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, which permit any Senator to make a motion to proceed, but also \nwith the general Senate practice under which Senators routinely concede \nto the majority leader the function of taking actions to determine the \nfloor agenda.\n  So the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is not, as the senior Senator from \nIdaho stated, ``a special procedure.''\n  Next, a June 11 CRS memorandum indicates that since the 100th \nCongress, consideration of five measures was governed by some statutory \nprocedure explicitly permitting any Senator to offer a motion to \nproceed to consider. In three of these cases, action to call up the \nmeasure for consideration was taken by the Senate majority leader. \nHowever, in two of those cases, no Senator took action to call up the \nother two measures. The majority leader secured their indefinite \npostponement. That means no Senators offered a motion to proceed, even \nwhen explicitly permitted to do so by statute. The majority leader kept \ncontrol of the Senate.\n  The Senate is a body which, quite rightly, reveres tradition. We \nmust, as we have so few rules. As a new Member, I relied on the \nguidance from the Parliamentarian, the Congressional Research Service, \nand my senior colleagues. I am certain that if anyone,\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nother than the majority leader, successfully offers a motion to proceed \nto the Yucca Mountain resolution, it will break with Senate tradition, \nundermine the goal of the majority leader, and allow other Senators to \ncontrol the floor. I hope the Members of this body will think before \nthey move forward on the resolution.\n  In closing, I thank the majority leader. He is keeping his word that \nhe gave to the people of the State of Nevada, and the people of the \nState of Nevada say thank you to the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5529-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MRS. KATHY IRELAND\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, since age 17 Mrs. Kathy Ireland has been \nblessed to have assembled an illustrious career as an actress, \nsupermodel, and vocalist. Her numerous talents have afforded her the \nopportunity to be regularly featured on the covers of such prestigious \nmagazines as Cosmopolitan, People, Glamour, McCalls, and Redbook. \nLikewise, her inherent capabilities have provided her with the good \nfortune to appear as a special guest on nationally renowned television \nprograms such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Today Show, Oprah, \nEntertainment Tonight, and Access Hollywood. This abundance of \naccolades has established Mrs. Ireland as a public figure of world-wide \nfame and recognition.\n  My purpose here today is not to recognize Mrs. Ireland for her \nextreme number of personal achievements, impressive as they are, but \nrather to expand on the manner in which she uses the fame and \nrecognition gained from such accomplishments as a medium by which to \nmake charitable contributions to our local and national communities. As \nI will bring to your attention in the next few minutes, Mrs. Ireland's \npersonal accomplishments pale in comparison to the number of ways in \nwhich she gives back to our communities, both local and Nation wide.\n  I was made aware of Mrs. Ireland's benevolent character just \nrecently, as it was brought to my attention that she was responsible \nfor sending an eighteen wheeler filled with enough food to feed 1600 \nneedy families for two weeks to Monroe County in my home State of \nMississippi. This is the second consecutive year Mrs. Ireland has sent \nthe Holiday Food Truck to aid Mississippians in need. In 2000, the \ntruck was dispersed to the northwest region of Mississippi, also known \nas the Mississippi Delta. A philanthropic concert entitled ``Stars Over \nMississippi'' is held biannually for the purpose of raising funds to be \nallocated towards increasing the educational opportunities available to \nthe children of Mississippi. Mrs. Ireland has further benefitted my \nState by selflessly devoting her time to perform in many of these \nconcerts. Mrs. Ireland has also asserted herself as a benevolent \nbenefactress of the state of Mississippi, by donating many thousands of \ndollars worth of children's furniture, on behalf of Mary and Sam \nHaskell, to Sela Ward's Hope Village Orphanage located in Meridian, MS.\n  It should be duly noted that Mrs. Ireland's generosity, patronage, \nand charity is not limited to benefitting communities located in my \nhome State of Mississippi. Examples of Mrs. Ireland's commitment to \ncommunity service on a national scale include currently serving as \nAmbassador of both Women's Health Issues and the National Women's \nCancer Research Alliance on behalf of the Entertainment Industry \nFoundation.

Madam President, today I rise to salute Stephen Matthew \nNalley from Starkville, MS, for his outstanding achievement in this \nyear's national spelling bee. Stephen finished in second place after \nspelling words such as ``altricial,'' ``muliebral'' and ``sericeous.'' \nHe endured ten rounds, defeating 248 other spellers between the ages of \n9 through 15.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal started the national spelling bee in \n1925 with only 9 contestants. Scripps Howard News Service assumed \nsponsorship in 1941. This year Steven and 249 other participants helped \ncelebrate the 75th Annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee held \nhere in Washington, D.C.\n  Steven was born with a particular type of autism that impairs social \ninteraction and contributes to repetitive behavior patterns. \nFortunately, he has been able to work with his disability and use it to \nhis advantage. Quoting his mother, Barbara Nalley, ``He's mildly \nautistic, but he's channeled that into his spelling.''\n  Steven's accomplishment serves as a reminder to us all that we can \naccomplish astonishing things when we are willing to put in great time \nand effort for them. Steven's approach to adversity is to not back \ndown, but rather to fight until he has conquered all obstacles and \nachieved his objective. I find this attribute of his remarkably \ninspiring.\n  Not only am I highly impressed with Steven's workmanship as an \noutstanding speller, but he also is a straight A student and a member \nof his school's honor society. He exemplifies a hard working young man \nand is a great asset for Mississippi.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Steven on his \ntremendous accomplishment and wishing him the best in all of his future \nendeavors. Congratulations, Steven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5529-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5529-S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we approach Flag Day tomorrow, I \nthought it worthwhile to reflect on the innate patriotism of so many \nAmericans. Justice Brennan wrote, ``We can imagine no more appropriate \nresponse to burning a flag than waving one's own.'' That is exactly how \nthe American people respond.\n  Immediately following September 11, Americans all around the country \nbegan to fly flags outside their homes and businesses, to wear flag \npins on their lapels, and to place flag stickers on their automobiles. \nThis surge in patriotism over the past 9 months has made American flags \nsuch a hot commodity that several major flag manufacturers cannot keep \nflags stocked on store shelves. Within one week of the attacks, demand \nfor American flags was 20 times higher than is typical for that time of \nyear, according to the National Flag Foundation in Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. During that same week, Wal-Mart sold 450,000 flags. \nWithin days of the bombing, K-mart sold 200,000 flags.\n  This expression of national pride was spontaneous, and consisted of \nindividual Americans taking conscious acts of patriotism. No one in the \ngovernment decreed that Americans must purchase and fly flags. There \nwas no official direction stating that Americans should wear clothing \nand accessories with flag designs, but these have been wildly popular \nas well.\n  Supporters of S.J. Res. 7, a constitutional amendment to prohibit \nflag desecration, believe that Americans need a lesson in how to \nrespect the flag. I disagree, and I believe that the American people \nhave proven these Senators wrong.\n  At the height of World War II, in the case of West Virginia State \nBoard of Education v. Barnette, Justice Jackson wrote, ``To believe \nthat patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nvoluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an \nunflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free \nminds.'' Patriotism is flourishing in ways that no one could have \npredicted. Americans are rallying around the flag in a voluntary show \nof strength that demonstrates America's commitment to freedom and \nliberty.\n  Respect cannot be coerced or compelled. It can only be given \nvoluntarily. Some may find it more comfortable to silence dissenting \nvoices, but coerced silence can only create resentment, disrespect, and \ndisunity. You don't stamp out a bad idea by repressing it; you stamp it \nout with a better idea.\n  My better idea is to fly the flag, not because the law tells me to; \nnot because there is something that says this is what I have to do to \nshow respect; I do it because, as an American, I want to. That is why \nthe American flag has always flown at the Leahy home. The extraordinary \ndisplay of patriotism we have witnessed over the past 9 months is \nevidence that the American public agrees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5530-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 6, \n2000 in Placer County, CA. A 37-year-old African American woman was \nattacked at a roadside rest stop. The perpetrators, two men, were \nhiding in a restroom stall when they attacked, bound and gagged the \nvictim with duct tape, sexually assaulted her, and wrote racial slurs \nall over her body. Police investigated the assault as a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5530-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN BURMA?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, leave it to the repressive generals \nin Rangoon to miss an opportunity to secure peace and reconciliation in \nBurma. I am referring to today's BBC article entitled ``Burma Renews \nSuu Kyi Isolation.''\n  I want to be very clear to the repressive State Peace and Development \nCouncil (SPDC), the Administration, and the international community--\nparticularly Japan--that the level of engagement with the hard liners \nin Rangoon should be conditioned on concrete, political progress \nfollowing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release. Intimidating and punishing \nany Burmese who meets with democracy leader Suu Kyi--as has already \noccurred--or continuing to restrict her movements is wholly \nunacceptable and must not be tolerated.\n  The State Department made a grave mistake in allowing a Burmese \ncolonel to visit Washington last month. The regime exploited this \nmistake when it touted in a press statement: ``This was our first \nconversation at this level with American authorities since 1988.'' We \nshould not allow an illegal military junta to spin our intentions--or \nour policy.\n  It is my expectation that the junta will allow Suu Kyi and the \nNational League for Democracy to conclude its assessment of Burma's \nhumanitarian needs before moving forward on any new programs or \ninitiatives. Restricting Suu Kyi's access to U.N. offices in Rangoon \nserves no logical purpose.\n  Those of us who have long championed freedom and democracy for the \npeople of Burma must be vigilant in the days, weeks, and months ahead. \nIt is premature for the Washington--or any other foreign capital--to be \nconsidering ``rewards'' for the SPDC: 1,500 political prisoners have \nyet to be released; forced labor continues unabated; ethnic \nnationalities suffer horrific human rights abuses; and, dialogue \nbetween the NLD and the regime has not resumed.\n  The State Department would be wise to withhold requests to Congress \nfor expanding narcotics cooperation with the Burmese--including the use \nof training facilities in Thailand--lest they be guilty of premature \njubilation in Burma.\n  As I wrote to President Bush last month, the SPDC should be judged \nnot by what they say, but rather by what they do. It does not look like \nthe tiger in Burma has changed its stripes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5530-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE DEATH OF S.SGT. ANISSA A. SHERO IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, for many generations, the people of \nWest Virginia have distinguished themselves by their willingness to \nserve their country in the armed forces. West Virginians understand the \ncost of freedom and have always been willing to pay it when called. \nToday, we are reminded again just how great that cost can be, as we \nmourn the loss of Air Force Staff Sgt. Anissa A. Shero, of Grafton, WV, \nwho died in a tragic airplane crash near the town of Gardez, \nAfghanistan.\n  Sgt. Shero was a volunteer, who chose to serve her country in the \nface of grave danger. When terrorists struck, she left behind the \nmountains of West Virginia for the mountains of Afghanistan, to risk \nher life so that we might live ours in freedom and safety. She was part \nof an extraordinarily successful effort to crush the Taliban, disrupt \nand demoralize al-Qaida, and free the people of Afghanistan from two \ndecades of war and despotism. Men and women in both nations are safer \nnow because of her work, and all of us who value freedom owe Sgt. Shero \na profound debt of gratitude and honor. I know that the thoughts and \nprayers of many people are, like mine, with her family and her friends \ntonight.\n  Like the two service members who died with her, and the 37 others \nkilled in Afghanistan during this war, including West Virginian Sgt. \nGene Vance, Jr., Sgt. Shero bravely did her duty as an American. Now, \nlet us pledge to do ours in her honor. Let us remember always, \nincluding on the floor of this Senate Chamber, that wars are about \npeople, and freedom, and lives. Let us make certain that our armed \nforces have the tools they need to meet any foe, any where, any time. \nAnd let us treasure the freedoms we enjoy as Americans and give thanks \nfor the service members who fight to protect them.\n  Sgt. Shero represented the best of West Virginia and the best of \nAmerica. She was strong, courageous, and dedicated. She will forever \nserve as a role model for West Virginians, men and women alike, who \nloved their country and who, like her, know our ideals are worth \nfighting for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5530-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5530-S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE ABM TREATY\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to acknowledge the fact that today, \n6 months after President Bush announced the U.S. intention to withdraw \nfrom the ABM Treaty, the Treaty lapses. The 30-year old treaty, which \nmost consider to be the cornerstone of arms control, now no longer \nexists.\n  The significance of today has gone largely unnoticed. Press coverage \nhas been minimal so most American will likely not realize what happens \ntoday. The objections of Russia and China to the withdrawal have been \nmuted. Our European allies have reluctantly accepted the withdrawal. \nSome would say that this lack of fanfare proves that the ABM Treaty was \na relic of the cold war and needed to be renounced. I would argue that \nwhile today's withdrawal seems insignificant at this moment, it has \nprofound implications for the future.\n  When President Bush announced his intention to withdraw from the \ntreaty, he stated: ``I have conclude the ABM Treaty hinders our \ngovernment's ability to develop ways to protect our people from future \nterrorist or rogue-state missile attacks.'' I would argue that this \nstatement is incorrect. First, the greatest threat from terrorists is \nnot from a long range missile but from methods we have witnessed and \nwatched for since September 11 conventional transportation like planes \nand cargo ships, used as weapons.\n  Secondly, any testing of missile defenses that could be planned for \nthe\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\nnext several years would not violate the ABM Treaty. We simply do not \nhave the technology yet to test a system in violation of the treaty. An \narticle in today's New York Times states that on Saturday, ground will \nbe broken for a missile test site in Fort Greely Alaska. The article \nstates that this test site would violate the treaty. That is not \ncorrect. Under Article IV of the ABM treaty and paragraph 5 of a 1978 \nagreed statement, the U.S. simply has to notify Russia of U.S. intent \nto build another test range. As a matter fact, the fiscal year 2002 \nDefense authorization act authorized the funding for the Alaska test \nbed prior to the President's announcement to withdraw from the treaty. \nAs a supporter of the ABM Treaty and a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I can assure you that Congress clearly had no \nintent to authorize an action that would violate the treaty. The \ntechnologies which would indeed violate the ABM Treaty, sea-based and \nspace-based systems, are mere concepts that are years away from \nconstituting an action that would violate the treaty. In sum, despite \nthe claims of the President, there was no compelling reason to withdraw \nat this time.\n  In addition, today, the United States becomes the first nation since \nWorld War II to withdraw from a major international security agreement. \nIn the past 50 years only one other nation has attempted such an \naction. In 1993 North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty which caused an international \ncrisis until North Korea reconsidered. The U.S. withdrawal has not \ncaused an international crisis, but it does send a subtle signal. If \nthe U.S. can withdraw from a treaty at any time without compelling \nreasons, what is to stop Russia or China from withdrawing from an \nagreement? Furthermore, what basis would the U.S. have for objecting to \nsuch a withdrawal since our nation began the trend? This administration \nmust keep in mind that other nations can also take unilateral actions, \nbut we might not be as comfortable with those decisions. Indeed, as we \nseek to eliminate the threat of weapons of mass destruction, this \nwithdrawal sends the opposite signal.\n  As I mentioned before, the ABM treaty was the cornerstone of arms \ncontrol. With the cornerstone gone, there are worries about an increase \nin nuclear proliferation. As Joseph Cirincione said, ``No matter what \nsome people may tell you, each side's nuclear force is based primarily \non the calculation of the other side's force.'' If China believes its \nforce could be defeated by a U.S. missile shield, China may decide it \nis in its best interest to increase the number of weapons in its \narsenal to overwhelm the shield. If China increases its nuclear missile \nproduction, neighboring rival India may find it necessary to \nrecalculate the size of its force. Of course, Pakistan would then \nincrease its inventory to match India. So, while there seems to be \nlittle consequence to cessation of the ABM Treaty today, if we are not \ncareful it could be the spark of a new arms race.\n  As of today, the ABM Treaty no longer exists. But our work has just \nbegun. Withdrawing from this treaty dictates that we redouble our \nefforts on other nonproliferation and arms control agreements. Since \nSeptember 11, every American has become acutely aware of the need to \neliminate and secure nuclear materials so that they do not become the \nweapon of a terrorist. The only way we will not regret today's action \nis to prove by future actions that the U.S. is truly committed to arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation. The United States should robustly fund \nCooperative Threat Reduction programs. The United States should pursue \nfurther negotiations with the Russians and agree to actually dismantle \nsome weapons rather simply place them in storage. The United States \nshould also ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  In his withdrawal announcement last December 13, President Bush said, \n``This is not a day for looking back, but a day for looking forward . . \n. '' I agree. We cannot look back to a treaty that no longer exists, \nbut we must work diligently from this day forward to ensure that the \nUnited States is taking the steps necessary to maintain the peace and \nsecurity once sustained by the ABM Treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5531-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      APPRECIATION FOR LENEICE WU\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to extend the appreciation of the Senate to a devoted \npublic servant at the Congressional Research Service. Leneice Wu is \nretiring from CRS after 34 years of service to the United States \nCongress, a period spanning 17 Congresses and the tenures of eight \nPresidents. Only five sitting members of the Senate and three Members \nof the House of Representatives have longer terms of service to the \nNation. This length of service is not only a credit to Ms. Wu, but also \na demonstration of the dedication that the staff of the Congressional \nResearch Service bring in their support of our work in Congress.\n  After graduating from Mary Washington College in 1968, Ms. Wu began \nher career with the Library of Congress as a research assistant, and is \nnow concluding it as the CRS Deputy Assistant Director of the Foreign \nAffairs, Defense and Trade Division. During her decades of service, Ms. \nWu has provided research and analytical support to Members of Congress \non a broad range of international relations issues, with a particular \nfocus upon the difficult challenges of arms control. The Strategic Arms \nLimitation Talks, START, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear non-\nproliferation, and chemical-biological arms control are but a few of \nthe areas in which she has assisted Congress. A list of her reports and \nanalytical memoranda to Congress would run several pages, but a brief \nsurvey finds: Congress and the Termination of the Vietnam War, Nuclear \nProliferation: Future U.S. Foreign Policy Implications, Congress and \nArms Control Policy, and U.S. Foreign Military Sales Legislation. Ms. \nWu also coordinated and contributed to the eight-part Fundamentals of \nNuclear Arms Control, issued as a Committee Print by the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs. On two occasions, Ms. Wu was detailed to \nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to advise in the preparation of \nArms Control Impact Statements, ensuring attention to congressional \nintent and interests.\n  In addition to her research responsibilities, Ms. Wu has undertaken \nnumerous administrative responsibilities. Prior to her present \nposition, within the Foreign Affairs Division she has served as head of \nthe Central Research Unit, the International Organizations, \nDevelopment, and Security Section, and the Defense Policy and Arms \nControl Section. Following these assignments she moved on to become the \nForeign Affairs Division's Program Coordinator and later Research \nCoordinator. Ms. Wu has also overseen a unique and vital resource to \nthe Congress, CRS's Language Services, which provides foreign language \ntranslations for both Members and Committees. For the Liberty of \nCongress as whole, Ms. Wu has served as a member of the Women's Program \nAdvisory Committee, and as both Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor \nand Officer.\n  Ms. Wu is a fine example of those many staff in this institution who \nwork in virtual anonymity to support the important work of the \nCongress. On behalf of my colleagues, I extend our deep appreciation to \nMs. Wu for her service, and wish her the very best in her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5531-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5531-S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     WE THE PEOPLE: THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION 2002 NATIONAL \n                              COMPETITION\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Madam President, I rise today to pay a proper \ntribute to Nanz & Kraft Florists of Louisville, KY. For over 150 years, \nNanz & Kraft has served Kentuckians, providing them with beautiful and \nmemorable floral arrangements for birthdays, anniversaries, funerals, \nhospital visits and various other occasions. Nanz & Kraft is the single \nlargest florist shop in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and one of the \nbiggest in the entire United States.\n  In 1850, the year Zachary Taylor died and Millard Fillmore became \npresident of the United States, Henry Nanz decided to open a quaint \nlittle flower shop on Fourth Street in downtown Louisville. He \ncultivated his flowers on a one-acre suburban plot and in a 12' x 20' \ngreen house. In 1870, with business thriving, Henry Nanz packed his \nbags and moved the company to 30 acres of land in the St. Matthews area \nowned by a Mr. Charles Neuner. In 1872, Mr. Neuner made the decision to \njoin the profitable company. For the next 82 years, the business was \nknown as Nanz & Neuner.\n  When in 1900 Nanz & Neuner celebrated their 50th anniversary, the St. \nMatthews site contained an astounding 60 greenhouses, a 15-acre \nnursery, and ten acres devoted to roses and other flowers, including \nField Grown Roses, the company's specialty. In 1954, Nanz & Neuner \nofficially became Nanz & Kraft, changing names but retaining the same \nformula for success. Today, Nanz & Kraft's main store is a 20,000 \nsquare foot building. There are three branch stores, and the business \nhas about 125 employees, half full-time and the rest part-time. They \nare open every day of the year except Christmas and make more than 200 \ndeliveries a day. Whether it be a birthday or a first date, Kentuckians \ncan count on Nanz & Neuner to brighten up the occasion.\n  I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in thanking all the men and \nwomen who have worked so hard over the last 152 years to make Nanz & \nKraft one of the most profitable and well-respected floral businesses \nin the United States. Nanz & Kraft truly is a tribute to the American \ncapitalist spirit. They have served the Commonwealth in three different \ncenturies now, through a Civil and two World Wars, and through 21 \ndifferent presidents, and I would just like to pass along my thanks and \nadmiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5532-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5532-S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 2002 NATIONAL MEDAL OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROFESSOR JERRY M. WOODALL OF \n                            YALE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to express my \nheartfelt congratulations to a Connecticut resident, Professor Jerry M. \nWoodall of Yale University, for being awarded the 2002 National Medal \nof Technology, our country's highest honor celebrating America's \nleading innovators. This represents the first time that a professor \nfrom Yale has ever achieved this extraordinary recognition, and it \nserves to underscore Yale's deep and renewed commitment to establishing \nitself as one of the world's premier engineering institutions.\n  I cannot imagine another person for whom this prestigious award is \nmore richly deserved. Professor Woodall, who holds the position of C. \nBaldwin Sawyer Professor of Electrical Engineering at Yale, has \nconducted pioneering research in compound semiconductor materials and \ndevices over a career spanning four decades. Fully half of the entire \nworld's annual sales of compound semiconductor components are made \npossible by his research legacy. He invented electronic and \noptoelectronic devices seen ubiquitously in modern life, including the \nred LEDs used in indicators and stoplights, the infrared LED used in CD \nplayers, TV remote controls and computer networks, the high speed \ntransistors used in cell phones and satellites, and the weight-\nefficient solar cell.\n  Professor Woodall spent most of the early and mid parts of his career \nat the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where he rose to the \ncoveted rank of IBM Fellow. He built the first high purity single \ncrystals of gallium arsenide there, enabling the first definitive \nmeasurements of carrier velocity versus electric field relationships, \nas well as GaAs crystals used for the first non-supercooled injection \nlaser. He and Hans Ruprecht pioneered the liquid-phase epitaxial growth \nof both Si doped GaAs used for high efficiency IR LEDs, and gallium \naluminum arsenide (GaAlAs), which led to his most important research \ncontribution so far the first working heterojunction. They built it \nfrom gallium aluminum arsenide mated to gallium arsenide (GaAlAs/GaAs), \nand it remains the world's most important compound semiconductor \nheterojunction.\n  He then invented and patented many important commercial high-speed \nelectronic and photonic devices which depend on the heterojunction, \nincluding bright red LEDs and the two classes of ultra-fast \ntransistors, called the heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) and \npseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (pHEMT). Many new areas \nof solid-state physics have evolved and been realized as a result of \nhis work, including the semiconductor superlattice, low-dimensional \nsystems, mesoscopics, and resonant tunneling.\n  Professor Woodall was elected to the National Academy of Engineering \nin 1989 and is a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), the \nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the \nElectrochemical Society (ECS), and AVS. He has served as president of \nthe ECS and AVS, and on the board and executive committee of the \nAmerican Institute of Physics (AIP). He has published 315 publications \nin the open literature and been issued 67 U.S. patents. He received \nfive major IBM Research Division Awards, 30 IBM Invention Achievement \nAwards, and an\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nIBM Corporate Award in 1992 for the invention of the GaAlAs/GaAs \nheterojunction. Other recognition includes a 1975 Industrial Research \n100 Award; the 1980 Electronics Division Award of the Electrochemical \nSociety (ECS); the 1984 IEEE Jack A. Morton Award; the 1985 ECS Solid \nState Science and Technology Award; the 1988 Heinrich Welker Gold Medal \nand International GaAs Symposium Award; the 1990 American Vacuum \nSociety's (AVS) Medard Welch Award, its highest honor; the 1997 Eta \nKappa Nu Vladimir Karapetoff Eminent Members' Award; the 1998 American \nSociety for Engineering Education's General Electric Senior Research \nAward; and the 1998 ECS Edward Goodrich Acheson Award, its highest \nhonor.\n  Woodall co-founded LightSpin Technologies, Inc., a high technology \nstartup company, and serves as its Chief Science Officer. From 1993 \nthrough 1999, he held the Charles William Harrison Distinguished \nProfessorship of Microelectronics at Purdue University. He earned a \nPh.D. in electrical engineering from Cornell University and a B.S. in \nmetallurgy from MIT.\n  I speak with utmost sincerity in expressing my gratitude to Professor \nWoodall for the lifetime of contributions or, more accurately, several \nlifetimes' worth of contributions that he has rendered in service to \nour nation in enabling it to become the world leader in technology and \nresearch. Our lives and our society would be dramatically different \ntoday had we not benefitted from Professor Woodall's drive and genius, \nand it fills me with exceptional pride to see him recognized for his \nefforts. Outstanding technologists such as he create to the tools to \nfully realize human and societal potential, and by having someone as \naccomplished as Professor Woodall on its faculty, both Connecticut and \nYale University will be well-situated to produce the next generation of \nengineering lights. On behalf of your state and your country, Professor \nWoodall, please accept my deepest congratulations and thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5533-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM EAST CENTRAL OREGON (CAPECO)\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to commend \nmy friends at the Community Action Program East Central Oregon, CAPECO. \nCAPECO was formed in October 1987 to support the economic development \nefforts of Morrow, Umatilla, Gilliam, and Wheeler Counties through its \nworker training services.\n  Located in my home town of Pendleton, OR, CAPECO works with the \nOregon Workforce Alliance to offer employment and training services to \nemployers and citizens of Morrow and Umatilla counties. CAPECO is an \nactive Work-Links partner, offering services to help job seekers, \nworkers, and employers. The Program has been active since the inception \nof the Workforce Investment Act and has been a tremendous help to \nhundreds of displaced workers trying to get back on their feet.\n  This important program not only provides up to fifty percent of \ndisplaced workers' wages, but it offers skill assessments and \nretraining, and help with job applications, interviewing techniques, \nand stress management.\n  I have heard from many constituents about how important this service \nhas been in getting back to work or gaining skills for a new job. Ms. \nMary Paige Rose recently contacted me to tell me how CAPECO changed her \ncareer. Ms. Rose writes: ``I was classified as a displaced worker by \nOregon's Employment Department. They directed me to go to CAPECO and \nattend their classes called Choices and Options. This class was \ninstructed by Mary Kinsch who became my work force counselor and \nconfident. In less than a year, I have opened my own business due to \nthe services I received from CAPECO . . . When I was fired from my \naccount executive sales position . . . it devastated me. I had never \nbeen fired before and never had needed to use these types of social \nservices. I am forever grateful for CAPECO and for the Oregon \nEmployment Department for assisting me. I would not be where I am today \nwithout the aid. . . . With the help of programs like CAPECO, I am not \na liability to Umatilla County or the State of Oregon, I am an asset. I \nappreciate all the help that Mary Kinsch and CAPECO were able to give \nme through the Workforce Investment Act. Please know that programs like \nCAPECO are very needed especially in such a distressed area as Umatilla \nCounty.''\n  Madam President, I am proud of CAPECO's important contribution to the \nOregon economy and proud of constituents like Ms. Rose who have taken \nadvantage of these services and also contributed to job growth in the \nstate. They are a credit to my state of Oregon and to this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5533-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GRANT CHAPEL\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, on June 14, the church family \nof Grant Chapel in Albuquerque celebrates what its pastor describes as \n``one hundred twenty years of God's faithfulness to Grant and to the \ncommunity of Albuquerque.''\n  Organized in 1882 as the ``Colored Methodist Mission,'' it was \nfounded to serve as a place of worship for African American people in \nNew Mexico. A year later, it was one of five churches awarded a plot of \nland by New Mexico Township, Inc., to promote development in \nAlbuquerque. In 1892, it became known as the Coal Avenue Methodist \nChurch and in 1905 it was renamed Grant Chapel to honor Bishop Abram \nGrant of the 5th Episcopal District which included the states and \nterritories in the West.\n  Building and growing are very much part of Grant Chapel's history. \nThe congregation has chosen to change sites over the years, and with \neach move, a new vitality has been infused into the church. Over the \ncourse of its history, some fifty ministers have served here, each \nbuilding on one another's success, and contributing to its importance \nin the community.\n  I am proud to add my voice in praise of the good people--past, \npresent and future--of Grant chapel, and to wish them at least another \nhundred twenty years of prayerful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5533-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5533-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5533-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5533-S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2431.

A bill to protect the rights of American consumers to \ndiagnose, service, and repair motor vehicles purchased in the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Motor \nVehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act of 2002. This legislation would \nprotect the viability of independent service station and repair shops \nand ensure that consumers will continue to have a choice of automotive \nservice providers.\n  The 1990 Clean Air Act mandated that vehicle manufacturers install \ncomputer systems to monitor emissions in 1994 model year cars and \nbeyond. Today, many vehicle systems are integrated into the car's \ncomputer system, making auto repair an increasingly ``high tech'' \nbusiness and making access to the computer and the information it \ncontains vital to the ability to perform repairs.\n  Increasingly, however, independent repair shops are being barred \naccess to the codes and diagnostic tools necessary to repair newer \nmodel cars. The effect is to reduce consumer choice for auto repair \nservices, and to endanger the livelihood thousands of small, family \nowned repair shops across the country.\n  On April 10, I met with a group of repair shop owners from Minnesota. \nThe explained that new practices by some auto manufactures were \npreventing them from competing on an even playing field. One thing we \ndon't need is another industry where all the little guys, the small, \nindependent businesses, are driven out. This is terrible for our \ncommunities. And reduced competition means higher prices for consumers\n  Specifically, the Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act would \nsimply require a manufacturer of a motor vehicle sold in the United \nStates to disclose to the vehicle owner, a repair facility, and the \nFederal Trade Commission, FTC, the information necessary to diagnose, \nservice, or repair the vehicle. The bill bars the FTC from requiring \ndisclosure of any information entitled to protection as a \nmanufacturer's trade secret.\n  This legislation is an example of what is good for small business is \ngood for the consumer. The bill is endorsed by the 44 million member \nAmerican Automobile Association, AAA, as well as the Automotive Service \nAssociation, the trade association of automotive service professionals.\n  To reiterate, I want to introduce a bill and tell colleagues about \nit. I have sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter. This is very much a \npro-consumer bill as well. It is called the Motor Vehicle and Owners \nRight to Repair Act. There has to be a better title.\n  Basically, this is the issue. The automotive industry, for 100 years, \nhas always shared information with mechanics. But post-1994, you have \ncars with very computerized systems. All of a sudden, the automotive \nindustry is now saying to independent mechanics, we will not share with \nyou the information about the computer system so you can get into the \ncomputer system, do the diagnosis and the repair, in which case I think \nit is a blatant anticompetitive practice.\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n  It puts the independent mechanics, the small guys, out of business. \nIn addition, it says to the consumers: Listen, you might want to take \nyour car back to the dealership for repair, but now that is your only \nchoice because you may want to go to the neighborhood mechanic you have \nworked with for years and he might want your business, but we are going \nto make it impossible for him to get your business. We are going to \nmake it impossible for you to go there.\n  I like this piece of legislation because it is little guy versus big \nguy. It feels right to me. At 5 feet, 5 inches, I like the little guys.\n  In April, some mechanics came by our office and talked with Perry \nLang, who works with me, and they said this is happening to us and \nasked for some help.\n  I say on the floor of the Senate two things: No. 1, I am circulating \na ``Dear Colleague'' letter. I hope to get a lot of support. I think \nthere will be a lot of support.\n  This is going on in the House with a lot of Republicans as well as \nDemocrats.\n  The second thing that I am saying to the industry today on the floor \nof the Senate--and I think they are watching this carefully--is we are \ngoing to get a good head of steam on this. If you want to sit down and \nnegotiate an agreement with the mechanics that is fair to these \nindependent mechanics, go ahead. Then we won't have to pass the \nlegislation. But I could not believe when I heard the report of what \nthey are dealing with.\n  Again, you have a blatant anticompetitive practice of the industry \nbasically saying we will not share with you any information about our \ncomputerized systems. If the industry wants to say there is some kind \nof a trade patent secret which they can't share, they can go to the FTC \nand get approval for that. Otherwise, for 100 years, this has not \nhappened. Now we get into a blatant collusion, anticompetitive practice \nthat is unfair to the independent mechanics who a lot of Senators know \nas friends and as small businesspeople. I am aiming to stop it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2619. A bill to provide for the analysis of the incidence and \neffects of prison rape in Federal, State, and local institutions and to \nprovide information, resources, recommendations, and funding to protect \nindividuals from prison rape; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as the Supreme Court has made clear, \n``being violently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty \nthat criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.'' \nGovernment officials have a duty under the Constitution to prevent \nprison violence.\n  Too often, however, officials fail to take obvious steps to protect \nvulnerable inmates. Prison rape is a serious problem in our Nation's \nprisons, jails, and detention facilities. Of the two million prisoners \nin the United States, it is conservatively estimated that one in ten \nhas been raped. According to a 1996 study, 22 percent of prisoners in \nNebraska had been pressured or forced to have sex against their will \nwhile incarcerated. Human Rights Watch recently reported, ``shockingly \nhigh rates of sexual abuse'' in U.S. prisons.\n  Prison rape causes severe physical and psychological pain to its \nvictims. It also leads to the increased transmission of HIV, hepatitis, \nand other diseases. The brutalization in prison also makes it more \nlikely that prisoners will commit crimes after they are released, as \n600,000 prisoners are each year.\n  To deal with this serious problem, Senator Sessions  and I are today \nintroducing the Prison Rape Reduction Act of 2002. This bipartisan \nlegislation is intended to address the prison-rape epidemic in an \neffective and comprehensive manner, while still respecting the primary \nrole of States and local governments in administering prisons and \njails.\n  Our bill directs the Department of Justice to conduct an annual \nstatistical review and analysis of the frequency and effects of prison \nrape. It establishes a special panel to conduct hearings on prison \nsystems, prisons, and jails where the incidence of rape is high. It \ndirects the Attorney General to collect complaints of rape from \ninmates, transmit them to the appropriate authorities, and review how \nthe authorities respond. It also directs the Attorney General to \nprovide information, assistance, and training to Federal, State, and \nlocal authorities on the prevention, investigation, and punishment of \nprison rape.\n  Our bill also authorizes $40 million in grants to enhance the \nprevention, investigation, and punishment of prison rape. These grants \nwill strengthen the ability of state and local officials to prevent \nthese abuses.\n  Finally, our bill establishes a commission that will conduct hearings \nover two years and recommend national correctional standards on a wide \nrange of issues, including inmate classification, investigation of rape \ncomplaints, trauma case for rape victims, disease prevention, and staff \ntraining. These standards should apply as soon as possible to the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons. Prison accreditation organizations that \nreceive Federal funding should also adopt the standards. States should \nadopt the standards too. If they ``opt out'' by passing a statute, they \nwill suffer no penalty, but States that fail to act at all will lose 20 \npercent of their prison-related federal funding.\n  Our bill is supported by a broad coalition of religious, civil \nrights, and human rights organizations, including the Salvation Army, \nthe Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association of \nEvangelicals, Prison Fellowship, Focus on the Family, the Presbyterian \nChurch, the Justice Policy Institute, the Sentencing Project, Youth Law \nCenter, Human Rights Watch, the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, and the National Council of La Raza. \nTogether, these diverse groups have demonstrated impressive moral \nleadership on this issue.\n  It is a privilege to work on this legislation with Congressmen Frank \nWolf and Bobby Scott in the House and Senator Sessions in the Senate. \nWhile we may disagree on other issues relating to criminal justice, we \nall recognize that rape is unacceptable, and it is long past time to \nend it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to commend Senator Kennedy for \nhis leadership on the important issue of reducing prison rape. I have \nenjoyed working with him to craft and refine the legislation that we \nare introducing today, the Prison Rape Reduction Act of 2002. Though \nSenator Kennedy and I come from different backgrounds and have \ndifferent political philosophies, we both agree that Congress should \nact to reduce prison rape.\n  I would also like to thank Congressman Frank Wolf and Bobby Scott for \ntheir important leadership on this bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. Congressman Wolf is a recognized champion for human \ndignity across the globe and this legislation to reduce prison rape is \nconsistent with his philosophy. Congressman Scott is very knowledgeable \non criminal law issues. While he and I have agreed and disagreed on \nmany issues over the years, we agree on the need to reduce prison rape.\n  As a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and as Attorney General of \nAlabama, I sent many guilty criminals to prison where they belong. I \nbelieved that they should be treated fairly in court, and I treated \nthem fairly. I also believe that they should be treated fairly in \nprison. Most prison wardens and sheriffs are outstanding public \nservants that do an excellent job of supervising inmates, and I commend \nmy friends in the law enforcement community for their hard work in this \narea.\n  However, knowingly subjecting a prisoner to rape is cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. Some studies have estimated that over 10 percent of the inmates \nin certain prisons are subject to rape. I hope that this statistic is \nan exaggeration. Nonetheless, it is the duty of Government officials to \nensure that criminals who are convicted and sentenced to prison serve \nthe sentence imposed by the judge and rape is not a part of any lawful \nsentence.\n  This bill responds to the problem of rape of prison inmates in three \nprincipal ways. First, the bill establishes a bipartisan National \nCommission that will study prison rape at the federal, state, and local \nlevels. Within 2 years, the commission will publish the results\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nof its study and make recommendations on how to reduce prison rape.\n  Second, the bill directs the Attorney General to issue a rule for the \nreduction of prison rape in Federal prisons. To avoid a 20 percent \nreduction in certain Federal funds, each State will have to pass a \nstatute that either adopts or rejects the standards for State prisons. \nThis bill contains no unfunded mandate to order States how to deal with \nprison rape. It does, however, require that they address the issue.\n  Third, the bill will require the Department of Justice to conduct \nstatistical surveys on prison rape for Federal, State, and local \nprisons and jails. Further, the Department of Justice will select \nofficials in charge of certain prisons with an incidence of prison rape \nexceeding the national average by 30 percent to come to Washington and \ntestify to the Department about the prison rape problem in their \ninstitution. If they refuse to testify, the prison will lose 20 percent \nof certain Federal funds.\n  In addition, the bill provides for $40 million in grants to States \nfor prevention, investigation, and prosecution of prison rape. This \nwill help the States to reduce repeat offenses by inmates.\n  A broad and bipartisan array of organizations and individuals have \nadded their support to this bill. The list includes: American \nPsychological Association; American Values; Biblical Witness \nFellowship, UCC; Camp Fire USA; Center for Religious Freedom, Freedom \nHouse; Christian Rescue Committee; Citizens United for Rehabilitation \nof Errants--Virginia, Inc. (Virginia CURE); Disciple Renewal; Focus on \nthe Family; Mary Ann Glendon, Learned Hand Professor of Law, Harvard \nLaw School; Good News, UMC; Human Rights Watch; Human Rights and the \nDrug War; Institute on Religion and Democracy; Justice Policy \nInstitute; Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs; National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People; National Association \nof Evangelicals; National Association of School Psychologists; National \nCenter on Institutions and Alternatives; National Council for La Raza; \nNational Network for Youth; National Mental Health Association; Marvin \nOlasky, Editor--World Magazine; Partnership for Responsible Drug \nInformation; Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); Prison Fellowship; Religious \nAction Center of Reform Judaism; Renew Network; Research and Policy \nReform, Inc.; Salvation Army; The Sentencing Project; Southern Baptist \nConvention; Stop Prison Rape; Unitarian Universalists for Juvenile \nJustice; Volunteers of America; and Youth Law Center.\n\n  I am especially proud of the evangelical Christian groups for their \nwork in gathering support for the bill. They have worked tirelessly for \nethics and compassion in government, and this legislation reflects \nthose values.\n  I would also like to thank Linda Chavez and Mike Horowitz for the \nideas that started this legislative initiative. Well-conceived, \ncarefully crafted ideas drive many legislative and political \ninitiatives that become law after people work together to form a \nbipartisan, moral position.\n  I also want to commend the hard work of Bill Pryor, the attorney \ngeneral of Alabama, who will end up dealing with the effects of this \nlegislation at the state level. Bill has worked with Prison Fellowship, \nhas talked with Alabama prison officials, and has worked with me on \nthis legislation. In addition to being an outstanding legal scholar and \nleader among all the States' attorneys general, Bill cares about people \nand demands fairness in how the State treats both victims and \nprisoners. I was very pleased that Attorney General Pryor joined us at \nthe press conference to express his support of the bill.\n  This bill will address prison rape, not through unfunded mandates and \nlawsuits, but through examining the problem and allowing sunshine to \nexpose deficiencies that need to be addressed. This bill is a necessary \nstep to reform and a bipartisan step toward justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Biden);\n  S. 2621. A bill to provide a definition of vehicle for purposes of \ncriminal penalties relating to terrorist attacks and other acts of \nviolence against mass transportation systems; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise to introduce legislation today \nwith Senator Biden to clarify that an airplane is a vehicle for \npurposes of terrorist and other violent acts against mass \ntransportation systems. A significant question about this point has \nbeen raised in an important criminal case and deserves our prompt \nattention.\n  Earlier this week, on June 11, 2002, a U.S. District Judge in Boston \ndismissed one of the nine charges against Richard Reid stemming from \nhis alleged attempt to detonate an explosive device in his shoe while \nonboard an international flight from Paris to Miami on December 22, \n2001. The dismissed count charged defendant Reid with violating section \n1993 of title 18, United States Code, by attempting to ``wreck, set \nfire to, and disable a mass transportation vehicle.''\n  Section 1993 is a new criminal law that was added, as section 801, to \nthe USA PATRIOT Act to punish terrorist attacks and other acts of \nviolence against, inter alia, a ``mass transportation'' vehicle or \nferry, or against a passenger or employee of a mass transportation \nprovider. I had urged that this provision be included in the final \nanti-terrorism law considered by the Congress. A similar provision was \noriginally part of S. 2783, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and \nPublic Safety Act,'' that I introduced in the last Congress in June, \n2000 on the request of the Clinton Administration.\n  The district court rejected defendant Reid's arguments to dismiss the \nsection 1993 charge on grounds that 1. the penalty provision does not \napply to an ``attempt'' and 2. an airplane is not engaged in ``mass \ntransportation.'' ``Mass transportation'' is defined in section 1993 by \nreference to the ``the meaning given to that term in section 5302(a)(7) \nof title 49, U.S.C., except that the term shall include schoolbus, \ncharter and sightseeing transportation.'' Section 5302(a)(7), in turn, \nprovides the following definition: ``mass transportation'' means \ntransportation by a conveyance that provides regular and continuing \ngeneral or special transportation to the public, but does not include \nschool bus, charter or sightseeing transportation.'' The court \nexplained that ``commercial aircraft transport large numbers of people \nevery day'' and that the definition of ``mass transportation'' ``when \nread in an ordinary or natural way, encompasses aircraft of the kind at \nissue here.'' U.S. v. Reid, CR No. 02-10013, at p. 10, 12 (D. MA, June \n11, 2002).\n  Defendant Reid also argued that the section 1993 charge should be \ndismissed because an airplane is not a ``vehicle.'' The court agreed, \nciting the fact that the term ``vehicle'' is not defined in section \n1993 and that the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. Sec. 4, narrowly defines \n``vehicle'' to include ``every description of carriage or other \nartificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of \ntransportation on land.'' Emphasis in original opinion. Notwithstanding \ncommon parlance and other court decisions that have interpreted this \nDictionary Act definition to encompass aircraft, the district court \nrelied on the narrow definition to conclude that an aircraft is not a \n``vehicle'' within the meaning of section 1993.\n  The new section 1993 was intended to provide broad federal criminal \njurisdiction over terrorist and violent acts against all mass \ntransportation systems, not only bus services but also commercial \nairplanes, cruise ships, railroads and other forms of transportation \navailable for public carriage. The bill I introduce today would add a \ndefinition of ``vehicle'' to section 1993 and clarify that an airplane \nis a ``vehicle'' both in common parlance and under this new criminal \nlaw to protect mass transportation systems. Specifically, the bill \nwould define this term to mean ``any carriage or other contrivance \nused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on land, \nwater or through the air.''\n  I urge the Senate to act promptly and pass this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION.\n\n       Section 1993(c) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\n       (1) in paragraph (7), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (8), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `vehicle' means any carriage or other \n     contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of \n     transportation on land, water, or through the air.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 2622. A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Joseph A. De Laine in recognition \nof his contributions to the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto present Reverend Joseph A. De Laine the Congressional Gold Medal in \nhonor of his heroic sacrifices to desegregate our public schools. His \ncrusade to break down barriers in education forever scarred his own \nlife, but led to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954.\n  Eight years before Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus, \nRev. De Laine, a minister and principal, organized African-American \nparents to petition the Summerton, SC, school board for a bus and \ngasoline so their children would not have to walk 10 miles to attend a \nsegregated school. A year later, in Briggs v. Elliott, the parents sued \nto end segregation. It was a case that as a young lawyer I watched \nThurgood Marshall argue before the Supreme Court as one of the five \ncases collectively known as Brown v. Board of Education. For this \nSenator, their arguments helped to shape my view on racial matters.\n  For his efforts, Rev. De Laine was subjected to a reign of domestic \nterrorism. He lost his job. He watched his church and home burn. He was \ncharged with assault and battery with intent to kill after shots were \nfired at his home and he fired back to mark the car. He had to leave \nSouth Carolina forever; relocate to New York, where he started an AME \nChurch, and he eventually retired in North Carolina. Not until the year \n2000, 26 years after his death and 45 years after the incident in his \nhome was Rev. De Laine cleared of all charges.\n  Last month, I spoke to the 100 descendants of Briggs v. Elliott, and \nI ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record, which \nshow the bravery of Rev. De Laine during a troubled time in our \nNation's past, and which point to the immeasurable benefits he has \ngiven our Nation.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Briggs v. Elliott Descendants Re-union Banquet, Summerton, South \n                         Carolina, May 11, 2002\n\n       I want to give you an insight into exactly what happened to \n     your parents 50 years ago in Summerton, SC, that led to the \n     desegregation of our Nation's schools by the Supreme Court of \n     the United States.\n       I speak with some trepidation, because right now I can see \n     Harry Briggs' son walking down that dirt road all the way \n     here to Scotts Branch School, and that school bus passing, \n     all for the white children. Yet all your families were asking \n     for was a bus. But they were told: ``you don't pay any taxes, \n     so how can you ask for a bus?'' What they didn't say is you \n     didn't have a job, whereby you could make a living and be \n     able to pay the taxes. They didn't say that.\n       I think of the threats, the burnings, the shooting up of \n     Reverend John De Laine's home. I think about how they turned \n     him into a fugitive. He had to leave his home in South \n     Carolina, never to return. Harry Briggs had to leave his home \n     and go to Florida to earn a living. It's not for me to tell \n     the descendants of the Briggs v. Elliott case how they have \n     suffered.\n       I didn't try this case, don't misunderstand me. My \n     beginnings with Briggs v. Elliott started in 1948 when I was \n     elected to the House of Representatives in Columbia.\n       The previous year James Hinton, the head of the NAACP in \n     the State gave a speech in Columbia. He talked about the need \n     to get separate but equal facilities. He got Rev. De Laine \n     from Summerton in the audience all fired up. Rev. De Laine, \n     who was the principal here, put together a petition signed by \n     20 parents, of 46 children, the Summerton 66.\n       I'll never forget the day after I was sworn into the \n     Legislature the superintendent of schools in Charleston \n     County took me across the Cooper River Bridge, down the \n     Mathis Ferry Road, to the Freedom School, the black school. \n     He said I want to show you what we really do, he used the \n     word at that time, ``for a Negro education.''\n       This was a cold November Day, and we went into a big one-\n     room building. That's all they had, one room, with a pot \n     belly stove in the middle. They had a class in this corner, a \n     class in that back corner, a class up front in this corner, \n     and a class here. Of course, they didn't have any desks, and \n     very few books, and one teacher teaching the four classes.\n       When I went to Columbia I was with a bunch of rebels. I \n     introduced an anti-lynching bill. I had never heard of \n     lynchings down in Charleston, but then they had one. As we \n     debated the bill, a fellow who was the grand dragon of the \n     Klan got up with all these Klansmen in the Gallery, and he \n     mumbled and raised cane. Speaker Blott got some order. But \n     several House members walked out. They said they wouldn't be \n     seated in the Legislature with a fellow like that. We passed \n     the anti-lynching bill.\n       I'm trying to give you this background, so you'll \n     understand the significance of what your parents did. We had \n     just had the case, whereby blacks could participate in the \n     Democratic primary. And we had just given women the right to \n     vote.\n       And in 1949 and 1950, I struggled because there was no \n     money in the state for separate but equal schools, or \n     anything else. I said we ought to put in a 3 percent sales \n     tax to pay for things. Governor Thurmond opposed it, and the \n     senators particularly opposed it. But I made the motion for a \n     one-cent tax on cigarettes; a one-cent tax on gasoline; and a \n     one-cent tax on beer. Beer, cigarettes, and gasoline.\n       We formed a House Committee with six of us to work on it. \n     We worked all summer. It's a long story, but let me cut it \n     and say by December we had it all written. I knew the \n     incoming governor, Governor Byrnes. I felt it would be good \n     to ask him to see if he could help me with this measure.\n       The second week in January, before he was sworn in, he \n     called me and said: ``You've got to come to Columbia, I'm \n     going to include this in my Inaugural address.'' Over \n     time, I made 79 talks on the proposal, until we finally \n     passed the sales tax, which provided some money for \n     separate but equal schools.\n       When the Briggs v. Elliott case came up, before Judge \n     Waring in Charleston, he questioned separate but equal. Then \n     in December 1952, the case went to the Supreme Court. \n     Governor Byrnes had served on the State Supreme Court, and he \n     wanted to make sure we won the case. In my mind, he was \n     absolutely sure that under Chief Justice Vinson the State \n     would win it.\n       But to make sure, he set aside Mr. Bob McC. Figg, who had \n     done all the work, and selected John W. Davis, as the \n     attorney for South Carolina against Thurgood Marshall, who \n     was representing Briggs and the NAACP. Mr. Davis had been the \n     Solicitor General of the United States. He had been the \n     Democratic nominee for president in 1924. He was considered \n     the greatest constitutional mind in the country.\n       The second thing the Governor did was to call me up and \n     say: ``I'm appointing you to go to Washington, because you \n     know intimately this law here that built the schools. You \n     have to go to Washington in case any questions of fact come \n     up.''\n       So we took a train to Washington. We came in at 6 o'clock \n     that morning at Union Station, and we sat down for breakfast. \n     I'll never forget it, because Thurgood Marshall walked in. He \n     and Bob McC. Figg had become real close friends. So he sat \n     down and was eating breakfast with us, and we began swapping \n     stories.\n       Mr. Marshall said ``Bob, you know that black family that \n     moved into that white neighborhood in Cicero, IL. They have \n     so much trouble. There are riots, and everything else going \n     on.'' And he said: ``Don't tell anybody, but I got hold of \n     Governor Adlai Stevenson.'' Stevenson was the governor of \n     Illinois at the time. And he said: ``I sent that family back \n     to Mississippi for safe keeping.'' And Thurgood added, ``for \n     God's sake, don't tell anybody that or it will ruin me.'' I \n     said: ``for God's sake, don't tell anybody I'm eating \n     breakfast with you, or I will never get elected again.''\n       I tell you that story so you can get a feel for 1952, for \n     what it was like 50 years ago.\n       We had wanted Briggs to be the lead case before the Supreme \n     Court. It was one of five cases that they would hear \n     collectively. But soon after our breakfast, we found out that \n     Roy Wilkens from the NAACP had gotten together with the \n     Solicitor General and moved the Kansas case in front of the \n     South Carolina case. Some reports said the reason was because \n     they wanted a northern case. That was not it. There was \n     another case from the State of Delaware, which was just as \n     north as the State of Kansas.\n       Kansas was selected because up until the sixth grade, yes, \n     it was segregated. But thereafter it was a local option, and \n     the schools were mostly integrated.\n       Before the court John W. Davis obviously made a very \n     impassioned, constitutional argument. But Thurgood Marshall \n     made the real argument, there wasn't any question about it. \n     He had been with this case. He had the feel, and everything \n     else of that kind.\n       I can still hear and see Justice Frankfurter on the Court \n     leaning over and saying, ``Mr. Marshall, Mr. Marshall, you've \n     won your case, you've won your case. What happens next''? And \n     Thurgood Marshall said, well, if he prevails, then the state \n     imposed policy of separation by race would be removed. The \n     little children can go to the school of their choice. They \n     play together before they go to school. They come back and \n     play together after school. Now they can be together at \n     school. The State imposed policy of separation by race in \n     South Carolina would be gone.\n       Another lawyer arguing the case was George E. C. Hayes, and \n     when I heard him that was my epiphany. Mr. Hayes got everyone \n     because he used a jury argument before\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n     the Supreme Court. He said: as black soldiers we went to the \n     war to fight on the front lines in Europe, and when we come \n     home we have to sit on the back of the bus.\n       I had been with the 9th Anti-Artillery Aircraft unit in \n     Tunisia in Africa for a month. And then I was in Italy and \n     Germany and crossed over to what is now Kosovo. So I served. \n     I knew exactly what he was talking about. And I said this is \n     wrong.\n       The next year Chief Justice Vinson died. It was reported at \n     that time that Justice Frankfurter said for the first time \n     that he believed there was a God in Heaven when Vison passed \n     away. They appointed Mr. Earl Warren as Chief Justice, who \n     dragged everybody back to the Court to re-argue the case in \n     December of 1953. He didn't want to hear about separate but \n     equal. He wanted the case re-argued on the constitutionality \n     of segregation itself.\n       Then on May 17, 1953 the decision came down, it was \n     unanimous, segregation was over in this country. So the \n     lawyers immediately got together to discuss how to implement \n     the decision. Since the decision said to integrate schools \n     with all deliberate speed, there was arguments back and forth \n     on how we could comply with this order with all deliberate \n     speed and not start chaos all over the land.\n       Some school authority down in Charleston came up with the \n     idea that with all deliberate speed meant we would integrate \n     the first grade the first year; we would integrate the first \n     and second grades the second year; the third year would be \n     the first, second, and third grades. Over a 12-year period, \n     we would then have the 12 grades integrated. When the head of \n     the NAACP in New York heard that he said: ``Noooo Way. We are \n     not going to be given our constitutional rights on the \n     installment plan.'' And that ended that. But nothing was done \n     for about 10 years, until Martin Luther King came along.\n       When I became Governor, I started working on other areas \n     that needed to be integrated, beginning with law enforcement. \n     I'll never forget all the white sheriffs who were against all \n     the blacks. We only had 34 black sheriffs. We have about 500 \n     today.\n       And we literally broke up and locked up the Ku Klux Klan. I \n     remember on the day I was sworn in as Governor, waiting for \n     me was a green and gold embossed envelope, with a lifetime \n     membership into the Ku Klux Klan. I never heard of such a \n     thing. I asked the head of law enforcement, do we have the Ku \n     Klux Klan in South Carolina? He said, ``Ohhh yes. We have \n     1,727 members.'' I asked, you have an actual count? And he \n     said: ``Ohhh yes, we keep a count of them.'' He said he could \n     get rid of them, but no Governor had helped him in the past. \n     I said, I'll help you. What do we do? He said: ``I need a \n     little money.''\n       So we infiltrated the Klan, and the members began to know, \n     or their bosses at businesses knew because they would say to \n     these people: ``You know on Friday night, your man, so and \n     so, has been going to these rallies.'' The next thing you \n     know, they quit going to the rallies. So by the time we \n     integrated Clemson with Harvey Gantt, it went very, very \n     peacefully. And there were less than 300 Klansmen.\n       Then, of course, as Senator I took my hunger trips. This is \n     the effect those arguments before the court had on me. I took \n     those trips with the NAACP to 16 different counties. As a \n     result, we embellished the food stamp program, we instituted \n     the women infants and children's feeding program, and the \n     school lunch program. The attendance in schools went way up \n     when we started that.\n       As your Senator I had the privilege of employing Ralph \n     Everett. He was the first black staff director of any \n     committee in the United States Senate.\n       We have both Andy Chishom and Israel Brooks as the first \n     black Marshalls of South Carolina. Matthew Perry, the first \n     black district judge of a Federal court ever appointed, I \n     appointed. The first black woman judge to the Federal \n     district court, Margaret Seymour, I appointed her. So we have \n     made a lot of progress along that line.\n       But to give you a feel for how things have changed, I \n     remember speaking at the C.A. Johnson High School in \n     Columbia, the largest black high school in the entire state, \n     the day after Martin Luther King was assassinated.\n       At the event, there was a mid-shipman, a senior at the \n     Naval Academy, who stood up and made one of the finest talks \n     I ever heard. I turned to the principal, because it was his \n     son, and I asked: who appointed your son to the Naval \n     Academy? He didn't answer. We walked down the row, and I can \n     see me now, asking him again. He still didn't answer. When I \n     got to my car, I said evidently you don't understand my \n     accent from Charleston. Who appointed your son to the U.S. \n     Naval Academy? He said, ``Senator, I didn't want to have to \n     answer that question. We couldn't get a member of the South \n     Carolina delegation to appoint him. Hubert Humphrey appointed \n     him.''\n       What goes around, comes around. Today, I have more minority \n     appointments to West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force \n     Academies than anybody. Recently I had Chuck Bolden, who is a \n     major general in the marine corps and a former astronaut, \n     ready to return to NASA as the number two person there. But \n     the Pentagon raised the question about taking such a talent \n     during a time of war and moving him to the civilian space \n     program. So we said the heck with it, he's too needed in the \n     military.\n       That is the effect Briggs v. Elliott had on this public \n     servant. There isn't any question that without the courage of \n     your parents, our society would be a lot worse off today.\n       I was there a few years back when the Congress of the \n     United gave the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. She \n     deserved it, and we wouldn't take anything from her for not \n     moving her seat. But in the 1950s the worst they could have \n     done to her was to pull her off the bus. These descendants \n     lost their homes. They lost their livelihoods. They almost \n     lost their lives. As far as continuing their life in the \n     State of South Carolina, they could not do it.\n       Without their courage, without their stamina, without their \n     example in starting the Briggs v. Elliott case, we never \n     would have had a civil rights act. We never would have had a \n     voting rights act. We never would have had all the progress \n     we've made over the many, many years.\n       So I wanted particularly to come back and to publicly thank \n     each of you descendants. And I want to announce that I am \n     putting forward a bill that would honor posthumously Rev. De \n     Laine with a Congressional Gold Medal.\n       I need 66 co-sponsors in the Senate. We have to have \n     similar support on the House side. But Cong. Clyburn, he can \n     get way more votes than I can. I don't think he'll have any \n     trouble. We'll try to work it out so that in '04, the 50th \n     anniversary of when the decision came down, we'll be able to \n     make that presentation.\n       I just want to end by saying because of the courage of your \n     parents, we made far more progress in the United States of \n     America. Our country is a far stronger country. We are more \n     than ever the land of the free and the home of the brave \n     because of Briggs v. Elliott. And I thank you all very, very \n     much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 2623. A bill to designate the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle \nGrove Plantation National Historical Park as a unit of the National \nPark System, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President I am pleased to introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Allen, to create the Cedar Creek \nBattlefield and Belle Grove Plantation National Historical Park.\n  This legislation builds on an effort that I have been involved with \nfor over a decade. In 1991, the Congress authorized the National Park \nService to conduct an assessment of the historical integrity of \nsignificant Civil War battlefields in the Shenandoah Valley of \nVirginia. That examination identified 10 Civil War battlefields in \neight counties in the Valley that remained significantly as they were \nduring the war.\n  The Valley itself was a location of constant engagements throughout \nthe War with more than 325 armed conflicts. The 10 battlefields that \nare today preserved under the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields \nManagement Plan include the places of Stonewall Jackson's 1862 \ncampaign, and later Union General Philip Sheridan's 1864 campaign which \nleft the Valley in ruins.\n  This legislation is the product of many months of discussions with \naffected individual property owners with the battlefield boundary, our \npartner non-profit organizations who today preserve Belle Grove \nPlantation and surrounding lands within the battlefield, local \ngovernments and many interested citizens. I am pleased to present to \nthe Senate their strong support for this legislation. I know that with \nretaining the private sector ownership of buildings and their direct \nparticipation in preserving and interpreting the story of Cedar Creek, \nwe will have a truly unique partnership.\n  The compelling story of the events that unfolded at Cedar Creek \nsurely earns recognition within our National Park system. In October of \n1864, the Federal Army of the Shenandoah, having soundly defeated the \nConfederate Army of the Valley at Winchester on September 19 and then \nagain at Fisher's Hill on September 22, ran the Confederate forces out \nof the Shenandoah Valley. In the process of this Union advance, Federal \nforces either burned or took all of the Confederate food reserves and \nlivestock between Staunton and Strasburg. Thinking he had finally \ndeprived the Valley as the Confederate's food source and as an invasion \nroute North, Major General Philip Sheridan left his army camped along \nCedar Creek at Middletown and went to Washington to have meetings with \nhis supporters.\n  Refusing to give up the Valley to the Federals, General Jubal Early \nmoved his very hungry, tired, and ill-equipped army of about 17,000 to \nFisher's Hill on October 13. Facing down Sheridan's\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nwell dug-in army of over 30,000 men, Early had to make a decision to \nattack or retreat. He chose to attack. On the night of October 18, he \nsent three of his divisions under the command of Major General John \nGordon across the Shenandoah River and along the flank of Massanutten \nMountain to hit the Federal position from the east, behind its \nentrenchments along Cedar Creek.\n  After marching and maneuvering all night, Gordon's divisions struck \nat dawn in a thick fog. The Federals were clearly surprised. Early \npushed the Federals all the way out of their camps, past Belle Grove \nplantation and all the way through Middleton. At mid-day, Gordon \nordered a halt to the advance so that he could regroup his forces.\n  Being informed that there was a battle going on, Sheridan rushed to \nMiddletown from Winchester. Once he arrived there in the afternoon, he \nfound his army posted along a ridge north of Middletown. There he was \nable to rally his men, and from the position he ordered a massive \ncounterattack. The counterattack completely swept the Confederates from \nthe field.\n  The battle of Cedar Creek was significant for many reasons. The \nbattle dealt the crushing blow to the Confederacy in the Shenandoah \nValley, thus ending the career of Jubal Early in the process. Most \nimportantly, however, coupled with the successes of General William T. \nSherman in the Atlanta campaign, the battle boosted the morale of the \nwar-weary North and guaranteed the re-election of President Abraham \nLincoln.\n  The untouched landscape of this battlefield and the historic \nstructure of Belle Grove plantation still today evoke the stories of \nthe war. This site will serve to tell the whole story of the campaigns \nof the Valley and visitors will experience the full impact of the War \nof these surrounding rural communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cedar Creek Battlefield and \n     Belle Grove Plantation National Historical Park Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish the Cedar Creek \n     Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation National Historical \n     Park in order to--\n       (1) help preserve, protect, and interpret a nationally \n     significant Civil War landscape and antebellum plantation for \n     the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future \n     generations;\n       (2) serve as a focal point to recognize and interpret \n     important events and geographic locations representing key \n     Civil War battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including those \n     battlefields associated with the Thomas J. (stonewall) \n     Jackson campaign of 862 and the decisive campaigns of 1864;\n       (3) tell the rich story of the Battle of Cedar Creek and \n     its significance in the conduct of the war in the Shenandoah \n     Valley; and\n       (4) preserve the significant historic, natural, cultural, \n     military, and scenic resources found in the Cedar Creek \n     Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation areas through \n     partnerships with local landowners and the community.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Battle of Cedar Creek, also known as the battle of \n     Belle Grove, was a major event of the Civil War and the \n     history of this country. It represented the end of the Civil \n     War's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 and contributed to \n     the reelection of President Abraham Lincoln and the eventual \n     outcome of the war.\n       (2) 2,500 acres of the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle \n     Grove Plantation were designated a national historic landmark \n     in 1969 because of their ability to illustrate and interpret \n     important eras and events in the history of the United \n     States. The Cedar Creek Battlefield, Belle Grove Manor House, \n     the Heater House, and Harmony Hall (a National Historic \n     Landmark) are also listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Interior has approved the \n     Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District \n     Management Plan, September 2000, which preserves the \n     District's historic character, and protects and interprets 10 \n     significant Civil War battlefields within the District, \n     including the Cedar Creek battlefield.\n       (4) The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic \n     District Management Plan and the National Park Service \n     Special Resource Study recognize the Cedar Creek battlefield \n     as the most significant Civil War resource within the \n     Historic District.\n       (5) The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic \n     District Management Plan, which was developed with extensive \n     public participation over a 3-year period and is administered \n     by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, recommends \n     that Cedar Creek Battlefield be established as a new unit of \n     the National Park System to provide permanent protection for \n     the battlefield and to serve as the central site to increase \n     the public's education and awareness of the War's legacy \n     throughout the Historic District.\n       (6) The Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation, organized in \n     1988 to preserve and interpret the Cedar Creek Battlefield \n     and the 1864 Valley Campaign, has acquired 308 acres of land \n     within the boundaries of the National Historic Landmark. The \n     foundation annually hosts a major reenactment and living \n     history event on the Cedar Creek Battlefield.\n       (7) Belle Grove Plantation is a Historic Site of the \n     National Trust for Historic Preservation that occupies 383 \n     acres within the National Historic Landmark. The Belle Grove \n     Manor House was built by Isaac Hite, a Revolutionary War \n     patriot married to the sister of President James Madison, who \n     was a frequent visitor at Belle Grove. President Thomas \n     Jefferson assisted with the design of the house. During the \n     Civil War Belle Grove was at the center of the decisive \n     battle of Cedar Creek. Belle Grove is managed locally by \n     Belle Grove, Incorporated, and has been open to the public \n     since 1967. The house has remained virtually unchanged since \n     it was built in 1797, offering visitors an experience of the \n     life and times of the people who lived there in the 18th and \n     19th centuries.\n       (8) The panoramic views of the mountains, natural areas, \n     and waterways provide visitors with an inspiring setting of \n     great natural beauty. The historic, natural, cultural, \n     military, and scenic resources found in the Cedar Creek \n     Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation areas are nationally \n     and regionally significant.\n       (9) The existing, independent, not-for-profit organizations \n     dedicated to the protection and interpretation of the \n     resources described above provide the foundation for public-\n     private partnerships to further the success of protecting, \n     preserving, and interpreting these resources.\n       (10) None of these resources, sites, or stories of the \n     Shenandoah Valley are protected by or interpreted within the \n     National Park System.\n\n     SEC. 4.

This legislation would \nprotect the viability of independent service station and repair shops \nand ensure that consumers will continue to have a choice of automotive \nservice providers.\n  The 1990 Clean Air Act mandated that vehicle manufacturers install \ncomputer systems to monitor emissions in 1994 model year cars and \nbeyond. Today, many vehicle systems are integrated into the car's \ncomputer system, making auto repair an increasingly ``high tech'' \nbusiness and making access to the computer and the information it \ncontains vital to the ability to perform repairs.\n  Increasingly, however, independent repair shops are being barred \naccess to the codes and diagnostic tools necessary to repair newer \nmodel cars. The effect is to reduce consumer choice for auto repair \nservices, and to endanger the livelihood thousands of small, family \nowned repair shops across the country.\n  On April 10, I met with a group of repair shop owners from Minnesota. \nThe explained that new practices by some auto manufactures were \npreventing them from competing on an even playing field. One thing we \ndon't need is another industry where all the little guys, the small, \nindependent businesses, are driven out. This is terrible for our \ncommunities. And reduced competition means higher prices for consumers\n  Specifically, the Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act would \nsimply require a manufacturer of a motor vehicle sold in the United \nStates to disclose to the vehicle owner, a repair facility, and the \nFederal Trade Commission, FTC, the information necessary to diagnose, \nservice, or repair the vehicle. The bill bars the FTC from requiring \ndisclosure of any information entitled to protection as a \nmanufacturer's trade secret.\n  This legislation is an example of what is good for small business is \ngood for the consumer. The bill is endorsed by the 44 million member \nAmerican Automobile Association, AAA, as well as the Automotive Service \nAssociation, the trade association of automotive service professionals.\n  To reiterate, I want to introduce a bill and tell colleagues about \nit. I have sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter. This is very much a \npro-consumer bill as well. It is called the Motor Vehicle and Owners \nRight to Repair Act. There has to be a better title.\n  Basically, this is the issue. The automotive industry, for 100 years, \nhas always shared information with mechanics. But post-1994, you have \ncars with very computerized systems. All of a sudden, the automotive \nindustry is now saying to independent mechanics, we will not share with \nyou the information about the computer system so you can get into the \ncomputer system, do the diagnosis and the repair, in which case I think \nit is a blatant anticompetitive practice.\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n  It puts the independent mechanics, the small guys, out of business. \nIn addition, it says to the consumers: Listen, you might want to take \nyour car back to the dealership for repair, but now that is your only \nchoice because you may want to go to the neighborhood mechanic you have \nworked with for years and he might want your business, but we are going \nto make it impossible for him to get your business. We are going to \nmake it impossible for you to go there.\n  I like this piece of legislation because it is little guy versus big \nguy. It feels right to me. At 5 feet, 5 inches, I like the little guys.\n  In April, some mechanics came by our office and talked with Perry \nLang, who works with me, and they said this is happening to us and \nasked for some help.\n  I say on the floor of the Senate two things: No. 1, I am circulating \na ``Dear Colleague'' letter. I hope to get a lot of support. I think \nthere will be a lot of support.\n  This is going on in the House with a lot of Republicans as well as \nDemocrats.\n  The second thing that I am saying to the industry today on the floor \nof the Senate--and I think they are watching this carefully--is we are \ngoing to get a good head of steam on this. If you want to sit down and \nnegotiate an agreement with the mechanics that is fair to these \nindependent mechanics, go ahead. Then we won't have to pass the \nlegislation. But I could not believe when I heard the report of what \nthey are dealing with.\n  Again, you have a blatant anticompetitive practice of the industry \nbasically saying we will not share with you any information about our \ncomputerized systems. If the industry wants to say there is some kind \nof a trade patent secret which they can't share, they can go to the FTC \nand get approval for that. Otherwise, for 100 years, this has not \nhappened. Now we get into a blatant collusion, anticompetitive practice \nthat is unfair to the independent mechanics who a lot of Senators know \nas friends and as small businesspeople. I am aiming to stop it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2619. A bill to provide for the analysis of the incidence and \neffects of prison rape in Federal, State, and local institutions and to \nprovide information, resources, recommendations, and funding to protect \nindividuals from prison rape; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as the Supreme Court has made clear, \n``being violently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty \nthat criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.'' \nGovernment officials have a duty under the Constitution to prevent \nprison violence.\n  Too often, however, officials fail to take obvious steps to protect \nvulnerable inmates. Prison rape is a serious problem in our Nation's \nprisons, jails, and detention facilities. Of the two million prisoners \nin the United States, it is conservatively estimated that one in ten \nhas been raped. According to a 1996 study, 22 percent of prisoners in \nNebraska had been pressured or forced to have sex against their will \nwhile incarcerated. Human Rights Watch recently reported, ``shockingly \nhigh rates of sexual abuse'' in U.S. prisons.\n  Prison rape causes severe physical and psychological pain to its \nvictims. It also leads to the increased transmission of HIV, hepatitis, \nand other diseases. The brutalization in prison also makes it more \nlikely that prisoners will commit crimes after they are released, as \n600,000 prisoners are each year.\n  To deal with this serious problem, Senator Sessions  and I are today \nintroducing the Prison Rape Reduction Act of 2002. This bipartisan \nlegislation is intended to address the prison-rape epidemic in an \neffective and comprehensive manner, while still respecting the primary \nrole of States and local governments in administering prisons and \njails.\n  Our bill directs the Department of Justice to conduct an annual \nstatistical review and analysis of the frequency and effects of prison \nrape. It establishes a special panel to conduct hearings on prison \nsystems, prisons, and jails where the incidence of rape is high. It \ndirects the Attorney General to collect complaints of rape from \ninmates, transmit them to the appropriate authorities, and review how \nthe authorities respond. It also directs the Attorney General to \nprovide information, assistance, and training to Federal, State, and \nlocal authorities on the prevention, investigation, and punishment of \nprison rape.\n  Our bill also authorizes $40 million in grants to enhance the \nprevention, investigation, and punishment of prison rape. These grants \nwill strengthen the ability of state and local officials to prevent \nthese abuses.\n  Finally, our bill establishes a commission that will conduct hearings \nover two years and recommend national correctional standards on a wide \nrange of issues, including inmate classification, investigation of rape \ncomplaints, trauma case for rape victims, disease prevention, and staff \ntraining. These standards should apply as soon as possible to the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons. Prison accreditation organizations that \nreceive Federal funding should also adopt the standards. States should \nadopt the standards too. If they ``opt out'' by passing a statute, they \nwill suffer no penalty, but States that fail to act at all will lose 20 \npercent of their prison-related federal funding.\n  Our bill is supported by a broad coalition of religious, civil \nrights, and human rights organizations, including the Salvation Army, \nthe Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association of \nEvangelicals, Prison Fellowship, Focus on the Family, the Presbyterian \nChurch, the Justice Policy Institute, the Sentencing Project, Youth Law \nCenter, Human Rights Watch, the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, and the National Council of La Raza. \nTogether, these diverse groups have demonstrated impressive moral \nleadership on this issue.\n  It is a privilege to work on this legislation with Congressmen Frank \nWolf and Bobby Scott in the House and Senator Sessions in the Senate. \nWhile we may disagree on other issues relating to criminal justice, we \nall recognize that rape is unacceptable, and it is long past time to \nend it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to commend Senator Kennedy for \nhis leadership on the important issue of reducing prison rape. I have \nenjoyed working with him to craft and refine the legislation that we \nare introducing today, the Prison Rape Reduction Act of 2002. Though \nSenator Kennedy and I come from different backgrounds and have \ndifferent political philosophies, we both agree that Congress should \nact to reduce prison rape.\n  I would also like to thank Congressman Frank Wolf and Bobby Scott for \ntheir important leadership on this bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. Congressman Wolf is a recognized champion for human \ndignity across the globe and this legislation to reduce prison rape is \nconsistent with his philosophy. Congressman Scott is very knowledgeable \non criminal law issues. While he and I have agreed and disagreed on \nmany issues over the years, we agree on the need to reduce prison rape.\n  As a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and as Attorney General of \nAlabama, I sent many guilty criminals to prison where they belong. I \nbelieved that they should be treated fairly in court, and I treated \nthem fairly. I also believe that they should be treated fairly in \nprison. Most prison wardens and sheriffs are outstanding public \nservants that do an excellent job of supervising inmates, and I commend \nmy friends in the law enforcement community for their hard work in this \narea.\n  However, knowingly subjecting a prisoner to rape is cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. Some studies have estimated that over 10 percent of the inmates \nin certain prisons are subject to rape. I hope that this statistic is \nan exaggeration. Nonetheless, it is the duty of Government officials to \nensure that criminals who are convicted and sentenced to prison serve \nthe sentence imposed by the judge and rape is not a part of any lawful \nsentence.\n  This bill responds to the problem of rape of prison inmates in three \nprincipal ways. First, the bill establishes a bipartisan National \nCommission that will study prison rape at the federal, state, and local \nlevels. Within 2 years, the commission will publish the results\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nof its study and make recommendations on how to reduce prison rape.\n  Second, the bill directs the Attorney General to issue a rule for the \nreduction of prison rape in Federal prisons. To avoid a 20 percent \nreduction in certain Federal funds, each State will have to pass a \nstatute that either adopts or rejects the standards for State prisons. \nThis bill contains no unfunded mandate to order States how to deal with \nprison rape. It does, however, require that they address the issue.\n  Third, the bill will require the Department of Justice to conduct \nstatistical surveys on prison rape for Federal, State, and local \nprisons and jails. Further, the Department of Justice will select \nofficials in charge of certain prisons with an incidence of prison rape \nexceeding the national average by 30 percent to come to Washington and \ntestify to the Department about the prison rape problem in their \ninstitution. If they refuse to testify, the prison will lose 20 percent \nof certain Federal funds.\n  In addition, the bill provides for $40 million in grants to States \nfor prevention, investigation, and prosecution of prison rape. This \nwill help the States to reduce repeat offenses by inmates.\n  A broad and bipartisan array of organizations and individuals have \nadded their support to this bill. The list includes: American \nPsychological Association; American Values; Biblical Witness \nFellowship, UCC; Camp Fire USA; Center for Religious Freedom, Freedom \nHouse; Christian Rescue Committee; Citizens United for Rehabilitation \nof Errants--Virginia, Inc. (Virginia CURE); Disciple Renewal; Focus on \nthe Family; Mary Ann Glendon, Learned Hand Professor of Law, Harvard \nLaw School; Good News, UMC; Human Rights Watch; Human Rights and the \nDrug War; Institute on Religion and Democracy; Justice Policy \nInstitute; Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs; National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People; National Association \nof Evangelicals; National Association of School Psychologists; National \nCenter on Institutions and Alternatives; National Council for La Raza; \nNational Network for Youth; National Mental Health Association; Marvin \nOlasky, Editor--World Magazine; Partnership for Responsible Drug \nInformation; Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); Prison Fellowship; Religious \nAction Center of Reform Judaism; Renew Network; Research and Policy \nReform, Inc.; Salvation Army; The Sentencing Project; Southern Baptist \nConvention; Stop Prison Rape; Unitarian Universalists for Juvenile \nJustice; Volunteers of America; and Youth Law Center.\n\n  I am especially proud of the evangelical Christian groups for their \nwork in gathering support for the bill. They have worked tirelessly for \nethics and compassion in government, and this legislation reflects \nthose values.\n  I would also like to thank Linda Chavez and Mike Horowitz for the \nideas that started this legislative initiative. Well-conceived, \ncarefully crafted ideas drive many legislative and political \ninitiatives that become law after people work together to form a \nbipartisan, moral position.\n  I also want to commend the hard work of Bill Pryor, the attorney \ngeneral of Alabama, who will end up dealing with the effects of this \nlegislation at the state level. Bill has worked with Prison Fellowship, \nhas talked with Alabama prison officials, and has worked with me on \nthis legislation. In addition to being an outstanding legal scholar and \nleader among all the States' attorneys general, Bill cares about people \nand demands fairness in how the State treats both victims and \nprisoners. I was very pleased that Attorney General Pryor joined us at \nthe press conference to express his support of the bill.\n  This bill will address prison rape, not through unfunded mandates and \nlawsuits, but through examining the problem and allowing sunshine to \nexpose deficiencies that need to be addressed. This bill is a necessary \nstep to reform and a bipartisan step toward justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Biden);\n  S. 2621. A bill to provide a definition of vehicle for purposes of \ncriminal penalties relating to terrorist attacks and other acts of \nviolence against mass transportation systems; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise to introduce legislation today \nwith Senator Biden to clarify that an airplane is a vehicle for \npurposes of terrorist and other violent acts against mass \ntransportation systems. A significant question about this point has \nbeen raised in an important criminal case and deserves our prompt \nattention.\n  Earlier this week, on June 11, 2002, a U.S. District Judge in Boston \ndismissed one of the nine charges against Richard Reid stemming from \nhis alleged attempt to detonate an explosive device in his shoe while \nonboard an international flight from Paris to Miami on December 22, \n2001. The dismissed count charged defendant Reid with violating section \n1993 of title 18, United States Code, by attempting to ``wreck, set \nfire to, and disable a mass transportation vehicle.''\n  Section 1993 is a new criminal law that was added, as section 801, to \nthe USA PATRIOT Act to punish terrorist attacks and other acts of \nviolence against, inter alia, a ``mass transportation'' vehicle or \nferry, or against a passenger or employee of a mass transportation \nprovider. I had urged that this provision be included in the final \nanti-terrorism law considered by the Congress. A similar provision was \noriginally part of S. 2783, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and \nPublic Safety Act,'' that I introduced in the last Congress in June, \n2000 on the request of the Clinton Administration.\n  The district court rejected defendant Reid's arguments to dismiss the \nsection 1993 charge on grounds that 1. the penalty provision does not \napply to an ``attempt'' and 2. an airplane is not engaged in ``mass \ntransportation.'' ``Mass transportation'' is defined in section 1993 by \nreference to the ``the meaning given to that term in section 5302(a)(7) \nof title 49, U.S.C., except that the term shall include schoolbus, \ncharter and sightseeing transportation.'' Section 5302(a)(7), in turn, \nprovides the following definition: ``mass transportation'' means \ntransportation by a conveyance that provides regular and continuing \ngeneral or special transportation to the public, but does not include \nschool bus, charter or sightseeing transportation.'' The court \nexplained that ``commercial aircraft transport large numbers of people \nevery day'' and that the definition of ``mass transportation'' ``when \nread in an ordinary or natural way, encompasses aircraft of the kind at \nissue here.'' U.S. v. Reid, CR No. 02-10013, at p. 10, 12 (D. MA, June \n11, 2002).\n  Defendant Reid also argued that the section 1993 charge should be \ndismissed because an airplane is not a ``vehicle.'' The court agreed, \nciting the fact that the term ``vehicle'' is not defined in section \n1993 and that the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. Sec. 4, narrowly defines \n``vehicle'' to include ``every description of carriage or other \nartificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of \ntransportation on land.'' Emphasis in original opinion. Notwithstanding \ncommon parlance and other court decisions that have interpreted this \nDictionary Act definition to encompass aircraft, the district court \nrelied on the narrow definition to conclude that an aircraft is not a \n``vehicle'' within the meaning of section 1993.\n  The new section 1993 was intended to provide broad federal criminal \njurisdiction over terrorist and violent acts against all mass \ntransportation systems, not only bus services but also commercial \nairplanes, cruise ships, railroads and other forms of transportation \navailable for public carriage. The bill I introduce today would add a \ndefinition of ``vehicle'' to section 1993 and clarify that an airplane \nis a ``vehicle'' both in common parlance and under this new criminal \nlaw to protect mass transportation systems. Specifically, the bill \nwould define this term to mean ``any carriage or other contrivance \nused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on land, \nwater or through the air.''\n  I urge the Senate to act promptly and pass this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION.\n\n       Section 1993(c) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\n       (1) in paragraph (7), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (8), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `vehicle' means any carriage or other \n     contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of \n     transportation on land, water, or through the air.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 2622. A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Joseph A. De Laine in recognition \nof his contributions to the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto present Reverend Joseph A. De Laine the Congressional Gold Medal in \nhonor of his heroic sacrifices to desegregate our public schools. His \ncrusade to break down barriers in education forever scarred his own \nlife, but led to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954.\n  Eight years before Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus, \nRev. De Laine, a minister and principal, organized African-American \nparents to petition the Summerton, SC, school board for a bus and \ngasoline so their children would not have to walk 10 miles to attend a \nsegregated school. A year later, in Briggs v. Elliott, the parents sued \nto end segregation. It was a case that as a young lawyer I watched \nThurgood Marshall argue before the Supreme Court as one of the five \ncases collectively known as Brown v. Board of Education. For this \nSenator, their arguments helped to shape my view on racial matters.\n  For his efforts, Rev. De Laine was subjected to a reign of domestic \nterrorism. He lost his job. He watched his church and home burn. He was \ncharged with assault and battery with intent to kill after shots were \nfired at his home and he fired back to mark the car. He had to leave \nSouth Carolina forever; relocate to New York, where he started an AME \nChurch, and he eventually retired in North Carolina. Not until the year \n2000, 26 years after his death and 45 years after the incident in his \nhome was Rev. De Laine cleared of all charges.\n  Last month, I spoke to the 100 descendants of Briggs v. Elliott, and \nI ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record, which \nshow the bravery of Rev. De Laine during a troubled time in our \nNation's past, and which point to the immeasurable benefits he has \ngiven our Nation.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Briggs v. Elliott Descendants Re-union Banquet, Summerton, South \n                         Carolina, May 11, 2002\n\n       I want to give you an insight into exactly what happened to \n     your parents 50 years ago in Summerton, SC, that led to the \n     desegregation of our Nation's schools by the Supreme Court of \n     the United States.\n       I speak with some trepidation, because right now I can see \n     Harry Briggs' son walking down that dirt road all the way \n     here to Scotts Branch School, and that school bus passing, \n     all for the white children. Yet all your families were asking \n     for was a bus. But they were told: ``you don't pay any taxes, \n     so how can you ask for a bus?'' What they didn't say is you \n     didn't have a job, whereby you could make a living and be \n     able to pay the taxes. They didn't say that.\n       I think of the threats, the burnings, the shooting up of \n     Reverend John De Laine's home. I think about how they turned \n     him into a fugitive. He had to leave his home in South \n     Carolina, never to return. Harry Briggs had to leave his home \n     and go to Florida to earn a living. It's not for me to tell \n     the descendants of the Briggs v. Elliott case how they have \n     suffered.\n       I didn't try this case, don't misunderstand me. My \n     beginnings with Briggs v. Elliott started in 1948 when I was \n     elected to the House of Representatives in Columbia.\n       The previous year James Hinton, the head of the NAACP in \n     the State gave a speech in Columbia. He talked about the need \n     to get separate but equal facilities. He got Rev. De Laine \n     from Summerton in the audience all fired up. Rev. De Laine, \n     who was the principal here, put together a petition signed by \n     20 parents, of 46 children, the Summerton 66.\n       I'll never forget the day after I was sworn into the \n     Legislature the superintendent of schools in Charleston \n     County took me across the Cooper River Bridge, down the \n     Mathis Ferry Road, to the Freedom School, the black school. \n     He said I want to show you what we really do, he used the \n     word at that time, ``for a Negro education.''\n       This was a cold November Day, and we went into a big one-\n     room building. That's all they had, one room, with a pot \n     belly stove in the middle. They had a class in this corner, a \n     class in that back corner, a class up front in this corner, \n     and a class here. Of course, they didn't have any desks, and \n     very few books, and one teacher teaching the four classes.\n       When I went to Columbia I was with a bunch of rebels. I \n     introduced an anti-lynching bill. I had never heard of \n     lynchings down in Charleston, but then they had one. As we \n     debated the bill, a fellow who was the grand dragon of the \n     Klan got up with all these Klansmen in the Gallery, and he \n     mumbled and raised cane. Speaker Blott got some order. But \n     several House members walked out. They said they wouldn't be \n     seated in the Legislature with a fellow like that. We passed \n     the anti-lynching bill.\n       I'm trying to give you this background, so you'll \n     understand the significance of what your parents did. We had \n     just had the case, whereby blacks could participate in the \n     Democratic primary. And we had just given women the right to \n     vote.\n       And in 1949 and 1950, I struggled because there was no \n     money in the state for separate but equal schools, or \n     anything else. I said we ought to put in a 3 percent sales \n     tax to pay for things. Governor Thurmond opposed it, and the \n     senators particularly opposed it. But I made the motion for a \n     one-cent tax on cigarettes; a one-cent tax on gasoline; and a \n     one-cent tax on beer. Beer, cigarettes, and gasoline.\n       We formed a House Committee with six of us to work on it. \n     We worked all summer. It's a long story, but let me cut it \n     and say by December we had it all written. I knew the \n     incoming governor, Governor Byrnes. I felt it would be good \n     to ask him to see if he could help me with this measure.\n       The second week in January, before he was sworn in, he \n     called me and said: ``You've got to come to Columbia, I'm \n     going to include this in my Inaugural address.'' Over \n     time, I made 79 talks on the proposal, until we finally \n     passed the sales tax, which provided some money for \n     separate but equal schools.\n       When the Briggs v. Elliott case came up, before Judge \n     Waring in Charleston, he questioned separate but equal. Then \n     in December 1952, the case went to the Supreme Court. \n     Governor Byrnes had served on the State Supreme Court, and he \n     wanted to make sure we won the case. In my mind, he was \n     absolutely sure that under Chief Justice Vinson the State \n     would win it.\n       But to make sure, he set aside Mr. Bob McC. Figg, who had \n     done all the work, and selected John W. Davis, as the \n     attorney for South Carolina against Thurgood Marshall, who \n     was representing Briggs and the NAACP. Mr. Davis had been the \n     Solicitor General of the United States. He had been the \n     Democratic nominee for president in 1924. He was considered \n     the greatest constitutional mind in the country.\n       The second thing the Governor did was to call me up and \n     say: ``I'm appointing you to go to Washington, because you \n     know intimately this law here that built the schools. You \n     have to go to Washington in case any questions of fact come \n     up.''\n       So we took a train to Washington. We came in at 6 o'clock \n     that morning at Union Station, and we sat down for breakfast. \n     I'll never forget it, because Thurgood Marshall walked in. He \n     and Bob McC. Figg had become real close friends. So he sat \n     down and was eating breakfast with us, and we began swapping \n     stories.\n       Mr. Marshall said ``Bob, you know that black family that \n     moved into that white neighborhood in Cicero, IL. They have \n     so much trouble. There are riots, and everything else going \n     on.'' And he said: ``Don't tell anybody, but I got hold of \n     Governor Adlai Stevenson.'' Stevenson was the governor of \n     Illinois at the time. And he said: ``I sent that family back \n     to Mississippi for safe keeping.'' And Thurgood added, ``for \n     God's sake, don't tell anybody that or it will ruin me.'' I \n     said: ``for God's sake, don't tell anybody I'm eating \n     breakfast with you, or I will never get elected again.''\n       I tell you that story so you can get a feel for 1952, for \n     what it was like 50 years ago.\n       We had wanted Briggs to be the lead case before the Supreme \n     Court. It was one of five cases that they would hear \n     collectively. But soon after our breakfast, we found out that \n     Roy Wilkens from the NAACP had gotten together with the \n     Solicitor General and moved the Kansas case in front of the \n     South Carolina case. Some reports said the reason was because \n     they wanted a northern case. That was not it. There was \n     another case from the State of Delaware, which was just as \n     north as the State of Kansas.\n       Kansas was selected because up until the sixth grade, yes, \n     it was segregated. But thereafter it was a local option, and \n     the schools were mostly integrated.\n       Before the court John W. Davis obviously made a very \n     impassioned, constitutional argument. But Thurgood Marshall \n     made the real argument, there wasn't any question about it. \n     He had been with this case. He had the feel, and everything \n     else of that kind.\n       I can still hear and see Justice Frankfurter on the Court \n     leaning over and saying, ``Mr. Marshall, Mr. Marshall, you've \n     won your case, you've won your case. What happens next''? And \n     Thurgood Marshall said, well, if he prevails, then the state \n     imposed policy of separation by race would be removed. The \n     little children can go to the school of their choice. They \n     play together before they go to school. They come back and \n     play together after school. Now they can be together at \n     school. The State imposed policy of separation by race in \n     South Carolina would be gone.\n       Another lawyer arguing the case was George E. C. Hayes, and \n     when I heard him that was my epiphany. Mr. Hayes got everyone \n     because he used a jury argument before\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n     the Supreme Court. He said: as black soldiers we went to the \n     war to fight on the front lines in Europe, and when we come \n     home we have to sit on the back of the bus.\n       I had been with the 9th Anti-Artillery Aircraft unit in \n     Tunisia in Africa for a month. And then I was in Italy and \n     Germany and crossed over to what is now Kosovo. So I served. \n     I knew exactly what he was talking about. And I said this is \n     wrong.\n       The next year Chief Justice Vinson died. It was reported at \n     that time that Justice Frankfurter said for the first time \n     that he believed there was a God in Heaven when Vison passed \n     away. They appointed Mr. Earl Warren as Chief Justice, who \n     dragged everybody back to the Court to re-argue the case in \n     December of 1953. He didn't want to hear about separate but \n     equal. He wanted the case re-argued on the constitutionality \n     of segregation itself.\n       Then on May 17, 1953 the decision came down, it was \n     unanimous, segregation was over in this country. So the \n     lawyers immediately got together to discuss how to implement \n     the decision. Since the decision said to integrate schools \n     with all deliberate speed, there was arguments back and forth \n     on how we could comply with this order with all deliberate \n     speed and not start chaos all over the land.\n       Some school authority down in Charleston came up with the \n     idea that with all deliberate speed meant we would integrate \n     the first grade the first year; we would integrate the first \n     and second grades the second year; the third year would be \n     the first, second, and third grades. Over a 12-year period, \n     we would then have the 12 grades integrated. When the head of \n     the NAACP in New York heard that he said: ``Noooo Way. We are \n     not going to be given our constitutional rights on the \n     installment plan.'' And that ended that. But nothing was done \n     for about 10 years, until Martin Luther King came along.\n       When I became Governor, I started working on other areas \n     that needed to be integrated, beginning with law enforcement. \n     I'll never forget all the white sheriffs who were against all \n     the blacks. We only had 34 black sheriffs. We have about 500 \n     today.\n       And we literally broke up and locked up the Ku Klux Klan. I \n     remember on the day I was sworn in as Governor, waiting for \n     me was a green and gold embossed envelope, with a lifetime \n     membership into the Ku Klux Klan. I never heard of such a \n     thing. I asked the head of law enforcement, do we have the Ku \n     Klux Klan in South Carolina? He said, ``Ohhh yes. We have \n     1,727 members.'' I asked, you have an actual count? And he \n     said: ``Ohhh yes, we keep a count of them.'' He said he could \n     get rid of them, but no Governor had helped him in the past. \n     I said, I'll help you. What do we do? He said: ``I need a \n     little money.''\n       So we infiltrated the Klan, and the members began to know, \n     or their bosses at businesses knew because they would say to \n     these people: ``You know on Friday night, your man, so and \n     so, has been going to these rallies.'' The next thing you \n     know, they quit going to the rallies. So by the time we \n     integrated Clemson with Harvey Gantt, it went very, very \n     peacefully. And there were less than 300 Klansmen.\n       Then, of course, as Senator I took my hunger trips. This is \n     the effect those arguments before the court had on me. I took \n     those trips with the NAACP to 16 different counties. As a \n     result, we embellished the food stamp program, we instituted \n     the women infants and children's feeding program, and the \n     school lunch program. The attendance in schools went way up \n     when we started that.\n       As your Senator I had the privilege of employing Ralph \n     Everett. He was the first black staff director of any \n     committee in the United States Senate.\n       We have both Andy Chishom and Israel Brooks as the first \n     black Marshalls of South Carolina. Matthew Perry, the first \n     black district judge of a Federal court ever appointed, I \n     appointed. The first black woman judge to the Federal \n     district court, Margaret Seymour, I appointed her. So we have \n     made a lot of progress along that line.\n       But to give you a feel for how things have changed, I \n     remember speaking at the C.A. Johnson High School in \n     Columbia, the largest black high school in the entire state, \n     the day after Martin Luther King was assassinated.\n       At the event, there was a mid-shipman, a senior at the \n     Naval Academy, who stood up and made one of the finest talks \n     I ever heard. I turned to the principal, because it was his \n     son, and I asked: who appointed your son to the Naval \n     Academy? He didn't answer. We walked down the row, and I can \n     see me now, asking him again. He still didn't answer. When I \n     got to my car, I said evidently you don't understand my \n     accent from Charleston. Who appointed your son to the U.S. \n     Naval Academy? He said, ``Senator, I didn't want to have to \n     answer that question. We couldn't get a member of the South \n     Carolina delegation to appoint him. Hubert Humphrey appointed \n     him.''\n       What goes around, comes around. Today, I have more minority \n     appointments to West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force \n     Academies than anybody. Recently I had Chuck Bolden, who is a \n     major general in the marine corps and a former astronaut, \n     ready to return to NASA as the number two person there. But \n     the Pentagon raised the question about taking such a talent \n     during a time of war and moving him to the civilian space \n     program. So we said the heck with it, he's too needed in the \n     military.\n       That is the effect Briggs v. Elliott had on this public \n     servant. There isn't any question that without the courage of \n     your parents, our society would be a lot worse off today.\n       I was there a few years back when the Congress of the \n     United gave the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. She \n     deserved it, and we wouldn't take anything from her for not \n     moving her seat. But in the 1950s the worst they could have \n     done to her was to pull her off the bus. These descendants \n     lost their homes. They lost their livelihoods. They almost \n     lost their lives. As far as continuing their life in the \n     State of South Carolina, they could not do it.\n       Without their courage, without their stamina, without their \n     example in starting the Briggs v. Elliott case, we never \n     would have had a civil rights act. We never would have had a \n     voting rights act. We never would have had all the progress \n     we've made over the many, many years.\n       So I wanted particularly to come back and to publicly thank \n     each of you descendants. And I want to announce that I am \n     putting forward a bill that would honor posthumously Rev. De \n     Laine with a Congressional Gold Medal.\n       I need 66 co-sponsors in the Senate. We have to have \n     similar support on the House side. But Cong. Clyburn, he can \n     get way more votes than I can. I don't think he'll have any \n     trouble. We'll try to work it out so that in '04, the 50th \n     anniversary of when the decision came down, we'll be able to \n     make that presentation.\n       I just want to end by saying because of the courage of your \n     parents, we made far more progress in the United States of \n     America. Our country is a far stronger country. We are more \n     than ever the land of the free and the home of the brave \n     because of Briggs v. Elliott. And I thank you all very, very \n     much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 2623. A bill to designate the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle \nGrove Plantation National Historical Park as a unit of the National \nPark System, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President I am pleased to introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Allen, to create the Cedar Creek \nBattlefield and Belle Grove Plantation National Historical Park.\n  This legislation builds on an effort that I have been involved with \nfor over a decade. In 1991, the Congress authorized the National Park \nService to conduct an assessment of the historical integrity of \nsignificant Civil War battlefields in the Shenandoah Valley of \nVirginia. That examination identified 10 Civil War battlefields in \neight counties in the Valley that remained significantly as they were \nduring the war.\n  The Valley itself was a location of constant engagements throughout \nthe War with more than 325 armed conflicts. The 10 battlefields that \nare today preserved under the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields \nManagement Plan include the places of Stonewall Jackson's 1862 \ncampaign, and later Union General Philip Sheridan's 1864 campaign which \nleft the Valley in ruins.\n  This legislation is the product of many months of discussions with \naffected individual property owners with the battlefield boundary, our \npartner non-profit organizations who today preserve Belle Grove \nPlantation and surrounding lands within the battlefield, local \ngovernments and many interested citizens. I am pleased to present to \nthe Senate their strong support for this legislation. I know that with \nretaining the private sector ownership of buildings and their direct \nparticipation in preserving and interpreting the story of Cedar Creek, \nwe will have a truly unique partnership.\n  The compelling story of the events that unfolded at Cedar Creek \nsurely earns recognition within our National Park system. In October of \n1864, the Federal Army of the Shenandoah, having soundly defeated the \nConfederate Army of the Valley at Winchester on September 19 and then \nagain at Fisher's Hill on September 22, ran the Confederate forces out \nof the Shenandoah Valley. In the process of this Union advance, Federal \nforces either burned or took all of the Confederate food reserves and \nlivestock between Staunton and Strasburg. Thinking he had finally \ndeprived the Valley as the Confederate's food source and as an invasion \nroute North, Major General Philip Sheridan left his army camped along \nCedar Creek at Middletown and went to Washington to have meetings with \nhis supporters.\n  Refusing to give up the Valley to the Federals, General Jubal Early \nmoved his very hungry, tired, and ill-equipped army of about 17,000 to \nFisher's Hill on October 13. Facing down Sheridan's\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nwell dug-in army of over 30,000 men, Early had to make a decision to \nattack or retreat. He chose to attack. On the night of October 18, he \nsent three of his divisions under the command of Major General John \nGordon across the Shenandoah River and along the flank of Massanutten \nMountain to hit the Federal position from the east, behind its \nentrenchments along Cedar Creek.\n  After marching and maneuvering all night, Gordon's divisions struck \nat dawn in a thick fog. The Federals were clearly surprised. Early \npushed the Federals all the way out of their camps, past Belle Grove \nplantation and all the way through Middleton. At mid-day, Gordon \nordered a halt to the advance so that he could regroup his forces.\n  Being informed that there was a battle going on, Sheridan rushed to \nMiddletown from Winchester. Once he arrived there in the afternoon, he \nfound his army posted along a ridge north of Middletown. There he was \nable to rally his men, and from the position he ordered a massive \ncounterattack. The counterattack completely swept the Confederates from \nthe field.\n  The battle of Cedar Creek was significant for many reasons. The \nbattle dealt the crushing blow to the Confederacy in the Shenandoah \nValley, thus ending the career of Jubal Early in the process. Most \nimportantly, however, coupled with the successes of General William T. \nSherman in the Atlanta campaign, the battle boosted the morale of the \nwar-weary North and guaranteed the re-election of President Abraham \nLincoln.\n  The untouched landscape of this battlefield and the historic \nstructure of Belle Grove plantation still today evoke the stories of \nthe war. This site will serve to tell the whole story of the campaigns \nof the Valley and visitors will experience the full impact of the War \nof these surrounding rural communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cedar Creek Battlefield and \n     Belle Grove Plantation National Historical Park Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish the Cedar Creek \n     Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation National Historical \n     Park in order to--\n       (1) help preserve, protect, and interpret a nationally \n     significant Civil War landscape and antebellum plantation for \n     the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future \n     generations;\n       (2) serve as a focal point to recognize and interpret \n     important events and geographic locations representing key \n     Civil War battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including those \n     battlefields associated with the Thomas J. (stonewall) \n     Jackson campaign of 862 and the decisive campaigns of 1864;\n       (3) tell the rich story of the Battle of Cedar Creek and \n     its significance in the conduct of the war in the Shenandoah \n     Valley; and\n       (4) preserve the significant historic, natural, cultural, \n     military, and scenic resources found in the Cedar Creek \n     Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation areas through \n     partnerships with local landowners and the community.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Battle of Cedar Creek, also known as the battle of \n     Belle Grove, was a major event of the Civil War and the \n     history of this country. It represented the end of the Civil \n     War's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 and contributed to \n     the reelection of President Abraham Lincoln and the eventual \n     outcome of the war.\n       (2) 2,500 acres of the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle \n     Grove Plantation were designated a national historic landmark \n     in 1969 because of their ability to illustrate and interpret \n     important eras and events in the history of the United \n     States. The Cedar Creek Battlefield, Belle Grove Manor House, \n     the Heater House, and Harmony Hall (a National Historic \n     Landmark) are also listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Interior has approved the \n     Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District \n     Management Plan, September 2000, which preserves the \n     District's historic character, and protects and interprets 10 \n     significant Civil War battlefields within the District, \n     including the Cedar Creek battlefield.\n       (4) The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic \n     District Management Plan and the National Park Service \n     Special Resource Study recognize the Cedar Creek battlefield \n     as the most significant Civil War resource within the \n     Historic District.\n       (5) The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic \n     District Management Plan, which was developed with extensive \n     public participation over a 3-year period and is administered \n     by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, recommends \n     that Cedar Creek Battlefield be established as a new unit of \n     the National Park System to provide permanent protection for \n     the battlefield and to serve as the central site to increase \n     the public's education and awareness of the War's legacy \n     throughout the Historic District.\n       (6) The Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation, organized in \n     1988 to preserve and interpret the Cedar Creek Battlefield \n     and the 1864 Valley Campaign, has acquired 308 acres of land \n     within the boundaries of the National Historic Landmark. The \n     foundation annually hosts a major reenactment and living \n     history event on the Cedar Creek Battlefield.\n       (7) Belle Grove Plantation is a Historic Site of the \n     National Trust for Historic Preservation that occupies 383 \n     acres within the National Historic Landmark. The Belle Grove \n     Manor House was built by Isaac Hite, a Revolutionary War \n     patriot married to the sister of President James Madison, who \n     was a frequent visitor at Belle Grove. President Thomas \n     Jefferson assisted with the design of the house. During the \n     Civil War Belle Grove was at the center of the decisive \n     battle of Cedar Creek. Belle Grove is managed locally by \n     Belle Grove, Incorporated, and has been open to the public \n     since 1967. The house has remained virtually unchanged since \n     it was built in 1797, offering visitors an experience of the \n     life and times of the people who lived there in the 18th and \n     19th centuries.\n       (8) The panoramic views of the mountains, natural areas, \n     and waterways provide visitors with an inspiring setting of \n     great natural beauty. The historic, natural, cultural, \n     military, and scenic resources found in the Cedar Creek \n     Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation areas are nationally \n     and regionally significant.\n       (9) The existing, independent, not-for-profit organizations \n     dedicated to the protection and interpretation of the \n     resources described above provide the foundation for public-\n     private partnerships to further the success of protecting, \n     preserving, and interpreting these resources.\n       (10) None of these resources, sites, or stories of the \n     Shenandoah Valley are protected by or interpreted within the \n     National Park System.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Madam President, today I rise to submit a resolution, \nalong with Senator Specter, supporting ``National Night Out,'' a \nprogram at the forefront of the Nation's effort to combat crime and \nterrorism. On August 6 of this year, over 33 million people in 9,700 \ncommunities from all 50 States will participate in the 19th Annual \nNational Night Out. These volunteers greet their neighbors, meet with \nlocal police, and participate in block parties and parades, all to \nencourage citizens to become active caretakers of their communities. \nThis resolution would salute and encourage those efforts.\n  This past year has seen our nation both horrified by unthinkable \ntragedy, and driven to ensure that nothing so terrible ever happens \nagain. Unfortunately, we can't have a police officer protecting us on \nevery block, during every minute, of everyday. And while many of us in \nthe Congress have worked for years to enhance the tools and resources \navailable to law enforcement, few things are more valuable in our \nongoing war against terrorism and crime than the eyes and ears of \nconscientious citizens. A 1995 study by the National Institute of \nJustice shows that crime rates are 40 percent lower, on average, in \ncommunities with high mutual trust among neighbors. By encouraging \nmembers of each community to get to know one another, be familiar with \ntheir block, and work with local law enforcement officials to spot and \naddress suspicious situations, National Night Out helps all of us sleep \nmore soundly.\n  Today, with terrorists seeking to strike our homeland, our efforts to \nkeep America's streets safe are more crucial than ever. Working side by \nside with local law enforcement, neighborhood crime watch groups have \nbeen, and will continue to be an invaluable resource. In fact, a \nJustice Department survey indicates that 90 percent of law enforcement \nofficers believe National Night Out enhances their policing programs. \nEvery year, National Night Out provides Americans with a great \nopportunity to meet their neighbors, show their patriotism, and keep \ntheir streets safe. I hope my colleagues will join Senator Specter and \nme in thanking them for making a difference, one doorstep at a time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5543-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5543-S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 285--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONDEMNING \n THE FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION TO RECOGNIZE THE \n                        NEEDS OF ALASKAN ESKIMOS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I rise to offer a sense of the Senate \nresolution condemning the International Whaling Commission's recent \nvote against renewing quotas for aboriginal subsistence whaling by \nAlaska's Inuit people.\n  I have always respected both the goals and the processes of the \nInternational Whaling Commission, but my support has been badly eroded \nby recent events.\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n  The Inupiat people of northern Alaska have engaged in environmentally \nresponsible whaling practices for thousands of years, with no \ninternational supervision. They were forced to stand and watch as the \ngreat whales were decimated.\n  Alaska's Inupiat people responded positively to the conservation \ngoals of the International Commission, forming their own organization, \nthe Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, which has participated \nwholeheartedly in International Commission meetings. The Alaska \nCommission has also put significant assets and effort toward research \nand monitoring that has proven conclusively that current Alaskan \nwhaling poses no danger to the stocks of bowhead whales that are its \ntarget species.\n  Whaling is more important to the communities of northern Alaska than \nmost can possibly understand. It provides a critical element of their \ndiet, a major staple for their survival. But beyond that, it is a \ncustom that is deeply ingrained in the culture of the Inupiat people.\n  Becoming a whaling captain is one of the greatest honors possible, \nand carries with it great responsibility. Whaling captains provide gear \nand supplies for their crews at significant cost, yet when a whale is \ntaken, they receive no compensation other than the knowledge of a job \nwell done, for which they are not even allowed to deduct their costs as \ncharitable contributions. It is a job that is important not only to the \nwhalers themselves, but to every resident of the whaling communities, \nwhere their catch is shared between young and old alike.\n  But that long history and honorable practice suffered a serious blow \nat the recent International Whaling Commission meeting in Shimoneseki, \nJapan. Nations promoting the resumption of commercial whaling, led by \nJapan itself, engineered a vote to reject the proposed renewal of \nquotas for Eskimo whaling.\n   It is clear from a statement released by the Japanese Fisheries \nAgency on May 24 that this action was taken solely to retaliate against \nthe United States for our opposition to the resumption of commercial \nwhaling, specifically our rejection of a small quota of Minke whales \nfor four coastal villages. There is a word for such an action, and that \nword is ``spiteful.''\n  This is not the way international negotiations should be conducted.\n  Alaska's aboriginal whaling has nothing to do with commercial \nwhaling, and everything to do with honoring a way of life that has come \nto be synonymous with survival for Alaska's Inupiat people.\n  It is not that I lack sympathy for the Japanese people, or the long \nhistory of whaling that is part of the culture of those four Japanese \ncoastal villages. I happen to believe that history also should be \nhonored, and I hope that an agreeable solution to the current dilemma \nwill be developed in the near future.\n  Nor can I suggest that this development was a complete surprise. \nJapan has long sought the resumption of commercial whaling, which is, \nin fact, the stated purpose of the International Whaling Commission. It \nhas long warned that some form of retaliation might result from our \ncontinued opposition in the face of scientific evidence that some whale \npopulations, such as the Minke whales sought by the coastal villages, \nhave fully recovered and could support the resumption of whaling.\n  Japan complains that the U.S. is being ``unfair.'' How could anything \nbe more unfair than the action Japan has orchestrated against Alaska's \nInupiat people?\n  I repeat, that this is not how international negotiations should be \nconducted. Targeting Alaska's Inupiat whaling is not justified and can \nonly serve to further alienate even those who might be sympathetic to \nthe Japanese villages.\n  The resolution I am introducing today condemns this unwarranted \ndevelopment, and calls on U.S. authorities to do everything in their \npower to ensure that aboriginal subsistence whaling in Alaska is \nallowed to continue under the same carefully crafted and scientifically \njustified system that currently guides it. I understand the various \nexecutive branch agencies with an interest in this issue are already \nengaged in doing just that, and they deserve our enthusiastic support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5544-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 286--COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING THE LOS ANGELES \nLAKERS FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING DRIVE, DISCIPLINE, AND MASTERY IN WINNING \n         THE 2002 NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 121\n\n       Whereas community, migrant, public housing, and homeless \n     health centers (referred to in this concurrent resolution as \n     ``health centers'') are nonprofit, community-owned and \n     community-operated health providers and are vital to the \n     Nation's communities;\n       Whereas there are more than 1,000 health centers serving \n     12,000,000 people at more than 4,000 health delivery sites, \n     spanning urban and rural communities in all 50 States, the \n     District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin \n     Islands;\n       Whereas health centers have provided cost-effective, \n     quality health care to the Nation's poor and medically \n     underserved (including the working poor, the uninsured, and \n     many high-risk and vulnerable populations), acting as a vital \n     safety net in the Nation's health delivery system, meeting \n     escalating health needs, and reducing health disparities;\n       Whereas health centers provide care to 1 of every 9 \n     uninsured Americans, 1 of every 8 low-income Americans, and 1 \n     of every 10 rural Americans, and without health centers these \n     Americans would otherwise lack access to health care;\n       Whereas health centers and other innovative programs in \n     primary and preventive\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\n     care reach out to 650,000 homeless persons and 700,000 farm \n     workers;\n       Whereas health centers make health care responsive and \n     cost-effective by integrating the delivery of primary care \n     with aggressive outreach, patient education, translation, and \n     enabling support services;\n       Whereas health centers increase the use of preventive \n     health services such as immunizations, Pap smears, \n     mammograms, and glaucoma screenings;\n       Whereas in communities served by health centers, infant \n     mortality rates have been reduced by between 10 and 40 \n     percent;\n       Whereas health centers are built by community initiative;\n       Whereas Federal grants provide seed money to empower \n     communities to find partners and resources and to recruit \n     doctors and needed health professionals;\n       Whereas Federal grants, on average, contribute 22 percent \n     of a health center's budget, with the remainder provided by \n     State and local governments, medicare, medicaid, private \n     contributions, private insurance, and patient fees;\n       Whereas health centers are community-oriented and patient-\n     focused;\n       Whereas health centers tailor their services to fit the \n     special needs and priorities of communities by working \n     together with schools, businesses, churches, community \n     organizations, foundations, and State and local governments;\n       Whereas health centers contribute to the health and well-\n     being of their communities by keeping children healthy and in \n     school and helping adults remain productive and on the job;\n       Whereas health centers engage citizen participation and \n     provide jobs for 50,000 community residents; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a National Community Health \n     Center Week for the week beginning on August 18, 2002, would \n     raise awareness of the health services provided by health \n     centers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there should be established a National Community Health \n     Center Week for the week beginning on August 18, 2002, to \n     raise awareness of health services provided by health \n     centers; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States and interested organizations \n     to observe such a week with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution, along with my colleagues, Senators Durbin, Bond, and \nHollings, that would establish the week of August 18, 2002, as National \nCommunity Health Center Week.\n  Community, migrant, public housing, and homeless health centers are \nnonprofit providers of health care for our Nation's medically \nunderserved. An essential element of our Nation's safety net, health \ncenters provide care to 1 of every 9 uninsured Americans, 1 of every 8 \nlow-income Americans and 1 of every 10 rural Americans. In rural and \nsmall communities, health centers are often the only health care \nproviders, and in many cases can be the difference between life and \ndeath. Communities served by these health care centers have experienced \nreduced infant mortality rates by as much as 10 and 40 percent. Not \nonly are health centers contributing to the physical well-being of \ncommunities, they are also contributing to the economic well-being of \nthe communities where they are located, by employing over 50,000 \ncommunity residents nationwide.\n  I commend President Bush for recognizing the valuable role of \ncommunity health centers. The President has wisely called for the \nestablishment of 1,200 new and expanded health center sites by 2006 \nthat will enable health centers to serve more than 16 million patients \nannually.\n  Congress should also pay tribute to the role of these centers in \nimproving the health and well-being of our Nation's poor and medically \nunderserved by establishing the week of August 18, 2002, as National \nCommunity Health Center Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5545-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3835.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) insurance firms that provide property and casualty \n     insurance are important financial institutions, the products \n     of which allow mutualization of risk and the efficient use of \n     financial resources and enhance the ability of the economy to \n     maintain stability, while responding to a variety of \n     economic, political, environmental, and other risks with a \n     minimum of disruption;\n       (2) insurance firms that provide group term life and \n     accidental death insurance are important financial \n     institutions, the products of which allow employers, labor \n     unions, and other groups to protect their employees and \n     members against the financial impact of untimely death and \n     allow their employees and members to make financial \n     provisions for their families and other beneficiaries at \n     reasonable cost;\n       (3) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain \n     property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable \n     prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and \n     catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban \n     development, and the construction and maintenance of public \n     and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United \n     States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly \n     interconnected world;\n       (4) the ability of employers, labor unions, and other \n     groups to obtain group life and accidental death insurance is \n     critical to the ability of such groups to attract employees \n     and members, which is vital to sustained high levels of \n     employment and economic growth;\n       (5) insurance firms that provide property and casualty \n     insurance and insurance firms that provide group life and \n     accidental death insurance face similar concentrations of \n     financial risk;\n       (6) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the \n     unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of \n     terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the \n     recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the \n     stability of the economy;\n       (7) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     including the absence of information from which financial \n     institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the \n     probability and cost of future terrorist events, and \n     therefore the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of \n     loss caused by such acts of terrorism;\n       (8) a decision by insurers to deal with such uncertainties, \n     either by terminating or excluding coverage for losses \n     arising from terrorist events, or by radically escalating \n     premium coverage to compensate for risks of loss that are not \n     readily predictable, could seriously hamper ongoing and \n     planned construction, property acquisition, and other \n     business projects, generate a dramatic increase in rents, \n     otherwise suppress economic activity and deprive the \n     beneficiaries of group life insureds the financial security \n     and benefits of such coverage; and\n       (9) the United States Government should provide temporary \n     financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to \n     the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of \n     national crisis, while the financial services industry \n     develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs \n     necessary to create a viable financial services market for \n     private terrorism risk insurance.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent \n     system of shared public and private compensation for insured \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to--\n       (1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and \n     ensure the continued widespread availability and \n     affordability of property and casualty insurance and group \n     life and accidental death insurance for terrorism risk; and\n       (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets \n     to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build \n     capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State \n     insurance regulation and consumer protections.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Act of terrorism.--\n       (A) Certification.--The term ``act of terrorism'' means any \n     act that is certified by the Secretary, in concurrence with \n     the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General of the \n     United States--\n       (i) to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to--\n\n       (I) human life;\n       (II) property; or\n       (III) infrastructure;\n\n       (ii) to have resulted in damage or loss of life within the \n     United States, or outside the United States in the case of an \n     air carrier described in paragraph (3)(A)(ii); and\n       (iii) to have been committed by an individual or \n     individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign \n     interest, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian \n     population of the United States or to influence the policy or \n     affect the conduct of the United States Government by \n     coercion.\n       (B) Limitation.--No act or event shall be certified by the \n     Secretary as an act of terrorism if--\n       (i) the act or event is committed in the course of a war \n     declared by the Congress; or\n       (ii) losses resulting from the act or event, in the \n     aggregate, do not exceed $5,000,000.\n       (C) Determinations final.--Any certification of, or \n     determination not to certify, an act or event as an act of \n     terrorism under this paragraph shall be final, and shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n       (2) Business interruption coverage.--The term ``business \n     interruption coverage'' means--\n       (A) coverage of losses for temporary relocation expenses \n     and ongoing expenses, including ordinary wages, where--\n       (i) there is physical damage to the business premises of \n     such magnitude that the business cannot open for business;\n       (ii) there is physical damage to other property that \n     totally prevents customers or employees from gaining access \n     to the business premises; or\n       (iii) the Federal, State, or local government shuts down an \n     area due to physical or environmental damage, thereby \n     preventing customers or employees from gaining access to the \n     business premises;

The annual premium shall be paid in installments at the \n     end of each calendar quarter. The reinsurance contract \n     premium and any annual assessment may be recovered by a \n     participating insurer from its covered lines policyholders as \n     a direct surcharge calculated as a uniform percentage of \n     premium.\n       (2) Additional credit risk premium.--If the Secretary \n     determines that a participating insurer has a credit rating \n     that is lower than the second from highest credit rating \n     awarded by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, the \n     Secretary may charge an additional credit risk premium, of up \n     to 0.5 percent of gross direct written premiums for covered \n     lines received by that insurer, to compensate the Fund for \n     credit risk associated with providing reinsurance to that \n     insurer.\n       (b) Initial Capital.--\n       (1) Loan.--The Fund shall have an initial capital of \n     $2,000,000,000, which the Secretary shall borrow from the \n     Treasury of the United States.

Upon application by the \n     Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to \n     the Fund, out of amounts in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, the requested amount as an interest-bearing \n     loan.\n       (2) Interest rate.--The rate of interest on any loan made \n     to the Fund under paragraph (1) shall be established by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury and based on the weighted average \n     credit rating of the Fund before the loss that made the loan \n     necessary.\n       (3) $50 billion loan limit.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the total amount of loans outstanding \n     at any time from the Treasury to the Fund may not exceed the \n     amount by which $50,000,000,000 exceeds the Fund's assets.\n       (4) Repayment of loans by assessment.--Any loan under \n     paragraph (1) shall be repaid from reserves of the Fund, \n     assessments of participating insurers, or a combination \n     thereof. If an assessment is necessary, the maximum annual \n     assessment under this subsection shall be not more than 3 \n     percent of the direct written premium for covered lines. The \n     reinsurance contract premium and any annual assessment may be \n     recovered by a participating insurer from its covered lines \n     policyholders as a direct surcharge calculated as a uniform \n     percentage of premium.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of S. Res. 286 submitted earlier today by Senators \nFeinstein and Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 286) commending and congratulating \n     the Los Angeles Lakers for their outstanding drive, \n     discipline, and mastery in winning the 2002 National \n     Basketball Association Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Madam President, I rise today with my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Barbara Boxer, to commend and congratulate the Los \nAngeles Lakers for winning the 2002 National Basketball Association \nChampionship last night.\n  Clearly, the Lakers are one of the most distinguished franchises in \nthe history of professional sports. In sweeping a talented and game New \nJersey Nets team, the Lakers won their third straight championship and \ntheir fourteenth overall.\n  Led by coach Phil Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant, the \nLakers could not be denied. Shaquille O'Neal dominated the Finals and \nwon his third straight National Basketball Association Finals Most \nValuable Player award after scoring a record 145 points in a four game \nseries.\n  Another superstar, Kobe Bryant, averaged 26.8 points, 5.3 assists, \nand 5.8 rebounds during the Finals series after being named to the \n2001-2002 All-National Basketball Association First Team. In addition, \nhe delighted fans with his usual collection of highlight material \nplays.\n  Coach Phil Jackson also had a record breaking night. He won his ninth \nNational Basketball Association title, tying the record of the \nlegendary Boston Celtics coach, Red Auerbach. In addition, he won his \n156th post-season game, surpassing former Lakers coach Pat Riley to \nbecome the winningest playoff coach in National Basketball Association \nhistory.\n  But it should be pointed out that the Lakers could not have won the \nchampionship without the hard work and dedication of the entire team: \nRick Fox, Derrick Fisher, Robert Horry, Brian Shaw, Devean George, \nLindsey Hunter, Samaki Walker, Mark Madsen, Slava Medvedenko, and Mitch \nRichmond.\n  I also want to congratulate team owner Dr. Jerry Buss, General \nManager Mitch Kupchak and all the others who put in the time and effort \nto bring another championship to the City of Angels. And, most \nimportantly, I would like to thank the Laker fans in Los Angeles and \nthroughout the state for being there for the team every step of the \nway.\n  The 2001-2002 Los Angeles Lakers have written another chapter in the \nhistory of one of the National Basketball Association's storied \nfranchises and will certainly go down as one of the greatest teams of \nall time.\n  They have made the City of Los Angeles and the State of California \nproud.\n  The Los Angeles Lakers are a team with a tremendous amount of heart, \nstamina, determination and a clear will to win. I have no doubt that \nthis team stands ready to make a run at a fourth straight championship \nand add yet another banner to the rafters of the Staples Center.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was pulling for the Sacramento team. I \nhave to say, as much as I dislike the Lakers, they sure came through in \nthe clutch. They really know how to win. You have to admire them for \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be agreed to en \nbloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record, without further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 286) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 286\n\n       Whereas the Los Angeles Lakers are 1 of the greatest sports \n     franchises in history;\n       Whereas the Laker organization has won 14 National \n     Basketball Association Championships;\n       Whereas the Los Angeles Lakers are only the fifth team to \n     win 3 consecutive National Basketball Association \n     Championships and the seventh team to sweep the finals 4 \n     games to none;\n       Whereas the Laker organization has fielded such legendary \n     superstars as George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, \n     Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, \n     and now, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant;\n       Whereas Shaquille O'Neal won his third straight National \n     Basketball Association Finals Most Valuable Player award, \n     joining Michael Jordan as the only player to win 3 \n     consecutive awards;\n       Whereas Shaquille O'Neal scored a record 145 points in the \n     2002 4-game finals series;\n       Whereas Shaquille O'Neal's 59.5 percent career field goal \n     percentage in National Basketball Association Finals games is \n     number 1 all-time and his 34.2 point scoring average ranks \n     second;\n       Whereas Kobe Bryant was named to the 2001-2002 All-National \n     Basketball Association First Team after averaging 25.5 points \n     per game, 5.5 rebounds per game, and 5.5 assists per game \n     during the regular season;\n       Whereas Kobe Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, and \n     5.3 assists during the 2002 National Basketball Association \n     Finals;\n       Whereas Coach Phil Jackson won his ninth National \n     Basketball Association title, tying the record of legendary \n     Boston Celtics coach, Red Auerbach;\n       Whereas Coach Phil Jackson won his 156th postseason game, \n     surpassing former Lakers Coach Pat Riley to become the \n     winningest playoff coach in National Basketball Association \n     history;\n       Whereas the Los Angeles Lakers epitomize the spirit of \n     their hometown with their determination, heart, stamina, and \n     amazing comeback ability;\n       Whereas the support of all the Los Angeles fans and the \n     people of California propelled the Los Angeles Lakers to \n     another National Basketball Association Championship; and\n       Whereas the Los Angeles Lakers are poised to win a fourth \n     straight National Basketball Association Championship next \n     season: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends and congratulates the \n     Los Angeles Lakers on winning the 2002 National Basketball \n     Association Championship Title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/13/senate-section/article/S5561-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JUNE 14, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
