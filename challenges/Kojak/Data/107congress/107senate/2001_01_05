Praise to You, for the \nprivilege of power is the antidote to this pride. With power comes \npower struggles to determine who is in control. These power struggles \ncan denigrate our awareness that You are in control. In this \nunprecedented time when power must be shared by the parties, bless the \nSenators with an equally unprecedented measure of trust in each other \nand each other's parties.\n  Dear Father, work in the minds and hearts of the Senators as they \nconsider the Senate committee organization. May this Senate exemplify \nto the Nation that great leaders can work together. When You are our \nLord, there is no need to lord it over others; when we remember our \naccountability to You, we can be accommodating to one another. May it \nbe so in this Senate for Your glory and the good of our beloved Nation. \nYou are Lord.

Mr. President, we have been in a quorum call this morning \nand for some part of yesterday. I know news reports are explaining to \nthe American people that we are in the process of organizing in the \nSenate at this point and it has been a bit difficult because, for the \nfirst time in the history of our country, the Senate is evenly split as \nbetween Republicans and Democrats.\n  There was an occasion in the last century, about 120 years ago or so, \nin which there was an equal number of Republicans and Democrats. But \nthere were also two Independents serving in the Senate at the time. \nHaving read a bit about that period of time, my understanding is the \nIndependents had quite an interesting time bargaining as between the \ntwo political parties about what their respective roles might be, \nshould they choose to assist one political party or another.\n  But that is not the case in this circumstance. We are evenly split. \nThe American people caused that to happen. They sent 50 Republican \nSenators and 50 Democrat Senators here to the Senate. It is my hope \nthat the negotiations currently underway between the Democratic leader, \nnow the majority\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nleader, Senator Daschle, and the Republican leader, Senator Lott, will \nbear fruit and that we will be able to organize in a manner that is \nconsistent with the wishes of the American people. The American people \nhave, by their desire, said that they want a split Senate, in fact a \ndead-even tie.\n  That would say to us that after January 20, the Vice President-elect, \nRichard Cheney, will have the opportunity to give the Republicans an \nadditional vote in this Chamber for the purpose of organizing. That is \ncertainly true. But it is not the case that the Vice President, in his \npresiding role according to the Constitution, is going to play a role \nin any committee in this Congress. There is no such role for the Vice \nPresident. Therefore, in each and every committee we have a \nrepresentation from 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, a selection, then, \nof which is made to the committee membership. We feel very strongly \nthat those committees ought to have a membership of 50/50.\n  Yesterday, we had the first hearing in the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation on which I serve. Senator McCain, who is \nthe chairman of that committee--actually yesterday it was Senator \nHollings who was technically the Chair, and Senator McCain works very \nclosely with Senator Hollings--Senator McCain, in his opening \nstatement, said: The way this committee works, we don't report things \nout of this committee that represent a partisan division. We work our \nissues out between the Republicans and Democrats. What we bring to the \nfloor of the Senate, he said, from the Commerce Committee, represents a \nconsensus among the members of the Commerce Committee.\n  He is right about that. He is a person who has chaired that committee \nall of the years that I have served on it in a circumstance where he \nreally searches for ways to find common ground between the two \npolitical parties. Much to his credit, I must say, Senator McCain has \nsaid he believes a 50/50 split on the committee is appropriate, given \nthe fact that the Senate is split 50/50. I only mention that because \njust yesterday he made the point that a 50/50 split will not make much \ndifference in committees where you work in a bipartisan way, and we do \nthat--and he does that.\n  But it is my hope that now, in the coming hours, that Senator Lott \nand Senator Daschle will be able to reach an agreement that is fair and \none that allows us to do our work and allows us to organize our \ncommittees. I feel very strongly the product of that work should at the \nvery least provide a 50/50 membership on the committees.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, he is right on the mark. Senator McCain \nis quoted in the paper today, almost verbatim what the Senator from \nNorth Dakota said. He said, as quoted in the paper: I don't report \nthings out of my committee on a partisan basis. If I did, they won't go \nanyplace anyway. And, in reality, the Senate is divided 50/50.\n  He went on further to say, as he understood the framework of the \nagreement, the Democrats would allow him to be chairman. He thought \nthat was a pretty good deal.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, in the form of a question, and \nask if he would agree: The fact is, the Senate is divided 50/50. As I \nsaid before, it doesn't matter what kind of math you use; 50 Democrats \nand 50 Republicans comes out equally. It would seem to me that the \ncommittee structure should be equal.\n  Again, reading in the Washington Times, which seemed to be a press \nrelease from the dissidents--I should not say ``the dissidents''--it \nseemed to be a press release from those people opposing equality in the \nSenate. It appeared to be a press release they issued. They are saying: \nI don't understand. We are going to be in the majority. We deserve to \nhave one more on the committee.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, and I ask if he would agree \nwith me: The Republicans are not in the majority in the Senate of the \nUnited States. On the organizational matters, there will never be any \ntie the Vice President can vote upon, as Alan Simpson said, formerly \nthe assistant Republican leader and Republican whip. As he said: The \nRepublicans will be killed by the public publicity-wise if they try to \noppose equality in the Senate.\n  He went on further to say that he thought the committee chairmanships \nshould rotate on a yearly basis.\n  So again in the form of a question: I would hope, as I am sure my \nfriend from North Dakota hopes, that the work of our leader, Senator \nDaschle, and their leader, Senator Lott, comes to fruition. These men \nhave worked extremely hard. They deserve the support of their two \ncaucuses. What they are trying to do, as I understand it, is come up \nwith something that is fair. That is all the majority of this Senate \nwants. The majority of the Senate wants a 50/50 division. If we had a \nvote on that today, that is how it would take place. So we should get \nthat here as quickly as possible and get on with the business of the \nSenate. Then we would not be in quorum calls here.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota agree?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the senior Senator from North \nDakota has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent, in that I took so much time of my \nfriend from North Dakota, that his time be extended for another 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say in response to the remarks of the \nSenator from Nevada, I certainly agree with his comments. It is not a \ncircumstance where I believe there is any ill will anywhere in this \nChamber on those issues. It is hard for a party that has been the \nmajority for there now to be a circumstance where they are not the \nmajority. In fact, they are in a body that is split evenly, 50/50. That \nis not easy. That is hard to deal with. I understand that. I do not \nsuggest there is ill will anywhere. I am sure they are trying to \ngrapple through these issues and how to respond to that.\n  But I must make another comment. This is not unusual. It has not \nhappened in this body, but it has happened plenty of times around this \ncountry. On many occasions, somewhere over 30 occasions, the \nlegislative bodies in the States--either a State Senate or a State \nHouse of Representatives--has discovered itself to be evenly divided, \ntied with respect to the number of Republicans or Democrats. \nIncidentally, I sent a report to Senators on this and, in every case, \nthey had to reach an agreement. You know, they said: What we have is a \nmembership that is equally divided, so how do we respond to this? Some \nState legislative bodies said we will have 50/50 splits on the \ncommittees. Some said we will have cochairs. Some said we will have \nrotating chairmanships. They have made all kinds of accommodations for \nit. In fact, in one State they actually just flipped a coin and decided \nwho was in the majority by a coin toss. There are so many different \nmechanisms for States to make these decisions. We have not had to make \nthose decisions until now.\n\n  What I hope will happen is that Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, in \nthe coming couple of hours, because time is of the essence here, will \nbe able to reach an agreement that is fair to every Member of this \nChamber and fair to both political parties.\n  We don't want that which we don't deserve. But we do believe that if, \nby virtue of the decisions made by the American people, we have 50 \npercent of the membership of a body of 100, we have the opportunity to \nhave that same percent of the membership on the committees, because \nthat, after all, is where the work originates that eventually comes to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I graduated in a high school class of nine--top five, incidentally. I \nunderstood from either lower math or higher math, that when you have \n100 seats and 50 are Republicans and 50 are Democrats, that is called a \ntie. That is the basis of all of this negotiation.\n  Let us hope in the next few hours our two leaders can reach final \nagreement. Then we will turn, next week, to a circumstance where we \nhave the capability of organizing and making all of the committee \nassignments and move on to deal with the nominations sent to us by \nPresident-elect Bush.\n  If such an agreement is not reached, of course, if there are some \ndiscordant voices in the Senate who say, ``It doesn't matter it is 50/\n50, we insist on having a majority in every circumstance in every \nway,'' if that is the\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\ncase, of course those many of us who feel very strongly about the need \nto have the opportunity to have a 50/50 split on the committees would \nnot want to allow that to happen. There will then ensue, of course, a \nbattle about organizing.\n  Let's avoid that. Let's not do that. Let us, today, in the next \ncouple of hours, resolve this in the right way and in a fair way. If we \ndo that, we will have best served the American people's interest.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator can be interrupted, and I will be very \nquick, he raises an important issue. People in the State of Nevada in \n1985 had a tie in the Nevada State Assembly, equal numbers of Democrats \nand Republicans. It was one of the most productive sessions in the \nhistory of the Nevada Legislature.\n  Evan Bayh, when he was Governor of the State of Indiana, had a tie in \nthe State Legislature. That was one of the most productive in the \nhistory of the State Legislature.\n  I say to my friend, he is absolutely right on target. I also say, in \naddition to Senator McCain, there are other people who will become \nchairmen after January 20, Republicans, who stated 50/50 is a fair way \nto do things.\n  I hope we can work this out. I know people have strong feelings, but \nI hope the two leaders will be able to bring something to us so we can \nget down to the work at hand. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point is, we wish Senator Daschle and Senator Lott \nwell and hope they succeed in reaching an agreement, and we pledge our \ncooperation to help them do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S31-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S31-S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to briefly \ntalk about the Federal Reserve Board and our economy because it is \nimportant we have some discussion on what is happening in our economy.\n  I have been watching in recent days the announcements both by the \nFederal Reserve Board and also the way the press in this country has \nportrayed the discussions about a softening or weakening economy and \nthe Federal Reserve Board's attempts to respond to it by cutting \ninterest rates.\n  Let me first say uncharacteristically that the Fed did the right \nthing a few days ago by reducing the Federal funds rate by 50 basis \npoints. The interest rates imposed by the Fed have been historically \ntoo high. Seven months ago, the Federal Reserve Board increased \ninterest rates for the sixth time, and that was 50 basis points. Do my \ncolleagues know why the Fed did that 7 months ago? Because the Federal \nReserve Board said America had an economy that was too strong and \ngrowing too rapidly.\n  The reason I want to have this brief discussion today is to say this \neconomic slowdown people talk about is not an accident. The Federal \nReserve Board believed the economy was growing too rapidly. They \nworried, therefore, that it would ignite a new wave of inflation. In my \njudgment, that was not a logical conclusion of the economic growth we \nwere seeing, but nonetheless, Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve \nBoard deliberately wanted to slow down the economy.\n  What is the result of all of that? Let me read a couple of headlines: \n``Slowing Factory Activity Hints at Recession. Sharp Drop Is Weakest \nMonthly Reading Since 1991.'' USA Today.\n  ``GM to Idle Eight Plants Next Week.'' Associated Press, January 4.\n  ``Sears to Close 89 Locations.'' This morning's Washington Post.\n  ``E-Toys to Eliminate 700 Jobs.''\n  ``Covad to Lay Off 400 Workers.''\n  I think one gets the point. This economy is slowing. The Federal \nReserve Board increased interest rates six times since June 1999, the \nlast time 7 months ago, by 50 basis points, believing that despite \nhigher productivity growth by the American workers there would be a new \nwave of inflation, and intending that it had to respond to an economy \nthat was growing too rapidly. In my judgment, they were mistaken. I \nsaid so at the time on the floor of the Senate.\n  Seven months later after saying the economy was growing too rapidly, \nwe have all these news reports that, gee, this economy is slowing. I \nwish the reporters would ascribe that slow growth now or the slowdown \nof the economy to the Fed's actions. This was medicine administered by \nan economic doctor 7 months ago and the months previous to that on five \nother occasions because the Fed believed our economy was growing too \nrapidly. It was the wrong medicine at the wrong time. The result is a \nslowdown, in many cases, perhaps, a slowdown that is more dramatic than \nthe Fed intended. Because of that, 2 days ago the Fed decided it would \ndecrease the Federal funds rate by 50 basis points. The problem is that \ndoes not always take effect quickly. It takes some while for it to \ncourse its way through our economy.\n  A 50-basis-point reduction is not enough. The Federal funds rate, and \ntherefore all other interest rates, are still high historically \nrelative to the current rate of inflation. It is, therefore, a tax on \nthe cost of money. An average American household, because of the \nprevious six interest rate increases imposed by the Fed, is now paying \n$1,700 a year in additional interest charges. Think of the chaos that \nwould have caused had someone come to the floor of the Senate and said: \nWe have a proposal. We think the economy is doing too well, and we \nwould like to ask every American family to pay $1,700 more a year in \ntaxes. Think of the debate about that.\n\n  Higher cost of credit is a tax on the American people artificially \nimposed by the Fed. Interest rates that are higher than are \njustifiable. Real interest rates, above the rate of inflation, are \nstill extraordinarily high, and in my judgment, represent a wrongheaded \npublic policy.\n  We will see if we get out of this with a slowdown that is a soft \nlanding and slow, gradual growth once again, or whether the Fed has \nreally miscalculated and increased interest rates so much that it took \nthis economy off track. I hope it is not the latter. I hope it is the \nformer. I am not wishing a bad result, but I am saying the next time \nsomeone talks about this economy--I heard some conservative \ncommentators say this is the Clinton slowdown. This slowdown is \nengineered by the Federal Reserve Board. They talked about it, they \ninsisted upon it, they voted upon it, and now 7 months later, we bear \nthe fruit that might be a bitter fruit. I want people to understand.\n  I kind of yearn for the day--and I was not here then--when we debated \ninterest rate policies all across this country. Read the economic and \nfinancial history of this country and you will find that a century and \na half ago, the question of interest rates and monetary policy was \ndebated from bar rooms to barber shops all across this country. As late \nas 50 years ago, a quarter point increase in the Federal funds rate \nimposed by the Fed would be front page headlines and debated at great \nlength, but not anymore.\n  The Fed acts imperviously to public input. It is the last dinosaur in \ntown. It operates behind locked closed doors. The American public is \nnot allowed in, and no President will comment much about the Fed \nbecause they are worried they will upset the market. So they went on \ntheir merry way 7 months ago believing they ought to slow down the \nAmerican economy.\n  The next time you hear about this economic slowdown, understand it \nwas engineered by the Federal Reserve Board and let us hope they take \naggressive additional action--not just the 50 basis points a couple \ndays ago--but aggressive additional action to put interest rates where \nthey ought to be relative to the rate of inflation and stop overtaxing \nthe American families by engineering the higher cost of credit they \nhave caused in the last year and a half that is unjustifiable.\n  It probably is shouting in the wind to talk about the Federal Reserve \nBoard, but it is, nonetheless, therapeutic for me, so I continue to do \nit.\n  I very much hope we can continue an economy that produces the rewards \nof new jobs and new opportunities and hope for all Americans. We need a \nbalanced fiscal policy and a balanced monetary policy to do that. The \nFed controls monetary policy absolutely. We control fiscal policy. We \nwill have, I assume in a matter of weeks, people bringing to the floor \nof the Senate very substantial proposals for tax cuts, as some say, \n$1.3 trillion or $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, to respond to \nthis very issue of an economic slowdown. Again, I say this slowdown was\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\ndeliberately engineered by the Fed. We need to be very careful, \nhowever, on fiscal policy which we control not to put this country back \nin the same peril of budget deficits in the future. It would be very \nirresponsible to begin permanently disposing of a surplus that is \nprojected in the future but that has not yet occurred.\n  If we have a surplus, and I hope we do, that results from a growing \neconomy, a fair amount of it ought to be used to reduce Federal debt. \nIf during tough times we run up Federal indebtedness, during good times \nsurely we must pay it down. What better gift to America's children than \nthat? If we have surpluses in the future, and I hope we do, some of it, \nin my judgment, can and should go back to the American families who pay \ntheir taxes and could use some tax relief, but not just with a formula \nthat deals with income taxes.\n\n  Most Americans pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. If we are \ngoing to send money back in the form of tax relief--and we should if we \nhave these surpluses, after we have allocated some to reducing the \nFederal debt--then let us make sure we understand we send it back based \non the total tax burden the American families face, and that includes \nthe payroll tax.\n  Finally, if we have surpluses--and I hope we will--some of it should \nbe devoted as well to the investments in the things that make America a \nbetter place in which to live: Sending our kids into the best \nclassrooms in the world, building our infrastructure, providing for our \nhealth, and those kinds of issues as well.\n  Mr. President, you have been generous with time today.\n  Again, let me hope that this day ends with good news for all of us in \nour ability to organize. We will continue these debates later in \nJanuary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S32-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur at 3:30 and that it be a unanimous-consent request for a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I will \nnot object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the request be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is so vitiated.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be recognized at this point, I do \nwant to say I was certainly willing to cooperate with that. I have \nasked if there is a Member who feels the necessity of a recorded vote. \nI have not been so notified. I want to make sure Members understand we \nanticipate there will be a voice vote. However, there will be \nopportunity for debate and a colloquy which Senator Daschle and I will \nhave between now and 3:30.\n  So Members can have some idea of what to expect, we do expect to have \nthe vote around 3:30. In the debate or comments that will need to be \nput in the Record, they can still be made after that. But between now \nand that time, we still have an opportunity for Members to present \ntheir statements on the Record.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I now, again, suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The other day, I quoted the writer Thomas Wolfe who \nsaid:\n\n       America is not only the place where miracles happen, they \n     happen all the time.\n\n  If the resolution I will soon introduce is not miraculous, it is, at \nthe very least, historic. It is also fair and reasonable. The details \nand the spirit of this agreement, which I expect the Senate to pass \nlater today, should enable us to conduct our Nation's first 50/50 \nSenate in a most productive and bipartisan manner.\n  I especially thank the Republican leader, Senator Lott. We will enter \ninto a colloquy in a period of time to be later determined, but I must \nsay, without his leadership and his sense of basic fairness, this \nagreement would not have come about. He and I have spent many hours \nover the last several months, and now weeks, and certainly in the last \nseveral days, negotiating the details of this agreement. He spent many \nmore hours consulting with the members of his caucus about it. He and \nthey deserve credit for taking this unprecedented step.\n  I also thank and commend my colleagues on this side of the aisle for \ntheir good counsel and patience as this agreement was negotiated, and \nfor their support of the finished product. I particularly thank our \ndistinguished President pro tempore, Robert C. Byrd, for his advice. \nWhen you are making history, you can't have a better guide than the man \nwho has literally written the book on the history of the Senate.\n  Our negotiations involve many difficult issues and many strongly held \nopinions. Neither party got everything it wanted. Both sides made \nconcessions. Both caucuses made principled compromises. That is the \nessence of democracy.\n  This agreement accurately reflects the historic composition of the \nSenate. More important, I believe it reflects the political thinking of \nthe American people. It calls for equal representation on Senate \ncommittees. Every committee would have the same number of Republicans \nand Democrats. And it specifies that Republicans will chair the \ncommittees after January 20. It allows for equal budgets and office \nspace for both caucuses, at 50/50.\n  One of the most vexing questions we struggled with during our \nnegotiations was how to break ties when committees are divided equally. \nWe have agreed that in the event of a tie vote, either leader can move \nto discharge a bill or nomination. The Senate will then debate the \nmotion to discharge for four hours, and that time will be equally \ndivided. There will then be a vote on the motion. If the motion passes, \nthe bill or nomination would be placed on the calendar.\n  Similarly, the resolution allows committee Chairs to discharge a \nsubcommittee in the case of a tie vote and place the legislative item \nor nomination on the full committee agenda.\n  We arrived at this process after much thinking and exchange of ideas. \nSenator Lott has been concerned that equal representation on the \ncommittees could lead to gridlock. While I do not share that concern, I \nbelieve this was a fair concession to get this agreement.\n  As to cloture, the resolution provides that no cloture resolution \nshall be filed by either party except to end a debate, and in no case \nwould cloture be filed before at least 12 hours of debate.\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\n  This provision reflects concerns on our side of the aisle. We wanted \nto ensure that there would be an opportunity for debate before cloture \nwas filed. Here, too, I believe Senator Lott and the Republicans have \nprovided a fair compromise.\n\n  The resolution provides that the majority leader shall retain his \nprerogative to obtain first right of recognition but that both leaders \nmay be recognized, as is currently the case, to make motions to \nproceed; and in scheduling legislation on the floor, both leaders shall \nattempt to attain an equal balance of the interests of either of the \ntwo parties; and if either party achieves a true majority during the \n107th Congress, we would need to adopt a new organizing resolution.\n  Senator Lott and I have discussed other ways to ensure bipartisanship \nin the Senate, from the right to offer amendments to the makeup of \nconference committees. We have pledged to work together to make the \nSenate operate in a fair and bipartisan manner, which I hope will \nenable us to demonstrate to the American people that their system of \ngovernment is strong and sound.\n  I have been asked what bipartisanship will mean in the 107th \nCongress. We cannot quantify bipartisanship. Bipartisanship is not a \nmathematical formula; it is a spirit. It is a way of working together \nthat tolerates open debate. It recognizes principled compromise--such \nas today's historic agreement. Bipartisanship means respecting the \nright of each Senator to speak his or her mind and vote his or her \nconscience. It means recognizing that we must do business differently \nafter an election that gave us a 50/50 Senate and almost an evenly \ndivided House. Above all, it means putting the national interests above \npersonal or party interests.\n  Tomorrow, Congress will count the electoral ballots and officially \nrecognize the results of the Presidential election. It is fitting that \ntoday we officially recognize the results of the Senate elections which \ngave us an even split between the parties.\n  Today's agreement makes a big downpayment on the bipartisanship we \nowe our country. Democrats and Republicans made significant \nconcessions, putting the national interest first and putting party \naside. It is my hope and my expectation we are witnessing only the \nbeginning of a cooperative and productive 107th Congress. This \ncertainly sets a mark.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wouldn't say this is my preferred result, \nbut I think it is a reasonable one with a serious dose of reality. We \nhave work to do and we need to begin it now, not in a week or two or \nthree or four. We need to conclude the assignment of our Members to the \nall important committees that will be having hearings on the nominees. \nWe need to go forward with the confirmation hearings on the President's \nnominations to the Cabinet, not in 2 weeks or 3 weeks but right away, \nas soon as possible, as soon as the necessary paperwork has been \ncompleted and the schedule has been agreed to by the senior members of \nthe committees.\n  As soon as the Inauguration, we need to have in place a Secretary of \nthe Treasury, a Secretary of State, a Secretary of Defense, perhaps a \nSecretary of Commerce--as many as we can get--so that this new \nadministration will be ready to begin work the morning of Monday, \nJanuary 22.\n  More important than these rules agreements or the organization \nresolution and the hearings of the nominees is, what are we going to do \nwith it? What are we going to do about the concerns of the American \npeople? Will we be able to come together and do what needs to be done \nto improve the quality, availability, accountability, and safety of our \nschools in America? I think we can.\n  But if we in this Chamber wrestle over finite details of the rules--\nwhile they do make a difference, rules do affect substance--I think the \nAmerican people will say: What is this talk of bipartisanship? Why \naren't you coming together, agreeing on this, and moving to the agenda \nof education and dealing with the problems of our defense needs in \nAmerica, dealing with the problem of readiness of the defense of our \ncountry, confronting the needs of our people on Medicare and what we \nare going to do about prescription drugs and Social Security reform?\n  That was a big item in this campaign. To the credit of our President-\nelect, George W. Bush, he had the courage to step up and say we need to \ntake a look at this.\n  The last discussion I had with the Senator from New York, Mr. Pat \nMoynihan, in this aisle was what we should do about reforming Social \nSecurity, how it could be done, and just with two or three actions, we \ncould secure Social Security for 70 years. By the way, he also talked \nabout how he believes there should be some opportunity for individuals \nto invest some of that money.\n  Social Security, Medicare, prescription drugs, defense, education, \ntax relief for working Americans that keeps the economy growing--that \nis the agenda. We are going to have tough debates. We will have \ndifferent approaches, but we will find a way to come together and get a \nresult because the American people are expecting that of us--the \nRepublicans, the Democrats, President George W. Bush, all of us.\n  I would prefer to have a clear advantage on every committee and a \nclear advantage number-wise on everything. While that is preferable, it \nis not the reality. There are those in this Chamber who will not agree \nwith me that we are going to support this resolution. There are those \nin this Chamber who probably will not agree with Senator Daschle that \nthis is enough. Some will say it is too much; others will say it is not \nenough. Who is to say?\n  The day may come when we will say: Well, yes, we didn't do that \nright; we didn't figure some of the things that might happen or the way \nthe rules might be used or abused. If that happens, then we will have \nto deal with it. Senator Daschle and I will have to go to the Member on \nhis side of the aisle or my side of the aisle and say: That is not in \ngood faith. That is not what we intended. Or, when we make a mistake, \nchange it. We have done that. One of the last actions we did this past \nsession was to put back in place a rule dealing with scope coming out \nof conference that we changed a few years earlier. We finally realized \nit was not right, and we changed it.\n  What we have here, as difficult as it may make life for us, as \ndifficult as it may be for our committee members and our chairmen and \nranking members to make this situation work, it is going to require \nadditional work, but it can be done. It is going to force us to work \ntogether more than we have in the past. No doubt. I do not think that \nis bad. I think this is a framework for bipartisanship. There has been \na lot of talk about that word, and I am sure there are some people in \nthis city, in this Chamber, who smirk at that, laugh at that. People \nacross America are saying: I have heard enough of that; let's get some \nresults here.\n\n  It is a framework to see if we really mean it. It can force us to \nlive up to the truest and best meaning of that word--nonpartisanship, \nAmericanship, that is what we ought to call it--to find a way to get to \nthese issues.\n  The President has repeatedly talked about how he is going to be a \nuniter, not a divider; he is going to reach out. Be conservative, yes; \nhe was elected because he is, but he also is compassionate about it.\n  The Government can be involved and be helpful in certain areas. It \ncan be a big problem in a lot of others. I guess I am of the school \nthat follows the latter part of that more than the former, but there \nare clearly some roles for the Federal Government. I do not have to \nlist them--defense, national transportation, health care concerns in \nAmerica. This is America. We cannot leave any child behind. We cannot \nleave any mother or grandmother unattended. We have to be in a position \nto do something about those situations.\n  We should follow the President-elect. Shouldn't we follow him? He has \nlaid down a marker. He has talked about coming together and getting \nresults. Should we do no less?\n  This is a classic case of extending the hand of friendship, of good \nfaith. Will it lead to tremendous accomplishments or will that hand of \nfriendship be bitten or the posterior kicked by one side or the other? \nIt could, but we have to start from a position of good faith and reach \nout and say we are going to make this work.\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\n  If it does not work, then the American people will see. If these 50/\n50 committees do not function, then we can talk about obstructionism, \nand one way or the other, the American people will know who is trying \nto make it work and who is stalling it. If we come to this floor and \nhave a debate on a tax bill and it passes this Senate by whatever \nnumber and does not get to conference or is tied up in conference or is \nkilled in conference, do you think the American people are going to \nstand for that? I do not think so. We cannot let that happen.\n  I have been here 28 years, in the House and Senate. I was here during \nthe eighties. I watched Speaker Tip O'Neill. I had quite a relationship \nwith him. On the floor, we fought like tigers. I even had his words \ntaken down one time. He never uttered a word to me about that. He never \nheld it against me. Privately, he could not have been any friendlier.\n  In instance after instance, even though he controlled the Rules \nCommittee, he had the power to stop the Reagan agenda. He did not do \nit. He would not do it. He said: No, this is the President. He was \nelected. He has a right to have his program considered and voted on. \nAnd the Speaker fought him like a tiger.\n  I remember going to former Congressman--the Senator from Texas was \nthere--Ralph Hall from Texas. I stood on the Democratic side of the \naisle, and the Speaker came up and said: Ralph, you can't vote for this \nReagan budget. I said to my friend, Ralph--actually, it was Sam Hall, \nnot Ralph. Ralph Hall is a good man also.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. That was the deciding vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Sam, this is a chance where you can make a difference for \nhistory. We can control spending some, we can give the people a little \ntax relief in a way that will help the economy grow.\n  He stood there with the two of us looking at him, took out his voting \ncard, stuck it in the box, and voted for it. That required an act of \ncourage. Did the Speaker get mad at him? Did the Speaker rough him up \nor punish him? No. He said: I am going to fight you, President Reagan, \nbut as two good Irishmen, we will get together at the end of the day, \nwe will have a good discussion, we will have a little fun, and we will \ntalk about America.\n  That is what is going to happen here. There will not be \nobstructionism. If there is, it will be clear who is doing it, if it is \non our side, one way or the other, or on the other side. This is not a \nprescription for inaction. It could be a prescription for action beyond \nour wildest imaginations.\n  We are going to talk a little bit more about what is in it. I will \nnot go into all the details here. The resolution will be read. It is \nrelatively short, relatively simple. In instance after instance, \nSenator Daschle and I discussed points, argued about points. When we \ncould not come to agreement, we said we would deal with the rules as \nthey are. So we got it down to what really matters.\n  Yes, we are going to have 50/50 on the committees, but remember the \nSenate is 51/50, it is not 50/50. It is 51/50. The Constitution very \nclearly provides for this. Our forefathers were brilliant. They were \nbrilliant. They could not have seen this exact situation, and while it \nis not unprecedented, it is rare that we have had these ties of 50/50, \nor in one instance I think it was 48/48, maybe one time 38/38. It has \nbeen relatively rare in 200 years, but they provided for this. It is in \nthe Constitution. Senator Byrd carries his around. Mine is not quite as \ntattered as his, but I have referred to it quite a few times in my \nlife.\n  Article I, section 3:\n\n       The Vice President of the United States shall be President \n     of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally \n     divided.\n\n  That is the solution. If it is 50/50, the Vice President breaks the \ntie. It is equally divided. We will have a way to deal with it.\n  My concern about doing 50/50 was: It just cannot work, Senator \nDaschle. If we are killing a nominee or a bill in the subcommittee or \nin the full committee, there has to be a way to have that matter \nconsidered by the full Senate. Do my colleagues think if we had a \nSupreme Court nominee killed on a tie vote in the Judiciary Committee \nthat the American people would stand for that or that the full Senate \nwould be satisfied with that? No.\n  So we labored and we labored, and we tried a lot of different \ninnovative ideas--some I suggested, some Senator Daschle suggested--and \nmost or all of them were not liked by both caucuses. Neither side liked \nthem.\n  We finally came up with what I think is a further extrapolation of \nwhat the Constitution provides, and that is, if there is a tie by a \nunique procedure, a discharge petition, a superdischarge petition, if \nyou want to call it that, a discharge action, the matter could be \nbrought to the floor, debated, yes, but not blocked on a unanimous \nconsent request, not filibustered, but to get it on the calendar, \nwhether it is the Legislative or Executive Calendar. At that point, all \nthe rules of the Senate apply. When we go forward from there, all \nrights and prerogatives are preserved. It could be filibustered.\n\n  A lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, when I talked \nabout what the rules already were, were shocked. Most people do not \nrealize you can filibuster a Federal judge. Sure, you can filibuster. \nWe had one last year the Democratic side filibustered, and then they \nsaid: Oops, we don't think that is a good idea; that is not something \nwe want to start doing around here, and backed away from it. We did; \nthey did. We are going to fix that. The rider is there.\n  On bills, sure, you can filibuster the motion to proceed, you can \nobject to this, that, or the other and filibuster the bill. Nothing has \nchanged on that. It will still be protected. I think we should try to \nfind a way to do less of that, less filling up of the tree, no filling \nup of the tree, if at all possible. I don't intend to make that a \npractice, and I want to make it clear, and I will clarify it even \nlater.\n  We should not have situations where we filibuster every bill and have \nto file cloture in every instance. We ought to have a full and fair \ndebate on both sides and move on and have a vote. We can do that.\n  Different times call for different actions. Last year is history. It \nwas an election year. It was an unusual election year. It rendered an \nunusual result. What are we going to do with it? Are we going to make \nthis Republic work and produce for the people or are we going to argue \nover part B of rule XII of the Senate? It is important; I do not \ndiminish it at all, but I think the American people expect more of us \nthan that. This resolution may haunt me, but it is fair, and it will \nallow us to go on with the people's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho sought recognition \nfirst, and I will allow him to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. Others of our colleagues \nhave come to the floor. The hour is late and snow is falling.\n  We gather here today in the full recognition that elections have \nconsequences. There is no question that the November election changed \nthe character, the makeup of the Senate. We have heard now both of our \nleaders talk about the agonizing effort they have gone through for the \nlast several weeks to understand the consequence in light of the rules \nof the Senate and the way we must govern in the coming months.\n  I am not quite sure if we can yet determine whether the glass is half \nfull or whether the glass is half empty, but we know that somewhere \nright about at the middle, it is divided, and that it is in that \ndivision we must work out our differences to govern. That is what our \ntwo leaders have attempted to do.\n  The resolution before us this afternoon speaks to that line that we \nare attempting to draw and that we as Senators are attempting to \nunderstand.\n  I could tell you what I believe the election meant, but I am not \nquite sure that my opinion is any more accurate than anyone else's.\n\n  But I do know one thing that the American people will expect of us in \nthe coming months. They will expect us to give a new President an \nopportunity to lead. They will expect us to allow a new President to \nform his Cabinet in the way he has chosen, for the\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\npurpose of developing that leadership and for the purpose of shaping \nhis policies for us and the Nation, to evaluate and form those policies \nultimately for us to be governed.\n  We have a responsibility in the Senate. We are going to start \nhearings on those nominees to that new Cabinet in the very near future. \nI hope, in the atmosphere of bipartisanship, and the kind of \ncooperation we see here today, the hearings will be fair, the hearings \nwill be probative, but, most importantly, that in the end it is not the \nchoice of an obstructionist to deny a new President his opportunity to \nlead and, therefore, his opportunity to form a new Cabinet. That is \npart of what our leaders struggled over: How do we sift that out and \ncreate that kind of fairness in the process?\n  Time will tell. And that is exactly what Leader Lott has just said. \nSome of us on our side are very hesitant at this moment. We have worked \nwith the other side, but we have also seen an element of what we would \ncall obstructionism over the course of the last year. But that was last \nyear. Since that time, an election has passed. We are now in the \nbusiness of shaping a new Congress, with a new administration, to \naccomplish new goals for the American people. I hope we can work \ncooperatively to accomplish that.\n  Shall we live in interesting times? a Chinese proverb might say. I \nwould say to whomever crafted that Chinese proverb, I have lived in \nenough interesting times. Two years ago at this time we were talking \nabout the procedures of the Senate for trying the impeachment of a \nPresident--interesting times. Following the November election, our \nConstitution hung in the balance for 36 long days--interesting times, \nhistoric times. And now, in a very historic way, the Senate attempts to \ngovern itself in a 50/50 representation.\n  For this Senator, enough history. Now let's get on with leading and \ngoverning for the sake of the American people and for this great \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln).

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. To say that these are historic times would be hackneyed and \ntrite. To say that the leaders of the Senate have risen to new heights \nand are acting and speaking as statesmen would be something other than \ntrite.\n  I first want to congratulate my leader on this side of the aisle and \nmy leader on that side of the aisle. I know they have gone through some \nexcruciating moments. I know, without asking, that they have lost some \nsleep. I know, without inquiring, that they have rolled and tossed on \ntheir pillows, having been in their shoes myself.\n  When I came to the Senate, Lyndon Johnson was the majority leader. \nPolitics did not prevail over statesmanship. He worked with a \nRepublican President, President Eisenhower, in the best interests of \nthe Nation.\n  When the great civil rights debate of 1964 occurred, Everett Dirksen \ndid not play politics.\n  Had Everett Dirksen not worked with Lyndon Johnson and with Mike \nMansfield, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would never have been written. \nHad Everett Dirksen played politics instead of acting the part of \nstatesman, cloture would never have been invoked on the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964.\n  When the Panama Canal treaties were before the Senate in 1977, had \nHoward Baker chose to play the part of a politician and not worked with \nRobert Byrd in the interests of the Nation as we saw those interests, \nthe Panama Canal treaties would not have been approved. More lives \nwould have been lost. Howard Baker acted the part of statesman. We both \nwere swimming uphill. The Nation's polls showed that the people \ngenerally were much opposed to the Panama Canal treaties. We came \ntogether. Even in this past election, I still lost the votes of some \nWest Virginians because of my support of the Panama Canal treaties in \n1977.\n  We saw on those occasions the separation aisle here become a \npassageway to the best interests of the Nation; Senators from both \nsides joining hands and marching together.\n  On the Appropriations Committee, we do not need a resolution of this \nkind. We have always worked together, Republicans and Democrats, on \nthat committee. The longer I work on that committee, the better our \nmembers of both parties seem to work together. We have worked well \nthroughout all the years I have been on that committee, when Senator \nRussell was chairman, when Senator McClellan was chairman, when Senator \nEllender was chairman, and when Senator Hatfield was chairman, when \nSenator Stennis was the chairman.\n  I say here today and now that the paradigm of cooperation, of \nstatesmanship, of bipartisanship has occurred during the chairmanship \nof Ted Stevens. I am one Democrat who has absolutely no compunction \nwhen it comes to stating the truth about a colleague. If I have to say \nthat the chairman is a better chairman than I have been, I have no \ncompunctions about that. I said that several times about Slade Gorton, \nthe former chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on the \nDepartment of the Interior. He was a superb chairman. He was a better \nchairman of that subcommittee than I ever was. That is a westerner's \nsubcommittee in the main.\n  Ted Stevens has been a chairman par excellence. We don't need any \nresolution. Whatever problem there is, he and I can settle it. There is \nno rivalry, none, between these two Senators. There is no party between \nthese two Senators. There is only friendship and respect and trust. \nThat is the way it has always been, and that is the way it is always \ngoing to be.\n  That is the secret to getting things done in this evenly membered \nSenate in these times, a 50/50 tie: trust, mutual respect and trust. I \nam not going to go to heaven if I hate Republicans. My old mom used to \nsay: ``You can't go to heaven and hate anybody, Robert.''\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n  Now, there are some people on both sides of the aisle who are \nextremely partisan. There are many others who are only moderately \npartisan. I think for the most part we can say that most Members on \nboth sides are moderately partisan.\n  This agreement is a real accomplishment. I don't think I would have \naccomplished this, if I had been majority leader. That leader on the \nRepublican side had an extremely tough way to go. Today he has risen to \na new stature. I thought he did himself well during the impeachment \ntrial. I thought my own leader set a fine example. Today these two \nleaders have set a wonderful example. But the example of statesmanship \ngoes beyond these two leaders.\n\n  I know it has been difficult for Members, particularly on the \nRepublican side, to come to an agreement such as has been reached here. \nBut they have been willing to give up their partisanship for the moment \nin the better interests of the Nation.\n  Also, it is exceedingly important--I have already mentioned it here--\nto George Bush, who will become the President of the United States on \nJanuary 20. It is vitally important to him, if he is to expect to see \nhis programs considered and adopted. And hopefully, from his \nstandpoint, certainly, and from the standpoint of many others, if he is \nto see those programs succeed, he is going to have to have help. He \ncan't depend on all of its coming just from his side of the aisle. He \nis going to have some help over here. Who knows, I may be one who will \nvote with him from time to time. There will be others on this side.\n  This agreement is exceedingly important to him. It sets the right \nexample. It should give heart and encouragement to the people of the \nNation. I view it as a pact which will make it possible for us to rise \nabove the interests of party, rise above even ourselves from time to \ntime, and enable us to accomplish something worthy of remembrance in \nthe pages of history.\n  This can be the most difficult situation that could ever confront the \nU.S. Senate. We could just tie ourselves in knots. But there is a \nspirit of goodwill that I see emanating here that has brought about \nthis agreement, which I hope will be agreed upon soon, and it is a \nunique agreement.\n  I personally express my deep gratitude to Mr. Lott and to Mr. \nDaschle. I would never have thought it could be done. I viewed the \nfuture with a great deal of dread, but I am encouraged to believe that \nwe can, indeed, accomplish something that will be in the best interests \nof both parties, be in the best interests of the Nation, and be in the \nbest interests of this Senate and make this Senate, once again, the \nbeacon that it has so many times shown itself to be in times of peril, \nin times of stress in the history of this great Nation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am humbled by the statement of the \nPresident pro tempore and the current chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. He and I have served together now for many years. I know he \ndid not know earlier today in our conference I told the conference that \nI thought that this resolution that has been crafted by our two leaders \nwas, in fact, extending a hand of friendship across this aisle based \nupon trust.\n  He, in his normal way, has stated it more clearly and precisely than \nI. Senator Byrd honors us all. But we are here as senior Members. As \nour leader on this side of the aisle has said, this is a 50/50 split in \nthe Senate. But it is still the Senate of the United States. Coming \nfrom Alaska, I know the value of the vote that comes from the Vice-\nPresidency. It was the only vote that Vice President Agnew cast that \nbroke the tie on the Alaska pipeline and brought our Nation billions of \nbarrels of oil.\n\n  We face issues all the time when we are split and have a tie. This \ntime we start with a tie, but we start also with the friendships and \nthe knowledge of one another that have been built up over the years. I \nthink it will be an interesting experience for newcomers to witness. \nThe Senate starts on the basis of trust.\n  When I was a very new and appointed Senator, I asked a Senator here \nwho was managing the bill on the other side of the aisle to call me \nwhen it came time to offer an amendment. I was tied up in a committee. \nI was surprised that the bell rang in the committee and the vote was \ngoing on. I came to the floor. I am not one to be shy in expressing my \nopinions, and I went to the then manager of the bill and started to \nberate him. Senator Mike Mansfield came to me and said: Senator, you \nshould not use language like that on the floor of the Senate. I told \nSenator Mansfield what had happened. He, as the majority leader, looked \nat that Senator and said: Is that true? The manager of the bill said: \nThat's true, but that amendment would not have passed. Senator \nMansfield said: Have you got your amendment, Senator?\n  He took the amendment from me, he stopped the vote that was going on, \nhe returned the bill to second reading, and he offered my amendment. \nThat amendment passed, and it has benefited my State for a long time.\n  I merely state it here today to say every Senator on this floor has \nequal rights. The 50/50 that we have is the result of the voters of the \ncountry, but there need not be a division between this body in terms of \nthe 50. We work on the basis of a majority. We can have a tie at almost \nany time, or a majority with a quorum.\n  We are looking at a process where every Senator has the right now to \nunderstand the responsibility that comes from this agreement that has \nbeen reached. I congratulate the Democratic majority leader; I \ncongratulate our future Republican majority leader for reaching this \nconclusion. I share the feelings of my friend from West Virginia that \nthis is an act, really, of true statesmanship. I believe those who have \nnot agreed should help us make it work because it will take the \nrelationships that exist between myself and my great friend from West \nVirginia to make this work. I not only trust the Senator from West \nVirginia, I trust him with my life, and he knows that. We have never \nhad an argument. I have served with him as chairman; he has served with \nme as chairman. We have resolved every difference we ever had before we \ncame to the floor. That is what is going to happen now.\n  Most of the work we do will be in committee. This resolution gives us \nthe ability to work in committee on the basis of trust. I honor the two \nleaders for what they have done. I am proud of the Senate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating our two leaders. \nI personally have deep concerns about this agreement and its \nworkability, but I begin my statement today by saying I intend to \nsupport it. I intend to do everything in my power to make it work. I \nwant to make a pledge to myself and my colleagues that I hope others \nwill make, at least to themselves. If it fails, it won't be because of \nme.\n  I will try to explain my concerns in the few minutes that I have. \nFirst of all, when it became clear that we had the extraordinary result \nof an equal number of Members in both parties, I sought direction from \nthe ultimate source of direction in the American democracy by turning \nto the Constitution. As Senator Lott has already pointed out, the \nfounders so long ago, in a world so different than our own, not only \nthought about this potential but they wrote it into article I, section \n3 of the Constitution. In fact, they didn't wait very long in writing \nthe Constitution to put it in.\n  In section 1 of article I they give exclusive legislative powers to \nCongress. In section 2, they establish the House of Representatives. In \nsection 3, they establish the Senate. Then they turn to exactly this \nquestion: ``The Vice President of the United States shall be President \nof the Senate''--the only responsibility given to the Vice President in \nthe Constitution of the United States. Then they give him his only \ndelegated power other than the power of succession in the event of \ndeath. That power is, ``but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally \ndivided.''\n  My basic response in following the Constitution as a guide is that we \nhave reached exactly the situation that the founders recognized in \nwriting the Constitution. We do not have 50 Members of the Senate who \nare Democrats and 50 who are Republicans. We have reached section 3 of \narticle I of the Constitution in terms of American history, and the \nVice President of the United States, with the Senate equally\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\ndivided, casts the deciding vote. My reaction, in looking at this \nprovision of the Constitution, was that we have a Republican majority, \nthat we have 51 Republicans and 50 Democrats.\n\n  It is awfully easy to say it when the new Vice President is a \nRepublican, but let me make it clear: If the new Vice President were a \nDemocrat, I would expect the Democrats to be the majority in the \nSenate. I personally would have never contemplated that they would not \nhave a majority on each of the committees because they would have the \nresponsibility under the Constitution for governing.\n  We have made a decision to go in the other direction. I have said \nthat I will support it and I will do my part in making it work. But let \nme tell you what my concern is about it. If there is anything that we \nlearn as we live and have experience, it is that the old adage about \nnever giving someone responsibility without giving them authority is a \nvalid adage. That is my concern about this agreement, even though I \nhope it does represent a reaching across the aisle, I hope it does \nbring in an era of bipartisanship. I am sure people back home do not \nunderstand why it is not so easy for us to get together.\n  I have disagreements with Senator Byrd, not because I don't love \nSenator Byrd, not because I don't admire Senator Byrd, and not because \nSenator Byrd is a Democrat and I am a Republican. I have differences \nwith Senator Byrd from time to time because we have a different vision \nof what we want America to be. We have a different conception of the \nproblems we face. Jefferson said: Good men with the same facts are \nprone to disagree.\n  My concern is that we may very well, in this process, be guaranteeing \ngridlock by giving just the responsibility to one party which clearly, \nunder the Constitution, Republicans now have. Come the 20th, our leader \nwill be called ``majority leader.'' I will be the chairman of the \nBanking Committee. Senator Domenici will be the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. My concern is that we should not separate responsibility \nfrom authority.\n  I am reminded, in concluding my remarks, of the Biblical story, as \nSenator Byrd and I am sure everyone will remember, about the two ladies \nwho brought a baby before Solomon and contested about whose baby it \nwas. Now, Solomon could have decided: The solution here is an equal \ndivision. He could have cut the baby in half. But Solomon decided that \nwas not right to divide the baby and fortunately, with his great \nwisdom, he figured out how to determine who was the real mother by \nfeigning to cut the real baby in half in which case the real mother \nsaid: No, let her have it. Solomon, with his great wisdom, having \ndetermined the real mother, gave her the child.\n  I hope that by separating responsibility and authority we have not \ncut the baby in half here today. I hope we can make this work. I think \nit is in the interests of the Nation that it work. Bipartisanship is a \nwonderful thing, and we have had it on many issues. Senator Byrd and I \nworked together on the highway bill, and every time I ride on one of \nour new highways in Texas, I rejoice that we got together and made the \nFederal Government stop stealing money out of the highway trust fund, \nand we spent the money building new highways in America so when people \npay gasoline taxes, sure enough, the money goes for the purpose they \nare told it goes.\n  There have been many great bipartisan actions taken by Congress. But \nthere are times when there are differences, not because one party is \ngood and the other party is bad or one party is right and one party is \nwrong--but because there are fundamental differences. When those \noccasions arise, we are going to have to work very hard to make this \nsystem work.\n  I intend to try to make it work. I think we can make it work. I \nbelieve we are going to pass the President's tax bill, for example. I \nthink it is going to get an overwhelming vote in the end. But I would \nsay that under this system it is going to be a lot harder to make the \nSenate work.\n  So in this joy from bipartisanship, I hope we are all committed to \nrolling up our sleeves and engaging in the extra effort that this is \ngoing to take. I commit today that I am, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the majority leader seek recognition?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just make a unanimous consent request? The \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, asked for 3 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent he be recognized preceding the recognition of Senator Reid for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, but \nif he is going to be able to get that, I would like to have 1 minute \nbefore his time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent Senator Inhofe then be \nrecognized, and Senator Carper be recognized after Senator Reid for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, after we had a \nRepublican conference, I went to my office and, with one of my most \nhelpful friends and workers in my office, I prepared some remarks. Let \nme assure you, after being part of the Senate here this afternoon, I \ndon't need my remarks. But I would like to share with Senator Byrd and \nthose who speak of history--I would like to share my history as a \nSenator. It will be very brief.\n  I was unexpectedly elected to the Senate and I never had been a \nlegislator anywhere. I was on a city council. I sit here--but I sat in \nthat second-to-last seat and waited my turn. And what a long time it \ntook.\n  I was never blessed with the luxury, Senator Byrd, that you have been \nin your life of being on the Democratic side all of your life and \nhaving such huge majorities from your side of the aisle. When I \narrived, there were only 38 of us. We didn't have to worry about this \nkind of agreement, as you know. The Democratic majority was a huge \nmajority and they ran every committee. They were in charge and they got \na lot done.\n  But what I learned, so there be no mistake about it, was to work with \nDemocrats. I learned to work with them when we got up to 44, and I \nlearned to work with them when we got up to 46, and what a thrill when \nwe finally got a majority. I still have more legislation passed here, \nthere, and yon that is bipartisan. I wish to say from the very \nbeginning, I pledge to try to make this work. I will do that with every \nounce of ingenuity, wisdom, or the opposite thereof if required, to try \nto make something work.\n  It is one thing to say to this Senate: Senator Harry Reid and I have \ngrown to be very good friends because we serve on an appropriations \nsubcommittee and we always agree on everything after we have spent some \ntime disagreeing. But I would also tell you that he and I do not agree \non policy. I note, with a big smile on my face, his policy positions \nhave become more known and more pronounced since he has occupied the \nsecond chair on that side--which I expected of him.\n  Did I have any real friends in the Democratic Party who went to \nexceptional ends to be helpful to me? Let me tell you a brief story. I \nwas a pipsqueak in the Senate, and Senator Long was a very big Senator. \nI was just starting my first term. I passed only one bill. It was a big \nbill. It imposed a 10-cent gasoline tax--Senator Byrd, you remember \nthat--on the users of the inland waterways. Do you remember that fight? \nIt went on forever, but I won fair and square, and I went home to \ncampaign. And, believe it or not, a Senator from that side of the \naisle, in my absence--I was in New Mexico--was going to undo my victory \nbecause they had the votes and he had the floor. A staffer called me \nand said: You better come back, get off the campaign trail and come \nover here and defend the only legislative victory you have, of any \nsignificance, in the first 6 years. I was prepared to do it.\n  Guess what the next call was, in about a half hour--Russell Long. I \nhad defeated him on the floor in that debate. And he said: Pete, they \nwon't do that.\n  I said: What?\n  They will not upset your victory. You won. You stay home and \ncampaign.\n  Think of that, telling a Republican to stay home.\n  You stay home and campaign and I will take the floor in your place \nand object to what is contemplated. And the victory that you got will \nnot be undone here on the floor by a Democrat.\n  That is friendship, right? But, listen, I didn't agree with Russell \nLong on a\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\nlot of things--and he knew that--here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I say to my Democrat friends on the other side of the aisle, all \nkinds of expressions have been used talking about what is going on: \n``We extend a hand to you'' and all those other wonderful words.\n  All I can say is, I am going to do my best to work with you, and I \nhope you will do the best you can to work with me on the Budget \nCommittee and get something done.\n  I, too, thought we were starting this session--and it is the reason I \nwas concerned about what was happening--I thought we started with the \nidea that on January 21, Vice President Cheney would be in that chair \nand he would make it no longer 50-50 but 51-50. I still believe that is \nthe case.\n  My thinking is he is going to be denied the right to vote on this \nissue. Maybe we ought to have a lengthy debate so he can have a vote on \nthis issue.\n  Our leadership has gotten together--I cannot use words of high enough \npraise to exceed the great words on the floor complimenting you, \nSenator Daschle, and my Republican leader for what you are doing.\n  Those who have listened to me in our own conference and maybe some \nmedia person has caught a glimpse of what I was saying heretofore the \nlast few days, I hope everybody understands that was my version of what \nwe were stepping into, and I thought clearly from the precedents I had \nread that that event would occur in due order, and we would not be \nsplit 50/50.\n  It is imperative we try to work together. The fact that I am going to \ntry to work with my counterpart, Kent Conrad, with whom I have already \nmet two times and talked with today at length about the Budget \nCommittee--but I am not sure it will work--while I am going to try my \nbest, I do not know whether we are going to be able to get the work of \nthe American people done under a 50/50 arrangement as to the committee \nstructure. I hope and pray that it will work.\n  I assure my leaders that, with all our vigor and all our commitments, \nit will be tough to get our work done as to serious and contentious \nmatters that are between the two parties or favor the President. It \nwill be very difficult to get it done. Nonetheless, I support it. It is \na very high-minded purpose that both of you had in mind and you \nachieved it. Our Republican leader achieved it. He will be praised for \ntrying to bring not just friendliness but bipartisan effort to the \nSenate.\n  My words expressing how much I hope that works are inadequate. I hope \nour praise will not be short lived and what we are praising them for \ntoday will not be for 2 weeks or 2 months, but maybe at the end of 1 \nyear, when we look back on it, we can say, in spite of the most \ndifficult committee structure we have worked with in this Senate, we \nwere able to work.\n  I know Senator Byrd as chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee and Senator Stevens, my great friend as well \nas his, have been able to do that, but I submit to them that the \nappropriations work is a little bit different than some of the other \ncommittee work. Some of it will end up in our committees that have very \nphilosophical, very partisan overtones. We will try to mellow those and \nget our work done as Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens have in such an \nexemplary manner.\n  I close by saying I graduated along in this Senate, never serving in \nany other institutional body of legislative significance. Senator Byrd \nhas frequently said that we must learn to understand and know the \nSenate, and once we have, we will love it. I have heard him say those \nwords or others. I am one to whom you have said: Senator Domenici, you \nhave really learned what the Senate is all about. I hope I have. I \nwanted to achieve; I wanted to bring bills to the floor that were \ncontentious. I see no other way to run the Senate other than that.\n  Nonetheless, again I repeat, I pledge all my energy to making this \nbipartisan arrangement work. I say to Senator Daschle, I will try. I \nsay to Senator Byrd, I will try. To my distinguished majority leader, \nrest assured this Senator will try to make your excellent agreement, \ndifficult agreement work. If I have reservations, I think they are \nlegitimate. They are concerns about whether this institution can work \nwith equal committees and without more assurance on the conference \nsituation which others will discuss.\n  All of the discord is gone. Senator Lott was my leader in the \nnegotiations. I compliment him for the results, and I compliment the \nmajority leader for his success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Kansas is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, the motto from my home State of Kansas is ``Ad astra \nper aspera.'' Translated it means ``to the stars through difficulty.'' \nIf you take a look at our pioneer past and the history of the problems \nwe experienced in the West, our heritage and progress we have made as a \nfree State, the motto is very appropriate. Perhaps ``to the stars \nthrough difficulty'' should be the appropriate motto to describe the \nchallenge we face in the Senate as we begin what Senator Byrd has \ndescribed as a very historic and a very unprecedented session. With a \n50/50 membership split, we have to proceed in a bipartisan fashion or \nwe are not going to proceed.\n  I thank and pay credit to the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nDaschle, and our distinguished Republican leader, Senator Lott, for \npersevering. Senator Byrd said it was excruciating, and it probably has \nbeen. There has been a lot of second-guessing, a lot of concern, a lot \nof frustration, a lot of worries. I have had some of those, but they \nhave basically worked out what we hope will be a blueprint of Senate \nrules and procedures that will allow us to work together and avoid \ngridlock and get something done.\n  Our respective leaders have said, and will speak for themselves, that \nthis will not be easy. Senator Domenici and Senator Gramm have \nexpressed those concerns.\n  I suppose some are wondering why a worker bee or a rank-and-file \nperson in the Senate should be here as opposed to the leadership and \nthe distinguished chairmen of the committees, but I have a little \nhistory in regard to this body and the other body.\n  I served 14 years as a staffer, 16 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, and now 4 in the Senate. That is a long time. I am the \nonly member of the Kansas delegation who has ever served in the \nminority. That is rather astounding to me.\n  I can remember when how legislation was considered and when it was \nconsidered in the House was a foregone conclusion. There were an awful \nlot of Charlie Stenholm-Pat Roberts amendments. All of a sudden, they \nbecame Roberts-Stenholm amendments. I can remember how that worked. In \nthe Agriculture Committee, we were not that partisan.\n  I have a great deal of reverence for this body. I serve on the \nAgriculture Committee. We have to get a farm bill done, tax policy \nchanges, sanctions reform; we have to have an export policy that works. \nOur farmers and ranchers are still hurting. Senator Harkin and Senator \nLugar will devise ways to get that done. We cannot hold that up.\n  The distinguished chairman-to-be after January 20 and the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan have quality of life issues with \nour armed services people; we have our vital national interests to \nprioritize; we have some recruiting problems, some retention problems. \nQuite frankly, our military is stressed, strained, and hollow. We must \naddress this. It is our national security. We cannot hold this up. We \nhave to move ahead.\n  I also serve on the Intelligence Committee. In that respect, the \nchairman-to-be, Senator Shelby, and the current chairman have to detect \nand deter and get ready for consequence management with all sorts of \nproblems in regard to terrorism and homeland defense. We are talking \nabout the individual freedoms and the security of the American people. \nWe cannot hold that up by a filibuster or any kind of gridlock.\n\n  In regard to what we have to do, let us follow the example of \nPresident-elect Bush. He has said: Let us unite. I am a uniter; I am \nnot a divider. We can do that. We can follow his example. We have \nreached out with a hand of friendship and trust, as described by \nSenator Stevens. We ought to seize that opportunity.\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\n  I know there are some who say we are going to get a slap in the face \nin return. It will not be a slap in the face in return to anybody in \nthis body or from a partisan standpoint; it will be a slap in the face \nto the American people, and they will understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 \nadditional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I talked to a respected and veteran newspaper \neditorialist of the Washington Post, Bob Kaiser, just a couple days \nago. He said: Pat, you have been around here quite a while. Is this \npossible? 50/50, will it work in the Senate? Can you avoid the partisan \nbickering and all that that encompasses?\n  I said: I don't know, Bob, but we've got a shot. We have an \nopportunity. Borne out of necessity, we must do this.\n  Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, and our leadership team, thank you \nfor arranging this possibility. It is now up to us. We have the \nresponsibility, and, yes, both of us now have the authority. Let's see \nif we can get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I had not realized when I came down to \nthe floor that this was going to turn into a history class. But I have \na little history to add to it myself, and I hope that it is \nappropriate.\n  During our conference today, we talked about a previous situation \nwhere the Senate was close to this circumstance. The Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Nickles, and I had an exchange about the facts in that \nsituation. He had it different than I had it. So naturally, under those \ncircumstances, you go check it out. I found out we were both right. So \nI would like to recite that to perhaps give us a historical setting of \nwhere we are.\n  I have only served in this body for 8 years. But as I have indicated \non the floor on other occasions, as a teenager I sat in the family \ngallery while my father served here. And this will perhaps shock \neverybody, but that was before Strom Thurmond was sworn in. I was in \nthe Senate Chamber before Strom Thurmond was, if you can believe that. \nAnd it is true.\n  The Republicans had just won the historic election of 1952. Dwight \nEisenhower was the President. The Republicans won the Senate by the \nnarrowest of margins, 49/47. Then, very quickly, Robert Taft was the \nmajority leader. I still have memories, sitting in the family gallery, \nof watching Robert Taft--a man whose face is now in the lobby as one of \nthe five greatest Senators in American history--prowling around in the \nback of this Chamber.\n  One of the interesting things about it is that the Chamber looked \nexactly the same then as it does now, except that Trent Lott has now \nchanged the color of the walls, I think wisely, in the television age.\n\n  But very quickly in the Eisenhower administration, Wayne Morse found \nthat his differences with President Eisenhower were irreconcilable, and \nhe announced himself an independent. So you had 48 Republicans, 47 \nDemocrats, and 1 Independent.\n  Senator Morse insisted that he would not take his committee \nassignments from either party, he would take them from the Senate as a \nwhole, and very quickly discovered that that kind of a stance meant he \ngot no committee assignments, period. So he began caucusing with the \nDemocrats with whom he was more ideologically aligned.\n  Then Robert Taft died. He contracted cancer. He yielded the majority \nleader's position to Senator Knowland of California. Senator Taft \nfought the cancer gallantly for months, and then he died. There was a \nDemocratic Governor in the State of Ohio, and Robert Taft was replaced \nby a Democrat. It suddenly became 48 Democrats, and 47 Republicans, \nwith 1 Independent.\n  That was the position Senator Nickles was trying to explain to me \nduring the conference, and he was right. My memory was the first \ncircumstance, and that was right. The difference was, we had had a \ndeath in there that I had forgotten.\n  Now this was the situation: Because the Republicans had organized the \nSenate with 49 Senators to begin with, they had organized it with a \nRepublican majority on every committee. They held that Republican \nmajority on every committee until Senator Taft died, and it switched. \nAt that point, Senator Morse--this I do remember--said, A, he had been \nelected as a Republican and, B, the Republicans controlled the \nadministration and, therefore, in order to prevent the new President \nfrom being frustrated in his opportunities to get things through, he \nwould, even though he had denounced his Republican party membership, \nvote with the Republicans on organizational issues, giving the \nRepublicans 48, the Democrats 48, and with Richard Nixon in the chair \ngiving the Republicans 49.\n  Here is the key point. Under those circumstances, the Democrats said: \nWe will not ask for a realignment of the committees. We will allow the \nmajority that was there on the committees to be maintained through the \nbalance of this Congress.\n  So it was 48 Democrats, 47 Republicans, and 1 Independent, with the \nIndependent vowing to vote against any organizational resolution the \nDemocrats might bring forward, and of course Vice President Nixon would \nvote also that way, so the Republicans, even though they had only 47 \nseats, in a 96-seat Senate, maintained the chairmanships and a 1-vote \nmargin on every committee.\n  Now we are in a different situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Now we are in a different situation in that we come into \nit even, 50/50. This time, the Democrats have not been so shy about \nsaying, we will automatically give up control on each committee. And \nthey have been very firm about saying that the committee ratios must be \nexactly the same. If I were in their shoes, frankly, I would probably \nbe arguing exactly the same way.\n  On the other hand, the Constitution has been cited here by the \nSenator from West Virginia, by the majority leader, and others, saying \nthat the Republicans have the ultimate right to break the tie through \nVice President Cheney after January 20.\n  This creates what is sometimes called an immovable object facing an \nirresistible force, with both sides digging in and saying: This is what \nwe absolutely have to have. And with the power of the filibuster, both \nsides have a nuclear weapon.\n  To have come up with a resolution that is producing the kind of \nrhetoric we are now hearing on the floor this afternoon demonstrates \nthe wisdom, the intelligence, and the skill of our respective leaders. \nI, for one, want to go on record congratulating them both and all of \nthe Members of the Senate who are lining up behind it, even though \nthere are those on both sides of the aisle who are terribly unhappy \nwith the ultimate result. The fact that we have one that is now going \nto pass by unanimous consent is a tribute to our leadership. I wanted \nto express that here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, while I do not disagree with anything \nthat has been said here, I do feel compelled to make a statement. While \nI was not on the floor, there was a unanimous consent request \npropounded successfully, so that this is automatically going to become \na reality without a vote. That is fine. That is going to happen. But I \nhave to say, I was not here on the floor, as 75 percent of the Senators \nwere not here.\n  I am not criticizing the majority leader or any Member of this \nSenate. But I have to say, I agree with Senator Byrd that--I think he \nprobably recited it, even though I was not here--section 3 of Article I \nof the Constitution says:\n\n       The Vice President of the United States shall be President \n     of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally \n     divided.\n\n  I often say that one of the few qualifications I have for this office \nis that I am not an attorney. So when I read the Constitution, I know \nwhat it says. So\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\nafter the 20th, we will be a majority party.\n  While I chair two subcommittees, the rule that we are adopting here, \nthe resolution, says that even though I chair that subcommittee, if it \nis an equal vote--it is a tie vote--it goes on to the full committee. I \ndo not think that is right. For that reason, I just want to make sure \nthe Record does reflect I do oppose the resolution. I would like to \nhave the Record reflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. May I say, I congratulate the \nPresiding Officer for assuming the chair. I assume this is her first \nopportunity.\n  Madam President, I was among the class of chairmen to hold out for \nthe one-vote majority, not for any reason personal against my \ndistinguished friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle but \nbecause of the enormity of the annual bill of the Armed Services \nCommittee on which our distinguished colleague from West Virginia \nserves and my distinguished chairman from Michigan serves.\n  That bill last time was brought to the floor with about 450 pages. It \ngrew to 900 pages. It took us 5 weeks. Therefore, with that type of \nresponsibility, whether I am the chairman or others are chairman or, \nindeed, on this side of the aisle, should it occur on a split, you need \nthe authority to do the job. Then you have to accept the \nresponsibility.\n  I fought the battle along with others. My distinguished leader, Mr. \nLott, gave me every opportunity to express my views. The decision was \nmade within our conference. I accept that decision, and I today \npublicly commit to make it work. We have to make it work. We have an \nobligation to 281 million people to make it work.\n  Our great Republic, three branches, coequal in authority, has gone \nthrough one of the great chapters of American history, a hard-fought \nelection by the contenders in the executive branch, that decision then \nthrust upon the judicial branch, finally decided by the Supreme Court \nof the United States. Now to the legislative branch is posed a \nchallenge to make it work. That we will do.\n  I say to my friends in the Senate, we will draw from that treasure \nthat we have in this institution called personal friendships and \nrelationships. They are not well known publicly, but I am blessed, I \nsay with humility, to have so many close, personal relationships \nthroughout this Senate, ones in which I pose great trust and \nconfidence.\n  If I may be personal to my good friend from West Virginia, or my good \nfriend, Senator Reid, and Senator Levin, we shall make this work in the \ninterest of our country. Because the other two branches are going to \nmake it work, we will. The legislative agenda of President Bush will \nrotate around the axle of the Senate--no disrespect to the other body. \nThis split will be the axle around which it rotates, and we will make \nit work and move forward in the interest of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, be recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this time.\n  We have an agreement. I believe it reflects well on both sides of the \naisle and the leadership on both sides of the aisle. I think neither \nside of the aisle is fully satisfied. There are problems in this \nagreement, as there are problems in any agreement, but it is a very \ngood first start.\n  The hard reality is that the elected membership of this body is split \n50/50. The elected membership, Senators, are split 50/50. So one would \nanticipate that the membership of the committees would be split 50/50. \nThis is a result of an election. The people of our country have spoken. \nThey have chosen who serves here, who represents them in this Chamber, \nand it is their decision that has determined the result.\n  There has been much discussion of the Constitution and the Vice \nPresident's role. It is absolutely the case that under our Constitution \nthe Vice President breaks ties. Those are ties on the floor of the \nSenate. The Vice President doesn't break ties in committees. So I think \nthe arrangement that has been worked out between the two leaders is the \nonly logical conclusion to which one could come.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee and the lead Democrat on the \nBudget Committee, let me say that the Budget Committee will be among \nthe first places to test this new arrangement. Senator Domenici, who \nwill chair the Budget Committee after January 20, which I have the \nprivilege of chairing for the next 2 weeks, has said he will give it \nhis best effort to make this work. I come to the floor to say I make \nthe same pledge, that I will give my best effort to make this \narrangement work.\n  What I mean by that is what I have just had the opportunity to say to \nthe Secretary-designate of the Treasury, Mr. O'Neill, in my office just \nmoments ago, that bipartisanship is more than a word. It means that \nboth sides give up part of their fixed positions. That is what \nbipartisanship means. If there is going to be compromise, it means that \nneither side gets precisely what it is seeking. But only through that \nkind of compromise and bipartisan spirit can we advance the agenda in \nthis Chamber.\n  Senator Domenici and I have already spoken several times. We had an \nextended discussion today. It is a good beginning.\n  Again, I pledge my best effort to making this arrangement work. I \nthink it can work. I believe if people of good faith join together, we \ncan achieve much for our country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have stated publicly on previous occasions \nmy admiration for the two leaders, the Democratic leader and the \nRepublican leader, and certainly that is accentuated as a result of the \nwork they have done today.\n  The work they have done has been difficult and hard, but in the \nprocess of doing the work, there have been some unsung heroes I want to \nrecognize. I call them heroes. I underline and underscore that. When an \nidea is given by Senator Daschle or by Senator Lott, somebody has to \nput this on paper and work out the details. Those details have been \nworked out. Therefore, I want to make sure the Senate record is spread \nwith the fact that we have had people who could be out in the private \nsector making lots and lots of money. They are here because they are \ndedicated public servants.\n  I mention specifically Mark Patterson, Mark Childress, Caroline \nFredrickson, Marty Paone, and Lula Davis on this side, who have spent \ntremendous amounts of time trying to carry forth the wishes of the two \nleaders.\n  On the Republican side, there are others who could mention probably \nmore people than I, but I have been able to witness personally this \nlast week the tremendous work of Dave Hoppe, Elizabeth Letchworth, and \nDave Schiappa, who have done tremendous work and have really made it \npossible to arrive at the point we are today. The work, the leadership, \nthe policy direction by our two leaders has been significant, but it \nhas only been able to be implemented because of the work of these staff \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this is my first opportunity to address \nthis body, so this is a special day for me.\n  For the past 8 years, I have been in and out of this Chamber any \nnumber of times as Governor of Delaware and chairman of the National \nGovernors' Association. I have never had the opportunity to sit down in \none of these seats or to speak at one of these podiums.\n  One of the great things about being Governor is you get to be part of \nthe National Governors' Association. There is a strong history there of \nDemocrats and Republicans, and one or two Independents as well, to \nactually work together, to reach across the aisle and to find \nconsensus, not just occasionally but routinely.\n  One of the aspects I liked most about being Governor was that every \nday you came home you felt good because you had gotten something done. \nSome of us\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\npreviously served together in the House for awhile. I can remember any \nnumber of times going home on the train to Delaware feeling frustrated, \nnot just 1 night or 1 week but maybe months, because we hadn't gotten \nenough done. We hadn't really met what was expected of us by the people \nwho sent us here.\n  I suspect, for people outside this body, the action we are endorsing \ntoday will have a relatively little consequence or seems to be of \nlittle consequence. But the agreement that has been struck is an \nagreement of real consequence, not just for those of us working here in \nthe years to come but I think a real consequence for our Nation.\n  We could have spent much of this month, and maybe the next month and \nthe month beyond that, arguing about the size of the negotiating table \nand how many seats were going to be at that negotiating table or how \nmany members would be on committees and subcommittees. We are not going \nto be doing that. Instead, we are going to have the opportunity to take \nup the business of the people who sent us here to work in the first \nplace.\n  This may be the triumph of man's hope over experience, but maybe if \nwe can agree on some of the difficult issues we are agreeing on today, \nthen there is some hope and promise that we may be able to find \nagreement on campaign finance reform, on ways to continue reducing our \nNation's debt, and we might shore up the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds, and we might cut some taxes--Democrats and Republicans \nwill find common ground there--and how we might extend health care \ncoverage to folks who don't have it, and prescription assistance for \nsome of our older Americans, and even on schools.\n  When the American people voted for 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, \nthey did not vote for gridlock. When they voted for almost equal \nnumbers in the House, they did not vote for gridlock. When they voted \nalmost equally for George W. Bush and Al Gore, they did not vote for \ngridlock. I am proud to stand here on my third day as a Senator to be \nable to support a wonderful compromise struck by two excellent leaders \nthat holds forth the promise that the next 2 years that we work \ntogether in the 107th Congress will be 2 years that will show a great \ndeal more progress for our country, and that is good. This is a good \nday. I commend those who brought us to this agreement.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is in an unusual situation and \nwe are dealing, I believe, with extreme wisdom. It is a very difficult \nanomaly. It has never happened before that the Senate has had a 50/50 \nsplit of this nature at the beginning of Congress. The only thing that \ncomes close was in 1953, which was very different because the \nRepublicans had a majority in the beginning of the Congress and the 50/\n50 situation that existed only occurred in the second session of that \nCongress. The same party was in control throughout with the Vice \nPresident's vote in the second session, which had the majority in the \nfirst session.\n  This is an unusual situation. It took wisdom and statesmanship on the \npart of our leaders to put together a resolution which would carry us \nthrough this very difficult point. Just like during the impeachment \nsituation, the leadership was able to work out a process which allowed \nthe Senate to function and to proceed in a manner that would allow us \nto have comity and civility, to avoid recrimination. So here the \nleaders have been able to put together a resolution which will permit \nus to do just that. I not only wish to thank Senators Daschle and Lott, \nbut many others have been involved in this. I see one of the clear \narchitects of anything we do around here in the Senate based on a \nknowledge of the Senate as an institution and a knowledge of the \nConstitution. Senator Byrd is on the floor. His role on this has been \nessential as well; the wisdom and the implications and precedents which \npreceded us, and which we will be setting here today, are very much \nknown to Senator Byrd. As always, we have relied heavily upon him in \nachieving this result. I simply say this: One of the national papers \nsaid a few days ago that power-sharing is the first test in the Senate.\n  Whether that term ``power sharing'' is particularly beloved by \nMembers of this body, nonetheless that is really what we have had to \nachieve today. We have succeeded in passing that test, in my judgment. \nWe carved out the mechanism which will allow us to respect the fact \nthat we have a 50/50 Senate.\n  On the other hand, we are different from the House in at least two \nways. Being in the presence of Senator Byrd, I am sure there are many \nmore ways; but at least in two ways that I focus on.\n  First, we have a Vice President, somebody who can break a tie.\n  Second, we are a continuing body. The fact is we are a continuing \nbody. If we didn't agree to a resolution, the previous Senate's \nresolution would continue to be in force until it was supplemented by a \nnew resolution.\n  That is very different from the situation that exists in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In my home State in Michigan, we had a very positive experience in \n1993, I believe, with a 50/50 House of Representatives. But they ended \nup with joint speakers, joint chairmen--joint everything, because there \nwas no alternative. There was no way of breaking that tie.\n  We have a way of breaking a tie here. We have a Vice President at \nleast on the Senate floor. We don't have a Vice President in committee, \nbut we have a Vice President on the Senate floor. And we have a \ncontinuing body. We are a continuing body, which means that the last \nresolution would have continued in place, with all of the difficulties \nand complications that would have created, until it was replaced by the \nresolution we are adopting here today.\n  I commend our leadership and all those who have been involved in \nmaking it possible for us to proceed as a Senate in a manner which I \nthink the public will respect as being fair and which is respectful of \nthis body and this institution.\n  I know how conscious we must be of what we are doing--not just for \nthe next period of time until a majority is reestablished by one party \nor the other, but we must be respectful of the implications of what we \nare doing for future circumstances similar to these.\n  History, I believe, will judge this agreement favorably. It is an \nagreement which is very sensitive to the history of this body. It is \nabout as close to the 50/50 yard line as we can get consistent with the \nfact that there is indeed a Vice President who on the floor can break a \ntie consistent with the nature of this body as a continuing \ninstitution.\n  The old saying that ``necessity is the mother of invention'' is \nsurely true again. It is the mother of bipartisan invention here, and I \nthink it will serve us very well, and we will find we can work together \nas well as we have so often even when one of us is in the majority and \none in the minority.\n  I know this has been the case on the Armed Services Committee. As the \nPresiding Officer knows and may know again, many of our committees work \nvery well together on both sides of the aisle. It has been true between \nmyself and Senator Warner, who has been chairman and will again be on \nthe 20th, and with Senator Thurmond before him. We have worked together \nvery closely. That closeness will continue surely and even perhaps be \nenhanced, if that is possible, by this resolution.\n  I thank all those who have been involved.\n  I see Senator Reid is also on the floor. I want to add my thanks to \nhim because he has been at every moment involved in the carving of this \ndocument. I commend him and all others on both sides for their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the agreement, the resolution is \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 8) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 8\n\n       Resolved, That, notwithstanding the provisions of Rule XXV, \n     or any other provision of the Standing Rules or Standing \n     Orders of the Senate, the committees of the Senate, including \n     Joint and Special Committees, for the 107th Congress shall be \n     composed equally of members of both parties, to be appointed \n     at a later time by the two Leaders; that the budgets and \n     office space for such committees, and all other subgroups, \n     shall likewise be equal, with up to an additional 10% to be \n     allocated for administrative expenses to be determined by the \n     Rules Committee, with\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\n     the total administrative expenses allocation for all \n     committees not to exceed historic levels; and that the \n     Chairman of a full committee may discharge a subcommittee of \n     any Legislative or Executive Calendar item which has not been \n     reported because of a tie vote and place it on the full \n     committee's agenda.\n       Sec. 2. Provided, That such committee ratios shall remain \n     in effect for the remainder of the 107th Congress, except \n     that if at any time during the 107th Congress either party \n     attains a majority of the whole number of Senators, then each \n     committee ratio shall be adjusted to reflect the ratio of the \n     parties in the Senate, and the provisions of this resolution \n     shall have no further effect, except that the members \n     appointed by the two Leaders, pursuant to this resolution, \n     shall no longer be members of the committees, and the \n     committee chairmanships shall be held by the party which has \n     attained a majority of the whole number of Senators.\n       Sec. 3. Pursuant to the provisions and exceptions listed \n     above, the following additional Standing Orders shall be in \n     effect for the 107th Congress:\n       (1) If a committee has not reported out a legislative item \n     or nomination because of a tie vote, then, after notice of \n     such tie vote has been transmitted to the Senate by that \n     committee and printed in the Record, the Majority Leader or \n     the Minority Leader may, only after consultation with the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the committee, make a motion \n     to discharge such legislative item or nomination, and time \n     for debate on such motion shall be limited to 4 hours, to be \n     equally divided between the two Leaders, with no other \n     motions, points of order, or amendments in order: Provided, \n     That following the use or yielding back of time, a vote occur \n     on the motion to discharge, without any intervening action, \n     motion, or debate, and if agreed to it be placed immediately \n     on the Calendar of Business (in the case of legislation) or \n     the Executive Calendar (in the case of a nomination).\n       (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule XXII, to insure \n     that any cloture motion shall be offered for the purpose of \n     bringing to a close debate, in no case shall it be in order \n     for any cloture motion to be made on an amendable item during \n     its first 12 hours of Senate debate: Provided, That all other \n     provisions of Rule XXII remain in status quo.\n       (3) Both Leaders shall seek to attain an equal balance of \n     the interests of the two parties when scheduling and debating \n     legislative and executive business generally, and in keeping \n     with the present Senate precedents, a motion to proceed to \n     any Legislative or Executive Calendar item shall continue to \n     be considered the prerogative of the Majority Leader, \n     although the Senate Rules do not prohibit the right of the \n     Democratic Leader, or any other Senator, to move to proceed \n     to any item.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S42-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S42-S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESERVATIONS ABOUT S. RES. 8\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is no secret that I have had serious \nreservations about this resolution. Let me first make a commitment to \nMajority Leader Daschle and soon-to-be Majority Leader Lott that I will \ncertainly work with them and all Members of the Senate to make sure it \nworks. I have the greatest respect for them, and I have the greatest \nrespect for the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, \nwho is, in my opinion, Mr. Civility in the Senate.\n  I have stated in the past that what is vitally important for us to be \nsuccessful in the Congress is that we need a greater return of civility \nand working together and trusting each other. This resolution I have \nhad problems with because it is difficult for me to see how two people \ncan drive a car at the same time or have their hands on the steering \nwheel at the same time.\n  Also, the way I look at the precedents of the Senate, it is not \nconsistent. When the Senate was organized on January 7, 1953, there was \nan equal number--the Senate was equally divided 48-48, with 48 \nRepublicans and 47 Democrats; the Independent was convening with the \nDemocrats, I think. The resolution said there was an equally divided \nSenate, but it also gave a majority of one on 15 committees.\n  I am troubled by breaking the precedent of the Senate. I think it is \nimportant that we work together. I compliment the leaders because they \nhave been working together. It is incumbent upon us to make this work.\n  Not everybody is happy with the resolution, but this is the Senate. I \nthink it is vitally important for our country that President-elect Bush \nand we get things done. It is going to be a test. It is a test that I \nwill certainly commit to do everything I can to make it successful. I \nsee some challenges. Any committee you look at, if you have an equal \nnumber--most committees have an odd number, so if you have disputes, \none group or the other is going to win. We are going to try to run \ncommittees on equal numbers. That will be a challenge for Democrats and \nRepublicans, and it will be incumbent upon all of us to work together. \nWhile I am not totally satisfied with this resolution, I commit to the \nleaders to help make it successful.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the resolution of organization \nof the Senate in 1953 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the 83d Congress, 1st Session, Senate Report, No. 1, Jan. 7 \n                    (legislative day, Jan. 6), 1953]\n\n                   STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n                       [To accompany S. Res. 18]\n\n       The Committee on Rules and Administration, to whom was \n     referred the resolution (S. Res. 18) proposing changes in the \n     number of certain standing committees, having considered \n     same, report thereon favorably with an amendment, and \n     recommend that the resolution, as amended, be agreed to by \n     the Senate.\n       This resolution would accomplish the following changes in \n     the Senate rules affecting certain standing committees as \n     follows:\n       1. To increase 10 standing committees by 2 members each (1 \n     majority, 1 minority), and to reduce 5 similarly.\n       2. To permit 18 Senators of the majority and 3 of the \n     minority to serve on four standing committees--Civil Service, \n     District of Columbia, Public Works, or Government Operations. \n     (Present rules do not include Civil Service or Public Works \n     and do not recognize the minority.)\n       This will present the following committee picture:\n       15 members instead of 13 (9):\n       Agriculture\n       Armed Services\n       Banking and Currency\n       Finance\n       Foreign Relations\n       Interstate and Foreign Commerce\n       Judiciary\n       Labor and Public Welfare\n       Interior and Insular Affairs\n       11 members instead of 13 (5):\n       Civil Service\n       District of Columbia\n       Government Operations\n       Public Works\n       Rules and Administration\n       23 members instead of 21 (1):\n       Appropriations\n     The proposal\n       1. Creates 20 new positions in the more desired committees \n     (10 each for majority and minority) without increasing total \n     number of committees.\n       2.

Establishes a minimum margin of 1 for the majority party \n     in each of the Senate's 15 committees, which present rules do \n     not, in an evenly divided Senate.

Permits continuity and experience for both parties on \n     the committees which, in the past, have tended to be loaded \n     with new Senators.\n       5. Insures better use of senatorial talent, industry, and \n     ability, for both majority and minority.\n     In summary\n       1. The plan meets the necessary mechanics of an evenly \n     divided Senate.\n       2. It opens the door for new Senators on major committees.\n       3. It retains the values of long Senate service.\n       4. It dispossesses no one, has distinct advantages for \n     majority and minority.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I join the number of colleagues who have \nspoken on the floor with respect to this agreement. I share both the \nrespect and admiration that have been expressed for the leadership for \nthe work they have done in order to bring us here.\n  Particularly, I know the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, worked \nhard within his caucus and had to be particularly persuasive in order \nto reach this accord.\n  I think this agreement respects the outcome of the election this \nyear. It is a reflection of the closeness of the division in the \nPresidential race. It is, in my judgment, a fair and accurate \nreflection of what happened in the Senate itself with the losses that \ntook place on one side of the aisle and a result that ended up with 50 \nSenators in both parties.\n  I have argued since day one that the only fair way, and the only \nsensible way, to try to bring the country together and set the stage to \nbe able to reach the compromises we needed to reach was to reflect the \nrepresentation of the Senate as a whole in the committee structures.\n  Some on the other side argued for some period of time that that is \nnot the way it should work. We heard some people talking a few moments \nago about how, if you are responsible for driving the train, you then \nneed the extra vote in order to be able to guarantee that you can drive \nthe train.\n  The problem with that argument all along is, that is not what the \nrepresentation of the Senate itself reflects.\n  The second problem with the argument is that it relied essentially on \nthe notion that, by having an extra vote, you somehow have an added \npower beyond the power of compromise, beyond the power of logic, beyond \nthe power of the merits of your argument, that you have a power of the \nextra votes simply to drive your will through. We have seen that in \noperation in the last few years in the Senate, frankly. I think for \nmany of us it has been a very negative and, frankly, a very \nunproductive experience.\n  The last few years saw us avoiding the rules of the Senate in order \nto drive through by virtue of the fact that there were more votes on \none side. In the end, you may be able to do that on occasion, whether \nit is the reconciliation rules that allow you to do that, or it is a \nparticular conference rule, or the Rule XXVIII issues we have had over \nthe last years. Those allowed you to do it.\n  But I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia would give \nthe most eloquent argument in the Senate for the fact that that didn't \nnecessarily serve the interests of the Senate nor even the interests of \nthe country.\n  What we have achieved today I believe stands to set the stage for the \nability of the Senate to serve the interests of the country.\n  Is there something of a sense of loss for some by virtue of this \nagreement? I think yes. I think that is reflected in the sort of \ndifficulty that was presented in getting here to this moment. But in \nthe end, I think the logic was simply so powerful that 50/50 on both \nsides means you divide the Senators and their committees according to \nthat number.\n  I admire and respect the Senator from Texas, who is one of the \nbrightest and most articulate people in the Senate and who read from \nthe Constitution about the powers of the Vice President to cast a vote \nto break a tie. Indeed, that is absolutely true. But I think most \nconstitutional experts would tell you that is sort of the vote of last \nresort--that it never contemplated that the Vice President of the \nUnited States is somehow going to be represented on every single \ncommittee, and then he is going to go to each committee and cast a \nvote. It contemplates, if there is a tie and ultimately there is the \ninability of the Senate to work its will of compromise, that in that \ncase the Vice President has the ability to cast his vote. Now the Vice \nPresident will still have that ability. That is respected in this \nagreement.\n\n  What this agreement achieves, which I think is perhaps the most \nimportant missing ingredient of the Senate, was reflected in the \ncomments of the Senator from West Virginia, our former leader and \nPresident pro tempore, who turned to his colleague on the \nAppropriations Committee and talked about trust. He talked about \nrespect. Those committees that work the best in the Senate don't need \nthis resolution. Those chairmen of either party who want to make their \ncommittee work effectively don't need a resolution to know the best way \nto get something through the Senate and through the House is to be \ninclusive, not exclusive.\n  So, in fact, we in the minority were remarkably forbearing in the \nlast year or two in not pressing the full advantage of the rules that \nwe might have pressed in order to stop the Senate cold in its tracks in \norder to disrupt in the many ways possible, using the rules of \nparliamentary procedure, to require our colleagues to be repeatedly on \nthe floor of the Senate to vote. In many ways, we were acquiescent, and \nsome might blame us for having been so. I think it was out of respect \nfor the process and out of the belief that there is a better way to get \nbusiness done here.\n  What I believe this agreement now does is set the stage for us to be \nable in the Senate to grow the respect and the trust about which the \nSenator from West Virginia talked. It gives Members the opportunity and \nrequires Members in committee to look to the other side of the aisle to \ntry to build the consensus necessary.\n  We all understand in that process we will never necessarily get 100 \nof our colleagues or 99 of our colleagues, but we can build enough of a \nconsensus that we can send legislation to the floor with votes of 16-4 \nor 18-0 or of a sufficient number at least to recognize that there has \nbeen a respect for the views of both sides rather than a willingness to \nsimply write a piece of legislation in conference without even \nincluding one Member of the Senate of the other side of the aisle and \nthen bring it to the floor and expect people to be happy and expect to \npass something that doesn't invite a veto or that somehow has the \nconsent of the American people.\n  The American people are why we are here, all of us. I think this \nagreement today respects what the American people said on election day. \nI think it respects this institution. I think it gives everyone an \nopportunity, long awaited, to do a better job of being Senators and \nallowing this body to be the great deliberative entity that it is \nsupposed to be.\n  In the end, this resolution and the words that comprise it in its \nthree pages are not going to do the job. Any Senator who is \nsufficiently disgruntled by this agreement, who figures that they will \ngo their own path, has the ability to continue to do things as we have \ndone them in the last few years. But I think this is a message to all \nMembers that we have an opportunity to try to legislate in the best \nsense of the word, to find the compromise. There is no way this will \nwork without that compromise. All Members need to understand that.\n  I hope in the next days the American people will see the Senate set \nthe example that we all want, and I know we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts. He is a Senator of enormous \nability and great talents. One of those talents is the capability of \nelocution in such an impressive and persuasive manner. I want to thank \nhim for his words today.\n  The President-elect can be very grateful to the two leaders of this \nbody today and to the Senators who have acceded to the needs and the \nrequirements of the moment to give up a little; everyone gives up a \nlittle. We are waiving some rules; we are temporarily changing some \nrules in this resolution. In the interests of going forward in the \nNation and in the interests of making it possible for this institution \nto rise to the expectations of the American people and accede to their \nwill, this resolution is really a unique instrument.\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\n  As the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has just said, this \nresolution makes it possible for the Senate to work its will; and \nachieve legislative goals; it only makes it possible. We, the Members \non both sides of the aisle, have to make it work. I am constrained to \nhope--yea, even believe--that we are going to make it work. The things \nI have heard said on this floor today make me believe that.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator. I have known him for a long time. \nI thank him for his contribution today.\n  Mr. President, if I may speak just for a few minutes, I ask unanimous \nconsent I may address the Senate on another matter for not to exceed 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S44-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S44]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on December 31st the Nation lost a \nremarkable man.\n  At his home in Los Altos, California, lands-end of the Nation and \nState he served, Alan Cranston did not witness the beginning of the new \nmillennium.\n  It has been said that death is the great leveler. But Alan Cranston's \naccomplishments in life have clearly set him apart.\n  Nearly seven decades ago, a young American journalist from California \npublished an unexpurgated version of Adolf Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' ``My \nStruggle''--revealing, as few had previously done, the true depth of \nthe danger and the evil that Hitler embodied. Hitler successfully sued \nfor copyright violation, and Alan Cranston wore that loss as a proud \nbadge throughout his life.\n  After a career in journalism, service in the U.S. Army during World \nWar II, business, and local politics, Alan Cranston joined the members \nof this U.S. Senate in 1969 by virtue of his election in the previous \nNovember.\n  Here, Senator Cranston's vision and rich composition of experiences, \ntalents, and wisdom enriched our Senate deliberations.\n  In 1977, when I was elected Senate Democratic Leader, Senator \nCranston won election as Assistant Democratic Leader, or ``whip.'' In \nall his years of working, first as my proverbial ``right hand'' and, \nsubsequently, as a close colleague in the Senate leadership when I \nbecame President pro tempore, Senator Cranston was a conscientious \nadjutant and a congenial friend and partner in numerous legislative \nefforts. Unfortunately, words alone cannot adequately convey the \nrespect in which I held Senator Cranston, nor the solid appreciation \nthat I felt for Senator Cranston and for his loyalty, his supreme \ndedication, his high purpose, his contributions to the Senate's work \nthrough many years.\n  He was a fine lieutenant, if I may use that term. He was always there \nwhen I needed him. And many times I said that he was absolutely the \nbest nose counter that I had ever seen in the Senate.\n  But friendship and respect are not always easily forged. Tragedy \nmakes a bond. In 1980, Senator Cranston was dealt Fate's glancing blow \nwith the death of a child, a loss of a promise to the future, when, his \nson, Robin Cranston, died in a traffic accident in 1980, at the age of \n33. Two years later, my wife, Erma, and I were dealt a similar blow \nwith the death of our grandson, John Michael Moore, in a traffic \naccident.\n  Mr. President, a valedictory is not always sad and it is fitting that \nSenator Cranston's final words on this Floor regarding his career be \nrepeated here. On October 8, 1992, he made these short and poignant \nremarks:\n\n       Mr. President, a Senator from California gets involved in \n     myriad issues. Just about every issue that exists has an \n     impact, somehow, in the remarkable State of 30 million \n     people that I represent. So I have been involved in \n     countless issues over my time in the Senate.\n       Most of all, I have dedicated myself to the cause of peace, \n     and to the environment. In many a sense I believe that my \n     work on the environment is probably the longest-lasting work \n     I have accomplished here.\n       When you deal with a social issue, or a war and peace \n     issue, or an economic issue, or whatever the results, the \n     consequences are fleeting. Whatever you accomplish is soon \n     changed, and often what you have done leads to new problems \n     that then have to be dealt with.\n       But when you preserve a wild river, or a wilderness, or \n     help create a national park, that is forever. That part of \n     your State, our Nation, is then destined to be there forever \n     after, as God created it.\n       I worked with particular dedication over these years, too, \n     on issues of justice, equal rights, human rights, civil \n     rights, voting rights, equal opportunity. I worked for \n     democracy and freedom in my country and in all countries. I \n     focused particularly on housing, and transportation, and \n     veterans.\n       I thank the people of California for the remarkable \n     opportunity I have had to serve them in the Senate for almost \n     a quarter of a century.\n\n  Today, I along with millions of Americans, thank my friend, Alan \nCranston, for his work, his life, and his vision.\n\n       No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece \n     of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed \n     away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a \n     promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of \n     thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am \n     involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for \n     whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S44-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S44-S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on an issue that \nis important to our national security: the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, or CTBT, that would ban all nuclear weapon tests. This is an \nissue that the new President and the new Senate should think about \ncarefully and deliberately during the 107th Congress.\n  Today General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, presented a report to President Clinton on his findings and \nrecommendations on the CTBT. President Clinton had asked General \nShalikashvili to conduct a comprehensive and independent study of the \nCTBT after the Senate voted against a resolution of ratification in \nOctober of 1999.\n  The CTBT negotiations were completed in 1996, and the United States \nwas the first nation to sign the Treaty. To date, 160 nations have \nsigned it and 69 have ratified it, including all our NATO allies, \nJapan, South Korea and Russia. However, to enter into force, it must be \nratified by 44 specified nations that have nuclear reactors, including \nthe United States.\n  The Treaty would prohibit all nuclear explosive tests. In so doing, \nit would make it much harder for nations to develop nuclear weapons, \nthus putting in place an important roadblock to nuclear weapon \nproliferation. The treaty provides for an expanded and improved \ninternational monitoring system that would improve our ability to \ndetect and deter nuclear tests by other nations--but only if we ratify \nthe treaty and it enters into force.\n  Secretary of Defense Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff all support \nratification of the CTBT, as do four former Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, including General Shalikashvili and Gen. Colin Powell.\n  When the Senate took up the CTBT in October 1999, it did so in haste \nand without the traditional bipartisan deliberation we have accorded \nother arms control treaties. On the eve of the vote, 62 Senators signed \na letter urging the Senate leadership to delay that vote and to \npostpone final consideration of the CTBT until the 107th Congress. \nUnfortunately, that request, which was made by nearly two-thirds of the \nMembers of the Senate, to delay the vote, was not heeded, and the \nresult was that the resolution of ratification was defeated by a vote \nof 51-48, with one Senator voting present.\n  Again, General Shalikashvili was asked to review the entire \nsituation, and in conducting his review, he met with a number of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle to discuss their concerns and \ntheir suggestions. He also met with many other experts on this issue, \nand he visited the nuclear weapons labs.\n  General Shalikashvili's report is a valuable contribution to this \nimportant topic. This report, which was just filed today, places the \nCTBT in the broader context of our nuclear nonproliferation goals and \nefforts and\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\npoints out that the CTBT is an important component of this enduring \nnational security priority of nuclear nonproliferation. He concludes \nthat the CTBT remains in our national interest and that the Senate \nshould reconsider the treaty in a bipartisan manner, hopefully with the \nresult that ratification is approved by the Senate.\n  General Shalikashvili's report reviews the major concerns which were \nexpressed about the CTBT during our debate, and it offers \nrecommendations in each of these areas, including ways to improve our \nmonitoring and verification of foreign nuclear testing efforts and ways \nto improve our nuclear weapons Stockpile Stewardship Program. These \nrecommendations address concerns raised about the CTBT and provide some \ncommonsense and balanced steps to improve our security while bringing \nthe CTBT into force.\n  Specifically, General Shalikashvili's report examines the larger \nnonproliferation context of the CTBT and concludes that the CTBT has a \ngenuine nonproliferation value for our national security. His report \nstudies the question of monitoring and verification and concludes that \nthe monitoring system under the treaty will significantly enhance U.S. \nnational monitoring capabilities and that cheating will be much harder \nand less useful than some fear. He evaluates our ability to maintain \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons and determines that \nwe can do so without nuclear testing if we fully support the Stockpile \nStewardship Program and manage it prudently.\n  Finally, General Shalikashvili's report looks at the question of \nwhether CTBT should be of indefinite duration and recommends that in \naddition to the safeguards accompanying the treaty, the Senate and the \nexecutive branch should conduct a joint review of the treaty 10 years \nafter ratification and at 10-year intervals thereafter.\n  One of the key points made by General Shalikashvili is that the CTBT \nis conditioned on a safeguard that will assure our ability to maintain \na safe and reliable stockpile. Under safeguard F, the United States \nwould maintain the right and the ability to withdraw from the treaty \nand to conduct any testing necessary if that were required to certify \nthe safety and reliability of a nuclear weapon type critical to our \nnuclear deterrent. General Shalikashvili's recommendation on the joint \nreview would strengthen this safeguard by saying that if, after that \njoint review, grave doubts remained about the treaty's value for our \nnational security, the President would be prepared to withdraw from the \ntreaty.\n  I know General Shalikashvili's report will be considered carefully \nand seriously by the Senate and by the new administration. I hope we \nand the new administration will review his report and think through our \nCTBT position in a deliberate manner, and I will be making this point \npersonally to President-elect Bush next Monday at a meeting in Austin \nfor congressional defense and security leaders.\n  We owe General Shalikashvili a national debt of gratitude for serving \nour Nation and its security once again. He has taken a great deal of \nhis time since retiring to review the CTBT and to craft recommendations \nthat I hope we will implement. I recommend his report to all Senators \nand to the new administration, and I hope we will reconsider the treaty \nin the best bipartisan spirit of the Senate as his report recommends.\n  I ask unanimous consent that General Shalikashvili's letter to the \nPresident, accompanying his report, and his introduction and \nrecommendations from the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Special Advisor to the President and the Secretary of \n           State for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\n                                                  January 4, 2001.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House.\n       Dear Mr. President: Last year, you and the Secretary of \n     State requested that I serve as your Special Advisor for the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In this capacity, I met with \n     senators from both sides of the aisle to discuss their \n     concerns and suggestions for any additional steps that could \n     be taken to build bipartisan support for ratification. I was \n     deeply appreciative of their willingness to engage in \n     serious, substantive discussions about the Test Ban Treaty.\n       In addition to talking with senators, I have also discussed \n     the Treaty with senior members of your administration, \n     leading national security experts from former \n     administrations, representatives of non-governmental \n     organizations, and numerous scientific and diplomatic \n     experts. I have visited the three nuclear weapon \n     laboratories, met with their directors, and talked with a \n     number of senior nuclear designers. My representatives have \n     traveled to the Air Force Technical Applications Center, \n     which operates U.S. national technical means for monitoring \n     compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, and to Vienna, \n     where work is underway on the international verification \n     system. I asked several think tanks to provide a ``second \n     opinion'' about verification and the Treaty's impact on other \n     countries' nuclear ambitions. I have also reviewed numerous \n     reports by external expert groups.\n       At the end of my review of the Treaty's potential impact on \n     U.S. national security, I support the Treaty, just as I did \n     when I served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. My \n     discussions over the last ten months have only strengthened \n     my view that the Treaty is a very important part of global \n     non-proliferation efforts and is compatible with keeping a \n     safe, reliable U.S. nuclear deterrent. I believe that an \n     objective and thorough net assessment shows convincingly that \n     U.S. interests, as well as those of friends and allies, will \n     be served by the Treaty's entry into force.\n       The nation's nuclear arsenal is safe, reliable, and able to \n     meet all stated military requirements. For as far into the \n     future as we can see, the U.S. nuclear deterrent can remain \n     effective under the Test Ban Treaty, assuming prudent \n     stockpile stewardship--including the ability to remanufacture \n     aging components. While there are steps that should be taken \n     to better manage the long-term risks associated with \n     stockpile stewardship, I believe that there is no good reason \n     to delay ratification of the Treaty pending further advances \n     in the Stockpile Stewardship Program as long as we have a \n     credible mechanism to leave the Treaty should a serious \n     problem with the deterrent make that necessary. I fear that \n     the longer entry into force is delayed, the more likely it is \n     that other countries will move irrevocably to acquire nuclear \n     weapons or significantly improve their current nuclear \n     arsenal, and the less likely it is that we could mobilize a \n     strong international coalition against such activities.\n       In my consultations with senators, I have found broad \n     bipartisan support for strengthened U.S. leadership of a \n     comprehensive international response to the dangers posed by \n     the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The overarching \n     question has been whether the contributions that the Test Ban \n     Treaty can make to national and international security \n     outweigh any potential risks. I have recommended a number of \n     steps that do not involve renegotiating the Treaty and that \n     would go a long way toward addressing specific concerns. I am \n     confident that there would be broad bipartisan support for \n     those of my recommendations that deal with developing a more \n     integrated non-proliferation policy, enhancing U.S. \n     capabilities to track nuclear proliferation and monitor \n     nuclear testing, and strengthening stockpile stewardship. I \n     urge their early implementation because these actions are \n     important for national security without regard to the \n     immediate fate of the Test Ban Treaty. Since these steps \n     would also strengthen the U.S. position under the Treaty, I \n     hope that the next Administration and the Senate will re-\n     evaluate the Test Ban Treaty as part of a bipartisan effort \n     to forge an integrated non-proliferation strategy for the new \n     century.\n       I hope that the attacked report will prove useful in \n     charting a course for future reconsideration and eventual \n     ratification of the Test Ban Treaty. Should developments at \n     home or abroad ever cast doubt on our ability to maintain a \n     safe, reliable, and effective nuclear deterrent, however, we \n     should withdraw from the Treaty if a resumption of nuclear \n     testing would make us more secure. My recommendations would \n     reduce the likelihood of such problems and provide additional \n     reassurances that, if they did occur, the United States would \n     take the appropriate actions. As additional insurance, I am \n     also recommending a joint ten-year Executive-Legislative \n     review of the full range of issues bearing on the Treaty's \n     net value for national security in response to concerns about \n     the Treaty's indefinite duration.\n       The rest of the world is looking to us for continued \n     leadership of global efforts to stop proliferation and \n     strengthen the nuclear restraint regime. Nothing could be \n     more important to national security and international \n     stability.\n           Very respectfully,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     General, USA (Ret.)\n                                  ____\n\n\nFindings and Recommendations Concerning the Comprehensive Nuclear Test \n                               Ban Treaty\n\n (By General John M. Shalikashvili (USA, Ret.), Special Advisor to the \n            President and Secretary of State, January 2001)\n\n\n                            i. introduction\n\n       A decade after the end of the Cold War, nuclear weapons are \n     still important to U.S. and allied security, a silent giant \n     guarding against a catastrophic miscalculation by a potential \n     adversary. The United States has the safest, most reliable, \n     most capable arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. It will\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\n     need a credible deterrent as long as nuclear weapons exist.\n       Equally important to our security are global non-\n     proliferation efforts. For the past half century, the United \n     States has led the campaign to prevent the spread of nuclear \n     weapons to additional countries or terrorist groups, and to \n     reduce the chances that such weapons would ever be used.\n       The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty places obstacles \n     in the path of nuclear weapon development by states that \n     could some day threaten the United States or its allies. The \n     question associated with Treaty ratification is whether the \n     security benefits from the Treaty outweigh any risks that a \n     ban on all nuclear explosions could pose to the U.S. \n     deterrent.\n       Four types of concerns have been most prominent in the \n     debate on advice and consent to ratification in October 1999 \n     and in my subsequent investigations:\n       1. Whether the Test Ban Treaty has genuine non-\n     proliferation value;\n       2. Whether cheating could threaten U.S. security;\n       3. Whether we can maintain the safety and reliability of \n     the U.S. nuclear deterrent without nuclear explosive testing; \n     and\n       4. Whether it is wise to endorse a Test Ban Treaty of \n     indefinite duration.\n       After examining these issues, I remain convinced that the \n     advantages of the Test Ban Treaty outweigh any disadvantages, \n     and thus that ratification would increase national security. \n     In each area, though, I am recommending additional actions to \n     address concerns and further strengthen the U.S. position \n     under the Treaty. I believe that we can go a long way toward \n     bridging differences on these issues if they receive a level \n     of sustained bipartisan attention equal to their high \n     importance for national security.\n       The broad objectives of my specific recommendations are to:\n       1. Increase bipartisan and allied support for a carefully \n     coordinated comprehensive non-proliferation;\n       2. Enhance U.S. capabilities to detect and deter nuclear \n     testing and other aspects of nuclear proliferation;\n       3. Improve the management of potential risks associated \n     with the long-term reliability and safety of the U.S. nuclear \n     deterrent; and\n       4. Address concerns about the Test Ban Treaty's indefinite \n     duration through a joint Executive-Legislative review of the \n     Treaty's net value for national security to be held ten years \n     after ratification and at regular intervals thereafter.\n       Test Ban Treaty supporters, skeptics, and opponents all \n     agree that the United States needs to revitalize support for \n     an integrated non-proliferation strategy, enhance its \n     monitoring capabilities, and develop a bipartisan consensus \n     on stewardship of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. I urge early \n     implementation of my recommendations on these issues because \n     they would strengthen U.S. security regardless of the \n     immediate fate of the Test Ban Treaty. Action on these steps \n     would also go a long way toward addressing concerns that have \n     been voiced about the Treaty. Together with my recommendation \n     on the ten-year joint review procedure, these steps offer a \n     way to build bipartisan support for Test Ban Treaty \n     ratification as an integral component of an overarching \n     strategy to stop nuclear proliferation and strengthen the \n     nuclear restraint regime.\n\n\n                  VIII. Compilation of Recommendations\n\n     Nuclear Weapons, Non-Proliferation, and the Test Ban Treaty\n       A. Working closely with the Congress and with U.S. friends \n     and allies, the next Administration should implement on an \n     urgent basis an integrated non-proliferation policy targeted \n     on, but not limited to, countries and groups believed to have \n     an active interest in acquiring nuclear weapons.\n       B. To increase high level attention and policy coherence, \n     the next Administration should appoint a Deputy National \n     Security Advisor for Non-Proliferation, with the authority \n     and resources needed to coordinate and oversee implementation \n     of U.S. non-proliferation policy.\n       C. As part of its effort to build bipartisan and allied \n     support for an integrated non-proliferation policy, the next \n     Administration should review at the highest level issues \n     related to the Test Ban Treaty. There should be a sustained \n     interagency effort to address senators' questions and \n     concerns on these issues of great importance to national \n     security.\n       D. The United States should continue its testing moratorium \n     and take other concrete actions to demonstrate its commitment \n     to a world without nuclear explosions, such as continuing \n     leadership in building up the International Monitoring System \n     (IMS) being established for the Treaty.\n     Monitoring, Verification, and Foreign Nuclear Programs\n       A. Higher funding and intelligence collection priorities \n     should be assigned to monitoring nuclear test activities and \n     other aspects of nuclear weapon acquisition or development by \n     other states.\n       B. Collaboration should be increased among U.S. government \n     officials and other experts to ensure that national \n     intelligence, the Treaty's international verification regime, \n     and other scientific stations are used as complementary \n     components of an all-source approach to verification.\n       C. The transition from research to operational use should \n     be accelerated for new verification technologies and \n     analytical techniques.\n       D. The United States should continue working with other \n     Test Ban Treaty signatories to prepare for inspections and \n     develop confidence-building measures.\n       E. Additional steps should be taken unilaterally or \n     bilaterally to increase transparency regarding the nature and \n     purpose of activities at known nuclear test sites.\n     Stewardship of the U.S. Nuclear Stockpile\n       A. Working with the Department of Defense, other Executive \n     Branch agencies, and the Congress, the Administrator of the \n     NNSA should complete as soon as possible his comprehensive \n     review of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The review will \n     clarify objectives and requirements, set priorities, assess \n     progress, identify needs, and develop an overarching program \n     plan with broad-based support.\n       Highest priority should be given to aspects of stockpile \n     stewardship that are most urgently needed to assure the near-\n     term reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, i.e. \n     surveillance, refurbishment, and infrastructure \n     revitalization.\n       Enhance surveillance and monitoring activities should \n     receive full support and not be squeezed by higher profile \n     aspects of the SSP.\n       The NNSA should make a decision about the need for a large-\n     scale plutonium pit remanufacturing facility as soon as \n     possible after the next Administration has determined the \n     appropriate size and composition of the enduring stockpile, \n     including reserves.\n       A dedicated infrastructure revitalization fund should be \n     established after the NNSA has completed a revitalization \n     plan for its production facilities and laboratories.\n       B. The NNSA, working with Congress and the Office of \n     Management and Budget, should place the SSP on a multi-year \n     budget cycle like the Department of Defense's Future Years \n     Defense Program. Some increase in funds for the SSP is likely \n     to be necessary\n       C. Steps to improve interagency management of stockpile \n     stewardship matters, such as the revitalization of the \n     Nuclear Weapons Council, are essential and should be \n     continued.\n       D. Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that the \n     performance margins of various weapon types are adequate when \n     conservatively evaluated.\n       E. Strict discipline should be exercised over changes to \n     existing nuclear weapon designs to ensure that neither an \n     individual change nor the cumulative effect of small \n     modifications would make it difficult to certify weapons \n     realiability or safety without a nuclear explosion.\n       F. The Administrator of the NNSA should establish an on-\n     going high level external advisory mechanism, such as a panel \n     of outstanding and independent scientists.\n     Minimizing Uncertainty with a Treaty of Indefinite Duration\n       A. The Administration and the Senate should commit to \n     conducting an intensive joint review of the Test Ban Treaty's \n     net value for national security ten years after U.S. \n     ratification, and at ten-year intervals thereafter. This \n     review should consider the Stockpile Stewardship Program's \n     priorities, accomplishments, and challenges; current and \n     planned verification capabilities; and the Treaty's \n     adherence, implementation, compliance, and enforcement \n     record. Recommendations to address concerns should be \n     formulated for domestic use and to inform the U.S. position \n     at the Treaty's ten-year review conference. If, after these \n     steps, grave doubts remain about the Treaty's net value for \n     U.S. national security, the President, in consultation with \n     Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the Test Ban \n     Treaty under the ``supreme national interests'' clause.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S46-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S46-S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY REPORT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General John M. Shalikashvili, released his report \nreviewing the major issues regarding ratification of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty (CTBT) which was rejected by the Senate in a vote last \nfall. His review of the brief debate in the Senate over this critical \nmatter of national security is thorough in its scope and balanced in \nits recommendations. I urge President Bush and his national security \nadvisory team to review General Shalikashvili's report closely and \nundertake to address his observations and recommendations immediately.\n  When it comes to the proliferation or improvement of nuclear weapons, \ntime is NOT on our side. The CTBT, when ratified and in force, will \ndiscourage non-nuclear weapons states from creating their own nuclear \narsenals and prevent current nuclear states from building new \ncapabilities that can endanger American and international security. The \nhearings held in the Senate last fall, although not nearly as \ncomprehensive as they should have been,\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\ndid serve to articulate issues of greatest concern to those who are \nuncertain or opposed to the treaty.\n  Those issues must be addressed head-on in order for the nation to \nproceed in a bipartisan way regarding further consideration of the \nTreaty. The international community of nations is watching us closely \nto see what direction the United States will choose to take. In his \nreport, General Shalikashvili has identified the key controversial \nissues and calls for specific actions to meet primary concerns before \nthe President and the Senate reconsider the Treaty.\n  President-elect Bush has clearly stated that he seeks to unify the \ncountry and is committed to enhancing our national security. Given the \ndivisions in the electorate and in the Congress itself, the challenge \nof gaining bipartisan support on key legislative matters including \ndefense matters is a daunting one for the new administration. Given the \noutstanding work of General Shalikashvili in reviewing last year's \ndebate on the CTBT, President-elect Bush has a very important \nopportunity to pursue bipartisan national security policy by committing \nto review General Shalikashvili's thoughtful assessment and to \nundertaking the recommendations he has put forward. As a member of the \nbipartisan Senate working group that has been examining the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support General Shalikashvili's effort on this critical \nnational security matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S47-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n JOSH HEUPEL RECOGNIZED FOR LEADING TEAM TO NATIONAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Josh \nHeupel, a native of Aberdeen, South Dakota who led the undefeated \nOklahoma Sooners to the National Championship January 3, 2001. Josh and \nthe number one ranked Sooners beat the Florida State Seminoles 13-2 in \nthe FedEx Orange Bowl in Miami.\n  Although the game was a defensive struggle, Josh was able to complete \n25 passes for 214 yards and also ran for another 24 yards. In the third \nquarter, Josh may have made the biggest play of the game when he made a \ncrucial, 39-yard completion that kept the drive going to set up the \nsecond field goal of the game. That field goal gave the Sooners a 6-0 \nadvantage.\n  Josh showed his true character after finishing second in the Heisman \nTrophy race. He explained that while he was disappointed, the only \ntrophy he truly wanted was the National Championship because that \nrepresented the accomplishments of his team, not an individual. On \nWednesday night he was able to accomplish his dream. That selfless \nattitude is charactistic of Josh, not only on the gridiron, but in life \nas well. He is well known for his devotion to his family, particularly \nas a role model for his younger sister, Andrea. He gives his time \nfreely to charities and to work in his church. In fact, the televised \nOrange Bowl game itself was transformed into a community-wide charity \nfundraising event in Josh's hometown of Aberdeen by his friends and \nfamily.\n  Ken and Cindy Heupel are Josh's parents and they can be very proud of \ntheir son's accomplishments, both as a football player and as a caring \nmember of society. Ken is the head football coach at Northern State and \nCindy is the principal at Aberdeen Central High School.\n  From all South Dakotans, I want to wish Josh a heart felt \ncongratulations. Although you have already proven that you are a true \nchampion with the volunteer work and the community service, I am sure \nit is nice to take home the championship hardware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/05/senate-section/article/S47-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S47-S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL CAREY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont is fortunate that it still \nhas at least one major radio station that has not forgotten its \nconnection to the community. This station is WDEV from the town of \nWaterbury. It is only a few miles from where I was born and raised and \nI have known the Squire family who owns the station throughout my life. \nIt is presently owned and run by Ken Squire, who carries on the family \ntradition of representing Vermont first and foremost. Part of that \ntradition has been the long running ``Wake Up Vermont'' program I heard \neach morning with the great team of ``Michael and Michaels.'' The \nprogram was done by Michael Carey and Eric Michaels and was one of the \nfinest radio programs in Vermont. Eric Michaels has a great ability as \nan interviewer on even the most complex of subjects, and Michael Carey \nadded a sense of continuity and comfort to the program. Between the two \nof them one had an enjoyable way to start the day.\n  I was saddened, as were most Vermonters, to hear that Michael Carey \nis retiring. I have known Mike for years and always enjoyed meeting \nwith him, either at the studio in Waterbury or over the phone when I \nwould be on their program from Washington, D.C. Eric Michaels said he \nwill be devastated by the loss of his radio partner and I can well \nimagine he is, but I am thankful that Eric will remain.\n  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say how much Michael Carey \nhas meant to Vermonters and how his sacrifice in getting up in the wee \nhours of the morning made it possible for rest of us to face the day.\n  I want to wish my Washington County neighbor the very best, and to \nthank him for the years of pleasure he has given all of us in central \nVermont, and I ask that an article about this radio legend by Robin \nPalmer in the Times Argus be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, Dec. 30, 2000]\n\n                      Vermont Radio Legend Retires\n\n                           (By Robin Palmer)\n\n       Waterbury.--A radio personality whose reliability co-\n     workers say was unmatched, ended a nearly 40-year career \n     today with a final ``Wake Up, Vermont'' program on WDEV.\n       Michael Carey, 53, is retiring because of health reasons \n     and, despite a last show dedicated to Carey and his many \n     attributes, it was a sad day for him and for central Vermont \n     radio.\n       ``It's a retirement that's been forced upon me and not one \n     that I'm looking forward to. I loved the profession and \n     that's what makes it doubly hard,'' said Carey, who shirked \n     at the attention surrounding him, calling his ``just a \n     profession.''\n       Carey's profession began at an early age, and one he said \n     he never expected to have.\n       At age 13, from his parents' apartment on Elm Street in \n     Waterbury, Carey had an illegal radio station. He played \n     records and read the weather, until a WDEV employee, Norman \n     James, heard Carey's pirate station and thought he'd put the \n     illegal endeavor to some good use, Carey said.\n       James got Carey a job answering phones for a WDEV Saturday \n     night request program called ``The Green Mountain Ballroom.''\n       ``Norm James got my foot in the door,'' said Carey, whose \n     name was already familiar to those at the Waterbury radio \n     station.\n       Carey's late parents, guitarist Morton ``Smokey'' Carey and \n     singer Lois Carey, used to perform each morning on WDEV, said \n     radio station owner Ken Squier.\n       Carey himself was later well known as the drummer in the \n     popular ``Carey Brothers Band'' that entertained throughout \n     the area in the 1970s.\n       In 1965, the radio pirate turned student worker was hired \n     as a full-time announcer at WDEV by legendary Vermont radio \n     personality and former ``Wake Up, Vermont'' host Rusty \n     Parker, who died on the air in 1982 while reading the news.\n       Since his start in the 60s, Carey said, ``I've done every \n     shift here at the radio station except a Sunday night \n     shift.''\n       During that time, ``there have been memories both very good \n     and very bad ones,'' Carey said, listing Parker's death and \n     the death of ``Cousin'' Harold Grout as two of the worst.\n       Two years after Parker's death, in 1984, Carey was promoted \n     to sign-on the station and host the morning program, \n     including ``Once Around the Clock'' from 5 to 6 a.m. and \n     ``The Morning News Service'' from 7 to 8 a.m.\n       When Grout died, Carey became the voice of the long-running \n     ``Trading Post'' program. And in April 1994, Carey was teamed \n     with radio group Vice President and General Manager Eric \n     Michaels for a 6 to 9 a.m. morning news program that \n     quickly became know as ``Wake Up, Vermont with Michael and \n     Michaels.''\n       ``From the first day we were in the studio together we felt \n     like we had worked with each other for a long time,'' said \n     Michaels. ``He can read me like a book.\n       ``So I'm devastated (that Carey's retiring), if you want to \n     put it in a single word. It's like getting a divorce,'' \n     Michaels said.\n       Michaels praised Carey as one of the most competent \n     broadcasters he's ever met. Carey can technically run a show \n     while not missing a beat as an announcer.\n       ``He's an absolutely wonderful news reader,'' said Michaels \n     of his co-host.\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\n       Carey was rarely flustered.\n       ``Doesn't matter if it was a snowstorm and floods, he could \n     always rise to the occasion. Squier said, ``That is his \n     strength.''\n       Bad weather and flooding once closed the Waterbury station \n     and after a 20-minute delay, Michael and Michaels went on-air \n     at a nearby studio that was so cold their lips stuck to the \n     microphones. Carey was unfazed, said Michaels.\n       And one stormy day, it took Michaels over two hours to \n     drive from Barre to Waterbury.\n       ``I called the whole program in by phone,'' said Michaels, \n     who all the while was guided by reliable Carey, sitting \n     comfortably at the station and casually chatting with \n     Michaels over the phone.\n       With Carey's retirement, Michaels will continue on with \n     ``Wake Up, Vermont.'' The ``Michael and Michaels'' portion of \n     the name will be dropped, and another WDEV radio announcer \n     will fill in for Carey while the radio station searches for a \n     replacement.\n       ``It's been the most reluctant job search that I've ever \n     had to do,'' Michaels said.\n       While the job search will stretch beyond Vermont's borders, \n     Squier said he is committed to keeping the morning broadcast \n     a ``Vermont sound.''\n       And Carey is invited back anytime he feels up to it, Squier \n     said.''We were terribly sorry to lose him,'' said Squier.\n       ``I think all of central Vermont will miss him,'' Squier \n     said. ``He was a steady hand for listeners in the morning.''\n       Carey said he may come back at some point and do part-time \n     work but, for now, that's not possible.\n       The Duxbury resident and father of three who for decades \n     has awoken at 3 a.m., said he will be ``trying to get back to \n     a normal life.\n       ``Just some R and R, rest and relaxation, getting on the \n     computer and trying to do some things.
