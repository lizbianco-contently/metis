Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nnomination of Eugene Scalia as the Solicitor of Labor. On previous \noccasions, I have had the opportunity to speak about Mr. Scalia's \noutstanding qualifications for this position. Today, unfortunately, I \nmust also speak about the failure of the majority party to bring his \nnomination to the floor.\n  On April 30, 2001, President Bush nominated Eugene Scalia as the \nSolicitor of Labor. That was 231 days ago. On October 17 he was \nreported out of committee. That was 2 months ago today. A lot of time \nhas elapsed since his nomination. Time has also elapsed since his \nsuccessful reporting out of committee. This is a longer confirmation \nperiod than any Solicitor of Labor in the past 20 years.\n  Each day that passes without a vote on his nomination is an injustice \nnot only to Mr. Scalia but to the President, the Department of Labor, \nand all those who are served by the Department as well.\n  I have with me today a letter to Senator Kennedy, who is the head of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The letter adds \nemphasis to what I have just said, that this is the longest time in 20 \nyears that it has taken for a Solicitor of the Department of Labor to \nbe considered. It also talks about how important this position is and \nhow important it is to have it filled right away.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2002, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $422 per year or $211 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $5.00 per copy.

DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S13322]]\n\n  Probably the most important and most interesting part of this is who \nsigned it. We have Thomas Williamson, who was the Solicitor of Labor \nunder President Clinton; we have Robert Davis, who was the Solicitor of \nLabor under President George H.W. Bush; we have George Salem, who was \nthe Solicitor of Labor under President Reagan; and William Kilberg, who \nwas the Solicitor of Labor under Presidents Nixon and Ford.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy and Senator Gregg: We served as \n     Solicitor of Labor in the administrations of Presidents \n     Nixon, Ford, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton. We are \n     writing to urge that the Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions proceed expeditiously with the \n     nomination of the current Solicitor nominee, Eugene Scalia.\n       The uniqueness and importance of the solicitor is reflected \n     by the Department's structure, which places him as the third-\n     ranking official, as you are aware. His involvement is \n     crucial to the Department's performance of its important \n     mission--the enforcement of the labor and employment laws \n     administered by the Department, the development of legally \n     compliant policy initiatives, and the issuance of regulations \n     in furtherance of those laws. While it is possible for the \n     Department to function without a confirmed Solicitor for \n     short periods of time, the absence of a Solicitor inevitably \n     causes significant interference with the Department's \n     operation and most important, is detrimental to those who are \n     protected by our Nation's labor laws. Without a Solicitor the \n     Department has more difficulty making important litigation \n     decisions; important enforcement initiatives may be delayed \n     as a consequence, and employment law violations may go \n     unaddressed. The absence of a confirmed Solicitor also makes \n     it harder for the Deparment to make significant regulatory \n     decisions, as the Secretary and other senior staff await \n     legal review by the person the President has nominated for \n     that task. Finally, the institution of the Office of the \n     Solicitor, which is the second largest cabinet-level legal \n     office, itself suffers when the Solicitor cannot personally \n     participate in the Department's deliberations, and functions \n     ordinarily performed by the Solicitor are assumed by other \n     departmental personnel.\n       Eugene Scalia was nominated to be Solicitor in April. We \n     recognize that some have raised concerns with his nomination. \n     We believe, however, that the best course at this time is to \n     have those concerns addressed in a confirmation hearing, so \n     that the Office of the Solicitor may be filled as soon as \n     practicable. Thank you.\n     Henry L. Solano,\n       Solicitor of Labor under President Clinton.\n     Robert P. Davis,\n       Solicitor of Labor under President George H.W. Bush.\n     William J. Kilberg,\n       Solicitor of Labor under Presidents Nixon, Ford.\n     Thomas S. Williamson,\n       Solicitor of Labor under President Clinton.\n     George R. Salem,\n       Solicitor of Labor under President Reagan.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. It is difficult to envision a better qualified person for \nthe Solicitor of Labor than Eugene Scalia. He is a nationally \nrecognized expert in the field of employment and labor law. I sat \nthrough the hearings in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. Some very penetrating questions were asked. Some excellent \nanswers were given.\n  A record was built. We know this is a man who will follow the \ndirection that was given during his hearings and was intended by the \nnomination of the President of the United States, a person who is \nexcellently qualified.\n  In fact, there was no question of his qualifications. As Professor \nCass Sunstein from the University of Chicago wrote in support of Mr. \nScalia's nomination:\n\n       In terms of sheer capacity to do a fine job, he's as good a \n     choice as can be imagined.\n\n  However, this exceptionally qualified nominee has not even been \nafforded a vote on his nomination. In the meantime, the absence of a \nSolicitor significantly harms the Department of Labor's operations as \nwell as those who are protected by the Nation's labor laws. The \nSolicitor enforces the laws under the Department's jurisdiction and \nadvises on the legality of the actions the Secretary and others at the \nDepartment want to take. Without this crucial position, the Department \ncannot effectively perform its important mission.\n  I do not see any justifiable explanation for failing to bring the \nPresident's nominee for the Solicitor of Labor to the floor. He \ndeserves a vote. What I do see is an attempt to hold up Mr. Scalia's \nnomination because he took a position consistent with a majority of \nboth Houses of Congress.\n  In previous articles, he had some opposition to ergonomics, and I am \ntalking about the repealed ergonomics rule that was put forward by \nOSHA, a rule that was seriously flawed both in its process and in its \nsubstance. Congress rejected the ergonomics rule for the same reason \nMr. Scalia and many other experts have articulated.\n  There is simply no justification for now denying Mr. Scalia a vote \nbecause he is opposed to a rule this Senate also rejected.\n  There is also simply no justification for opposing Mr. Scalia's \nconfirmation because of his last name. I hope my colleagues will not \nallow any antipathy they have for Mr. Scalia's father to cloud this \nbody's solemn responsibility regarding confirmation of Presidential \nnominees.\n  The President has selected Eugene Scalia to be the Solicitor of \nLabor. Our task is to evaluate whether the President's choice is, in \nfact, qualified for the position. In Mr. Scalia, the President has \nchosen someone with the credentials and character to make an \noutstanding Solicitor.\n  Mr. Scalia's nomination has been reported out of committee, yet he \nremains in limbo, as I mentioned, 231 days since his nomination, 2 \nmonths since he was successfully reported out of committee. Mr. \nScalia's nomination should be brought to the floor of the Senate. Mr. \nScalia is entitled to that. The President is entitled to that. The \nSecretary of Labor is entitled to that. Everyone who is served by the \nDepartment is entitled to that. I urge the majority leader and my \ncolleagues to ensure this happens.\n  I ask my colleagues to read the letter from the former Solicitors to \nsee how important the position is and how important it is to have the \nPresident's choice installed in that position.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The absence of a quorum having been \nsuggested, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13322-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the conference report \non the education reform bill. I urge the Senate to approve it. This \nlandmark bipartisan legislation contains far-reaching reforms to give \nall the Nation's students much greater opportunity than ever before to \nsucceed educationally, to do well economically and participate fully in \nAmerican society, and to enable schools and communities across the \nNation to provide a much higher quality of education for their \nstudents.\n  The conference committee has worked well together for over 5 months \nto reach these agreements. I commend all of the conferees for their \neffective work and leadership on the many parts of this bill, and for \ntheir commitment to the high priority of improving education for all \nstudents.\n  It has been a genuine bipartisan process. We have been able to reach \neffective agreement on these reforms, because the challenge is so \nimportant and the need is so significant.\n  We need to enact these reforms and implement them as soon as \npossible. The Nation's students, schools, teachers, principals, and \nsuperintendents cannot wait. The parents of the 48 million students in \nthe Nation's public schools cannot wait. And Congress shouldn't wait \neither.\n  Throughout our history, education has opened the doors of opportunity \nfor generations of Americans. It has been a long and continuing battle, \nand it still is.\n  The Nation's Founders understood this, when they urge public \neducation in the early days of the Republic.\n  As John Adams said so well,\n\n       The education of a nation instead of being confined to a \n     few schools and universities for the instruction of the few, \n     must become the national care and expense for the formation \n     of the many.\n\n  The women's movement understood this, as they fought to open the \ndoors of schools to girls as well as boys.\n  Civil rights leaders understood this, as they risked their lives to \nend segregated schools that were separate and unequal.\n  The bill before us today continues that great march of history, to \nfulfill the promise of a good education and greater opportunity to all \nchildren in America--whether they are black or white, from the cities \nor the suburbs or the rural areas, from the North to the South to the \nEast to the West.\n  This legislation is about the future of America. In this 21st \ncentury, we want an America that continues to be a beacon of freedom \nand progress for the world. And we want all Americans to have a chance \nto fulfill their greatest dreams and reach their fullest potential.\n  But to do so will require more than just the words of the legislation \nwe adopt today. It will require hard work and continued partnership \nbetween Federal, State, and local governments--and between schools, \ncommunities, and parents.\n  It will require constant effort and constant vigilance to see that \nall students receive the help they need.\n  And, it will require a commitment of more resources in the years \nahead, so that the Federal Government lives up to its part of the \nbargain.\n  I strongly support these reforms, but I am concerned that this \nconference and this Congress and this President have failed to support \nthe investments necessary if we are serious about truly leaving no \nchild behind.\n  Moving IDEA to the mandatory side of the budget would have been a \nvictory both for children with disabilities and for children without \ndisabilities.\n  Prior to the passage of the IDEA legislation in 1975, we had \napproximately one million disabled students who were being warehoused \nand receiving informal education, if any education at all.\n  All State constitutions guarantee education for all children--not \njust children who do not have disabilities.\n  In 1975 we passed IDEA, with the idea goal that the Federal \nGovernment would meet its responsibilities by offsetting 40 percent of \nthe cost for the education of children who qualified for IDEA.\n  Over the past 25 years, Congress failed to meet its responsibility of \n40 percent of funding IDEA. The Senate insisted on full funding. We \nintroduced an amendment that called for mandatory spending, which would \nhave required that we provide full funding of this important program.\n  The reason this was such a controversy during the time of our \nconference is that: One, it involves children; two, it involves \nchildren who are the most vulnerable, those having special needs; \nthree, it is a constitutional right; four, we committed ourselves to \nthe States and local communities that we were going to provide this \nhelp and assistance over a long period of time.\n  The principal argument against us was we should wait, that we are \ngoing to reform the IDEA system next year. As was pointed out in the \nnumerous debates on this issue, we are committed to these children. \nThey need our help now. Now is the time. We have heard enough excuses. \nWe should be meeting our responsibilities. Moving IDEA to the mandatory \nside of the budget would have been a victory both for children with \ndisabilities and for children without disabilities.\n  It would have guaranteed students with disabilities that they and \ntheir parents will not have to fight as hard as they do today to get \nthe education to which they are entitled. It would have freed up local \nresources to improve regular public school programs for all students.\n  Our very able and gifted leader on so many of the disability issues--\nTom Harkin, joined by Senator Hagel who has been strongly committed on \nthis issue for years in a bipartisan way--have reminded us that this \nfight will continue next year. I am absolutely convinced we will be \nsuccessful. Nonetheless, as we address these issues, we ought to \nunderstand that two-thirds of the children who actually qualify for \nIDEA also qualify for what we call the title I funding.\n  Only one third of the children are actually covered by the title I \nprogram today. With what has happened to our economy, there are more \nthan 660,000 additional students who will be eligible for title 1 \nfunds. With early requests in the budget this year, there is a 3.6-\npercent increase. We have been able to get that up to close to $4 \nbillion, which represents about a 20-percent increase, which under the \nwhole ESEA budget is just about where it has been for the last 5 years. \nThis is an important improvement, but it will still only reach one \nthird of the students. We are strongly committed to making sure the \nbenefits of this legislation are going to reach all of the children, \nand we are going to come back and make the battle and the fight for \nthis particular program.\n  Since I am talking about the budget, I will give just a very brief \noversight as to how the funds are distributed based on the money that \nhas been authorized and included in this legislation, and then actually \nthe money in appropriations that have also tracked our legislation.\n  The title I education program, is targeted towards the neediest \nchildren in this country. The formula has not only reached the needy, \nbut it has also been spread out until there is no question that it \nneeds more focus and more targeting to reach the neediest of the \nchildren. This has been one of President Bush's prime considerations \nand one of his prime objectives. It was his strong commitment in this \narea that allowed the opportunity to reach strong common ground. We \ngive him praise and credit for his leadership in this whole reform of \nthe title I program.\n\n  One of the major achievements of this legislation is that it \ndramatically\n\n[[Page S13324]]\n\nincreases Federal education funds for the neediest students. With this \nbill and the pending appropriations bill, we will be able to tell every \ncity in the country that they will see an increase of more than 30 \npercent in supplemental Title I education funding for disadvantaged \nchildren. There will be $11 million more for Boston, $80 million more \naid for Los Angeles in the next school year, and $140 million more for \nNew York City.\n  High poverty rural areas will see similar percentage increases in \nFederal education aid in the next school year. In Todd County, South \nDakota there is a 50-percent poverty rate, however we will see a 30-\npercent increase in the resources to reach those neediest children. In \nArizona, there is a 75-percent poverty rate, and we see an indication \nof increased support for the education of those children in that \nparticular county.\n  In the Meek Public Schools in Nebraska, where there is a 67-percent \nchild poverty rate, there is likewise an increase in resources.\n  So whether it has been in the urban areas with the increased poverty \nrate or it has been in the rural areas, what we have tried to do in \nthis bill is to get increased focus and attention in terms of \ninvestment in this program.\n  Money is not the answer to everything, but it is a pretty clear \nindication of the Nation's priorities. You cannot increase the quality \nof education with money alone, but you cannot do it with reform alone. \nThe key is to have reform, the resources, and the investment. That is \nwhat we are attempting to do with this legislation.\n  But Congress and the administration have to do more next year and the \nyear after. This battle will go on. This battle for resources will \ncontinue again and again and again, until we meet our obligations to \nfamilies, parents and students across the country.\n  One of the major goals of this conference report, is to lessen, over \nthe 12-year period, the educational achievement gap between the \ndisadvantaged students and their more affluent peers, between minority \nand non-minority students. There are wide gaps between these students \ntoday in the K-12. We are strongly committed to reducing and attempting \nto eliminate that disparity.\n  The bill begins to do that by ensuring that all States set \nperformance standards in reading and math and that they will set high \nstandards in science by the year 2005. These standards outline what \nstudents should know and be able to do in these subjects.\n  Each State will develop a strong curriculum that helps teachers \ntranslate those standards into day-to-day learning for their students. \nEach State, itself, makes the judgment and decision about what their \nchildren should know in what particular grade. Their educators, their \nprofessionals, their parents, their instructors, their principals, and \ntheir school boards get together and make the determination about what \nthe children should know in each particular grade in each of the \nparticular States. We give States the flexibility to do so.\n  We have stated--and we will restate--our objective, and that is to \nmake sure these tests are not punitive, they should be used to find out \nwhat a child knows. These accountability measures will help ensure that \nevery children receives a good education. But they won't work alone. \nAccountability is only the measure of the reform--it is not reform \nitself. We must provide the necessary support and resources to see that \nschools can achieve their goals.\n\n  We want to make sure that, across the country, the child who is doing \nreasonably well today will do even better, the child who is having \ndifficulty making it will find out they are able to deal with the \nchallenges they are facing in school, and the child who is not making \nit is going to get the help and the assistance they need in order to be \nable to reach proficiency. That is what we are going to do with our \nprogram.\n  States must also set annual goals for schools to raise student \nachievement. The States will each set their own goals based on how they \nare doing now. But all States must put themselves on a glidepath to see \nthat all children achieve proficiency in 12 years. We let the States \nmake the judgments and decisions about how that will progress.\n  Schools that do not meet the annual goals set by the State for 2 \nconsecutive years will be given extra resources and technical help to \nturn themselves around. Students in those schools will have the option \nto transfer to a high performing school. If the school does not meet \nits achievement goals for another year, it must offer the lowest-\nachieving children after-school tutoring services. If the school \ncontinues to fail to meet the goals after 6 years, it will be either \nrestructured as a charter school, taken over by the State or district, \nor reopened with new leadership and staff.\n  But at the end of 12 years, every child in America has to be able to \nreach the proficiency level. Twelve years is a long time, but this is a \ncomplex issue. I am always reminded of the great words of H.L. Mencken \nwhen he said: For every complex question, there is a simple, easy \nanswer, and it's wrong.\n  This is a complex challenge. We are not offering a simple answer. We \nare offering a responsible answer that has been based on the \nexperiences of recent years and our studies in the committees and the \nconference and taking the best judgment of those who have really \nthought about this over a long period of time. That is what we believe \nis represented in this legislation.\n  These accountability measures will ensure that every child receives a \ngood education. They will not work alone. Accountability is only the \nmeasure of reform, it is not reform itself. We must provide the \nnecessary support and resources to see that schools can achieve their \ngoals. This legislation includes the needed reforms that are the \nbuilding blocks of change to help the Nation's schools meet their \ngoals.\n  The objective of this legislation, is to provide a greater \nopportunity for all students to achieve high standards.\n  There is the extra help for mastering the basics. There is a very \nimportant dropout provision. My friend from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, has been so active in that area, as well as in many other \nareas. There will be more mental health services, more counselors \nhighly qualified teachers, more after-school tutoring.\n  In addition to better basic students, students will have greater \naccess to a variety of other courses to enhance education, including \nadvanced placement, foreign languages, civics education, economics, \nAmerican history, physical education, art education, character \neducation, and programs for gifted and talented students. The pathways \nto excellence--we have the advanced placement, foreign language, \nAmerican history, civics, economics, arts, physical education, the \ngifted and talented programs, as well as character education.\n  So the tools will be out there for these children to be able to take \nadvantage of this. The support systems will be out there to help and \nassist them, depending on what the particular needs are of the \nchildren.\n  We are setting high standards for children, we are setting high \nstandards for schools, and we are setting high standards for parents.\n  We ought to set high standards for the Congress to make sure we give \nthe resources so these programs will work, and we ought to set the \nstandards for the States to make sure they are going to meet their \nresponsibility. That is what we are able to do here with regard to the \nchildren, with regard to the schools, and with regard to the parents. \nThe rest of that puzzle is here in the Senate and in the statehouses \nacross the country. They are the ones that provide the principal \nresources for the children.\n  Reform of the schools is high standards and high expectations. We \nknow and we saw once again from the tragic circumstances of September \n11, Americans do their best when they are challenged. That was \ncertainly true of those at the time and place of the disaster in New \nYork and at the Pentagon and the field in Pennsylvania, the individuals \nwho performed with such extraordinary bravery and heroism, and how our \nservice men and women are performing today. Americans respond best to \nchallenges. That is the essence of this legislation, high standards and \nsupport.\n  In order to achieve high expectations, the bill includes reforms that \nwill strengthen teacher training and mentoring, with the strong \ncommitment that we are going to have highly qualified teachers in every \nclassroom.\n\n[[Page S13325]]\n\nWe have the option for moving toward smaller class size which has \ndemonstrated such success in a number of our States, such as Tennessee \nand Wisconsin. It expands support for early reading, so that all \nchildren read well by the end of the third grade.\n  Violence and drug prevention programs are even stronger, there are \nmore opportunities for parents to be involved in their children's \neducation greater parent involvement, and the new books for school \nlibraries. If we are going to develop effective reading programs, the \nnew school library program will have enormous success.\n  One of my real pleasures is reading with a child each week as part of \nthe Everyone Wins! Program, where a number of my colleagues also \nparticipate. I have seen the change that have taken place in the last 5 \nyears in books in those libraries. If you went there and started \nreading 4 or 5 years ago, you would have to search to find an age-\nappropriate book in order to be able to read to the child. Now that is \nchanging. We want to make sure this is going to change for schools and \nschool libraries across the country.\n  It improves bilingual education for students with limited proficiency \nin English.\n  It also strengthens after-school activities, to give extra \nopportunities to more students to improve their learning. Afterschool \nprograms which have demonstrated such success--I don't think in any of \nthe categorical programs in the last 2 years that the Federal \nGovernment has out that any of them have been as oversubscribed with \nquality applications as the afterschool programs. They work and are \nmaking a major difference. I recently visited an afterschool program in \nthe Boston area, which has partnered with the business community. They \nare teaching children graphics and art design, things that they would \nnever have seen in school.\n  This is an awakening, an interest in these children in some areas of \nlearning that they had never even thought of. It is transferring into \nenhanced grades. All of this is happening in boys clubs and girls clubs \nacross the country. It needs to be supported. And more classroom need \nto have access to technology.\n  Finally, we have the State and local school report cards for \nparents--the children, the schools, and now the parents. The student \nachievement for all students, children with disabilities, children with \nlimited English proficiency. We have seen the changing of the \ndemographics in our public school systems, minority children, and the \npoor children; graduation rates, professional qualification of \nteachers, the high poverty/low poverty schools, and the percent of the \nhighly qualified teachers, high poverty, low poverty.\n\n  Every parent is going to be able to receive a report card, not just \non their child, but also detailing the achievement of all children in a \nparticular school district or state. They will know how many qualified \nteachers they have. They will know also what is happening in these \nother areas of learning in their schools, what the graduation rates \nare. We are giving the greatest amount of information to parents so \nthat they will know what is happening in their school, what is \nhappening in the next school, what is happening around their schools; \nempowering the parents in ways they need and they want and they desire \nso that they can help make a difference in terms of the education of \ntheir children.\n  This has not been done, and it needs to be done. Thirteen States \nprovide no individual school profiles at all. Of the 37 States that do \nproduce school report cards, their quality and accessibility for \nparents vary widely. Here, we are setting a standard to provide uniform \ninformation to all parents in an understandable format.\n  That is really something that we intend to do.\n  I know there are others who want to speak early. I have taken about a \nhalf-hour of the Senate's time. I do want to say that I believe we have \nvery important legislation that is going to make a very important \ndifference in the lives of the children.\n  Before concluding, I will express some appreciation to some very \nimportant and special people who helped get us to where we are, and \nthen I will yield the floor. I see my friend from New Hampshire, \nSenator Gregg. I am enormously grateful to him.\n  First of all, I thank President Bush for his strong commitment in \nmaking this his No. 1 domestic agenda item. I have been here in recent \nyears where we have seen attempts to dismantle education programs and \nto cut back in terms of funding for education. I have seen attempts to \nrepeal the Department of Education. Thankfully, now we are beyond that \ndebate.\n  I have always believed that it would be useful to have someone at the \nPresident's elbow when they have those cabinet meetings talking about \nchildren and education. This President has indicated he wants to make \nreal education reform available for the neediest children. He deserves \ngreat credit for helping to give direction to this effort.\n  I, in particular, thank my colleague, Senator Gregg. We worked \nclosely together on this important legislation, particularly over the \nperiod of the past 5 months. We came at this issue from very different \ndirections. We both shared a very important commitment to try to get \nsomething done that would benefit children. We were each prepared to \nput aside some of our own reservations to come up with legislation. And \nI frankly believe that our final product, with what has been achieved, \nis better, quite better than the previous legislation passed by the \nHouse and the Senate earlier this summer.\n  I thank Senator Gregg for his strong involvement and participation.\n  I thank John Boehner, who was our chairman, and who was very \neffective in keeping us moving in a positive direction. He was very \ntalented and should receive very considerable credit for this \nachievement.\n  Also, I thank George Miller from the House, whose knowledge and \nlegislative skills and dedication helped make this conference report an \nexcellent piece of legislation. George is a legend in many ways. His \npassion is education. We saw that in this conference. Anyone who \nlistens to George speak on this subject knows his very strong \ncommitment and the knowledge and ability he holds in this area. We \nthank him.\n  I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Daschle, and Senator \nReid for their leadership and support throughout this process. Senator \nDaschle, from the earliest days of this effort on education, was \nstrongly committed to achieving results and good legislation. He was \ncommitted to getting something positive, something that was going to \nmake a difference for children. I don't need to remind this body of the \nnumber of times that Senator Daschle has addressed the conferees on \nthis education conference, urging us forward and working to try to make \nsure we would achieve great results. His help and assistance has been \nabsolutely invaluable and essential in getting us to where we are \ntoday. I am enormously grateful to him personally, and I commend his \nstrong commitment to education. I thank Senator Reid, as well, for his \ncontinued support and assistance.\n  I also want to mention Secretary Paige and Sandy Kress. Secretary \nPaige came to our committee as one of the first members of President \nBush's Cabinet. He had a strong record in Houston, under very \nchallenging circumstances, and demonstrated many of the principles the \nPresident illustrated. Sandy Kress was able to devote much of his time \nduring the early days in which this legislation was formed, and he \ncarried a great commitment to the President's positions. He is a very \neffective fighter for those positions and never gave up on any of them \nas we moved through, but always tried to find some way of moving this \nprocess toward a positive solution. I am grateful and thankful to both \nSecretary Paige and Mr. Kress.\n  I want to take a final moment to thank the staffs. It is important as \nwe enter the final passage of this legislation that they be included in \nthe managers' opening statements. Their role has been absolutely \nindispensable. Their satisfaction should be deep, continuing, and \nabiding. They are all skilled professionals. They will do many things \nin their lives, but I doubt they will ever do anything that will be \nmore important to children in this country than what they did over the \nperiod of this last summer. While others were away during the August \nRecess, staff were here working tirelessly\n\n[[Page S13326]]\n\nthroughout the summer on various provisions of this legislation. They \nwere in touch with all of us as discussions moved forward, and they are \nabsolute masters of the details of these provisions.\n  I think all of us are mindful of the words that ``the devil is in the \ndetails.'' This legislation is over 1,100 pages long, and our staffs \ncombed through the details and ensured that our objectives were met. \nThey have done it with a professional excellence, which is, I think, in \nthe highest order of this institution. It is what the American people \nexpect and what they deserve to have, and we have not let them down. So \nI thank all of them for their good work.\n  In particular, I thank Danica Petroshius, who is here on my staff; \nMichael Dannenberg, Roberto Rodriguez, Dana Fiordaliso, Ben Cope, \nConnie Garner, David Sutphen, Melody Barnes, Jim Manley, Helen Yuen, \nKaren DiGiovanni, and Menda Fife of my staff, who all worked long and \nhard together on a wide variety of issues in this legislation.\n  I also thank Sally Lovejoy and Paula Nowakowski of Congressman \nBoehner's staff; John Lawrence, Charles Barone, Alex Nock, and Denise \nForte of Congressman Miller's staff; Denzel McGuire, Townsend McNitt, \nand Stephanie Monroe of Senator Gregg's staff; Lloyd Horwich of Senator \nDodd's staff; Bev Schroeder of Senator Harkin's staff; Kimberly Ross of \nSenator Mikulski's staff; Sherry Kaiman, Michael Yudin, and Justin King \nof Senator Jeffords' staff; Carmel Martin of Senator Bingaman's staff; \nJill Morningstar of Senator Wellstone's staff; Bethany Little of \nSenator Murray's staff; Elyse Wasch of Senator Reed's staff; David \nSewell of Senator Edwards' staff; Ann O'Leary and Wendy Katz of Senator \nClinton's staff; Michele Stockwell of Senator Lieberman's staff; \nElizabeth Fay of Senator Bayh's staff, and Joan Huffer of Senator \nDaschle's staff.\n\n  I also thank Denis O'Donovan and Steve Chapman who served our \ncommittee so effectively and made sure that the conference ran \nsmoothly. I also thank the staff of the Congressional Research Service, \nWayne Riddle, Jim Stedman, Rick Apling, and Jeff Kuenzi. CRS provides \ninvaluable help to all of us. There are also many others who work hard \nand they don't get recognition, but they were absolutely invaluable.\n  I am sure there are others I should mention, and I will try to make \nsure I include them later in the day or tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his kind comments in his opening statement, with \nwhich I agree in part and disagree in part, but that is what makes this \nan exercise that is so worthwhile.\n  Let me pick up where Senator Kennedy has left off, which is thanking \nthose people who have done an extraordinary job with this exceptional \npiece of legislation, which will have a very significant, if not \ndramatic, impact on our Nation's future in education. There were a lot \nof people who played a huge role in making this a success, but I think \nno one within the Senate obviously played a bigger or more significant \nrole than Senator Kennedy. He was willing to step forward and work with \nthe President in order to accomplish completion of this bill.\n  When the President ran for office, he outlined a very clear and, I \nthought, compelling agenda on the issue of education. He was willing to \nstep onto this rather controversial field and take very specific \nstances and try to drive a policy that would dramatically improve \neducation for American children. This was his No. 1 domestic priority \nwhen he ran for President. He could not have been successful in \naccomplishing this if he had not had the bipartisan support he received \nin the Senate and in the House.\n  Here in the Senate it was led by Senator Kennedy, and he deserves \ntremendous praise for that. The Senator has, for over 30 years, had a \nwide swathe in the Senate and has a voice that gets listened to. He \nused his strengths to move this bill aggressively and effectively. He \nwas assisted by exceptional staff, and that may be the key to all of us \nhere.\n  I thank Danica Petroshius for her great work, and the other members \nof the Kennedy team. I hadn't realized how many he had until I listened \nto the names. Maybe that is why we felt overwhelmed at times. I also, \nobviously, want to thank Congressman Boehner, whose leadership within \nthe conference was critical. He was adroit in his ability to keep all \nthe parties at the table negotiating. It was a difficult task because \nof the different views brought to the table. He deserves great credit.\n  I thank Sally Lovejoy, his staff director. I also consider George \nMiller to be a bit of a legend--mostly on the basketball court, but as \na legislator also. It was a pleasure to have a chance to get \nreacquainted with Congressman Miller, whose opinions are always \nexpressed with great passion and tremendous effectiveness, and to work \nwith him in developing this bill. His fingerprints are significant in \nthis area.\n  I thank Charles Barone of his staff, who was another player of \nsignificant importance in this exercise.\n  The support we got from the Department of Education was exceptional, \nalso, as mentioned by Senator Kennedy. Secretary Paige interjected \nhimself at key points in the process. He was extraordinarily \nconstructive, and he has been a shepherd of this exercise. His people: \nBecky Campoverde, Christy Wolfe, Sandra Cook, Paul Riddle, Kay Rigling, \nTom Corwin, and Jack Kristy also played significant roles in getting us \non the right track. CRS was a tremendous help to us and the people at \nlegislative counsel who drafted this bill.\n  Obviously, I cannot discuss this bill without talking about some of \nthe other players in the Senate who were involved. Senator Kennedy \nmentioned some of the people on his side of the aisle. On our side of \nthe aisle, we had a working team within our committee that was very \nstrong and committed many hours on different issues. Almost everybody \nhad a role to play.\n  I especially thank Senator Frist for his role with respect to \nStraight A's and flexibility, and his staff person, Andrea Becker. \nSenator Tim Hutchinson was critical in a number of areas--bilingual \nreform being one critical area--and Holly Kuzmich of his staff played a \nmajor role. Senator Enzi played a role everywhere. Amanda Farris of his \nstaff was helpful especially on technology issues. Susan Collins of \nMaine, a real force for quality education in the Senate, and her staff \nperson, Jordan Cross, was very important to the positive completion of \nthis effort.\n  Senator Kennedy did mention Sandy Kress and Margaret Lamontange at \nthe White House. We had staff who did an exceptional job--especially \nSandy Kress and Margaret Lamontange--back and forth bridging the \ndifference. We had one staff person who went from my staff to the White \nHouse at a critical point, stayed at the White House for a critical \nperiod, then came back to my staff at a critical point, and then had a \nbaby. She did all this while doing a great job helping to produce this \nbill. That was Townsend McNitt who played a very significant role in \nthe success of this bill, along with my other staff: Stephanie Monroe, \nBecky Liston, Kathy McGarvey, and, of course, Denzel McGuire, who was \nthe right arm in this exercise, as far as I am concerned, and did an \nexceptional job and is to be credited for much of what was done right \nin this bill.\n  The bill itself, as has been mentioned, is fairly complex legislation \nwith a lot of moving parts, and therefore, it did take a long time to \ncomplete. As we move through this debate over the next few days, I hope \nto go into more specifics.\n  The themes of this bill are essential to understanding the outcome of \nthis bill. The reason we were successful is we all basically had the \nsame fundamental goal. All the major players who came to the table to \ntry to develop this legislation understood, No. 1, that the laws which \nwe placed on the books 35 years ago to help low-income kids were very \nwell-intentioned, but they had not worked. We have spent $130 billion \nover that period of time, and yet we see that our low-income children \nare falling behind and have stayed behind their peers at almost every \ngrade level.\n  In fact, the average child who comes from a low-income family and is \nin the\n\n[[Page S13327]]\n\nfourth grade reads two grade levels below his or her peers. This has \nnot changed over that 35 years. There has been no significant \nimprovement as we have tried to address the issue in a variety of \nreauthorization efforts.\n  There was a genuine desire--and it cut across party lines, cut across \nphilosophical views, cut across geographic areas--and commitment to do \nsomething about giving the low-income child a better shot at education \nbecause we all understand that the American dream and the capacity to \npursue the American dream is dependent upon education.\n  The engine of the American dream is the public school system. \nRegrettably, for the low-income child, that public school system is not \nfiring on all cylinders. We know that, and we are going to try to fix \nit, or at least put in place laws which will help us fix it.\n  Equally important as the fact the low-income child was being left \nbehind, the failure to educate generation after generation of low-\nincome children, especially children from minority backgrounds, was \ndividing our country. We were balkanizing ourselves based on education \nand the failure of certain segments of our population, certain large \ncultural segments of our population, to be economically successful or \nsocially successful, and who were finding themselves isolated within \nour culture.\n\n  That is not constructive to a nation. We have seen nations balkanize. \nWe cannot afford that in the United States. John Adams was absolutely \nright; the key to avoiding that is having an educated public. He saw it \nwhen he founded our Nation, and we need to see it today as we move \nforward as a nation.\n  As we become larger and larger and more diverse, we must transcend \nour diversity in a positive way through educating people and making \nsure everyone has an equal shot at the American opportunity through \nquality education.\n  The goal to obtain quality education for low-income kids cuts across \nall the different groups participating in this bill. That is why we \nwere able to overcome our differences as we moved through some very \ncomplex and critical parts of the debate.\n  There has been some discussion--and I alluded to not agreeing with my \ncolleague on some of his opening statement--there has been some \ndiscussion on the issue of IDEA. This is another area that needs \nsignificant attention. But the bill we are dealing with today deals \nwith the low-income child and the title I program, which is the most \nsignificant Federal program in the area of elementary and secondary \nschool education.\n  IDEA and special education is a separate issue and should be dealt \nwith as a separate issue because the IDEA issues are equally complex, \nmaybe narrower, maybe not as many, but certainly equally as complex and \nintensely felt as the title I issues--in fact, more intensely felt in \nmany instances. To merge the two and try to solve both of those issues \nat the same time would have been a mistake.\n  We have put off the IDEA funding issue and the other major questions \ndealing with IDEA such as overidentification, especially of minority \ngroups, issues involving discipline, issues involving excessive \nattorneys fees, issues involving excessive bureaucracy being forced on \nthe school systems, issues involving whether or not a special education \nchild has a right to move out of a public school and into a private \nschool and the payment for those activities. All those programmatic \nissues which are very intricate and very difficult to address should be \nbrought up in the context of a full IDEA reform and reauthorization \nwhich will occur next year.\n  As part of that, we should address the mandatory issue, which I am \nperfectly willing to do. In fact, I believe we have made huge steps \nforward in the area of funding IDEA. In fact, over the last 5 years, \nbecause it was made a No. 1 priority of a group of Members on this side \nof the aisle when we were controlling the Senate, we have increased \nfunding for IDEA by 173 percent. That is the most significant increase \nin funding that any element of the Federal Government has gotten, \nincluding NIH, which we made a commitment to double over this same \nperiod.\n  IDEA funding has gone up dramatically. We are still not at the full \nfunding level, which is 40 percent of the cost of IDEA, but we went \nfrom the 6-percent level, which is what it was when other Senators and \nI began the initiative to get to full funding, to almost 20 percent \nfunding of IDEA.\n  President Bush has continued that commitment. In fact, he sent up the \nsingle largest increase ever proposed by a President in the IDEA \naccounts this year. Over $1 billion will be put into the IDEA accounts, \nwe presume, once the Labor and HHS appropriations bill is completed as \na result and in part of the President's commitment.\n  The commitment to funding IDEA is there, it is aggressive, and it is \na stronger commitment than any other element of the Federal Government. \nAs a result, I think people who are concerned about special education \nfunding cannot say they are being left behind. Not only are they not \nbeing left behind, they are out in front of the crowd when it comes to \nfunding. The question is how much further will they be out in the front \nof the crowd and how do we handle the mandatory issue versus \ndiscretionary accounts, which is more of an issue of inside baseball \nwith appropriators and how they deal with that issue than it is whether \nIDEA is going to be funded.\n  There are a lot of attempts in this bill to significantly change the \nfocus of how we proceed relative to low-income children. If we want to \ngeneralize about them, we can say there are four different areas. The \nfirst is we are going to take the programs which presently exist and \ntry to make them more child--say, try to take them away from being \nbureaucracy centered and school centered to being more focused on how \nthat child is doing and whether that child is succeeding and whether \nthat child is keeping up with his or her peers.\n  Secondly, we are going to empower parents to assist their children \nwhen they have a child who is in a failing school and who is being left \nbehind and is from a low-income background. We have given them a whole \npanoply of new tools to do that, including much more information, as \nwas pointed out by the Senator from Massachusetts, and a lot of tools \nthat allow them to take action which affects their child's education, \nsomething parents cannot do today.\n  In most instances when talking to parents of a low-income child, it \nis not parents but parent. They usually come from single-parent \nfamilies. That is unfortunate, but that single parent is usually \nstruggling to make ends meet and really does need to have some options \navailable to her--usually it is a ``her''--when she is trying to \naddress the education failures of the school her child attends. So that \nis the second part. First, child center; second, empowering parents.\n  Third, we give more flexibility to local school districts and to \nStates. I believe very strongly--and I think everybody at the table \nended up with this approach--that the local school district should have \nthe ability to move their dollars around to accomplish this goal of \nbetter education for low-income kids.\n  In exchange for that flexibility, we are expecting the fourth item, \nwhich is accountability, and specifically accountability that reflects \nthere has been academic achievement. Academic achievement is the end \nresult we seek.\n  We are going to say to the local school districts they can have these \ndollars and they can have them with very few strings attached both in \nthe area of their teacher accounts and in the area--if they decide to \nbe a Straight A's school district, in the area of their school \naccounts. When they get these dollars, we are going to expect results, \nresults that are defined by the school district. This is very important \nto remember. We do not say there will be a national standard to which \nthey teach. In fact, we say just the opposite: There shall be no \nnational curriculum. We say to the local school districts they decide \nhow much their children in the fourth grade should know; for example, \nhow much math they should know and how proficient they should be in \nEnglish, and when they make that decision, then it is that standard \nwhich they set which we expect them to meet for their children.\n  We have a process of tests which basically requires them to test \nthese kids to see if they are meeting that standard and then tell their \nparents if they\n\n[[Page S13328]]\n\nare meeting that standard. One of the most important parts about this \ntesting proposal is the scores are disaggregated. No more burying the \nchild who maybe does not make it in a group of people who do not make \nit covered by a group of people who do make it. These are disaggregated \nnumbers so we will know if a low income child from a school system is \nnot making it. We will know if a child from a certain minority group is \nnot making it. That is important. That is new information, a new \napproach.\n  In addition, we adjust and change a large number of programs which \nreally were not working all that well. For example, bilingual \neducation, the second largest account under title I under the ESEA. Yet \nwe know what happened to bilingual education. It got off track. Instead \nof kids learning English, we ended up isolating kids, took them on a \ntrain track that took them to their language and left them there, put \nthem in schools and classrooms where they basically were being taught \nin their language and they were not being allowed to learn English \nessentially, or they were not being asked to learn English.\n\n  That is wrong, and it is not fair. They cannot compete in the \nAmerican society, in the American culture, unless they speak English. \nWe are an English-speaking culture. It is great that people come to \nthis country from all around the world and they speak other languages. \nThat is one of the great strengths of our great melting pot. But the \nconsistent thing is, amongst our culture, we speak English as a \nsociety. So retaining one's language, yes, that is essential, but they \ncome through as a result of their ethnic cultural background, and they \nneed to learn English.\n  Our school system should not isolate kids and not allow them to learn \nEnglish. So we change the bilingual program so now the stress in \nbilingual education is going to be teaching kids to learn English so \nthat they can compete in our world, compete in America, and have a shot \nat the American opportunity.\n  There are a lot of other major initiatives in this bill that I want \nto go into as we move down the road, but my time is about up. I want to \nspend some time, for example, discussing--I will highlight it now--some \nof the new tools we give parents, especially what are known as \nsupplemental services, because I do think this is a breakthrough \napproach.\n  What we are basically going to say to a parent if their child is in a \nfailing school and that school has failed 3 years--by the way, on the \neffective date of this bill there will be 3,000 schools which will, \nunfortunately, fall into that category, and therefore this program will \nbe available immediately to those poor parents.\n  We are going to say to that parent they can take their low-income \nchild to afterschool programs, or maybe to a school structured so it is \nduring school hours and they will get tutorial support. Those \nafterschool programs are not all public school driven. They can be. \nThey can be private school driven. They can be at a parochial school. \nThey could be at a private enterprise that does tutorial activities or \nthey could be in the structure of the public school system if the \npublic school system decides to set up a tutorial activity.\n  We are essentially going to say to that parent, we will give them the \nmoney they need to cover, in most instances, all the costs of that \ntutorial activity. Depending on what town they are from, what city they \nare from, the costs will be on a sliding scale, but it will be a \nsignificant amount of dollars, somewhere between $500 and $1,000, which \ncan buy a lot of tutorial support.\n  So that is a big incentive. First, it is a big plus with a parent, \nwhose child has maybe fallen behind in math or fallen behind in \nEnglish, to take their child and get tutorial support. It is an equally \nbig incentive for the school systems to get their house in order--very \nimportant.\n  There is another program I also want to spend some time talking \nabout, but I suspect the Senator who is in the chair is going to spend \nsome time talking about it, and that is the charter school system which \nwas authored by the Senator in the chair. We dramatically expanded it. \nThat, again, is another new tool we are going to be giving parents as \nan option in order to help their kids who are in a failing school. The \nSenator from Delaware deserves great credit for having authored that \nproposal.\n  In addition, I hope we have more time to talk about public school \nchoice, which is another really exciting tool we are putting in place. \nPublic school choice already exists but not with the emphasis we are \nputting in this bill and not with the transportation costs. In other \nwords, a lot of parents in an inner city, for example, cannot send \ntheir kids to another public school, even if the school is failing and \nthey know another public school is across town that is not because they \nsimply cannot get them there. This bill allows the costs of moving that \nchild from the school that has failed to the school that is not failing \nto be paid for as part of the effort.\n  So, in addition, there are protections for school prayer, for the Boy \nScouts of America, for military recruiters, protections relative to \ndiscipline records, a whole series of initiatives that are very \nimportant in maintaining the integrity of our school system. I will go \ninto those hopefully in more depth as we move on through this debate, \nbut at this point I understand we are going to sort of go back and \nforth. I understand the Senator from Massachusetts has speakers until \nabout 2:30 and then we have speakers from 2:30 to 3.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy very much for \nyielding. I also thank him for his leadership on this very important \nlegislation. I have admired his work in the Senate since I have been in \nthe Senate. There is no legislation, that I am aware of, however, that \nhas passed under his jurisdiction and with his leadership that is more \nimportant than this education bill--the Leave No Child Left Behind Act \nof 2001.\n  I also would like to thank Senator Gregg. I think he has worked long \nand hard on this set of issues and also deserves great credit for this \nfinal product.\n  Congressman Miller and Congressman Boehner in the House both deserve \ntremendous credit, as do many of the Members in the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  Of course, I thank the staff of all concerned for the wonderful work \nthey have done, particularly my own staff member Carmel Martin who has \nbeen mentioned by Senator Kennedy. She has been an integral part of all \nthe negotiations related to this legislation and has done a wonderful \njob advocating for the proposals and initiatives that I believe are \nmost important. I'm pleased to say that all of those proposals are in \nthe final bill.\n  Before I get into positive aspects of the conference report, let me \nsay a few things about the disagreement we had at the end of the \nconference related to IDEA funding and specifically, the Harkin-Hagel \namendment regarding IDEA funding. My State of New Mexico has the \nhighest child poverty rate among the entire 50 States. We rank 11th in \nterms of the school age population growth during the last decade; about \n16 percent of our student population is served by special education, \nwhich is also one of the highest in the Nation. Providing a \ncomprehensive, responsive system of education and social supports is \nextremely important in my State and for the entire Nation.\n  That goal will not be possible in coming years unless we at the \nFederal level step up to the responsibility we committed to many years \nago, and that is to provide 40 percent of the cost of IDEA services. \nThat is not an unreasonable or excessive commitment by the Federal \nGovernment, but it is something we have never achieved. We have never \nachieved the promise we made to the citizens of this country when IDEA \nwas first passed, but it is time we did that.\n  I congratulate Senator Harkin for his hard work to get that done, \nalong with Senator Kennedy. I believe this is an issue that will be \nrevisited next year when we reauthorize IDEA. I will strongly support \nthe full funding provision then, as I did this time.\n  Let me say a few things about the positive aspects of the legislation \ncurrently before the Senate. This is a milestone, as I see it. I \nrecall, and the\n\n[[Page S13329]]\n\nSenator referred to, the earlier debates about eliminating the \nDepartment of Education. I recall those debates were raging in the \nSenate when I came in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, they persisted \nwell into the 1990s.\n\n  However, we have reached a major milestone. We have turned a corner. \nWe have developed a bipartisan consensus that education needs to be a \nnational priority, and not just a State priority or a local priority. \nWe also have developed a bipartisan consensus that the Federal \nGovernment needs to accept substantial responsibility for improving the \nquality of education, and not just leave that to the States or leave \nthat to local school districts.\n  I see that as great progress. It is incorporated in this legislation, \nand that is why I believe this legislation is so significant. I am \nproud to support the bill. I believe it does contain provisions that \ncan bring revolutionary change to our education system. They do not \nautomatically bring that revolutionary change to our educational \nsystem, but they put in place a framework which, if we follow through, \ncan dramatically improve our education.\n  The most important of these provisions, as I see it, are related to \naccountability for student performance. They relate to the challenge of \nensuring that students actually make progress.\n  In 1999, Congressman Miller introduced legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives to create an accountability system for student \nperformance with the focus on closing the achievement gaps between \ndisadvantaged student groups and nondisadvantaged groups of students. \nThat same year, I introduced companion legislation in the Senate. In \nboth of those bills, we required new accountability for the quality of \nthe instruction by mandating that teachers be qualified in the subjects \nthey are assigned to teach and requiring public reporting related to \nstudent performance and teacher qualification. Our legislation also \nrequired that schools demonstrate progress in improving student \nachievement and closing achievement gaps.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, over nearly a year ago, we \nreintroduced our respective bills and we were grateful to receive \nbipartisan support for our proposals. Senator Lugar joined me in \nlegislation we introduced in the Senate, and in the House Congressman \nBoehner became very involved in this effort. Perhaps most \nsignificantly, President Bush became very involved in this effort, as \nhe indicated he would during his campaign. I congratulate the President \nfor the success he has had and the contribution he has made to this \nimportant legislation. I also want to thank him and the other Members \nfor their great work on this bill.\n  For the first time, I believe States and local school districts and \nindividual schools will be held accountable for improving academic \nachievement for all students, not just a few students. This bill \nensures that Federal funds are tied to those gains in student \nperformance. Most importantly, it ties these funds to eliminating \nachievement gaps.\n  The components of the accountability system are worth mentioning. Let \nme mention some of them.\n  First, raising standards for all students, providing an objective \nmeasure for progress.\n  Second, focusing on the progress of disadvantaged students by setting \nseparate goals for their achievements so that schools must show gains \nfor those groups or be labeled as failing to make adequate progress.\n  Third, the bill calls for identifying schools that are failing to \nmeet these goals in a timely manner so they can get additional funding, \nso they can get additional support. If they still cannot show \nimprovement after that funding and support is provided for a period of \nyears, then it provides some strict consequences for the chronic \nfailure to adequately serve those students.\n  Next, the bill calls for working to ensure that every class has a \nqualified teacher and that low-income and minority students are not \ntaught by unqualified teachers at a higher rate than are other students \nin our school systems.\n  Finally, the bill provides an expanded role for parents.\n  As described by Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg, this empowers \nparents and gives them a report card that parents can take to \nunderstand precisely the quality of the education their child is \nreceiving.\n  Although we need to do more for IDEA funding and on the \nappropriations front--and that debate will continue next year--the \nconference report does include increased authorization levels for key \nprograms. In addition to the set-aside for accountability and turning \naround struggling schools, the bill guarantees that States receive at \nleast $3 million each to help develop required assessments. It \nauthorizes $490 million nationally for this purpose. The bill sets out \nauthorization levels for title I that lead to full funding for that \nprogram.\n  The bill also authorizes resources to help create 21st century \nschools by authorizing the use of Federal funds for school renovation, \nproviding $650 million to improve school safety, providing $1.25 \nbillion for afterschool programs, and $2 billion to integrate \ntechnology into the classroom.\n  I should also note that the technology program in current law, which \nI helped to author, has been improved by making teacher training in \ntechnology a priority for the $1 billion provided to school districts \nnationally. The conference report also authorizes a separate teacher \ntraining in technology program for Schools of Education so new teachers \nwill graduate with the skills they need to use technology to improve \nstudent performance. These measures will ensure that teachers will know \nhow to effectively use technology in their classroom instruction.\n  There are several provisions in here that I want to highlight that \nrelate to improving high schools. Most of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act has historically focused on elementary schools, and that \nis appropriate. But we have some provisions in this final bill that \nrelate to high schools and to improving the quality of teaching at the \nmiddle school and the high school level. One of those is the advanced \nplacement program.\n  This bill includes a new measure supporting advanced placement \nprograms. I sponsored this measure with Senators Hutchison and Collins \nand I thank them for their support. It provides high school students \nwith challenging academic content in advanced placement courses. They \nraise the bar for academic standards and allow students to earn \nvaluable college credits.\n  Last year there were about 1.5 million students who took advanced \nplacement courses in this country. Unfortunately, that does not \nrepresent nearly the number of students it should. Only 54 percent of \nthe Nation's high schools currently offer advanced placement courses. \nThe rest do not. There is much more that can be done here.\n  The purpose of the advanced placement measures included in this bill \nis to build on the existing Advanced Placement Incentive Pilot Program \nto provide grants to States and districts seeking to raise academic \nstandards through advanced placement programs. This is an extremely \nimportant initiative.\n  In my State, we have one school district--the Hobbs Municipal \nSchools--that has made tremendous progress by emphasizing the advanced \nplacement instruction and the pre-advanced placement instruction in \ntheir middle schools and high schools. This is something that I believe \nall students throughout the country could benefit from very \nsubstantially.\n  Another program contained in this bill that is a major benefit for \nhigh school students in particular and middle school students is the \ndropout prevention initiative.\n  When the Governors met with former President Bush in Charlottesville \nat the National Education Summit many years ago, one of the national \ngoals identified for the country was that we would have at least 90 \npercent of all of our students completing high school and getting a \ngraduation certificate before they left high school. That was the goal \nset. Unfortunately, we have done very little to achieve that goal in \nthe 12 years since it was identified.\n  This legislation, for the first time, makes dropout prevention a \nnational priority. That is extremely important in my State. We have the \nunfortunate circumstance that a disproportionately greater number of \nminority and low-income students wind up leaving school before they \ngraduate. There are over 3,000 students who drop out of school\n\n[[Page S13330]]\n\neach day in this country. Hispanic youth are nearly three times more \nlikely to drop out than non-Hispanic students in our classrooms. The \ndisparity is equally great for Native American students. The Dropout \nPrevention Program provided here commits Federal funds and grants to \nlocal schools and school districts to help them deal with this very \nimportant issue.\n  Senator Reid of Nevada cosponsored this legislation with me and \ndeserves great credit for his longstanding support of the effort we \nmade to get attention to this dropout problem. I am very pleased that \nis included in the bill.\n  One other provision I want to highlight that I believe is very \nimportant is the Smaller Learning Communities Program.\n  I am persuaded--and I believe the evidence clearly demonstrates--that \nwhen larger school buildings are divided up into smaller learning \ncommunities, the student achievement levels rise, the dropout rates \ndecline. There is greater security, less violence, and less \nabsenteeism. This is an extremely important initiative. Again, this is \nsomething that I think is a very positive provision in this \nlegislation.\n\n  Let me highlight a few programs that have great significance in my \nhome State of New Mexico.\n  The bill authorizes the program related to tribally controlled \nschools and Indian education. One in four of all tribally controlled \nschools is in my State of New Mexico. We also have many Native American \nstudents in our public schools. We worked closely with our colleagues \non the Indian Affairs Committee to improve the existing legislation \ngoverning these programs.\n  In addition, the bill revamps and expands a program providing funds \nto districts with a large Federal presence, or impact aid districts. \nThese districts have smaller, and in some cases have no local tax base \nbecause of the existence of Federal land or Indian land within that \nschool district. Under this bill, the existing construction program for \nthese districts is expanded so that more districts can qualify for \nFederal assistance for facility renovation and modernization.\n  There are other very important initiatives in this bill. We \nsubstantially expand the program that assists students with limited-\nEnglish-proficiency. That is a very important program for my State, \nwhere over 20 percent of our total student population are English \nLanguage Learners.\n  The report also includes a program for small and rural districts. In \nmy state 88 percent of the districts are rural and 45 percent serve \nfewer than 1,000 students. The rural program in the conference report \nwill ensure that these districts can effectively use their federal \nresources.\n  I know there are others waiting to speak. Let me conclude by again \nthanking Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for their leadership, and \ntheir staff, and Danica Petroshius, in particular, for all of her work \nwith us; again, my own staff member, Carmel Martin, who worked so hard \non the legislation.\n  I see this as a very major step forward. I look forward to following \nthrough. As I said, none of this is self-implementing. This is \nauthorizing legislation. We will need to come back each year for the \nnext 6 years during the time this bill is in effect and see to it that \nadequate resources are provided so that these programs can be \nadequately funded and so that States will not be able to legitimately \nsay that it is wrong to hold them accountable if we do not provide them \nwith assistance. I think we can and should do that. We must follow \nthrough so we can do something here that will make a major difference \nfor future generations in this country.\n  I am very pleased to support the legislation. I urge my colleagues to \ngive it a positive vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. He \nmentioned the whole issue of the Governors' meeting in Charlottesville. \nSenator Bingaman, I think, more than anyone else from that meeting up \nuntil this legislation, has followed the issue of accountability in the \ndevelopment of education and education standards. The issue on dropouts \nthat he mentioned has been included in here. Advanced placement, \nsmaller learning communities, education technology--this legislation \nreflects a great deal of what the Senator has been interested in and \nhas spoken to. I thank him not only because of all of that, but he has \nmade an indelible mark on this legislation. I am grateful to him.\n  I see the Senator from Indiana who, again, on the issue of \naccountability, has been enormously schooled in this subject. When he \narrived here in the Senate and started speaking about education, I took \nthe chance to look back over Indiana and found that this was his No. 1 \none priority as Governor. He arrived here with a very keen insight into \nways we could be more effective in trying to benefit children in \nlearning. Although not a member of the committee, he has been very much \ninvolved with this legislation. We always benefit from his comments and \ninsights. I am delighted to see him in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy, for \nthose very gracious remarks. I am pleased to have his strong support of \nthe conference report on H.R. 1, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n  I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues who brought us \nto this moment today, starting with Senator Kennedy. From the very \nbeginning, Senator Kennedy has been results-oriented in trying to \nstrike the right balance between principle and practicality and has \ngiven clear evidence in this debate about why he is considered to be \none of the most accomplished legislators of our time.\n  Senator Kennedy understands that the art of legislating is not the \nsame as being in a political science classroom. It is not the same as \nhaving an ideological debate. The end of the debate is what matters in \nwhat we can do and what we can actually accomplish to help people of \nour country--in this case, the schoolchildren of America. I thank him \nfor his leadership and for his dedication and perseverance.\n  Also, I thank my colleague, Senator Gregg. Senator Gregg is a former \nGovernor. He has labored in these vineyards for many years. I thank him \nfor his very able leadership throughout this process. We wouldn't be \nhere today without him.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to the President, who was good \nenough to call some of us down to White House, even before he was sworn \nin, to offer his commitment. He very clearly wanted to make this \nlegislation his top priority. He wanted to work on this in a bipartisan \nfashion. He wanted to have accountability and some of the other \nlandmark accomplishments that are included in this legislation. I thank \nhim for his leadership.\n\n  Also, I thank Sandy Kress, the President's chief liaison on this \nissue. I think the Presiding Officer is aware that Sandy is not only \nvery schooled in the subtleties and the complexity of education policy, \nbut he is also a card-carrying member, and in fact dues-paying member, \nof the Democratic Leadership Council. I believe this may be the very \ndefinition of bipartisanship when it comes to the education debate. I \nthank Sandy for his leadership.\n  Our colleague, Joe Lieberman, will be in this Chamber before long. I \nthank Joe for his courage and persistence. We would not be here today \nwithout his perseverance and dedication to these issues. He is a true \nleader, a true statesman. I want to acknowledge today his indispensable \ncontributions to this conference report.\n  I thank the staff. I thank Elizabeth Fay of my own staff, who has \nworked tirelessly, sometimes late into the night and early in the \nmorning. She has been my strong right arm. I am grateful to her.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy's assistant, Danica Petroshius, Michele \nStockwell of Senator Lieberman's staff, Denzel McGuire of Senator \nGregg's staff, Charles Barone of Representative Miller's staff, Alex \nNock of Representative Kildee's staff, Sally Lovejoy of Representative \nBoehner's staff, Kathleen Strottman of Senator Landrieu's staff, and \nall the rest of the staff on both sides of the aisle in the legislative \nbranch and at the White House. They make it possible for us to do our \njobs. I want to say how grateful we are to each and every one of them. \nI also want to thank Will Marshall and Andy Rotherham of the \nProgressive Policy\n\n[[Page S13331]]\n\nInstitute and Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust for their advice and \nsupport.\n  Last, but by no means least, I thank the majority leader, Senator \nDaschle, who has scheduled this debate and action on this bill. We are \ngrateful to him for his leadership and for his statesmanship. I want to \nacknowledge the fact that, with Senator Kennedy's agreement, he placed \nSenator Lieberman and myself on the conference committee. This was a \nnew development. I thank him for his confidence. I hope we have \ndemonstrated his confidence in us was well placed. As a matter of fact, \nI was joking with Senator Kennedy at one point in the debate--only one \npoint--it seemed as if those of us who were not regular members of the \ncommittee were even more supportive of the chair than regular members \nof the committee. So this is perhaps a small precedent of some kind.\n  In any event, for Senator Kennedy's willingness, and Senator \nDaschle's willingness, to put confidence in me, I am very grateful. I \nhope I discharged my responsibilities well, serving on the conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, this is another step in America's long journey toward \nmaking education a national priority for our country. The journey began \nin the mid to late 1800s with the common school movement when Horace \nMann, and many others, reached a determination in this country that a \ngood education should not be the province of the elite, the well to do, \nthe wealthy alone, that the consequences of ignorance went way beyond \nthe well-being of a single individual and, instead, affected all of us \nas a community and as a country.\n  Nearly 100 years later, in the 1960s, in the war on poverty, we \nrealized that the dream of a good education for too many poor children \nwas, instead, merely a cruel illusion and that we should reach out to \nthose communities and those families without means to make sure they \ncould realize the dream of a good education. Not only so they could \nrealize their full potential as individuals, but equally important, so \nthat our country could recognize our full potential as a great society. \nSo the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was born.\n\n  Today we gather to recognize that the status quo is no longer good \nenough. Too many children, particularly poor children, are still at \nrisk of falling behind, and that the failure is not theirs but ours and \nthat of the system which for too long we have been unwilling to \nfundamentally change.\n  Today we gather in this Chamber to make progress toward correcting \nthat cruel inequity. The progress we mark today is a victory of \nbipartisanship and good public policy. Both sides in this debate have \nbeen required to put aside long-entrenched ideological positions. There \nwere too many on the one side who believed that the only thing wrong \nwith our public education system was the need for more dollars. And \nthere were too many on the other side who believed that improving the \npublic education system was beyond all hope and that, instead, it \nshould be abandoned in favor of private school vouchers.\n  Instead, we have forged a new way, a third way, a better way, that \nwill insist upon change, results, and accountability in our public \nschool system.\n  There are consequences if results do not occur. There is \naccountability for all of us to improve the system and give the \nchildren the education they so desperately deserve. The consequences of \ninaction are great today. The consequences for ignorance and a lack of \naccountability have never been greater. Our country's economic well-\nbeing depends upon the quality of the education our children are \nreceiving in classrooms across America today.\n  In a global-knowledge-based economy, our economic progress, our \nstandard of living, and our competitiveness will be determined by the \nquality of our children's education. High skills will demand high \nwages. The days of not knowing very much but commanding high wages and \na good standard of living are rapidly receding. Our economic well-being \ndepends upon our success in this arena.\n  Likewise, there are profound social consequences to our level of \nsuccess in this regard. The gulf today between haves and have-nots in \nAmerica is primarily an education gap, a skills gap, a knowledge gap. \nIf we want to avoid the consequences of a large and growing, persistent \nunderclass in our country for the first time in America's history, it \nwill be by winning the battle to improve the quality of education that \nthose who are less fortunate in our society receive.\n  The very vibrancy of our democracy is, in many important ways, \ndependent upon our success in this regard because an informed citizenry \nand participation by our citizens require more knowledge and learning \nthan ever before.\n  It was Thomas Jefferson, one of the Founders of our Republic--one of \nthe founders of the Democratic Party--who once said: A society that \nexpects to be both ignorant and free is expecting something that never \nhas been and never will be. Jefferson and the other Founders of our \nNation understood the clear, indisputable link between knowledge, \ncitizenship, and democracy. It is that challenge that we rise today to \nmeet as well.\n  The bill we are advocating in this conference report embodies within \nit major changes in education policy for the schools of America, \nchanges for the better. It embodies high academic standards for all \nstudents. No longer will we tolerate the two-track system which \nembodied within it what the President referred to as the ``soft bigotry \nof low expectations,'' trapping too many poor children in ghettos of \nignorance and, therefore, ghettos of poverty.\n\n  Today we will reemphasize the fact that every child can learn and \nthat every child should be given that opportunity, that expectations \nmatter, and that we should expect the very best from all of our \nstudents, not just those who have been born to greater privilege than \nsome in our country.\n  This legislation embodies meaningful assessments to evaluate progress \neach and every year. There are clear definitions of how much progress \nwe will consider to be good enough, with the goal of 100 percent \nproficiency within 12 years. And there is a focus on subgroups so we \nensure that no group of America's children--the economically \ndisadvantaged, the disabled, those who do not speak English as a first \nlanguage, those who come from racial or ethnic minorities--that those \nchildren's futures will not be left behind, and their lack of adequate \nprogress will not be masked by the progress of the majority of our \nschoolchildren, because these schoolchildren from these subgroups are \nas near and dear to the heart and future of our country as any others. \nThey must not, and shall not, be left behind in this legislation.\n  The bottom line is that every school, every district, every State, \nand each and every one of us, will be held responsible for the progress \nby our children each and every year.\n  This legislation strikes the right balance between Federal and State \nresponsibilities, making this clearly a national priority, because the \nprogress of education will have national consequences for years to come \nfor every American, but still recognizing that State and local \nofficials and governments must take the lead in devising ways to \nimplement this vision because they are ultimately closest to the \nschools with accountability to citizens at the local level.\n  This legislation contains a strong commitment to teacher quality with \n$3 billion to recruit and train good teachers. This is vitally \nimportant because, after parental involvement, the most accurate \npredictor of a good education for a child is the presence of a quality, \nmotivated teacher in that classroom. Nothing is more important, besides \nparental involvement, to the future of educational progress.\n  This legislation contains within it a robust commitment to parental \nchoice and the inclusion of market forces within our public education \nsystem, while still retaining the genius of a public education, which \nis the implicit guarantee of a good education for everyone, not just \nthose who would do well in a purely market-based system.\n  I would like to take a moment to salute the leadership and the work \nof the Presiding Officer in this regard. These provisions would not be \nwhat they are and would not have been included in this legislation \nwithout the Senator from Delaware. I want to acknowledge and thank him \nfor his steadfast leadership and support on this bill.\n  We have public school choice for every parent where a school has not \ndone well enough in making progress\n\n[[Page S13332]]\n\nwithin 2 years. There are supplemental services after 3 years, giving \nparents a choice for afterschool, summer school, and weekend tutorials \nto make sure the kids get the education they need. And finally, there \nis a meaningful, determined commitment to charter schools, making them \nan integral part of the public education system, to give more vitality, \nmore innovation, and more accountability to public schools through \ncharter schools. I thank the Chair for his leadership in this regard. \nMy own capital city of Indianapolis just designated the first of four \ncharter schools in Indianapolis. We look forward to benefiting from the \nprovisions the Chair has championed in this bill.\n\n  There are major provisions in this bill to help those who are limited \nEnglish proficient. We also do a better job of targeting resources to \nkids who are most in need. Senator Landrieu from Louisiana championed \nthe targeting provisions in this bill. I always thought it was one of \nthe ironies of ESEA that so many schools with a high concentration of \npoverty children, in fact, receive next to nothing in terms of support \nfrom the very vehicle that was designed to rectify this inequity.\n  In conclusion, let me say two things: First, nothing is perfect. Even \nwith all of this historic progress that I and others have outlined, \nthis is a major step forward. But, of course, many of us would like to \nhave seen us accomplish even more, particularly in the area of funding. \nWe have made a major step forward in regard to ESEA funding and with \nthat, an implicit commitment to make even more historic increases in \nthe years to come toward full funding of this vital program. I voted \nconsistently--I know the Chair and others did--for more funding for \nIDEA. This includes a $1 billion downpayment as commitment toward full \nfunding of this initiative which is not only long overdue but vitally \nimportant to the educational progress of children with disabilities \nacross America. We must do better in this regard. We will do better.\n  The choice was the progress we have outlined in this bill or \nnothing--nothing for another year, nothing year after year for \nAmerica's schoolchildren. While there is work yet to be done, I don't \nthink the appropriate course was to set aside the progress that is here \nto be made because, frankly, we cannot afford to wait any longer in \nmaking all the progress that we practically can for America's \nschoolchildren. That is why I support this bill and why I am also \ndedicated to coming back and finishing the business with regard to IDEA \nand ESEA funding.\n  Let me conclude by saying, 2 years ago, on the floor--Senator Kennedy \nmay remember that I quoted Winston Churchill when he spoke at a time of \ngreat trial for his country, a time of military trial for his country. \nI will paraphrase him once again today as we gather to make progress \nwith the successful conclusion of this debate on reforming education. \nAt that time, Churchill said that they had not reached the end and \nperhaps they had not reached the beginning of the end, but at least \ncertainly they had reached the end of the beginning. So have we.\n  Let us begin to provide the kind of historic advancements that \nAmerica's schoolchildren have needed for so long. Let us begin to make \nmeaningful progress in closing the inequities in income in our country \nby making knowledge and education affordable and available to all of \nour children, regardless of race, creed, color, religion, or income. \nWhen we do that, we will look back on this day's work with gratitude \nand satisfaction that we have made a difference in this body.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for adding another illustrious chapter to his \nlong career of public service to our country. I thank him and my \ncolleagues, including Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I mentioned earlier how much we value our \ncolleague's participation in the fashioning and shaping of this \nlegislation. He remembers that we had a 2-week debate without \nconclusion in the year 2000 on this legislation. We had 8 days of \nmarkup even this time. The legislative effort has been ongoing. It is a \nbetter product as a result of it. Frequently legislation gets derailed.\n  I again thank the Senator for all of his good work and his counsel. I \nknow he will be very much involved as we follow on with this \nlegislation with a reauthorization of higher education.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Connecticut. Senator Dodd has, as \nall of us know, been the chairman of the children's caucus and has \nalways taken a great interest in education, as well as children's \ninterests. He has been very much involved in this legislation, he and \nSenator DeWine, with our safe and drug-free school features that are so \nimportant now in terms of violence in schools, the afterschool \nprograms, which are so essential. He has been the principal advocate \nfor those programs, the private character education, early childhood \neducators, a whole series of measures that have been included in this \nlegislation as a result of his strong work. We are delighted to see \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me add my voice to those who have \nalready spoken in commending the chairman of the committee, Senator \nKennedy, and the ranking Republican on the committee, Judd Gregg of New \nHampshire, for their leadership, and John Boehner, the chairman of the \nHouse committee, along with George Miller of California, the ranking \nDemocrat. They have been the four principals responsible in the last \nfew months for putting this proposal together. The adjectives \ndescribing the contributions of my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts are merited, considering the amount of time and effort he \nhas put into this product. Later in my remarks, I will acknowledge the \nkey staff people who have put in tireless hours--forgoing weekends, \nevenings, and vacations--to try to reach compromises on some of the \nthorniest issues of this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont. Senator Jeffords began the \nprocess as our Senate Education Committee chairperson. He has fought \nhard for his entire career in public life on behalf of education and \ncertainly made a significant contribution to this bill, particularly in \none area he cares about especially deeply, special education. I gather \nSenator Jeffords may not vote for the conference report at the end of \nthe day because of his deep disappointment over the fact that we did \nnot include mandatory spending for special education. I share his \nconcern.\n  Full-funding for special education gained broad support in this body. \nUnfortunately, neither the other body in conference nor the \nadministration was supportive, despite the rhetoric of many years for \nmeeting the goal of full-funding; that is, the Federal government \nproviding 40-percent of state's special education costs.\n  In fact, I see my good friend from New Mexico, Pete Domenici, in the \nChamber, former chairman of the Budget Committee. I recall sitting on \nthat committee with him some 12 years ago when we actually had a tie \nvote in the committee on fully funding special education. We will come \nback to this issue, even though we didn't include it in this bill.\n  The interest and concern of communities all across the country is \nwell founded on this particular issue. I will get into it in a little \nmore detail later. But, in any event, Senator Jeffords deserves a great \ndeal of credit for his tireless efforts on behalf of children, \nparticularly those with disabilities.\n  I also thank President Bush. He is getting a lot of credit these days \nfor the conduct of the war in Afghanistan, and rightfully so. All of \nthe news has been focused on that. But he deserves a great deal of \ncredit, in my view, for making education his top domestic priority. We \nmay have our disagreements, including on significant parts of this \nbill, even though I intend to support it. But, this administration is \nquite different from administrations past that we talked about \neliminating the Department of Education. We now have a President who is \nhas made education his top domestic priority. Without his leadership on \nthis, without his insistence that this issue be pursued by this \nCongress, I don't think we would have arrived at the position we have \ntoday. I commend the President for his commitment to this cause.\n  I hope it remains throughout his term in office. I hope that during \nthese next 3 years when he submits his budget to the Congress that \neducation will be among his top domestic priorities there, as well. I \nam confident it will, based on his dedication over the previous year to \nthis issue.\n\n[[Page S13333]]\n\n  I have said I had some concerns about the bill. Obviously, all of us \ndo. That is the nature of compromise.\n  The bill, as we know, requires testing of every child, all 50 \nmillion, who go to public schools. Of the 55 million children who go \noff to school every morning, 50 million go to public elementary or \nsecondary schools, and 5 million to private or parochial schools. We \nare going to test every child in the third to the eighth grade every \nyear in math and in reading. I think that has some value.\n  My concern is that we may be tilting more toward diagnosis than \ntreatment. Then again, you can't treat unless you diagnose, so I accept \nthe notion that you have to take children's temperatures, if you will. \nMy concern is the obvious one--that once we take their temperatures, \nare we then going to put the resources into the most troubled \ncommunities in America so that these kids get the treatment they need \nto pass not only the tests they will be required to take in third \nthrough eighth grade, but passing more difficult tests in life as to \nwhether or not they can become good citizens, whether or not their \neducation is full and rounded, whether or not they are going to be good \nparents, whether or not they are going to make a contribution to the \neconomic well-being of our Nation.\n  This bill makes it clear that we must have high expectations for \nevery child, regardless of race, disability, limited English \nproficiency, or income. Because quality teachers are so critical to \nchildren's success, this legislation will insist that all teachers be \nhighly qualified within 4 years. That is a tremendous goal, Mr. \nPresident, one which I strongly support.\n  The underlying question I have in all of this is whether or not we \nwill provide the resources, budgetary and otherwise, to achieve those \ngoals.\n  We have added measures to ensure that schools will be accountable for \nstudents' progress in reading and math, and in limited English \nproficiency for students learning English. That is something I strongly \nsupport, also.\n  This bill ensures that Federal education reforms and resources are \ntargeted to our neediest children. There are also many parts of the \nbill that are of particular interest and importance to me. Let me \nenumerate them quickly.\n  One is that we protected and expanded 21st Century Community Learning \nCenter Programs after school. I know I am preaching to the choir when I \ntalk to my colleagues about this. We understand that this is a \ndangerous period of time for kids after school. You need only talk to \nany parent in the country about what happens after school--this is when \nchildren are most likely to become victims of a crime, or become \ninvolved in bad behavior that could undermine their education and their \nwell-being.\n  We provide something I have felt strongly about for years--\nprofessional development for early childhood educators through \ncompetitive grants to local partnerships that focus on helping teachers \nin child care and other early childhood education programs that support \nchildren's learning and development. Again, I am preaching to the \nchoir.\n  I welcome the administration's support for early literacy through the \nEarly Reading First program. The Early Childhood Educator Professional \nDevelopment grants will complement, rather than duplicate, those \nefforts, by providing educators with training in all the domains of \nchild development--social, emotional, physical, and cognitive. We must \nremember that a child's school readiness must include a knowledge of \nletters, but also how to follow directions, how to work independently \nor with others, and how to resolve conflicts without aggression, \nto name a few.\n\n  These programs work, and there are not enough of them. Children with \nbetter qualified early childhood educators have better behavior skills, \nbetter vocabularies and pre-reading skills, lower juvenile arrest \nrates, and do better in school. Yet, most early childhood educators \nhave only a high school diploma. Professional development therefore is \ncritical.\n  I thank Senator DeWine. He and I have worked for many years on Safe \nand Drug Free Schools. This bill reauthorizes that act and makes \nsignificant improvements to it. It ensures that programs under the act \nwill be in response to identified State and local needs, will be based \non proven or promising theories, will have clear and measurable goals, \nand will be undertaken with parent and community input. That is as it \nshould be. These are the people who know best at the local level where \nthe resources should go. The Safe and Drug Free Schools Act has been \nmost successful over the years.\n  I see my colleague from New Mexico here. He and I have championed and \nworked together on character education for some time. There has been no \nstronger advocate than Senator Domenici for that. We started out with a \ntiny pilot program a few years ago because none of us knew for certain \nwhether this noble idea would actually work in practice. As a result of \nthose pilot programs, over the years, we have seen marvelous \nachievements made by kids in some of the toughest communities and \npoorest communities in America. As a result of those pilot programs, \ncharacter education is now part of the seamless garment of learning. \nStudents who receive character education carry with them throughout \ntheir lives not only the ability to contribute to society, but also the \nunderstanding that it is their responsibility to contribute. We now \nhave some $25 million in character education grants to go to local \ncommunities. That is a 300-percent increase over where it was. So I \nthank my colleague from New Mexico for joining with me over the years \nin that particular program. I know he will address that in a few \nminutes.\n  I am also pleased to tell you that this bill includes strong privacy \nprovisions to ensure that schools are centers of learning, not centers \nof market research. Senator Shelby of Alabama and I, along with \nCongressman Miller, have worked hard to see to it that parents have a \nright to know whether their children are being used as marketing tools \nand the right to say that they don't want their children to be a part \nof that. It is hard enough to get kids to learn. I am nervous about \nbusinesses reaching into captive audiences of kids and probing them \nabout themselves and their families without parental involvement. This \nbill now adds very strong provisions in that regard. Parents wouldn't \nallow somebody to come into their home and question their 7- or 8-year-\nold child without permission. Now, parents will have the right to keep \nthat from happening in the schoolroom--children being subjected to \nmarketing techniques that may violate families's privacy and also used \nto develop product lines.\n  Today also marks the end of the injustice of treating Puerto Rican \nchildren as second-class citizens under title I. I thank my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts for his leadership on this. I thank Commissioner \nAnnibal Acevedo Vila, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Sila Calderon, and \nothers who have fought very hard to see that we treat Puerto Rican \ntitle I children just as we treat every other child in the United \nStates. We do that in this bill. They deserve the same educational \nopportunities as all American children. They are going to be subjected \nto the same testing requirements. The expectation that these children \nperform is just as high in Puerto Rico now as in any other State. Now, \nthey will receive not three-quarters of their allocation of title I \nfunds, but 100 percent.\n\n  We have set high goals for title 1 authorizations. Senator Collins of \nMaine and I drafted an amendment that passed with 79 votes for full \nfunding for title I. This bill doesn't have full funding for title I, \nbut this Chamber went on record supporting full funding. I thank \nSenator Collins for her work in that. We didn't achieve it here, but \nour goal is that this will ultimately be what is supported by the \nadministration and our colleagues here. The concern I have is one I \nhave expressed all along, and that is whether or not the resources are \ngoing to be here to support the reforms. We are taking a leap of faith. \nMany advocated that we wait before adopting this conference report \nuntil the President submitted his budget in January.\n  We could have waited a few weeks to see what President Bush puts on \nthe table before we passed this 6-year bill. We are not going to do \nthat because we are going to rely on the commitments made by the \nadministration that the resources will be there.\n\n[[Page S13334]]\n\n  I would point out that in the midst of this recession, State \neducation budgets have declined in excess of $11 billion since last \nyear. So the demands are going to be even greater than before. The \nnumber of low-income students is going to go up. The number of title I \nstudents will increase. State budgets are going down. Whether or not we \nhave applied adequate resources, only time will tell.\n  On this issue, the President's rhetoric far exceeds his action so \nfar. I do commend him immensely for making the education issue his top \ndomestic priority. I can only hope that when the budget is submitted \ncome January, the numbers on title I--the numbers needed to support \nthese reforms will be there. We will also continue to fight for full \nfunding of IDEA. The pressures are going to be significant there. By \nproviding only 15 percent, rather than 40 percent, we consign every \ncommunity in America to making up the difference in their special \neducation budget. That means added pressure on local communities, most \nof whom pay for education with local property taxes.\n  As I said recently, if we were debating the Defense budget, we would \nnot tolerate anyone saying: This is the best we could do. If it was the \nDefense budget, we would say: Don't tell us it is the best you can do; \ntell us what you need and we will provide it. I happen to think \neducation is as important an issue as there is, if not the most \nimportant issue.\n  In our democracy and free-market economy, education is critical to \nsuccess. I would like to think we would do all that needs to be done. \nSo, I am disappointed in the budget numbers, but I am confident that \nover time, we will gain the support we need to provide the resources \nnecessary to implement the reforms included in this legislation.\n  To give my colleagues an idea, the title I increases in my State of \nConnecticut are not insignificant, a 20-percent increase in title I \nfunding which will be very helpful. In Hartford, CT, that means going \nfrom a little more than $16 million to in excess of $22 million, a 37-\npercent increase in title I. New Haven will go from almost $12 million \nto in excess of $16 million, a 33-percent increase in title I funding. \nThese are Congressional Research Service estimates. That is \nsignificant, and those additional dollars are going to go a long way in \nserving the neediest children in two of the largest cities in the State \nof Connecticut.\n  The issue is whether the appropriations will be sufficient this year \nand in the future to implement the reforms in this authorizing \nlanguage. Again, I hope that will be the case in the coming years, that \nwe will continue this bipartisan effort that marked this legislation \nand that the appropriations process will be not just bipartisan within \nCongress, but also between Congress and the executive.\n  In closing, I also thank Shawn Maher, Lloyd Horwich, Grace Reef, and \nPatrick Rooney of my office who have done terrific jobs. From Senator \nKennedy's office: Danica Petroshius, Jane Oates, Roberto Rodriguez, \nMichael Dannenberg, Dana Fiordaliso, and Ben Cope were tremendously \nhelpful and supportive in listening to all of us and our staffs as we \nworked through the legislation. I thank Denzel McGuire and Townsend \nMcNitt of Senator Gregg's staff, and I thank all the staff of other \nSenators from the conference as well as members of the House staff, all \nof whom should be commended.\n  As I said earlier, their names are not well known, they are not \nelected to office, but we all know that without their Herculean efforts \nlate at night, on weekends, and in lieu of vacations, we would not be \nhere talking about this fine legislation that we will ask our \ncolleagues to support.\n  Sandy Kress of the White House and his staff, as well, deserve \ntremendous credit for staying at the table and seeing us through this \nprocess.\n  I immensely commend my friend from Massachusetts for the tremendous \neffort he has made on this legislation and his significant \naccomplishment. He deserves a great deal of credit for it. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I mentioned before a number of the \nprovisions in which the Senator from Connecticut had been particularly \ninterested. The one I had not mentioned and the one I welcomed the \nopportunity to work with him on was full funding of the title I for \nPuerto Rico. If we look over the percentage of men and women who serve \nin the military, they come from Puerto Rico. They are at the highest, \nif not the highest, of the top two or three equivalent States.\n  If we look at Congressional Medals of Honor and other awards--these \nare individuals who have always been there. They are American citizens \nand their children should receive the full benefits of the legislation.\n  I welcomed the chance to work with Senator Dodd and our conferees to \nmake sure that was going to happen over time.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico. He is not a member of our \ncommittee--and he will express his views--but if my colleagues will \ntake a moment and look on page 434 for the provisions to improve the \nmental health of children, as well as character education, which \nSenator Dodd mentioned--character counts also includes community of \ncaring programs as well--Senator Domenici has been the leader in this \ninstitution of making sure we have parity and equality in mental \nhealth. This has been one of his great causes. He has educated this \nbody and educated the country. He and Senator Wellstone are two real \nchampions in understanding there are mental health challenges for \nchildren and for students.\n  Senator Domenici has been enormously helpful to our committee. He has \nmade a very important contribution to the development of this \nlegislation. We are enormously grateful for his interest and \ninvolvement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, the chairman of the committee, I greatly appreciate the \ncomments he made with reference to both character education and the \nissue of our schools integrating mental health systems that are \noperating outside the schools but should be in the schools. That is on \npage 434. I am very pleased it was added.\n  I offered this issue as an amendment and turned it into a grant \nprogram that is modeled after the language of an amendment. It is going \nto go a long way toward using the community's mental health resources \nto help public school children who have mental health problems.\n  Second, I thank Senator Dodd who spoke a moment ago about his and my \ninvolvement in a program that involves character education. My \ncolleagues will remember when I first talked about it in this Chamber, \nSenator Sam Nunn joined me and then Senator Dodd. Senator Dodd fell \nimmediately into succession when Senator Nunn left, and it became known \nas the Domenici-Dodd approach in the Senate.\n  The Senator from Connecticut found some exciting ways to do this in \nhis State. So have I. One of the most exciting things I have done in \neducation is visit schools with character education as part of their \nprogram, with the voluntarism it brings to bear and the wonderful \nfeeling it gives to children and teachers to know in their regular \neducation they are also learning what the word ``responsibility'' \nmeans, what the word ``trustworthiness'' means, which essentially is: \nYou should not lie; you should live up to contracts and agreements.\n  And there are other programs that are part of the character counts \napproach. These are used to get children excited about character and \nthe principle attributes that make somebody a person of character. We \nall know that is very important, and I am very thrilled to have been \npart of that over the years. It is working in so many States.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership. I will work now on the \nappropriations to see if we can get the full $25 million. This is \nauthorized, but we have to get it appropriated. That is a small amount. \nEverybody should know the reason it is small is we do not tell anybody \nhow to do this part of education. We merely offer money to them for \ncenters or resource-based facilities so they can pass on the word and \nthe tools to various teachers and organizations. We want character \ncounts taught by teachers at the local level, using local people to \nimplement it.\n\n[[Page S13335]]\n\n  Nonetheless, walk into a classroom of sixth graders and see that this \nmonth is the month of responsibility. See the walls loaded with posters \nabout responsibility, and then sit down with them while they talk about \nresponsibility. Then go to the class reunion which they do once a \nmonth. They make the awards themselves for those who have been most \nresponsive, for those who have been most trustworthy, for those who \nhave been best in their citizenship. It is exciting, it is moving, it \nis very positive, and rather fantastic, because one might say we have \nbeen spending a lot of money and trying a lot of things. We have \nremained rather constant in one way of doing it for almost 40 years. \nEssentially, we changed it only in that we pushed for more resources in \nthat 40-year approach.\n\n  I might say the time was ripe for change, and this President made it \npart of his effort. As a matter of fact, it probably can be said that \nonly because he has pursued it as he has have we finally produced an \neducation bill that is significantly different and has significantly \ndifferent qualities and characteristics about it than we have ever had \nbefore.\n  I want to, in my own way, tick off a few of them. First of all, I am \npleased that in addition to character education expansion, better \nmental health coordination, and teacher recruitment centers are in this \nbill. I introduced an amendment in that regard, too, and that is going \nto be very helpful because, if anything, we know we are not paying our \nteachers enough and that movement of paying more is catching up State \nby State.\n  We need to help our teachers be better teachers because the fact is, \nwe know in many instances they need help and they need to be better \neducated, especially in the specialities that will make these students \nbetter and more well rounded, better at math and science and \ntechnology.\n  In addition, in educational funding this bill authorizes \nsignificantly more money. We are very hopeful the appropriators will \ncome close. The amount this bill authorizes is $26.3 billion, and that \nis dramatically up from last year.\n  The other thing that is new and different is enhancing accountability \nand demanding results. There were many who questioned that, but in a \nsense what has come out in the conference is good. It is good in that \nit requires report cards on school performance. States using Federal \ndollars must show success on an annual reading and math assessment for \nstudents of third grade through the eighth. Four hundred million \ndollars is authorized to help the States administer this new approach.\n  There were some who were saying they will not have enough money to \nput this into effect. That was cut through and some extra resources \nwere given so they can do what is necessary to enhance the \naccountability and prove there are results.\n  We have unprecedented State and local flexibility. That is \ncontentious nonetheless because there are some who do not want to do \nthat. They want the Federal Government to remain in charge. Compromises \nwere forthcoming, but we might say we are going to be trying \nunprecedented State and local flexibility, not as much as some want but \nmore than some wanted in this area. I think the compromise is going to \nprove in 2 or 3 years that we probably ought to give even more \nflexibility to the State and local people.\n  We have streamlined bureaucracy and reduced red tape in the process \nof putting programs together. We have made 45 programs out of 55, and \nthen we have given a certain number of districts an option to opt out \nof the Federal program and opt into one with pure flexibility. We do \nnot do that for everyone because some are very frightened about what \nmight happen. But I think we allow approximately 150 schools to \nvoluntarily pull out from the details, spend the money on the ideas, \nand see which comes out better 3 or 4 or 5 years from now in terms of \nstudent and teacher education.\n  We have expanded parent choices. Children in failing schools are \ngoing to be allowed to transfer to better performing schools or to \ncharter schools immediately after a school is identified as failing. I \ndo not know whether that is going to work. We all know that is a \ndifficult concept. We do not know in some parts whether there are going \nto be enough schools for them to transfer to. Nonetheless, this \ncertainly sets the stage and sets a standard that the United States \nought to give parents more choice if parents are willing to be part of \nit, help with transportation and other things. Then we go into reading \nwhere for the first time we have a very major change in that almost a \nbillion dollars is authorized for reading. That is very exciting. I \nhope they fund the appropriations.\n  In Early Reading First Program, there is some money, asking that it \nbe part of the Federal program, and then it lays the groundwork for \nimportant reforms in special education. It has already been said we did \nnot move totally to mandatory funding of that program that we are so \nconcerned about, a program called IDEA, but we are moving toward more \nfunding rather than less.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Judd Gregg, is in \nthe Chamber. He is the one who pushed the Congress more adequately fund \nIDEA. We started about 5 years with him pursuing this, and for the \nfirst time in the history of IDEA, special education, we started to \nfund it at higher levels. In this bill, we move even more in the \ndirection of seeing to it that schools are not overburdened because the \nFederal Government puts more money into this program.\n  We have something in this bill to make schools safer, something for \nEnglish fluency, and we have some special safeguards regarding rural \nschools. That is exciting, and that means we have concern that the \nregular programs that exist in a city such as Albuquerque might not \nwork in a school district in Deming, NM, which is considerably smaller \nand very rural.\n  So I hope when we are finished, the President will sign this bill, \nand I hope he takes some credit for it because, indeed, he deserves \nsubstantial credit for it, as do a number of Senators, including \nSenator Kennedy, clearly, as the chairman of the committee, Senator \nGregg, and many others. I am not on the committee, but I do a little \nbit because I am genuinely interested and concerned, and I think we \nhave added some special ideas to this bill.\n  I want to thank those Members who allowed those ideas to find their \nway into this bill, and clearly our next step is to see how much the \nappropriators are going to appropriate. This is an authorizing bill. It \nmust be funded. I hope in the next week we will know, and we will be \ntelling the appropriators that we have praise for their work because \nthe most important aspects of this bill would have been funded by them \nin the health and human services appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see our friend and colleague from \nDelaware in the Chamber. I wanted to again point out to our colleagues \nthat again he is one of our newer members, but he spent a great deal of \ntime making education a top priority in Delaware.\n  I have listened to him speak about education on many different \noccasions. He has been enormously active during our debate on this \nlegislation on the charter school programs and also on the voluntary \nschool choice programs. We are very grateful for all of his \ninterventions and for his strong support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I begin by thanking Senator Kennedy for \nhis kind words. A year ago this month, I was privileged to be in \nAustin, TX, at the Governor's house for a fellow who had that day \nstepped down as Governor of Texas and was about to become President of \nthe United States.\n  There were any number of Senators present that day, a number of \nRepresentatives from the U.S. House of Representatives, and one sitting \nGovernor--that was me. Absent from those in attendance that day was \nSenator Kennedy.\n  We spent the better part of an afternoon discussing with the new \nPresident-elect what kind of changes we should make to the educational \nsystem in our country. I remember returning from that meeting, that \nextended discussion, and calling Senator Kennedy on the phone to share \nwith him a little bit of what took place in his absence.\n  I recall reading almost a year ago there were some in this city who \nwere saying education reform would be at\n\n[[Page S13336]]\n\nthe forefront of the President's agenda, and that a good deal of it \nwould take place with or without the involvement of the ranking member \nand now chairman of the committee, Senator Kennedy.\n  As it turns out, Senator Kennedy ended up being in the center of the \naction. He and his staff helped to shape, in no small part, the agenda. \nI want to express my thanks to him for his support and his acceptance \nof provisions offered by Senator Gregg and myself with respect to \npublic school choice and charter schools.\n  I say to Senator Gregg, who is present today, how much I appreciate \nthe opportunity to be his ally, to make sure that as we assess the \nschools in this country and provide leadership in Washington, we not \nonly support the States in establishing strong standards and assessing \nstudent performance, but also empower parents by giving them greater \nchoices as to where their children will go to school.\n\n  I want to mention a few others who played an important role in \nshaping this bill and in supporting the measures that Senator Gregg and \nI advanced with respect to public school choice and charter schools. We \nhave already heard from Senator Bayh. Later, I suspect we will hear \nfrom Senator Lieberman, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Frist, all of \nwhom played an incredibly important part in the conference and in the \ndebate on this legislation. I want to also recognize a few of my old \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, including Chairman Boehner \nand Congressman Miller, who have been mentioned, as well as some \nMembers who have not been mentioned. To Mike Castle from Delaware, Tim \nRoemer of Indiana, Rob Andrews from New Jersey, and Heather Wilson of \nNew Mexico, I want to say a special thanks for the great work they have \ndone to give us a solid compromise. And I take my hat off to the \nPresident. He has made this his primary initiative coming out of the \nstarting block and has done wonderful work, along with Sandy Kress, \nMargaret Spelling, and others from the White House staff.\n  If I could draw a rough analogy to a war going on on the other side \nof the world, the military campaign in Afghanistan, we are providing \nmore money for our military operations. We are saying to those leading \nthat operation: We will give you significant flexibility in how you use \nthe resources. We will not try to micromanage the war from Washington. \nBut we are going to hold you accountable for results.\n  If you think about this legislation, in an effort to ensure better \nresults from our schools in America, we have agreed with the President \nto provide more money for our schools. We have agreed to provide that \nmoney with greater flexibility to be used in our schools as our school \nleaders at the local level believe is best suited to raise student \nachievement. And we have agreed that, while we will provide that money, \nmore money with greater flexibility, we will demand results. We will \nnot throw good money after bad. We want results. There will be \nconsequences for those schools that do well and consequences for those \nthat do not.\n  That is the basic compact at the heart of this legislation--greater \nfunding and greater flexibility in exchange for greater accountability \nfor results. Beyond this, we have added measures to target federal \ndollars where the need is the greatest. We have also included report \ncards for parents, report cards that will give them the information \nthey need to assess the performance of the schools their children \nattend. We do this because we want to empower parents to make choices \nfor their children and we want to bring market forces to bear, \ncompetition to bear, within our public schools.\n  If we had debated this legislation 6, 7, 8, or 9 years ago, we might \nhave come at it in a different way. A decade or so ago, I know of no \nState which had adopted rigorous academic standards--no State that had \nspelled out what they expected their children to know and be able to do \nin reading, writing, math, and social studies. Today, all but one State \nin America has adopted rigorous academic standards, spelling out what \nthey expect their students to know. A decade or so ago, we didn't have \nStates that had developed tests to measure student progress. Today, \nover half the States have developed those tests. In my State and other \nStates, we measure student progress each and every year. A decade or so \nago, we did not have accountability systems in place. We did not have \nsystems in place that said we will hold schools accountable and \nresponsible: for those that meet the grade, there are certain rewards; \nfor those that do not, there are certain consequences. Today, almost \nhalf the States in America have adopted accountability systems.\n\n  A decade or so ago, if we had taken this legislation up, we would \nprobably have said: The Federal Government should write the standards; \nwe are smart enough in Washington to write the standards and impose \nthose on the States. We have not done that in this legislation. This \nlegislation acknowledges that the States have spent a lot of time, \neffort, and energy with the input of some of the best and brightest \nteachers, business leaders, and scientists--working to develop their \nown academic standards to measure student progress. In this legislation \nwe say to the States: You develop the standards, you determine how \nquickly you will move over the next 12 years to get up to those \nstandards, but once you have done that, we will hold you responsible \nfor moving all kids up to the standards--kids from the best \ncommunities, with the highest per capita income, as well as those from \nthe toughest communities.\n  A decade or so ago, we might have provided the money and said to our \nschools and school districts: By the way, here is the money, and this \nis exactly how you have to spend it. We don't do that in the context of \nthis legislation. We say: Here is extra money. Roughly half the money \nwe will provide will be provided in ways that give you more \nflexibility. If it makes more sense to use the for before- or \nafterschool programs, do that. If it makes more sense to use the money \nto provide full day kindergarten, do that. Or for prekindergarten \ntraining, do that. But in the end, however you decide to use the \nresources, we want and demand results.\n  Now, let me talk briefly about public school choice and charter \nschools. In the State of Delaware, as Governor, I signed into law \nlegislation making Delaware the first State to go to statewide public \nschool choice. I will never forget hearing a conversation between \nschool administrators shortly after we signed that legislation into \nlaw. One administrator was heard saying: If we do not offer students \nand parents what they want in our schools, they will go somewhere else. \nIf we don't offer students and parents what they want in our schools, \nthey will go somewhere else. In Delaware, they can do that. They take \nthe money to another school. The money from the State taxpayer follows \nthe students. We have injected competition and market forces into our \npublic schools in ways that might have seemed impossible half a dozen \nyears ago.\n  The legislation we are debating, and will hopefully pass this week, \nsays there will be consequences flowing from the annual tests given in \ngrades 3 through 8. Among the consequences of a school failing to make \nprogress toward their own standards, at the rate they have said they \nwill make it, is that parents are given an alternative. We will provide \nassistance to help turn around the school, but public school choice \nbecomes an option for parents after that second year that the school \nfails to make adequate progress. Transportation money is also provided \nso that a student can actually go from school A to school B if that is \nwhere they want to go. If school B gives a better education, the \ntransportation money to get that child from school A to school B must \nbe provided. Having dealt as Governor with public schools through the \nturmoil of public school choice and the challenges of its \nimplementation, I know it is not easy. I am grateful to Senators \nKennedy and Gregg for ensuring we provide the necessary resources to \nhelp schools and school districts to make that difficult transition to \npublic school choice.\n  After 4 years, if a school continues to fail students--if it fails to \nmake adequate progress toward their State's standards--not only are \nparents provided with the option of public school choice, but that \nschool has to be reconstituted. That school has to be closed, it has to \nbe taken over by the State or by a business interest, or that school\n\n[[Page S13337]]\n\nhas to be turned into a charter school. As a State with a number of \ncharter schools I know that charter schools provide wonderful \neducational opportunities for children in some of the most \ndisadvantaged communities in America. However, we do not provide much \nhelp to charter schools to finance their facilities. We ought to. It is \nthe number one challenge facing charter schools today--preventing new \ncharter schools from opening and preventing successful ones from \nexpanding. With this legislation, we provide some help at the Federal \nlevel to assist charter schools in accessing the credit markets and \nleveraging private capital. We also provide new incentives to encourage \nStates to treat charters like other public schools and provide them \nwith equitable funding for facilities.\n  Let me conclude with one last thought. One of our sports heroes, \nespecially this time of year as we play football on Sunday, is a fellow \nno longer with us, Vince Lombardi. He used to say about football: \nUnless you are keeping score, you are just practicing.\n  In Delaware and States across American we have begun to keep score. \nWe set the standards. We measure student progress. We are keeping \nscore. We are trying to figure out what works and provide more money \nfor those things that work.\n  This is a tough-love approach. Sometimes on our side of the aisle we \nare viewed as just wanting to throw more money at every problem. We are \nall love. Sometimes those on the other side of the aisle are viewed as \njust being tough, as not willing to provide the resources that are \nneeded in a loving way.\n  The beauty of this legislation--and it is not perfect by anyone's \njudgment--is that it takes the toughness and it mixes it with a measure \nof love. We commit to investing greater resources on behalf of students \nin this country and in return we demand improvement. As a result, we \nemerge as a full partner with the States and the school districts \nacross our country that are doing a whole lot of wonderful things to \nraise student achievement.\n  I am convinced that no piece of Federal legislation will solve all of \nour problems with respect to schools. We are a minority partner with \nrespect to public education. But with this legislation, and hopefully \nwith the funding that will follow this week in the appropriations bill, \nwe will be a more meaningful partner from Washington, DC, from our \nNation's Capital, than we have ever been in the past.\n  For everyone who has worked hard to get us to this day--Sean Barney, \na member of my staff, Danica Petroshius and Michael Meyers of Senator \nKennedy's staff, Michele Stockwell and Elizabeth Fay of Senator \nLieberman's staff and Senator Bayh's staff respectively, and Denzel \nMcGuire and Townsend McNitt of Senator Gregg's staff--my heartfelt \nthanks for a job very well done on behalf of all of our students.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator.\n  We have a number of other Senators who have indicated their desire to \ncomment on this legislation. We are waiting now for the Senator from \nOhio. As soon as he comes, I will yield the floor.\n  I want to take a moment to reiterate another important provision in \nthis legislation. Achieving our goal of a well-trained teacher in every \nclassroom. That is a critical and important reform. There are other key \nreforms to which our colleagues have spoken, but I think this is one of \nthe most important commitments in this legislation.\n  For those who are very interested in this particular subject matter, \nthere is a wonderful document entitled ``What Matters Most, Teaching \nfor America's Future,'' a report of the National Commission on Teaching \nand America's Future, which I have found to be one of the most helpful \nand useful documents in terms of understanding what is happening in \nschools across the country and what is missing.\n  Let me mention some of the conclusions they have reached in this \nexcellent study. Their conclusions are evident in many communities \nacross the country. I will also indicate what we have tried to do about \nthem.\n  I read from page 38. I will not ask, obviously, that the Record print \nit. The Record will include the parts I read.\n\n       Some problems, however, are national in scope and require \n     special attention. There is no coordinated system for helping \n     colleges decide how many teachers in which fields should be \n     prepared, or where they will be needed. Neither is there \n     regular support of the kind [of recruitment] long provided in \n     medicine to recruit teachers for high-need fields and \n     locations.\n\n  This legislation responds to that. It recognizes that recruitment is \na national problem. The bill greatly expands the support for \nrecruitment in all subject areas, including math and science, and \nthrough State-grant programs.\n  This bill also includes Troops to Teachers, which has been enormously \nsuccessful in a number of communities across the country. Also, there \nis support for the Transition to Teaching Program, which is another \nvery successful program.\n  Another important area:\n\n       Turnover in the first few years is particularly high \n     because new teachers are typically given the most challenging \n     teaching assignments and left to sink or swim with little or \n     no support. They are often placed in the most disadvantaged \n     schools, and assigned the most-difficult-to-teach students \n     with the greatest number of class preparations. Many of them \n     are outside their field of expertise with a slew of \n     extracurricular activities with no mentoring or support. \n     There is little wonder that so many give up before they have \n     really learned to teach.\n\n  We have included a very effective mentoring program that is \nresponsive to this issue.\n  This legislation supports teacher mentoring at the local level for \nall schools and for schools that have fallen behind. We must fulfill \nour goal of providing every new teacher with an effective and \ndependable teacher mentor.\n  Finally, on professional development:\n\n       In addition to the lack of support for beginning teachers, \n     most U.S. school districts invest little in ongoing \n     professional development for experienced teachers, and spend \n     much of these limited resources on unproductive practices. \n     Estimates of professional development support range from one \n     to three percent of the district operating budget even when \n     the costs of staff time are factored in.\n\n  We have included provisions in this legislation that ensure that \nprofessional development will reconnect teachers to work with their \nstudents. It will be linked to concrete tasks of teaching. It will be \norganized around problem solving. It will be based on scientifically \nbased research and will be sustained over time by ongoing conversations \nand coaching. All of those recommendations are included in this report.\n  This legislation requires professional development funding to meet \nthese criteria that I have mentioned. In addition, all title I schools \nmust spend 5 percent of their funds for professional development. Title \nI schools that are falling behind must reserve 10 percent of funding \nfor professional development.\n  Hiring well-trained teachers and having such teachers stay in \nclassrooms located in underserved areas is a high priority in this \nlegislation. We have taken the best recommendations we could possibly \nreceive based upon experience and incorporated them into this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today, as many of my \ncolleagues have, to speak for this long awaited piece of legislation. I \nthank Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for the tremendous work they \nhave done in bringing this effort together. There have been a wide \nrange of differing views, clearly because of the differences of \nphilosophy and attitudes about how the Federal Government should engage \nin the business of education at the primary and secondary levels.\n  At the same time, clearly the Nation is replete with studies that \nindicate our children are not achieving at the levels they should and \nthat the commitment is not as much as it could be, even though many \nStates such as mine struggle as much as is possible to commit the \npublic resources to education and at the same time knowing that in many \ninstances it is woefully inadequate.\n  We finally begin I think to recognize--this legislation reflects it--\nthat simply throwing money at the educational establishment will not \nsolve our educational problems. That has been largely the argument at \nthe Federal level for a good number of years: The only thing public \neducation lacks\n\n[[Page S13338]]\n\nis money. We now know that is not the total answer. We needed to cut \nFederal redtape to implement long overdue reforms.\n  I think we truly want to see improvements in our educational system. \nThere is no one in this Chamber or across America who doesn't want the \ngoal of greater recruitment, higher quality of education for our young \npeople, and, of course, our young people in the broad sense achieving \nat higher levels.\n  This bill, while authorizing a substantial increase in Federal \nsupport for education, does not simply continue funding programs which \nhave no track record of success or, even worse, which have a proven \nrecord of failure.\n  We did this in the past. I think the result is evident. We spent more \nmoney for little to no improvement in the educational programs to which \nour young people were being subjected. Of course, the end result was \nobvious. Our children were not achieving at the levels that I think all \nof us would have wished compared with other educational programs around \nthe world. We were not measuring up.\n  The bill on which our conference committee worked so long and hard \ndoes not continue the old ways. That is why I am in this Chamber today. \nI think many of us who were skeptics and concerned, and watched very \nclosely, recognize the work of this legislation has been long overdue \nin making the changes to the Federal programs and giving the States the \nflexibility to use the Federal dollars to implement programs and \nreforms, and, in much of it, it is their own reforms.\n  For the first time, the Federal Government has made a real commitment \nto returning power to the States. This bill cuts through the redtape, \nas I mentioned earlier, allowing States to use Federal money to \nimplement programs that they think are important, instead of programs \nthat the Federal Government or the bureaucrats at the Department of \nEducation think are the higher of the priorities.\n  We know that in all of our States education varies, it differs, and \nin many instances it should. While the fundamental learning skills are \nalways critical and uniformity is necessary, clearly, different States \nwish to attract and offer different approaches. I continually hear from \nprincipals, superintendents, and school board members about how their \njob would be made much easier if the Federal Government would let them \ndo what they know how to do instead of trying to tell them how to do \nit. We finally paid attention to them. I think we are going to offer \nthem the flexibility for which they have asked. All we ask in return is \nresults. That is a rather simple equation.\n  This demand for demonstrable results is indeed--and some have \ncharged--a Federal mandate. I have been in this Chamber more than once \nbefore speaking against Federal mandates. But this one Federal mandate \nreplaces numerous other mandates which are eliminated throughout the \nbill. This mandate is also unlike most of the other Federal mandates \nthat are incorporated in current law today; it is fully funded. In \nfact, the bill requires full funding for the cost of the tests which \nwill be developed due to its mandates. And if we do not fund those \ncosts, the States do not have to implement the tests. That is a fairly \nreasonable and appropriate formula. If we do not own up to our promise \nand our commitment under the law, then the States do not have to follow \nsuit.\n  I suggest this bill isn't perfect, but then again my guess is most \nlegislation that comes to the floor, depending on one Senator's or the \nother's point of view, would not meet that test. For example, it does \nnot authorize full funding for the federally mandated Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. It does provide substantial new moneys for \nthe Federal program to meet the commitment, though. I hope next year we \nwill fully reauthorize IDEA and fund it.\n  That was a program where we promised but we never delivered. As a \nresult of it being a Federal law on the ground that superintendents and \nprincipals had to live up to, there was a phenomenal drain of local \neducation money to that program away from other programs and other \ncommitments to education that were made. So, literally, local education \nfunding was providing for a Federal law and a Federal mandate under \nIDEA.\n  I am not going to stand here this afternoon and debate the value of \nIDEA, but certainly the commitment was made to fund it, and we are \nmoving in that direction with substantially more moneys; we ought to \ncontinue to do that. What does it do? It frees up local money to go \ninto education where it was intended. I think that is why it is so \ncritically important.\n  I think this bill provided by the conference committee, however, is a \nbetter vision of educational reform than the bill voted out of the \nSenate in June. I am glad we are finally getting it to the President \nfor his signature.\n  In the past few weeks, too much important legislation has been held \nup on the floor for partisan reasons or for somebody thinking they were \ngaining political points out in the field. Well, they may be gaining, \nthey may be losing, but there is one very real thing about this \nlegislation. If it passes, and if it is signed by the President, \nAmerica's children win. That is the most important nature of any good \neducation bill.\n  It has been a top priority of this President, as it has been a top \npriority of this Senate for a good number of years, to move to improve \npublic education, to participate in it at the Federal level, as limited \nas it may be, in a way that it enhances the authority at the local \nlevel to have greater flexibility in decisionmaking and ultimately, we \nhope, produce a higher quality of education for our young people.\n  I am proud to support the final conference report. I am confident it \nwill make important strides toward what President Bush calls the right \nvision, and that is that no child should be left behind by America's \neducational system.\n  So, once again, I thank the two Senators who, along with others, have \nworked hard on this and have brought it to the floor for final \nconsideration. I support the education bill's conference report and \nhope we move quickly on it. It is a good and right approach and a great \nChristmas present to America's schoolchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I withhold that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know Senator DeWine and Senator Enzi are on their way \nover to the Chamber. As soon as they arrive, I will yield the floor.\n  I bring to the attention of the Senate a rather interesting story \nthat recently evolved at the Sterling Middle School in Quincy, MA.\n  Five years ago, the Sterling Middle School was known as the school \nwhere tough kids went. This year, Sterling was recognized by the \nMassachusetts Department of Education for the improvement they made in \nthe statewide tests. In fact, Sterling has reduced their failure rates \nevery year since 1998. How did they transform this failing school? The \nschool changed the way they scheduled classes, giving teachers more \ntime to teach and students more time to do things, such as experiments \nin science, problem solving in math classes, and serious writing in \nEnglish classes.\n  Teachers got the professional development they needed to make sure \nthat longer classes incorporated techniques that would increase \nlearning. And the school created a council, which gives parents, \nteachers, and students the ability to decide what textbooks work and \nhow lessons should be structured.\n  Since 1998, Sterling's eighth grade failure rates have dropped, from \n46 percent to 17 percent in math, and from 12 percent to 2 percent in \nEnglish. This is a school which has turned itself around.\n  The reforms we have enacted in this bill will give other school \ndistricts the chance they need to turn around schools that are failing. \nWith this legislation, we give the teachers more professional \ndevelopment, we give the parents the voice they need to connect with \nthe schools that serve their children, and we give the schools the \nflexibility to reduce their class size so that teachers can reach every \nchild. So this bipartisan legislation will help more public schools \nprovide the best possible education to every student.\n\n[[Page S13339]]\n\n  I will mention another factor. The absentee rate at the Sterling \nMiddle School has been reduced by 90 percent, and today it is under 1 \npercent. They previously had an enormous absentee rate and an \nincredible dropout rate which has been dramatically reduced.\n  The Sterling school is low-income, working-class school. Forty-two \npercent of students in the Sterling Middle School receive free or \nreduced-price lunches. The district's free and reduced-price lunch rate \nis 28 percent. Eighty-one percent of Sterling students are white. The \npercentage of students in the Quincy district who are white is 70 \npercent. Twenty-five percent of the students are classified as \ndisabled.\n  Principal Metzler credits the school's outcomes to a commitment to \nhigh academic standards for all children, including those with \ndisabilities. The school has instituted a full inclusion program for \nchildren with disabilities. There is block scheduling to extend \ninstructional time, and math and reading are integrated throughout the \ncurriculum.\n  These are the kinds of innovations taking place at the local level \nthat we are giving life to with this legislation and which we believe \nwill be replicated and duplicated across the country. This is an \nextraordinary example of how things work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the very important aspects of this \nlegislation deals with accountability. In addressing accountability, we \nmust address the issue of assessment. A number of our Members have \nfocused on this issue. I want to discuss several points, in the few \nminutes we have waiting for our colleagues, about why developing high-\nquality assessments is such an important goal.\n  Under this bill, States will develop their content standards about \nwhat children ought to know in a particular grade. Those standards will \nshape curriculum. With ensuring that all classrooms have a well-trained \nteacher, and with quality curriculum, we will be able to assess \nstudents to find out what they are learning, and where we need to \nimprove. Schools will identify areas for improving student achievement, \nand will provide active support and extra assistance to help those \nchildren. Such services may be accomplished throughout the school day, \nor they may take place after school. The school has the flexibility to \ndecide what works in terms of that support.\n  Several of my colleagues raise questions about assessments, and about \nthe practice of testing. I recognize from the outset that American \nchildren are the most overtested children in the world. However, the \nproblem is that we're not focusing deliberately measuring what we \nshould. And we're not focused on the quality of the measure--too many \nchildren are being tested with off-the-shelf tests, and we're running \ninto situations where teachers are teaching to such low-level tests.\n  This obviously undermines what we are attempting to achieve with this \nlegislation. Our objective is much different in this legislation. We \nseek to establish high standards. We seek to set in place the reforms \nthat will ensure that all students meet those standards, because we \nknow that they all have the potential to achieve. And we seek to use \ngood assessments as tools, not as reforms in and of themselves, to \ngauge the success of our progress, and to understand the academic needs \nof students.\n  All assessments under this bill must be aligned to State academic \nstandards to help teachers and parents understand how well a child \nknows a particular subject that is being taught. All of this works \ntogether. You have challenging content standards. You have good \ncurriculum. You have high-quality tests. You have the well-trained and \nhighly-qualified teacher--the real professional--working with students \nto ensure their success. It is all coordinated. Rarely are all of these \npieces in place in all of our schools. So often schools with needy \nchildren are the places where one or more of these elements are \nmissing. We must change that.\n  Assessments are important tools in school reform. We need objective \ninformation about how children are achieving in order to identify the \nproblem areas and fix them. When your car breaks down, the mechanic \nruns a test to determine where the problem is. Is it in the carburetor \nor the exhaust? Is it in the electrical system? Then the mechanic uses \nthe tools specific to the problems to fix it. When you are sick, the \ndoctor performs a series of tests to determine what the illness is that \nyou have. Then the doctor prescribes a remedy specific to the illness.\n  The academic tests under this bill serve the same purpose. They help \nthe teachers and parents diagnose the problem and apply remedies that \nwill help the child achieve in those areas. The tests are not punitive. \nThey serve as a stethoscope, not a hammer. This bill builds upon \ncurrent law by requiring States to administer one test each year in the \nelementary school grades, one test in the middle school grades, one \ntest in the high school grades, until 2005.\n\n  Not all States have complied with this requirement. We need to get \nabout the business of doing it, and doing it now. There is no excuse \nfor having poor-quality, sub-par assessment program.\n  Beginning in the 2005-2006 school year, States will be required to \nadminister assessments in every grade, 3 through 8, in order to provide \naccurate information. That gives States 3 years under our bill to \ndevelop a high-quality system that is valid, reliable, and aligned to \nstandards. Such a system should ultimately provide accurate information \nabout student achievement from year to year, and should be useful in \ndiagnosing student needs, skills, and knowledge more accurate. All of \nthe tests under this bill must be of high technical quality, and based \non nationally recognized professional standards.\n  However, we know the tests cannot provide a complete picture of how a \nschool is doing. Therefore, we require that the States use the \nadditional resources such as graduation rates and retention rates to \ndetermine whether a school is performing well. We have made tests an \nintegral part of the reform, and we provide the resources to help the \nchildren do well in them.\n  We will begin to provide States the resources to develop and \nimplement these assessments in FY 2002, even though the tests \nthemselves will not be required for close to 3 more years. There will \nbe resources available to the States. Help is on the way to meet the \nchallenge of ensuring that all students achieve to high standards.\n  Seeing the Senator from Ohio, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I \ncongratulate him and Senator Gregg for their tireless efforts to bring \nthis bill to us. I also, of course, congratulate Congressman Boehner as \nwell as the President of the United States for his leadership. This \nbill has been a long time coming. It has really taken a tremendous \namount of work on behalf of all of the leaders in this effort.\n  Over the last several months, as we have debated the reform of our \npublic schools, I have argued it is necessary that we look at exactly \nwhere we are as a society and how this is affecting our public \neducation system. If we don't look at ourselves and how our society \nreflects itself through education, we will not make any reforms, we \nwill seek no change, and we will fail our children.\n  As I see it, tragically, our society is becoming more and more \ndivided, divided along economic and educational lines. This division is \ncertainly nothing new. Scholars and sociologists have been warning us \nfor many years that this was where our Nation was headed, particularly \nif we didn't properly educate our children. Tragically, we have not \nheeded these warnings.\n  As a result, our Nation today is a Nation split into two Americas: \nOne where children get educated and one where they do not. This gap in \neducational knowledge and the gap in economic standing is entrenching \nthousands upon thousands of children into an underclass and into \nfutures filled with little hope and little opportunity.\n\n[[Page S13340]]\n\nThis is happening across the country, and certainly it is happening in \nmy home State of Ohio, which in many respects is a microcosm of what is \nhappening all over our Nation.\n  In Ohio, growing income and educational disparities are creating our \nvery own permanent underclass. Most of Ohio, candidly, is doing better \neconomically and educationally.\n  The children in these areas have a great future. However, when we \nlook across the entire State, we see two areas where this is not always \ntaking place--areas where the children are not being as well educated \nas we would like our own children to be educated. And these are also \nareas where the income level shows that disparity. We see it in \nAppalachia, we see it in our core cities.\n  Too many children in Appalachia and too many in our core cities are \nat risk. In fact, according to the National Center for Education \nStatistics, in 1999, young adults living in families with incomes in \nthe lowest 20 percent of all family incomes were five times as likely \nto drop out of high school as their peers from families in the top 20 \npercent of the income distribution.\n  Just look at some of the class of 2000 graduation rates of my own \nhome State of Ohio in the urban areas. In Akron, only 72 percent of the \nState's high school students graduated last year. That is actually a \nhigh rate for an urban area. In Toledo, only 67 percent graduated; in \nColumbus, it was 62 percent; in Youngstown, 59 percent; in Dayton, 57; \nin Canton, 53 percent; in Cincinnati, 51 percent; and in Cleveland, \nonly 34 percent of the students who started high school actually \nfinished. Yes, that's right, only one-third of the students in \nCleveland public schools graduated; two-thirds did not.\n  I think if you look across the country, you will see these figures \nreplicated in urban areas, no matter what State we are referencing. \nThere is something wrong when that many of our children are simply not \ngraduating. There is also something wrong in this country when nearly \none-third of college freshmen must take remedial courses before they \ncan begin regular college-level course work. There is something wrong \nwhen only one-third of fourth graders can read. The practical result of \nthis is a society that is growing farther and farther apart, not closer \ntogether. So how do we bring society back together? That is our \nchallenge. How do we bring about equality and opportunity so that all \nchildren in this Nation have the chance to lead full, meaningful, and \nproductive lives as adults. We do this in the same way that we have \nalways done it, and that is through education.\n  As Horace Mann, a former president of Antioch College in Yellow \nSprings, OH, and the man known as ``the father of public education,'' \nonce said:\n\n       Education beyond all other devices of human origin, is the \n     great equalizer of the conditions of man--the balance-wheel \n     of the social machinery.\n\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what education can and should do. It \nshould provide all children, regardless of their economic circumstances \nor family backgrounds, with the tools they need to make it as adults in \nour society--the tools necessary to rise above individual situations of \npoverty and instability, individual situations of hopelessness and \ndespair. It truly has been, for generation after generation of \nAmericans, their ticket out of poverty, their ticket out and away from \ndespair--their ticket to opportunity.\n  The education reform conference report we will be voting on tomorrow \nis certainly a step in the right direction. It is a step toward giving \nour children the tools they need to move ahead in life. Mr. President, \nwe in this Chamber cannot fix broken homes or solve the issue of \npoverty overnight, but we can use finite and limited Federal dollars in \nways that help close this education gap in America. We can use the \nfinite resources of the Federal Government to help close that education \ngap and give these children opportunities. I believe the best place to \nbegin on the Federal level is by restoring accountability and \nachievement with the single most important resource in the classroom, \nand that, of course, is the teacher.\n\n  When I think about teachers, I think about something else that Horace \nMann once said. He said that ``teaching is the most difficult of all \narts and the profoundest of all sciences.'' I can certainly attest to \nthat. As a college student at Miami University many years ago, I spent \n4\\1/2\\ months as a student teacher at Princeton High School north of \nCincinnati. It was tough. In many respects, it was the toughest thing I \never did.\n  Teaching is tough. In fact, that is what I have learned firsthand--\nthat Ohio's and America's teachers simply don't get the respect, the \nadmiration, nor the salaries they deserve. Not surprisingly, the \nNational Center for Education Statistics predicts that within the next \ndecade, we will need to hire 1.7 million to 2.7 million new teachers to \nreplace those who retire or leave the profession.\n  While this exodus of teachers is certainly a daunting challenge and a \nvery real and pending problem, it is also an enormous opportunity. It \nis the single greatest opportunity for us as a country, as parents, as \ncommunity leaders to reshape the next decade of education in the United \nStates. When I think about this opportunity, when I think about how we \ncan shape education to the greatest benefit of our children, I am \nreminded of something my own high school principal, Mr. John Malone, \nonce told me many years ago. He said that when it comes to education, \nthere are only two things that matter: One, a student who wants to \nlearn; the other is a teacher who can teach. Mr. Malone was right many \nyears ago, and he is still right about that today.\n  Nothing is more important than that teacher in the classroom. When \nyou get right down to it, good teachers are second only to good parents \nin helping children learn. So any effort to restore confidence and \nimprove quality in education must begin with a national recommitment to \nteaching as a profession.\n  I believe we are doing just that with our education reform \nlegislation. Through language in the bill which I worked to have \nincluded, we can expand, enhance, and encourage support for teachers \nall across America.\n  First, we have a provision that would provide support for people in \nother professions who seek a second career as a teacher. We need to \nmake it easier, not harder, to recruit future teachers from the \nmilitary, from industry, and from research institutions--people with \nestablished careers in real world job experiences who want to go into \nteaching. We must utilize them and we must make it easy for them to \nenter the classroom.\n  My provision would allow the use of Federal funds for alternative \nteacher certification programs. This will allow States to create and \nexpand different types of alternative certification efforts. It would \nmake it easier for them to enter the teaching profession.\n  Second, we have a provision giving support for teachers seeking to \nimprove subject matter knowledge or classroom skills. This language \nhelps ensure that our teachers have access to training academies where \nthey can sharpen and improve their skills as teachers. There is such a \nfacility in Cincinnati called the Mayerson Academy. Teachers can go \nthere to learn from seasoned educators, experienced educators who can \nguide and help them become stronger in the classroom. Plans are already \nunderway for a similar teacher training academy in Dayton, OH. No \ndoubt, this kind of support should be available for teachers in every \ncommunity in our country.\n  When we have studied teaching and education, we have found that many \ntimes teachers start off and they are put in the classroom; they have \njust come out of teacher's college and they don't get the mentoring or \nassistance they need. That is something that will truly make a \ndifference.\n  Finally, we have a provision for giving support to new teachers from \nexperienced teachers who do, in fact, serve as these mentors. Many of \nour experienced, most senior, most knowledgeable teachers are about to \nretire, and it is vital that we don't lose their expertise.\n  We can utilize their skills through mentoring programs. Our provision \nwould allow the use of Federal funds for new and existing teacher \nmentoring programs.\n  All of these provisions we have worked on are included in the final \nversion of this bill.\n  I also believe we need to prioritize our limited Federal funding to \nrecruit and retain good teachers in our high-need urban and rural \nschool districts.\n\n[[Page S13341]]\n\nOne way to do that is by recruiting teachers from the military through \nthe Troops to Teachers Program. Last year I worked to save this \nprogram, and I fully intend to do the same this year.\n  Troops to Teachers assists retiring military personnel in gaining the \nState certification necessary to teach. Furthermore, Troops to Teachers \nhelps broaden the makeup and skills of our current teacher pool. \nFinally, it brings the best teachers to the schools and the children \nwho need them the most.\n  This is a program that has been championed by the First Lady. It is a \nprogram that has received wide accolades. It is a program that works. \nWe need to not only continue it, we need to expand it.\n  Because the Federal role in education accounts for only a small \npercentage of district spending--about 8 percent; that is about all the \nFederal Government puts into a typical school district--we must be \nespecially prudent and wise in allocating those limited Federal \nresources. That means we should direct those dollars first and foremost \nto America's neediest school districts.\n  In keeping with that notion, I am very pleased that the conference \nreport makes sure a portion of increases in title I funds goes to the \ntarget grant formula. I congratulate the conferees for doing this work. \nThis formula would funnel Federal funding directly to school districts \nin the highest poverty areas of the country. Again, I thank Senator \nKennedy and Senator Gregg for this work.\n  The target grant formula recognizes the disparity between public \neducation in affluent and poorer school districts and that there was a \nunique set of challenges associated with educating impoverished \nchildren. However, since the formula's creation in 1994, not a single \nFederal dollar has been appropriated to fund this grant program; that \nis, until now.\n  In the floor debate on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, I supported \nSenator Gregg's amendment to provide $1 billion for the target grants. \nThis will fundamentally reform our education system, and it is about \ntime. By funding the target grants, we are finally focusing on those \nchildren most truly in need.\n  While I strongly believe the teacher is the most important resource \nin the classroom and that it is necessary to target funds to those \ndistricts most in need, there are other issues in education we need to \naddress, such as the problems of drugs and violence in our schools. My \ncolleague, Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut, and I have improved the \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools Program. We worked on this for well over a \nyear. This bill authorizes $650 million for the State grant program and \nadditional funds for the national program. This vital program provides \nfunds to over 97 percent of school districts nationwide to keep our \nschools safe and drug free.\n  This bill incorporates the reforms on which Senator Dodd and I have \nworked. This bill will make a difference in this area.\n  We need this program because a child threatened by drugs and violence \nis not able to learn, and a teacher afraid to stand in front of a \nclassroom is certainly unable to teach, and that is a situation we \nshould never, ever have in our schools.\n\n  I believe it is clear that the Government can make a difference in \nrestoring quality and equality to education. On the Federal level and \non the State level, the Government can help target programs to those \nchildren in those districts most in need. However, the whole realm of \neducation is so big and so vital and so all-encompassing that it is \nsomething we cannot leave to the Government alone to fix. Everyone \nknows that.\n  Parents, families, and communities must take an active role in \nreforming our schools and helping our best teachers stay in our \nchildren's classrooms. Parents must go into their children's schools \nand help the teachers teach, volunteer to read to the classes, or help \nteach math, science, history, or literature. Society must help provide \nopportunities for families in need, help teach them, help them learn \nhow to help their own children succeed in school.\n  Ultimately, education reform is a journey toward the horizon, not a \ndestination but a never-ending, forward-leading journey toward the \nfuture. So as we move toward that horizon, as we move ahead for the \nsake of our children, we need to get back to basics: Good teachers, \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools, and parental and community involvement in \nthe schools.\n  I am confident we will go forward in the days ahead to give the \nchildren the tools they need for a bright and promising future.\n  We will go forth to restore quality and community in our system of \neducation.\n  We will go forth and establish a new way of thinking--a way of \nthinking that challenges and changes the current culture of education \nin America.\n  We will go forth and restore education's ability to ``equalize,'' as \nHorace Mann suggested.\n  We cannot rest--we must not rest--until every child in this country \nhas teachers who are qualified to teach and schools that are safe, \ndrug-free learning environments. Our children's future and the future \nof America hang in the balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ncomments both on education and Haiti. I think he is modest in character \nwhen he is talking about Haiti. He mentioned he is going there next \nmonth. He did not mention all of the years he and his family have been \ngoing there, and not just going there on vacation but going there to \nwork with the poor. As those of us who have traveled to some other \ncountries know, it is a different level of poor. It actually deserves \nand needs another word because it is so far below the poor we recognize \nthat it kind of defies imagination unless a person has been there.\n  I appreciate the effort that his family makes each and every year to \ngo to Haiti and consequently to understand that Government a little bit \nbetter. It does tie in with education because as of September 11 our \nworld got smaller. The United States and the students in the United \nStates did not have the tendency to notice what was going on in the \nother countries as much as they do now, and that is a stronger part of \nthe education now and a more understandable part by the kids in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator for his very generous comments.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my main purpose today is to address the \neducation bill, which conference report we are looking at now. I am a \nmember of that conference committee which spent nearly 6 months \nconsidering this bill, and I am especially pleased to be talking about \nthis landmark legislation.\n  As many of my colleagues have and will mention, this bill provides \nthe most comprehensive education reform since 1965. The Senate and the \nconference committee went into this to a different level than we have \ndone for years, and I am happy to report it lives up to its name by \nachieving the simple yet powerful goal of ensuring that no child is \nleft behind, a request we had from the President.\n  I give particular thanks and congratulations to the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, who played a very forceful role in each step of \nthe process with this bill and was a significant contributor to the \nnegotiations, someone who directed the negotiations, was in the \nnegotiations, and came up with some unique compromises that made this \nbill possible.\n  Senator Gregg is a person who is intensely interested in education. \nPart of that is from his tour as Governor of New Hampshire, which has \ncarried over into his Senate work. He is truly a person in education \nthat has a very strong focus and a vision for what needs to be done.\n  I also, of course, congratulate and thank Senator Kennedy for his \nintense effort on this bill and willingness to come up with a solution \nfor America. Senator Collins of Maine needs to be mentioned \nparticularly for her efforts and particularly her wordsmanship that \nresulted in some of the compromises, particularly that helped on a \ncouple of our controversial rural issues.\n  Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas spent a lot of hours and, of course, \nSenator Sessions of Alabama, with his intense interest in children with \ndisabilities, and the vast number of school visits he has made to \nschools in Alabama over the last couple of years has\n\n[[Page S13342]]\n\nbrought some insight into the classroom that has been very helpful. \nThere are a number of us who try to get into the classrooms when we go \nback home on a regular basis and see what the problems are and the \nsuccesses to see if we cannot overcome the problems and share the \nsuccesses.\n  Does this bill contain everything? No. But it does contain the 80 \npercent we all agree on, and that is since September 11 the new way we \nhave of doing business.\n  We are going ahead with issues on a much faster and more dramatic \nscale than has happened in decades probably. We have had to do bills \nfrom scratch in less than a week. The normal process is to spend 2 or 3 \nyears working different versions of a bill, having hearings, working \ncompromises between Members, eventually getting it to a hearing in \ncommittee and then markup in committee, which is where the amendments \nare made, and then bringing it to the floor for debate.\n  Our form of government is designed to have a very lengthy process, \nand it works. It has worked for centuries now, longer than any other \nexisting government. But on September 11, we had to change our \noperation. We had to take care of some problems on a shorter term basis \nthan we have ever had to handle before, and we did it. We were putting \nout about a bill a week on topics that had not been debated extensively \nin committee or on the floor.\n  Are they perfect? No. Legislation seldom is. Do they do the job? \nYes. Will they be revisited? Yes.\n\n  Education is not one of those emergency terrorism bills. It is a bill \nthat has been worked on continually by Congress. We even held the \ndebate before September 11. We were involved in conference committee \nbefore September 11. However, the bill before the Senate contains the \n80 percent on which we all agree. The other 20 percent we will continue \nto hash out over the months and years to come.\n  We have completed the bill and done it successfully. The conference \nreport reflects an agenda President Bush made clear during his first \ndays in office when he invited lawmakers to his ranch in Crawford to \ndiscuss his No. 1 domestic priority, education reform. It emphasizes \naccountability, flexibility, and local control, funding for programs \nthat work, and expanding parental control. It has student access to \ntechnology, it has high-quality teachers, and safe learning \nenvironments as a priority.\n  In addition, this legislation fulfills an important commitment to \nStates such as Wyoming that are already heavily investing in improving \nstudent achievement by allowing them the flexibility they need to \ncontinue to innovate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Governors of a number of States. Additional Governors, of course, \nwill join, but this includes Connecticut, Georgia, Arizona, Arkansas, \nColorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, \nNew Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, \nRhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin, and last, \nbut only by virtue of the alphabet, Wyoming.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                December 10, 2001.\n       Dear Members of Congress: We are writing to support H.R. 1, \n     the education reform legislation that embodies the education \n     goals of both President Bush and the Congress. As Governors, \n     we have served on the front line in promoting educational \n     improvement in our own states. We believe strongly that H.R. \n     1 will help significantly in furthering this worthy cause \n     throughout the country.\n       First, we appreciate the increased resources for education \n     authorized in the legislation. The bill will provide federal \n     funding for key priorities such as Title I grants for \n     disadvantaged students, Title II grants for teacher \n     professional development and training, and Reading First \n     funds for states to implement comprehensive reading programs \n     in the early grades. And it appears as if funding for \n     elementary and secondary education will increase by more than \n     20 percent this year.\n       Second, we are pleased that H.R. 1 grants states and local \n     districts unprecedented flexibility and freedom in deciding \n     how federal education funds should be used to meet the unique \n     needs of their students. In the key titles relating to \n     teachers, technology, and bilingual education, authority over \n     spending will pass rather dramatically from the federal \n     government to states and local districts. Further, states and \n     local districts will be given far greater authority to move \n     funds from certain uses to other uses they deem to be more \n     effective at achieving improvement in student results.\n       Finally, as supporters of accountability in education, we \n     favor the accountability features of H.R. 1. We know that \n     when adults are held responsible for student progress, that \n     progress tends to be greatest. H.R. 1 establishes a \n     comprehensive accountability system, and, wisely, it does so \n     in cooperation with the states. States will set their own \n     standards. States will select their own assessments. States \n     will have a great deal of flexibility in establishing the \n     details of how and when the elements of accountability will \n     be implemented for their own schools. And, where the federal \n     legislation calls for specific steps to be taken, such as \n     annual testing, federal funds will be made available to pay \n     for them.\n       President Bush has challenged the nation to leave no child \n     behind. The Congress has responded with H.R. 1, which is \n     grounded in the best practices derived from the states over \n     the past decade. States have modeled reforms, which have in \n     turn become the basis for this landmark legislation. The \n     Congress should complete action on H.R. 1 immediately so that \n     every state, district and school can begin 2002 with a clear \n     and bright beacon shining on their path to improved student \n     achievement.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gov. John G. Rowland, Connecticut; Gov. Roy Barnes, \n           Georgia; Gov. Jane Dee Hull, Arizona; Gov. Mike \n           Huckabee, Arkansas; Gov. Bill Owens, Colorado; Gov. Jeb \n           Bush, Florida; Gov. George Ryan, Illinois; Gov. Bill \n           Graves, Kansas; Gov. Mike Foster, Louisiana;\n         Gov. Jane Swift, Massachusetts; Gov. Kenny Guinn, Nevada; \n           Gov. Don DiFrancesco, New Jersey; Gov. Gary Johnson, \n           New Mexico; Gov. George Pataki, New York; Gov. John \n           Hoeven, North Dakota; Gov. Frank Keating, Oklahoma; \n           Gov. Mark Schweiker, Pennsylvania; Gov. Lincoln Almond, \n           Rhode Island; Gov. William J. Janklow, South Dakota; \n           Gov. Don Sundquist, Tennessee; Gov. Jim S. Gilmore III, \n           Virginia; Gov. Scott McCallum, Wisconsin; Gov. Jim \n           Geringer, Wyoming.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. These are States that see the special emphasis in the bill \nand want to add their congratulations and hope for approval of the \nconference report. We are always encouraged that those who have that \ndirect of a hand in education are showing support for work we have \ndone.\n  H.R. 1 strikes a good balance between making sure that Federal funds \nare well spent and maintaining appropriate State and local control of \neducation. It significantly changes accountability standards with the \ngoal of assuring that low-income and minority students, as well as \nother students, are learning. Yet it also prohibits national testing or \nFederal control over curriculum. While States will be required to \nadminister the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known by \nthe acronym NAEP, every other year in grades 4 and 8, there will be no \nrewards or sanctions associated with the results. The use of NAEP will \nsimply be a tool for parents to evaluate the performance of their \nchild's school against others in the Nation.\n  Of course, we will also provide accountability for NAEP and we will \nwatch to see if they can get the results out faster than in previous \nexperience--as when I was in the Wyoming Legislature. It will give a \nmeasure, a comparison, for parents to rely on and to give them some \ndirection with what their children are learning compared to the rest of \nthe Nation.\n  Some of the most important provisions in this bill concern our \nNation's teachers. As we know, one of the greatest educational \nresources is our teachers. I say this not only because my daughter is a \nteacher but because research has found, with the exception of involved \nparents, no other factor affects a child's academic achievement more \nthan having knowledgeable, skillful teachers. Every member knows that. \nEvery Member knows teachers who have had a tremendous influence on \nlives, ones who challenged us or encouraged us or disciplined us.\n  Right now, there are Hallmark ads on behalf of teachers, in a very \nspecial way conveying a message of thanks, something we need to do to \nteachers in the past who have influenced our lives and made a \ndifference. By the time we are in the Senate, a lot of the teachers are \nto longer around to be able to get that thanks. It is an opportunity we \nshould not pass up.\n  There is a Hallmark ad I particularly like where the teacher is \nretiring, packing up his books. A lady comes to visit, a former \nstudent. She is surprised that he does recognize her and even remembers \na paper she wrote. He says: I\n\n[[Page S13343]]\n\nsuppose you went on to be one of those corporate, well-paid lawyers. \nShe says: No, I became a teacher, like you.\n  We need to be thankful we have people who are willing to teach \nchildren, educate children, and spend the time with kids, to know them \nwell enough, to help them understand what learning is. We have those \nkinds of dedicated teachers in the United States. This bill will help \nto ensure there continue to be those kinds of teachers.\n  There were several places where contentious negotiations took place \nduring the deliberations on this conference report, but one area that \nwas not negotiable was ensuring our children have high-quality \nteachers, especially when it comes to reading and math. H.R. 1 contains \nunprecedented reforms that will help to ensure that all children are \ntaught by a highly qualified teacher.\n  Unlike more restrictive proposals that require States and local \nschool districts to use Federal funds exclusively for the purpose of \nhiring new teachers, this legislation provides maximum flexibility to \nStates. It will allow them to develop high-quality professional \ndevelopment programs, provide incentives to retain quality teachers, \nfund innovative teacher programs such as teacher testing, merit-based \nteacher performance systems, alternate routes of certification, or to \nhire additional teachers, if that is what they believe is necessary.\n\n  Despite all of these efforts to improve teacher quality, there are \nsome who say all we really need to do to improve student achievement is \nto hire more teachers. For small, rural States such as Wyoming, that is \nnot the answer. While I certainly recognize our Nation is facing a \nteacher shortage in the coming years, Wyoming currently has a declining \nstudent enrollment, which is forcing some school districts to eliminate \nteaching positions. Moneys specifically earmarked for hiring new \nteachers will be of little help to schools in these areas with \ndeclining enrollment.\n  In addition, rural States such as Wyoming often have difficulty \nrecruiting and retaining teachers--especially highly qualified \nteachers. We do have quite a bit of success, once we get them to come \nto Wyoming, at retaining them. Of course, we recognize anybody who can \nmake a living in Wyoming usually lives in Wyoming. We do appreciate \nthose teachers who come and stay.\n  In this bill, money earmarked for new teachers does not help Wyoming \nkeep teachers from leaving. Congress must provide State and local \nschool districts with flexibility to pay good teachers more money or \nprovide other incentives in order to encourage them to continue \nteaching.\n  It is because of issues such as these that I am particularly pleased \nthis legislation paid special thanks to rural school districts. H.R. 1 \nprovides rural districts with increased flexibility in funding to \nenhance academic achievement while helping to ensure that students in \nrural areas have equal access to educational opportunities. As many \nfolks from Wyoming are aware, rural schools often receive too little \nmoney from Federal categorical formula grants to provide meaningful \nservices to their students. By the time the formula is broken down for \nthe size of the school, there is not enough money to do the program.\n  In addition, they generally do not have personnel or resources \nnecessary to secure Federal competitive grants which many schools use \nto augment and innovate beyond what is provided for in formula grant \nprograms. The Rural Education Achievement Program, also known in this \nbill as rural flex, is included and addresses these problems by \npermitting rural schools to combine funding from a number of different \nformula grants. This allows rural schools to better serve their \nstudents by allowing them flexibility to determine where their money \ncan do the most good.\n\n  Eligible school districts can use funds for virtually any activity \nauthorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including \neducational technology, professional development, technical assistance, \nand teacher recruitment and retention.\n  The conference report also makes it clear that rural districts often \nface unique challenges in implementing restructuring actions that \nresult from 5 consecutive years of failure, and they should be given \nflexibility as long they are held to the same accountability \nrequirements as other districts.\n  Distance does create challenges. In Wyoming, we have miles and miles \nof miles and miles. We have a population of 493,000 people, and our \nState has 400 miles on a side. The average town that I visit is about \n250 people. It is a long way between those towns. For virtually every \ntown, you can drive outside of it and you see the whole town at once. \nIt is not one running into another, running into another, running into \nanother. Even Cheyenne, WY, our largest city of a little over 52,000, \ncan be seen in its entirety by driving outside the town and looking \nback at it, and it is a long way to be able to see the next town. In \nfact, usually you cannot see a next town.\n  What happens if you give people flexibility with schools, if they can \ngo to the public school of their choice but is too far to go to another \nschool? We already have public choice in public schools.\n  Usually our schools are not failing, so this provision would not \npertain to those schools anyway. But this bill will allow those rural \nschools that have failed to make progress but may not have the \nresources necessary to hire a completely new staff of teachers or find \na private contractor willing to take over the school's governance, to \ntake advantage of additional options as long as they are equally \nrigorous and are likely to help the school improve its performance.\n  Under the same provision, the Secretary of Education will be required \nto assist rural districts that request assistance in implementing \nalternative governance arrangements.\n  I thank Senators Collins, Murray, and Bingaman for their hard work on \nthis particular language. I am also pleased the conferees were willing \nto recognize that schools in rural areas and small towns often require \nadditional assistance to implement an advanced technology curriculum. \nDue to the isolated nature of many small rural towns, technology can \noffer rural students academic opportunities that they otherwise would \nnot have. Ensuring that rural students are technologically literate is \nvitally important to many communities in my State of Wyoming. I am \npleased the conferees have demonstrated their commitment to improve \nacademic performance in rural areas and have helped rural students \nparticipate in the highly competitive economy of the 21st century.\n  Wyoming has been a pioneer in distance learning. We now have the \ncapability, in many schools--no matter how small or how rural--to have \nclasses the kids can take through a distance learning program to give \nthem a wider variety of choice of classes. This bill will help to \nenhance that.\n  This bill also preserves the integrity of Federal educational \nprograms that impact Native American children. As a Senator from the \nState of Wyoming, which was the crossroads for many of the Indian \ntribes and is now the home of the Shoshone and the Arapahos, I believe \nit is critically important that the United States continue to fulfill \nthe Federal Government's unique and continuing trust relationship with, \nand responsibility to, American Indian people for the education of \nIndian children.\n\n  I am confident that the action of this conference committee has \nhelped to ensure the programs that serve Indian children are of the \nhighest quality and provide for not only the basic elementary and \nsecondary educational needs but also the unique educational and \nculturally related academic needs of these children.\n  I am also pleased we were able to make improvements in the Impact Aid \nProgram. That affects many areas of our Nation that have military \nbases, Indian reservations, or other Federal property districts that \nlimit the ability to generate funds to pay for education. Then the \nFederal Government steps in to provide for that revenue that was lost \nby having that Federal facility.\n  I am pleased we were able to come up with a compromise that allows \ndistricts and schools that are most heavily impacted to be served first \nthrough the competitive construction grants that are authorized by this \nbill. It is my hope the changes made by this conference committee will \nemphasize the importance of making Impact Aid construction grants on \nthe basis of greatest need and maximized effort so we\n\n[[Page S13344]]\n\ncan continue to fulfill the Federal Government's obligation to impact \ndistricts and the children who reside there.\n  As a strong supporter of the Boy Scouts of America and an Eagle \nScout, I am glad to report that the H.R. 1 conference report includes a \nprovision that would deny funding to any public school or educational \nagency that discriminates against or denies equal access to any group \naffiliated with the Boy Scouts.\n  Our children are our most valuable resource and we must prepare them \nto face the challenges of the 21st century. We cannot do this by \nallowing Washington politicians to implement a one-size-fits-all \napproach to education. The No Child Left Behind Act allows States to \ndecide how to best serve their students and teachers. I strongly \nsupport this conference report. I encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I thank the President for his leadership on this historic \nlegislation. If it were not for his determination to craft bipartisan \nreform of our Nation's educational system, we would not have this bill \nbefore us today. I also thank Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for \ntheir tireless efforts to craft the compromises that made this bill \npossible and brought it to us at this time. They and their hard-working \nstaffs deserve a great deal of credit for this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment because I \nsee my friend and our committee member, Senator Reed, in the Chamber. I \nalso thank Senator Enzi for his work and his support on this \nlegislation.\n  We have some important protections of rural education in here. I took \na few moments earlier today in a presentation to show that we have \nabout a 30-percent increase--for example, in Detroit, MI, in terms of \nthe urban areas, but we have a similar increase in the poorest rural \nareas of this country as well. He has fought, not only on that issue, \nbut also for flexibility in rural areas.\n  He was very much involved in the Indian education programs and has \nbeen, as we all know, and is involved in education technology issues. I \nthank him.\n  This legislation incorporates a number of recommendations that \nMembers have made. Senator Enzi has been very constructive and helpful. \nI enjoy working with him on this, as I always do when we work on OSHA. \nI always enjoy working with him on OSHA.\n  I was not in the Chamber when Senator DeWine spoke. As has been \nreferenced earlier, Senator DeWine and Senator Dodd restructured the \nwhole Safe and Drug Free School provision. It is better in this \nlegislation. It is enormously important. All of us have seen in very \nrecent days the rather dramatic increase in substances that have been \ncoming into the United States, principally, I believe, because our \nCoast Guard has been involved in other kinds of activities. This has \nbeen true in the Northeast, I learned from talking to various law \nenforcement officials. They are overstretched and overworked. The total \nmembership of the Coast Guard is just what it was in the 1960s, and we \nhave given them many more responsibilities. But the Safe and Drug Free \nSchool provision has been enormously important, particularly in dealing \nwith violence in schools.\n  So I thank Senator DeWine for his work. He has also been very much \ninvolved in Troops to Teachers. I see the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. He knows about this, is familiar with this program, \nand has supported it. Senator DeWine has been very much involved, \nparticularly in the areas of science and math, where retired officers \nhave gone back into education. It has made an enormous difference. I \nthank him for his work.\n  I see my good friend, Senator Reed. I want to tell America, if you \nsee a library being modernized in your school district, there is the \nman right over there who was able to do it. We were in an incredible \nsituation with regard to expanded reading. This is one of the principal \nrecommendations of the President. It is very worthwhile. Also the early \neducation reading. There was strong support for that and a budget \nallotment for it, but not for libraries. Our good friend, Senator Reed, \nhad brought up the problems that school libraries have been facing.\n  Also the parent involvement, I mentioned earlier this afternoon the \nrole of parent involvement: Tough accountability for students, tough \naccountability for schools, and real responsibility for parents.\n  There are two areas where we are going to need responsibility in this \ninstitution and in the States. We have to get the resources. Senator \nReed has been the most actively involved in making sure we are going to \nhave school libraries, parental involvement provisions, and highly \nprofessional development for teachers.\n  I thank Senator Jack Reed for all of his good work. He comes from \nRhode Island, which has a long tradition of educators, with Claiborne \nPell, former chairman of our committee and the author of the Pell \ngrants and many other important educational programs as well. There is \nsomething in the air in Rhode Island; all of their Senators are \nstrongly committed to good education for children. We are fortunate to \nhave him as a member of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for those very kind \nand gracious words.\n  Today represents the culmination of a very long process to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It has been \ndifficult and daunting, and at times very frustrating. We are here \ntoday because of the work of many people. But singular among those \npeople is the senior Senator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Kennedy. His determination, his creativity, his \npersistence, his unwillingness to accept anything less than a bill that \nwould materially aid children of America in their education is today \nmanifest on the floor of the Senate. We owe him a great debt of thanks \nand great praise.\n  Of course, he was part of the process with our other colleagues, \nSenator Gregg, the ranking member, and, in the other body, Congressman \nBoehner and Congressman Miller, with whom I had the privilege of \nserving on the Education Committee when I was in the other body.\n  A great deal of the tone, texture, and change in spirit was the \nresult of President Bush's commitment to work for education, and doing \nso in a bipartisan way.\n  Today we see the culmination of that long and at times trying \nprocess. Today we have legislation which represents, I believe, an \nadvance in giving every child an opportunity to learn and an \nopportunity to be educated in this country, which is the greatest \nopportunity one can ever have.\n  We are building on previous efforts. As a younger Member of the other \nbody, I served on the conference committee for the Goals 2000 Act and \nthe 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nIt was there that we talked about tougher accountability and stronger \ninsistence that the States step in when schools are failing. We \ninsisted upon higher standards. We met resistance, but we insisted. We \ndid not go as far then as I believe we could have gone, or should have \ngone. But today I believe there is vindication of those efforts almost \n8 years ago when we talked about insisting that schools be held \naccountable and that real money flow to schools so that children can \nlearn. We have taken steps in the intervening years as a result of \nGoals 2000 and the 1994 reauthorization.\n\n  In every State in the country, there has been some effort. In my \nState of Rhode Island, there has been a great deal of effort, and I \ncommend my local leaders for what they have done to move education \nforward.\n  As we approached this reauthorization, there were several important \ngoals that I believed we must achieve.\n  First, we should strengthen and build upon the accountability system \nthat was developed in the 1994 reauthorization.\n  Then we should ensure that the President's proposals for testing in \ngrades 3 through 8 have appropriate guidelines and not unduly harm \nstudents or the educational initiatives that are already underway in \nmany States, including in my home State of Rhode Island; that we should \nalso offer increased flexibility; and that we should insist upon high \nstandards but give the States and the communities the ability to reach \nthose standards\n\n[[Page S13345]]\n\nthrough means that they could choose locally.\n  Then, finally--and I believe most importantly--we had to give the \nStates the resources to make the changes that were urged upon them. We \nhad to give them the resources to meet those standards.\n  These are the parameters I used to judge the legislation that is \nbefore us. I believe we have in a very meaningful way met those \nexpectations.\n  Having erected a structure of accountability, having sensitized the \nschools of this country to be more sensitive to performance and to \nbetter teaching and to parental involvement, the test now is making \nsure that the States, the cities, and the towns in America have the \nresources to do the job. That is the test we will be taking in the \nyears ahead.\n  As Senator Kennedy stated, there were some particular issues in which \nI was interested. I am pleased to say we have made progress on those \nissues.\n  In the area of school libraries, I have long been a firm believer \nthat good school libraries mean good education. Study after study has \nconcluded that if there are good school libraries in school systems, \nthose schools will succeed. In fact, there have been studies in diverse \ncommunities, such as in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Alaska, which \nindicate that a good school library means better performance, \nregardless of geographic area and regardless of income. It is just one \nof those obvious points to which people will agree. But the real \nchallenge is to go beyond the nodding of the head in agreement to the \nfunding and support for school libraries.\n  Interestingly enough, Dr. Susan Neuman, the Assistant Secretary for \nElementary and Secondary Education in the Bush administration, is one \nof the experts in this regard. She found through her research that \nlimited access to books leads to poor academic achievement. \nUnfortunately, if you look at school libraries, particularly in poor \ncommunities in this country, they are starved for resources, for space, \nand for trained librarians and library assistants. As a result, it is \nno wonder that this is another burden on the education of \nchildren, particularly children from disadvantaged areas.\n\n  I was mystified when I arrived in the other body in 1991 that the \nRepublicans eliminated direct support of libraries back in 1981 as part \nof the Reagan revolution. In 1994, working with Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Bingaman, and Senator Pell, my distinguished predecessor, we \nwere able to reestablish a school library program. Another of the great \nheroes of that effort was Senator Paul Simon of Illinois.\n  Sadly, within months of completing the reauthorization in 1994, the \nnew Republican Congress eliminated the library program as an authorized \nprogram under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  This year, however, with President Bush's emphasis on increasing \nreading skills and literacy, and developing teachers who are adept at \nteaching reading, there was another opportunity to push forward on the \nissue of school libraries. The President's initiative seeks to increase \nprofessional development for teachers to improve reading instruction. \nHowever, it makes little sense to me to have better reading teachers \nand children eager to learn to read but libraries that are deplorably \ninadequate.\n  I have been sent materials from time to time by librarians from \nacross the country. A librarian from Arizona sent me a book about the \nU.S. Constitution which I thought was interesting, particularly when I \nnoted that the foreword was written by the distinguished President, \nCalvin Coolidge. It was still on the shelves of this library several \nyears ago. I believe when President Coolidge wrote his foreword there \nwere several amendments to the Constitution that had not yet been \nadopted.\n  That is just one example of books that are terribly out of date. Some \nof them are terribly offensive with respect to stereotypes of today, \nand which we would abhor, but are still on the shelves of many school \nlibraries.\n  If we are going to train teachers to be better reading instructors, \nif we are going to embrace the eager young children and challenge them \nto read, we have to give them the materials to read.\n  I was extremely pleased, particularly when this legislation came to \nthe floor and Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, Senator Chafee, and \nothers joined me in passing an amendment that would authorize $500 \nmillion to support school libraries. It was a 69-to-30 vote--a clear \nindication that this Senate on a bipartisan basis was standing strongly \nbehind school libraries and school librarians.\n  We took this issue to the conference, and we were successful in the \nconference. We now have legislation in this report that once again \nsupports school libraries. But the challenge remains to translate these \nvery noble words into real dollars in the next budget cycle.\n  With respect to parental involvement, Senator Kennedy also indicated \nthat this legislation strongly reflects an emphasis on parental \ninvolvement.\n  Once again, parental involvement is not something that is just nice \nto do, something that is good socially; it is the heart of a good \neducational system in this country and any place in the world.\n  Research has indicated that if you have strong parental involvement, \nyou will have better performance from students. Students need to know \nthat their parents care about education. They need to know that their \nparents care about what they are doing and learning.\n  In 1999, I introduced the PARENT Act, legislation which I developed \nin conjunction with the National PTA to implement effective ways to \ninclude parents in the lives of schools. Some would say: Why do we need \nto do that? We need to do that because today there are parents who--\nsimply because of time constraints, because both spouses are working, \nbecause they have children in three different elementary schools--do \nnot have the same kind of opportunities, if you will, to be part of the \nlife of their school as, perhaps, our parents did. So we have to \ndevelop new and different techniques to reach out and involve these \nparents.\n  Then we have parents who themselves have been very unfulfilled by the \neducational process. Their educational experience was deplorable or \nsomething they do not want to recall. Those parents find it difficult, \nin many cases, to be effective teachers of their children because of \nthe apprehension, if you will, about school. We have to reach those \nparents.\n  In the past, we have tried to do this, particularly through the title \nI program. A 2001 study by several academics looked at the title I \nprogram. They found that title I schools have always talked about \nparental involvement. There has been a model to bring parents in as \ncollaborators.\n  In the past, in our reauthorizations, we have tried to stress \nparental involvement. In 1983, we said you have to have an annual \nmeeting in a title I school with the parents. In 1988, we talked about \ninvolving parents in planning and providing more information to \nparents. In 1994, we said districts have to spend at least 1 percent of \ntitle I moneys on parental involvement. That is all well and good, very \nnoble words. But, once again, there was very limited accountability, \nvery limited oversight.\n  As a result, there has been very limited participation by parents, \nparticularly in those difficult areas where disadvantaged students and \ndisadvantaged parents are likely to be.\n  So it is no surprise that when the PTA surveyed the parents of \nAmerica, fully 50 percent said they were inadequately informed about \nwhat is going on in the school. They felt they could not participate in \ntheir school. They felt the school was not user friendly to them, the \nparents.\n  So working with the PTA, and others, we tried to craft legislation \nthat would, once again, in a meaningful way, attempt to involve parents \nin every school in America by adding accountability to title I; not \njust a list of things you have to do, but an insistence that these \nthings be done: Provide parental access to information about their \nchildren's education, make sure there is an active and effective and \nongoing collaboration with schools, require states to disseminate to \nevery school research-based practices that work to actually involve \nparents.\n  We also, when we looked at some of the other programs--such as the \nSafe and Drug Free Schools Program, the technology program, and the \nteacher quality program--insisted there be an\n\n[[Page S13346]]\n\naspect of parental involvement with the idea that parents just don't \nshow up one night a semester for parent-teacher conferences, but they \nare active in planning many aspects of the life of the school. This \nlegislation, I am pleased to say, was significantly incorporated in \nthis conference report. I believe it represents a significant advance \nproviding not just a list of nice things to do, but real accountability \nso these aspects of the parental involvement will, in fact, be done.\n\n  There is another important aspect of this legislation in which I was \nkeenly interested, and that is professional development. We all \nrecognize and we all stand up and say, sincerely and emphatically: \nEvery child deserves a highly skilled, highly motivated teacher. But we \nhave to go beyond the words. We have to make that a fact of life. And \nit is not a fact of life at so many schools.\n  In the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, just in 1998, I \nworked closely with my colleagues and incorporated aspects of \nlegislation I had previously introduced called the TEACH Act, which \nestablished grants to foster partnerships between teaching colleges and \nactual schools in communities.\n  One of the defects of teacher preparation is the fact that sometimes \nit is totally disconnected from the real life of the teacher, that the \nclinical aspect or the practice aspect is just a few weeks in a 4-year \ncurriculum. The TEACH Act is now part of the Higher Education Act. It \nestablishes a relationship between teacher colleges and elementary and \nsecondary schools which, I believe, will provide more realistic \npreparation for teachers.\n  But we have to pay attention not only to the new teachers who are \nentering our schools, but we have to pay attention to all teachers. \nThat means good, solid professional development for the incumbent \nteachers, for those who are teaching today in the classrooms of \nAmerica. That is why I introduced legislation, the Professional \nDevelopment Reform Act, which I am pleased to say is incorporated in \nmany parts of this legislation.\n  There is a broad consensus that good professional development has to \ninvolve sustained intensive activities that focus on deepening \nteachers' knowledge of content, that allow teachers to work \ncollaboratively, that provide opportunities for teachers to practice \nand reflect upon their teaching, that are aligned closely to these new \nstandards, and that all of it is embedded in the daily life and work of \nthe teachers.\n  We all recall some experiences we have had. I recall that once every \nyear there was a teachers institute. We thought it was terrific. We got \nthe day off. I did not know what the teachers did there, but I found \nout later. In most cases, they went to a big hall. They listened to a \nlecturer talk about something that may or may not be interesting to \nthem. They socialized and then went home. That, for many school \nsystems, was professional development. It was clearly inadequate.\n  Professional development has to be based upon content, what that \nteacher is purporting to teach: Math, science, history, and English. \nThey have to know what they are teaching. Sadly, there are lots of \nteachers who do not know that. And we do not force them, through \nprofessional development, to master those details.\n  Then they have to have the opportunity to collaborate. One of the \ngreat problems of elementary and secondary education is the fact that \nso many teachers walk in in the morning, they have a cup of coffee, say \nhello to the rest of the teachers, and that is the last time they have \na conversation with an adult for the rest of the day. At 3:30, they get \nin the car and go on with the rest of their life.\n\n  We have to build into our educational system the opportunity for \nteachers to talk about the craft, the art of teaching. We have to, of \ncourse, make all of this correlated with and focused on the high \nstandards that we insist that our children meet. This is a daunting \ntask.\n  This legislation reflects, in many respects, an emphasis toward \nmoving toward those very challenging aspects of professional \ndevelopment. I would like to have gone further, but we have gone at \nleast, I believe, in the right direction.\n  There are examples of very effective professional development around \nthe country. I have visited Community School District 2 in New York \nCity. It is in Manhattan. It is a school district that is committed to \nprofessional development. They do exactly what all of the experts say. \nThey provide, for example, young teachers the ability to observe \nexemplary senior teachers. They have senior teachers working one on one \nwith other teachers. They have peer networks where teachers can get \ntogether and talk with their peers about the educational process.\n  All of this is exciting. It makes teaching something more than a dull \nexercise of showing up, reciting something to students who are not \nparticularly interested, and then walking out. Too often--in fact, I \nwould argue if it happens anyplace, it is too often--that is the \nexperience.\n  Let me mention one other aside about this notion of collaborative \neffort. One of the interesting things that happened in Rhode Island--we \nwere lucky because we have a State that is committed to educational \nprogress--is that one of our foundations, the Rhode Island Foundation, \nactually gave laptop computers to a significant portion of our teachers \nin the State.\n  You can do that when you have a population of a million people. And \nthe teachers used them, not just to do lesson plans but actually to \ninteract and collaborate with other teachers on challenging questions \nsuch as what to do with a child who continually refuses to be quiet and \nsit down. These are not things you learn in a lecture on the cognitive \nprocesses of schoolchildren but something you need to know to be a good \nteacher. They found it out by simply getting advice from seasoned \nteachers. That is what we have to do. This legislation moves in that \ndirection.\n  There is another aspect, too, that I have been very interested in, \nand I believe it is key to our educational progress. That is to \nrecognize that the school is one of the few places in our society where \nchildren are there for an extended period of time. There is a \nrequirement that they go. But in effect, schools can't succeed as \nislands isolated from the other institutions of life.\n  We talked about parental involvement. That is the first and most \nimportant aspect of education, the parent as teacher. But many children \nhave problems with health care. Many children have mental health \nissues. Many children have problems because of the social problems of \nthe family. If the schools ignore those problems, those children will \ninvariably fail. They have to be cognizant of all the issues that \ninfluence a child.\n  I think it is important to recognize in the school and even have an \norganization in the school that can access multiple services for \nchildren. We could have a great nursing program. We could have great \nmathematical instructions. We could beef up our science laboratories. \nBut if a young child does not have a place to live, or comes in on a \ncold day without a coat and goes home without a coat, chances are we \nare not going to be able to challenge that child to do their best work. \nWe have to recognize that.\n  In fact, as important--and it is very important--as this legislation \nis, we have many other things to do to ensure that every child learns, \nthat no child is left behind. We can start with housing, health care, a \nlong list. We are making progress today, but we would be deluding \nourselves to think we have solved the problems of children in America \nby simply reforming education.\n  It is important in the context of education to have these \ninstitutions and organizations. In Rhode Island, they are called COZs, \nchild opportunity zones. Within the school there is a trained person \nwho can link up a child and the family to social services, childcare, \nhousing programs, all those things that are going to make a difference \nin the life of that child, so when they come to school they will be, as \nwe have said for decades, ready to learn. I hope, indeed, that some of \nthe efforts we have made in this bill will advance that very important \nprinciple.\n  As we began this debate about the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, as we moved through the Senate, several very important issues \nbecame obvious. First, to the extent we quite properly insisted upon \naccountability, we had to recognize that we must design an \naccountability system that is\n\n[[Page S13347]]\n\nfair and flexible. We could have designed a system in which every child \nin America passed. That would be a waste of time, a waste of money. We \ncould have designed a testing system where everyone failed. That would \nbe counterintuitive and foolish. So over the last several months we \nhave been working to try to reach a point where there was enough \nflexibility in the States that they could, in fact, achieve progress. I \nbelieve in the process of debate and discussion, again with the \ntremendous leadership of Senator Kennedy, we have made progress.\n\n  We have a system now that recognizes standards, standards that have \nintegrity, standards that are checked ultimately by a national test, \nbut also that allow the States the flexibility so their good schools \nwill continue to be recognized as good, and schools that are not \nmeeting that standard have an incentive and a direction to move \nforward. We have made that progress.\n  In so many cases, what we are doing is complementing the efforts that \nhave been accomplished in local communities. In my State of Rhode \nIsland, we have had tremendous efforts to reform our schools. In 1997, \nmy legislature passed article 31 which mandates an extensive series of \nevaluations, of school improvement teams, and ultimately, if schools \nfail, giving the State not only the authority but the responsibility to \nstep in and set the schools right.\n  That type of system should not be compromised by a scheme here in \nWashington that basically turned the clock back, put my State back to \nthe starting point and made them run an entirely different race. I \nbelieve, through the efforts of the conferees, we have a situation in \nwhich my State and other States can build on what they have done to \ncreate even a better system. That is one aspect that we confronted as \nwe moved along.\n  The second aspect, the one that is the most troubling, is the fact \nthat all of these important innovations and initiatives that have been \nembraced by this legislation will not be successful if we do not have \nthe funds to give the States and the communities to carry out our \nintent, our wishes and their wishes, which is truly to give every child \nan opportunity and an excellent education.\n  We know we are in a very difficult, precarious situation. The tax cut \nof last spring has set us back immensely in having the extra resources \nor even the resources at all to robustly fund education, to make it the \nkind of national priority this bill calls for. After September 11, it \nis even more difficult. But before September 11, as vice chairman of \nthe Joint Economic Committee, I was pleased to be able to issue a \nreport of the Democratic staff on September 7 that raised very \nseriously the question of whether or not we were going to be in \ndeficits for the foreseeable future because principally of the tax cut. \nThe reality is, we are.\n  The OMB Director declared a few weeks ago that we are looking at \nseveral years of deficits. So that will make it very difficult for this \nCongress to live up to the very challenging standards we set for \nourselves in this legislation. But live up to it we must.\n  The situation here in Washington is difficult. If you go back to the \nStates, it is even more difficult. It has been estimated that the \nStates have already scheduled about $11.3 billion in educational cuts \nto meet their budget crisis. As we are talking about extra money in the \nbillions, that is very encouraging, but it really could be offset \nbefore we even sign this bill by the cuts we see in the States. They \nare taking drastic steps. That $11.3 billion means laying off teachers, \neliminating teacher training, eliminating parental involvement, all the \nthings we say are necessary, all the things about which we are speaking \nwith great pride and purpose. The States are forced today to begin to \ncut those.\n  In Rhode Island, the Board of Governors for elementary and secondary \neducation suggested that the state increase the education budget by 4.4 \npercent. The Governor has told every State agency to cut their budget \nby 6 percent. To his credit, he has said there will be a little extra \nfor education. We won't force them to have the 6-percent cut. But \nnowhere is he prepared to meet the 4.4-percent increase. That is going \nto be multiplied throughout this country. So we are looking now at a \nsituation where we will have to struggle mightily for resources. The \nStates are already cutting their budgets.\n  And so again we can be pleased that this structure of educational \nreform has been completed, but if it is built on a foundation that \nshifts with the winds of deficit, then we are going to be in an awkward \nposition in the months and years ahead. That is why I was so strongly \ncommitted to supporting the efforts of Senator Harkin, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Jeffords, and so many others to fully fund IDEA, to make that \nfunding mandatory.\n  First, it is the right thing to do. Back in the mid-1970s, we \ncommitted ourselves--the Federal Government--to IDEA, to share \nsignificantly with the States the cost of meeting the education needs \nof students with disabilities. We never lived up to that. Year in and \nyear out, we have all said how strongly we believe in IDEA, how much we \nhave to fund it. We relay tales of our school committees and \nsuperintendents, and how they insist that if you do anything at all, \nplease fully fund IDEA. Yet when we had the opportunity to do that in \nthe conference, we blinked, we refused to do that.\n  IDEA seems to be one of those issues where we say wait until next \nyear--but next year never comes. Once again, we have to wait until next \nyear. But the real test of education reform, I believe, will be whether \nor not we do fully fund IDEA next year in our budget and whether we do \nfund these other innovations incorporated in this legislation.\n  Fully funding IDEA is the right thing to do. There are 6 million \nchildren today being served by IDEA. They are in regular classrooms, by \nand large. They are part of the life of the school. They are not \nshunned and excluded as they were in the fifties, sixties. It turns out \nthat the high school graduation rates for children who receive IDEA \ninstruction are much higher than their predecessors'--those young \nAmericans who were pushed aside and urged to leave school or were put \nin special classrooms. It is working, and we have to make it work more.\n  The other aspect about IDEA is, if we had made the spending \nmandatory, we would have freed up significant dollars for other \neducation programs. Now, IDEA will compete with title I and other \nprograms, such as Pell grants, and it will compete with a whole range \nof programs--all of them important, all of them, I suspect, every \nMember of the Senate will stand up and support and say we have to do \nmore. Well, we had the chance to do more, and we failed to do that.\n  I commend Senator Harkin and Senator Jeffords and my colleagues, \nSenators Collins, Roberts, Warner, and Hagel. This was a bipartisan \neffort on the Senate side. The House, unfortunately, did not agree with \nus. But we must attend to this as a first order of business in the next \nsession of this Congress.\n  This conference report, I believe, represents great progress by many \nof us. Accountability has increased and improved. One aspect, which is \nparticularly noteworthy--and I believe it has been mentioned by many \ncolleagues--is the increased targeting of title I. That program was \ndesigned in 1960 to help low-income students, but through the process \nof legislation it has been flattened out so that title I reaches many \nstudents and it is not targeted to the very poor. This legislation \nchanges that and, given the caveat of robust funding, it could be the \nmost significant aspect of this entire legislation. I believe, again, \nthis is something very near and dear to Senator Kennedy's efforts--not \njust this year, but over the lifetime of his service to the country and \nthe Senate. I commend him for that in particular.\n  I am pleased, as I have made clear before, about the library \nprovisions included in the President's literacy program. This \nlegislation is much more sensitive, in many different aspects, to \nparental involvement. Professional development--although it doesn't go \nas far as I would like--sets the right tone, the right direction, and \nis emphasized as a critical aspect of not just development of teachers, \nbut reform of education.\n  We have the concept of child opportunity zones that has been embedded \ninto the legislation. I hope we can build on that and see how that \nworks. I know it works in my State. I hope we can take that notion of \ncoordinating and integrating services for children in the school and \nmake it something that is common in every jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S13348]]\n\n  Bilingual education has been strengthened significantly. There is \nalso good news in the fact that provisions in the other body that would \nhave limited bilingual education to 3 years were stricken. Now it is \nmuch more oriented to serving these children, getting them to master \nEnglish as a critical language, not just here in the United States but \naround the globe, and not arbitrarily saying you have 1, 2, 3 years to \nlearn it. That might be easy for a 5- or 6-year-old coming to this \ncountry, but what about a 14-year-old who grew up in a country without \nthe educational advantages we take for granted? I would find it \ndifficult to become a fluent speaker in another language in 2 or 3 \nyears. I assume that would be the case for others coming here. This \nlegislation does not have an arbitrary limit.\n  The safe and drug-free schools program, once again, incorporates \naspects of parental involvement. Technology grants are here, with \nparticipation by parents as well as teachers and educational \nsupervisors. The accountability provisions have been hard fought over \nmany weeks. It represents a balance between a legitimate and credible \nnational standard, together with local flexibility, ultimately checked \nby the national test, which will see how well the States are doing, \ngiven the opportunity to develop their own tests internally.\n  All of this is very commendable and, in some respects, exciting. But \nI come back to what I have said throughout this presentation: All of \nthis will be interesting but ineffectual without real funding--not just \nat the Federal level, but at the local level; not just for 1 year, but \nfor many years.\n  One of the great experiences of my life was being able to serve as a \nsoldier in the Army. One of the great transformations of a lifetime was \nthe transformation of our military. One of the key aspects was their \nrecognition that you had to train the trainers--better professional \ndevelopment. It was done with the knowledge that you had to have real \nresources to do it. You had to commit real resources. We did that.\n  Today we are seeing amply demonstrated the wisdom of increased \nprofessional development, high standards of accountability. But \nresources go along with it.\n  I will conclude by simply saying that one aspect of this legislation \nthat has received a great deal of notoriety has been the fact that \nevery child in America, beginning in 2005, will have to be tested from \ngrades 3 through 8. I am confident that the children of America will \npass those tests--if this Senate passes the test it faces next year: \nFund education aggressively--IDEA and title I. If we pass our test, I \nhave no doubt the children of America will pass their test. If we fail, \nhow can we blame them?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend again, my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, for his excellent presentation in highlighting a \nnumber of the very important provisions included in the bill in which \nhe was particularly interested. I thank him also for emphasizing the \nimportance of responsible action and investment in education by the \nStates, and by the Federal Government.\n  As I mentioned earlier in the day, we are putting a great deal of \nresponsibility on children and youth to succeed academically. We are \nputting enormous responsibilities on the schools to teach effectively, \nand we are giving a great deal of information to the parents so that \nthey can be responsive and effective advocates for their children. All \nof these ideas and reforms are set forth in this legislation. But the \ningredient that will make the real difference, and ensure that all of \nthis works, is funding--additional help and assistance State \nlegislatures and additional help from this institution. We are prepared \nto make that case in the future, as we have tried to do so often this \npast year, and in the most recent past with some success.\n  Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues on both sides for their \ncomments. A number of colleagues came and talked about the different \nparts of the legislation that they were most involved in, and we have a \nnumber of others who are looking forward to making comments tomorrow. I \nthink there is requested time for probably 12 to 14 colleagues on our \nside. I know a similar number on the other side will have a short \ntimeframe. We are coming in at 9:30 and intend to vote at noontime.\n  In summary--and I will do this very quickly--I think if someone can \nthink about these elements together, I think they come to the \nrealization that each of these reforms is important, but taken \ntogether, they give us something that is very special in this \nlegislation, reforms that are eminently worthwhile.\n  We were talking about State standards. We will have additional \ndiscussion on the issue of standards and assessment tomorrow, but I \nwould like to highlight these elements in this legislation and make a \nbrief comment before we adjourn this evening.\n  In this legislation, we talk about assessments and States developing \ncontent standards--what the educators, parents, and those involved in \neducational policy think a child should know at a grade level. We then \nhighlight curriculum development, and invest in a well-trained teacher \nfor each classroom. After reforms are in place, high-quality \nassessments help us identify what a child does not know so that we may \nassist that child to achieve the knowledge he or she needs to succeed.\n  That is our desire, and we are doing it with assessments that are not \noff-the-shelf tests but a thoughtful way of testing not only what the \nchild has actually learned but also how they have learned to think.\n  I will mention briefly several aspects of these assessments. They \nmust be valid and reliable. They must be aligned to academic standards. \nThe scores must be disaggregated by race and ethnicity, English-\nproficiency status, migrant status, students with disabilities, and \neconomically disadvantaged students so that we know that all children \nare learning. And so that we can identify who is falling behind, and \nprovide additional help and attention to such children.\n  Gone are the days where students fall through the cracks. Children \nwill not fail with no attention to their failure in a given classroom. \nWe will know. And we will be held accountable. This is incredibly \nimportant.\n  We are going to insist the tests meet high standards of validity and \nreliability, and that they are developed consistent with professional \nand technical standards. There must be multiple measures within the \ntest multiple test items, varying formats, and multiple tests to assess \nthe highest order of understanding and thinking; not just memorizing, \nbut critical thinking and true problem solving. That is a key element. \nAll educators understand that developing those skills is the key to \nstudent success.\n  Under this bill, Itemized score analyses of test results will be \nprepared and reported to school districts and schools to address \nspecific academic needs so districts will know if their children are \nfalling behind, and why. All schools and school districts, for the \nfirst time, will have the data to know. We will be able to analyze not \nonly a particular school but also an entire school district, which is \nvery important.\n  We have individual diagnostic reports that will be provided to \nteachers, parents, and principals to provide information on student \nachievement and help address the specific academic needs of the \nstudents.\n  Students with disabilities will be provided reasonable adaptations \nand accommodations for inclusion in State assessments. If a child needs \nadditional time because of a disability, they will receive the time \nthey need. That will be worked out by teachers and by professionals so \nparents will not be tormented with saying: My child could have done all \nright if they had a little more time. States vary in the type of \naccommodations they provide to students with special needs. But some \nStates have structured a system that works very well. We have taken the \nsuccess of those States and worked closely to model this legislation to \nensure that all students with special needs--students with disabilities \nand students with limited English proficiency--are provided the \naccommodations they need to succeed. I believe that we will make a \nmajor difference in the evaluation of such students.\n\n  States must also identify languages other than English that are \nspoken by\n\n[[Page S13349]]\n\nEnglish language learners, and identify the need for testing such \nstudents in their native language. This is of the utmost importance, \nbecause we have seen in States such as Colorado that, at an early point \nin their academic career, some English language learners perform better \non assessments in their native language than they do in English. \nUltimately, and at the appropriate time, all students should be \nassessed on their reading skills in English. But in the meantime, \nStates must make every effort to develop native language assessments. \nThese are the kinds of details we have gone into in this area and why \nwe think it will make an important difference in educational \nenhancement.\n  I will quickly summarize in these final moments before the Senate \ngoes in recess for the evening. We have basically set goals to achieve \nacademic proficiency for all children in this country within 12 years. \nI said on a number of occasions those great words of H. L. Mencken: For \nevery complex problem, there is a simple, easy answer, and it is wrong. \nWe understand it is complex, and it is going to take us some time. We \nset the goal for 12 years for proficiency for all children, and we are \ngoing to need the resources to do it. We are setting the mark down now \nthat we are starting down that road.\n  We have increased targeting of the resources, as we explained \nearlier, both in rural areas and in urban areas; a qualified teacher in \nevery classroom, and professional development to continue to support \ntheir professional growth. These are key aspects of ensuring \nopportunity for our children. I talked about these reforms earlier \ntoday.\n  We are allowing States to continue to reduce class sizes. There will \nbe the resources to do that, not as broad as I would like, but there \nwill be resources.\n  We expand afterschool opportunities. There will still be a lot of \nchildren who will not be able to participate because we are not giving \nthat enough support, but it is in the bill.\n  We promote safe and drug-free schools.\n  We expand the support for limited English proficient students. I was \nreminded of the success of bilingual education, listening to my \ncolleague from New Hampshire earlier, who is not here now, as he spoke \nabout the failure of bilingual education programs. Not all bilingual \neducation programs are successful. However, many are. I know of some \nschool districts where they are teaching children several days a week \nin English, and other days in Spanish. The students receive dual \nimmersion in those two languages. The limited English proficient \nstudents learn in their native language and in English. And at the end \nof the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades, these children have higher \nlevels of literacy than that have only learned in one language. There \nare successes. Not all of them are successful, but there are successes, \nand this legislation builds on those programs that have been \nsuccessful.\n  Since 1995, the two-way bilingual education programs introduced in a \nnumber of the elementary schools in the St. John's Valley in the State \nof Maine have taken substantial steps to improve student achievement. \nThe French-English program is an additive bilingual program, meaning \nthat all students learn a second language without compromising their \nfirst language. This is the only program of its kind in Maine.\n  The St. John's Valley district, through support from a federal \nbilingual education grant, supported costs for teaching training, \nmaterials, and administrative costs between 1995 and 2000. In 1997, \nstudents from the immersion program at the second grade out-performed \nnon-immersion students on the California Test of Basic Skills in \nreading, vocabulary, and language mechanics. The trend continued in \n1998 with students in the bilingual education program placing 93rd in \nthe national percentile in reading and math on that test. Clearly, \nthere are programs that work, and they work well.\n  The additional commitment to reading and early reading in this bill \nis enormously important. Parental involvement, resources for the \nconstruction of charter schools, expansion of school libraries, \nassistance for children's mental health and emotional needs--this is \nsomething which is of enormous importance. Supportive resources for \nstruggling schools, accountability for results, protecting civil rights \nof all children--each reform is eminently worthwhile.\n  Taken together, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This \nconference report deserves to receive an overwhelming vote in the \nSenate. I look forward to that tomorrow.\n  If there is no one further who desires to speak, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the past few weeks, the American \npeople have learned more than they thought they would ever want to know \nabout the ancient scourge of anthrax. From reading the morning \nnewspaper, and watching the nightly news, we have learned much about \nwhat anthrax is, how it infects, the dangers it poses, and ways to \ntreat it.\n  But there was been very little attention given to the history of this \ndreaded and deadly disease that is on everyone's mind. From where did \nit come? What has been its impact on the world?\n  Let me begin by pointing out that the disease derives its name from \nanthracis, the Latin transliteration of the Greek word for coal, and \nthe name probably stems from the black scab-like crust that the anthrax \nlesion develops. But through the ages, anthrax has been called by a \nvariety of names. In Russia, cutaneous anthrax--infection through the \nskin--has also been called ``Siberian ulcers'' because of the \nprevalence of the disease in that region. Inhalation anthrax has been \ncalled ``wool sorters'' disease because it comes most commonly from \ninhalation of spore-containing dust produced when animal hair or hides \nare handled. A colloquial German term for anthrax is ``ragpicker's \ndisease.''\n  The exact origins of anthrax and the time of its arrival upon Earth \nare unknown. But, it is commonly accepted that anthrax has been killing \nanimals, and humans too, for thousands of years, perhaps as much as \n10,000 years, dating back to the beginnings of animal domestication. It \nis certainly a\n\n[[Page S13350]]\n\npestilence as old as pastoralism and the origins of civilization. It is \nbelieved that man probably became aware of anthrax when he turned from \nhunting to a life of farming and animal husbandry.\n  The first recorded appearance of anthrax can be found in the Bible, \nwhere it appears that God may have used anthrax to punish the Pharaoh \nfor holding the ancient Hebrews in bondage. The fifth Egyptian plague \nthat affected livestock, and the sixth plague, known as the plague of \nboils, could well have been anthrax. These plagues are depicted in the \nBook of Exodus which reads: ``Behold thy hand shall be upon thy fields \nand a very grievous murrain upon thy horses, and asses, and camels and \noxen, and sheep.'' Murrain, according to the dictionary, is a group of \ncattle diseases that includes anthrax.\n  Anthrax may well have been Apollo's ``burning wind of plague'' that \nbegins Homer's ``Iliad,'' a plague that attacked ``pack animals first, \nand dogs, but soldiers too.'' Ancient Greek physicians, Hippocrates and \nGalen, described skin lesions that were probably those of anthrax. Some \nmedical historians believe that the ``plague of Athens,'' 430-427 B.C. \nas recorded in Thucydides's ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' was \nprobably anthrax. Thucydides describes symptoms of fever, bleeding, and \n``small pustules and ulcers,'' all consistent with a severe form of the \nanthrax infection.\n  In ancient Rome, Virgil's ``Georgics'' laments the shortage of \nanimals caused by what appears to have been anthrax: ``Now in droves \nshe deals out death, and in the very stalls, piles up the bodies, \nrotting with putrid foulness.''\n  For the next 2,000 years, animal and human anthrax ravaged Europe and \nAsia. At periodic intervals, plagues of anthrax swept across huge \ntracts of land killing massive numbers of livestock and people. In \n1613, for example, 60,000 persons in southern Europe died of anthrax.\n  The disease was first recognized in North America during the colonial \ndays. In Santo Domingo in 1770, about 15,000 people are reported to \nhave died from intestinal anthrax contracted by eating diseased meat. \nThe first recorded human case of anthrax in the United States occurred \nin Philadelphia in 1834.\n\n  In the late 19th century, anthrax contributed to two medical \nbreakthroughs. The first came in 1876 when the German physician Robert \nKoch confirmed the bacterial origins of anthrax. Koch grew the organism \nbacillus anthracis in pure culture. He demonstrated its ability to form \nendospores, and produced experimental anthrax by injecting it into \nanimals. This was the first microorganism ever specifically linked to a \ndisease and demonstrated that germs cause disease.\n  Just 5 years later, in 1881, anthrax again contributed to medical \nhistory when the legendary French chemist, Louis Pasteur, produced a \nvaccine that helped prevent anthrax infection in animals. This made \nanthrax the first disease to be prevented by a vaccine.\n  Inspired by Pasteur's contributions to control anthrax in animals, in \n1895, an Italian investigator named Achille Sclavo developed a serum \nfor the treatment of anthrax in humans. Since then, the treatment of \nhuman anthrax has been further refined and the introduction of a \nsuccession of drugs, including penicillin, tetracycline, and, I must \nsay, Cipro.\n  Throughout the 20th century, despite all the progress that had been \nmade in identifying and fighting the disease, naturally occurring \nanthrax has continued to take a heavy and widespread toll on the \nworld's population, both animal and human. Cases of livestock being \ndevastated by anthrax were reported every year throughout the world, \nwith Spain, Albania, Italy, Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Russia \nsuffering significant outbreaks on a regular basis. In 1945, an anthrax \noutbreak in Iran killed more than a million sheep. In the United \nStates, an outbreak of anthrax in Kansas and Oklahoma in 1957 killed \n1,500 head of cattle, numerous pigs, horses, and sheep.\n  In the United States, there have also been scattered, fatal cases of \ninhalation anthrax. Between 1930 and 1960, there was a football player \nwho may have contracted the disease from playing-field soil, a San \nFrancisco woman who beat bongo drums made of infected skin, a \nconstruction worker who handled contaminated felt, and several \ngardeners whose infections were traced to contaminated bone meal \nfertilizer. In Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1957, inhalation anthrax \nkilled four woolen-mill workers. In the same year, a man and a woman \nliving near a Philadelphia tannery also died of inhalation anthrax.\n  The most deadly human anthrax epidemic in the 20th century occurred \nin Zimbabwe between 1979 and 1985. More than 10,000 people were \ninfected, and at least 182 cases were fatal.\n  But, it was in the 20th century that the history of anthrax took on \nanother lethal dimension--anthrax became a weapon of war.\n  Biological warfare, of course, was not novel to the 20th century. The \nRomans fouled water supplies of their enemies by dumping the rotting \ncorpses of people and animals into the wells of their enemies. The \nMongols catapulted the cadavers of persons who had succumbed to bubonic \nplague inside the town walls of cities they had besieged. The British, \nand later white Americans, destroyed Indian tribes by giving them \ndisease-infected clothing.\n  But it was in the 20th century that mankind started developing, \nexperimenting with, and then deploying anthrax as a weapon of war.\n  World War I is well remembered for introducing poison gas into \nwarfare. But, during that war, Germany also established a large \nbiological weapons program that involved anthrax. They infected \nlivestock exports, bound for Russia and Allied countries, with the \ndisease. In Norway, police arrested German agents carrying vials of \nanthrax bacteria with which the agents intended to infect reindeer \nbeing used to carry supplies to the Allied forces in Europe. In the \nUnited States, German agents were reported to have injected horses, \nmules, and cattle with anthrax.\n  International revulsion at the horrors of World War I included a \nrevulsion against chemical and biological weapons, and this led to the \nGeneva Protocol of 1925. This treaty, which 28 nations signed, \nprohibited the use of both chemical and biological weapons in war.\n  The high hopes for this treaty were never achieved because it only \nbanned the use of biological weapons in war, and did not expressly \nforbid their production and development. Furthermore, several nations, \nincluding the United States, reserved the right to use biological \nweapons in reprisal if first used against them--thus implicitly \nmaintaining the right to develop and stockpile the weapons.\n  The failure of the treaty was revealed in the early stages of World \nWar II, when imperial Japan began a massive, deadly biological warfare \nprogram in Manchuria, the infamous ``Unit 731,'' which included the \ndevelopment and use of anthrax. Japanese scientists conducted \nexperiments on Chinese prisoners, while the Japanese military targeted \nboth the Chinese military and civilians as well as Manchurian civilians \nwith anthrax weapons, killing thousands.\n  There is no indication that Nazi Germany had any investment in \nbiological weapons capability. According to Jeanne Guillemin, who has \nresearched and written extensively on anthrax, a directive from German \ndictator Adolph Hitler forbade research on offensive biological \nweapons. However, late in the war, Guillemin writes, it appears that \nsome of Hitler's subordinates, notably Reich Marshal Herman Goring, \nbegan supporting research on biological weapons at a small secret \nfacility in Poland, but the war ended before the effort produced any \nresults.\n  Meanwhile, Allied governments had stepped up full scale anthrax-based \nbiological warfare programs. In 1942, the British military experimented \nwith explosives testing involving anthrax spores on an island just off \nthe coast of Scotland. It would take the British 36 years, 280 tons of \nformaldehyde, and 2000 tons of seawater to decontaminate the island.\n  In 1943, the United States began developing anthrax weapons. By the \nnext year, 1944, American engineers, at what is now Fort Detrick, MD, \nhad produced 5,000 anthrax bombs for use by the Allied forces, but they \nwere never deployed.\n  After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged \nnot only in a full-scale, nuclear arms race, but also in a biological \nweapons race as well. At times, the cost was high, in\n\n[[Page S13351]]\n\nhuman as well as financial terms. In 1951, for example, two Fort \nDetrick employees died after exposure to anthrax. Neither country, \nhowever, was deterred. The cold war was underway and so was the effort \nto develop deadly weaponry. Therefore, both countries continued \nstockpiling germs as well as nukes.\n  In 1969, President Richard Nixon had finally had enough. After \nreviewing the extensive U.S. investment in offensive biological \nweapons, he declared: ``Mankind already carries in its own hands too \nmany of the seeds of its own destruction.'' He terminated the American \noffensive biological weapons program and began championing a British \nproposal that called for an international treaty to ban biological \nweapons, an effort that resulted in the Biological Weapons and Toxins \nConvention and Treaty of 1972. Since then, 140 states have signed the \ntreaty agreeing to halt research directed at the offensive use of \nbiological weapons.\n\n  The high hopes for this treaty were smashed when both the United \nStates and Soviet Union interpreted the treaty in such a way as to \nallow ongoing research on more than 200 projects. The failure of the \ntreaty was vividly and tragically demonstrated in April, 1979, when an \nanthrax outbreak at a military microbiology facility in the Soviet \nUnion killed about 70 people.\n  The end of the cold war failed to end the threat of biological \nweapons. Because they are deadly, cost-effective weapons to produce--a \nmajor biological weapons program requires only about $10,000 worth of \nequipment and a 16x16 square-foot room--biological weapons became a \nweapon of choice for international terrorists. Domestic as well as \nforeign terrorist organizations have been caught attempting to unleash \nanthrax upon innocent civilians. In the 1990s, the Japanese terrorist \ncult that attacked the Tokyo subway system with sarin gas, also \nreleased anthrax on Tokyo near the imperial palace, the legislature, \nand a foreign embassy. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n  What these terrorist groups or nations could not produce themselves, \nAmerican companies have been ready to provide.\n  According to a 1994 Senate report, private American suppliers, \nlicensed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, exported biological and \nchemical materials to Iraq from 1985 through 1989. Newsday reported \nthat one American company alone made 70 shipments of the anthrax-\ncausing germs and other pathogenic agents to Iraq in the 1980s.\n  Mr. President, I find it unfortunately ironic that American companies \nwere supplying anthrax to a nation with which, just a few years later, \nwe were at war, thus forcing American soldiers to face the prospects of \nencountering those same germs on the battlefield. I find it tragically \nironic that American companies were selling anthrax to a country that \nthe State Department now includes on its lists of states that sponsor \nterrorism--a nation that may now be participating in anthrax attacks \nupon the United States.\n  I realize that Iraq had been at war with Iran, and Iran was our \nbigger enemy at the time. Therefore, it may have served our military \nand political interests to have been shipping supplies of anthrax to \nIraq. But, I have to ask, shouldn't we have been a little more careful \nabout which countries we supplied with such potentially deadly weapons? \nWe realized the danger in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Why \nshouldn't we have been as vigilant with biological weapons? We may now \nbe paying the price for our negligence!\n  I also realize that this is hindsight, and, as they say, hindsight is \ntwenty-twenty. The worst private's hindsight, they say, is better than \nthe best general's foresight.\n  We have recently had foresight--warnings that have been ignored.\n  A short time ago, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st \nCentury, referred to as the Hart-Rudman Commission, pointed out:\n\n     biological weapons are the most likely choice of means for \n     disaffected states and groups of the 21st century.\n\n  Two years ago, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, CIA Director George Tenet pointed out:\n\n       There are a number of terrorist groups seeking to develop \n     or acquire biological and chemical weapons capabilities. Some \n     such groups--like Usama bin Ladin's--have international \n     networks, adding to uncertainty and the danger of a surprise \n     attack.\n\n  Last April, the State Department, in its ``Patterns of Global \nTerrorism,'' pointed out:\n\n       Most terrorists continue to rely on conventional tactics . \n     . . but some terrorists--such as Usama bin Laden and his \n     associates--continue to seek chemical, biological, \n     radiological, and nuclear capabilities.\n\n  There were plenty of warnings that an archenemy of the United States, \nan archenemy determined to kill as many Americans as he could, could \nwell unleash this ancient scourge upon America.\n  Who among us could have truly comprehended beforehand the horror of \nSeptember 11? It is difficult enough to understand even after the fact.\n  But if history teaches us anything, it is that we should never \nunderestimate the enduring power of evil. No science fiction writer \never wrote of anything as horrible as the Nazi Holocaust. It took an \nevil madman and his fanatical followers to make it a reality.\n  Now we are faced with another madman and his fanatical followers. We \ncannot allow ourselves to ever again underestimate him or others like \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13351-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13351-S13352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ATTACK ON HAITIAN NATIONAL PALACE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment--I see my \ncolleague waiting to speak, and I ask him if he will indulge me 5 more \nminutes--to talk about something that happened very early this morning \nin this hemisphere that I think does, in fact, affect all of us in this \ncountry.\n  Today we are faced with a very grave situation in Haiti. Early this \nmorning, armed gunmen stormed the National Palace in Haiti apparently \nin an attempted coup. While the Haitian police have apparently regained \ncontrol of the building, the violence in Port-au-Prince seems to have \njust begun.\n  In apparent retaliation for the palace attack, hundreds of President \nAristide's supporters have surrounded the palace wielding machetes and \nsticks. Recent reports also indicate that supporters have torched the \nheadquarters of the Convergence opposition alliance, as well as other \nheadquarter buildings of the 15-party alliance.\n  It is also my understanding homes of opposition leaders have now come \nunder attack.\n  Now, more than ever, it is essential that President Aristide call for \npeace and push for domestic order. Continued violence and retribution \nwill do nothing but cause further instability and upheaval. Candidly, I \nfear that Haiti may be ready to implode. President Aristide has an \nobligation to take his immense popularity and use that popularity to \ntalk directly to the people of his country and make it clear to them \nand his supporters that taking revenge on people who they think may \nhave been involved in the coup or taking revenge on the parties that \noppose President Aristide is not in the best interests of Haiti. He has \nan obligation to do that, and I call upon him to do that and to help \nstop the violence.\n  As my colleagues well know, Haiti's political system has been in \nturmoil for quite some time. The most recent crisis stems from last \nyear's contested elections. After 17 visits to the country by the \nmediator appointed by the Organization of American States, there has \nbeen no agreement yet reached.\n  Both the Haitian Government and the opposition coalition continue to \navoid a compromise. Both the opposition parties and the President of \nHaiti have an obligation to go further than they have gone to try to \nwork out their differences. They need to do that for the benefit of the \nimpoverished people of Haiti. Ultimately, it is the Haitian people who \nsuffer from this continued dispute.\n  Today we are faced with a country of about 8 million people who grow \nmore and more impoverished, if that is possible, with each passing day. \nHaiti is already by far the poorest country in the hemisphere. We are \nfaced with a country whose poverty and instability continue to deepen.\n  This despair has erupted into violence, violence that threatens the \nvery stability of the Aristide government. That is why it is especially \nimportant Mr. Aristide and the Haitian Government show leadership and \npush for order in Port-au-Prince.\n  I urge Mr. Aristide not to condone further violence or retribution. I \nalso\n\n[[Page S13352]]\n\nurge anyone who is trying to stage a coup to respect the popularly \nelected Government of Haiti.\n  I also urge Mr. Aristide to move forward with OAS efforts to bring an \nend to Haiti's continued political crisis and bring about positive \nchange. Similarly, I encourage the opposition coalition and its \nfollowers to show restraint and work toward a peaceful solution.\n  I conclude by saying the United States continues to be a friend to \nthe Haitian people. At present, there are no holds on bilateral and \nU.S. humanitarian assistance to the Haitian people and we are, in fact, \nproviding over $55 million this year alone. There is, however, other \nmoney that is being withheld. The American Development Bank, for \nexample, this money will continue to be withheld until there is a \npolitical settlement in Haiti, a settlement that must take place. Until \nthe Haitian Government calls for an end to violence, including today's \nretribution, and distances itself from the kidnappings, political \nkillings, and corruption, then innocent Haitian people will continue to \nsuffer.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me to proceed. I have spoken many \ntimes about the situation in Haiti. I will continue to do so. I am \nplanning to actually travel to Haiti next month. This is a situation \nthat ultimately is of grave concern to the United States, but \nultimately we must realize, as the people of Haiti and this Government \nmust realize, the future of Haiti is in their hands, not in ours. \nSettling the political disputes, restoring the peace, is in the hands \nof the Haitians. We call upon them to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13352-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CUBA WADLINGTON, JR.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay respect to \na great man who was also a great builder: a builder of pipelines, a \nbuilder of communities and a builder of dreams. Cuba Wadlington, Jr., \npresident of Williams Gas Pipeline, died on Sunday, December 9, in \nTulsa, OK. He was the quintessential pipeline executive. Over the last \ntwo decades, there was no one more driven to conceive and build \ninterstate natural gas pipeline projects. The Kern River pipeline, his \nfirst, was the longest pipeline built in the 1990's and was the first \ninterstate pipeline to be built into California. His vision also \nproduced Gulfstream pipeline, the first line to connect Alabama and \nFlorida by laying pipe on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. These \nprojects are a part of the 28,000 miles gas pipeline system that is \nWilliams'. Those who know Cuba also know that he had a passion for \nAlaska and his early and current work were focused on building a \npipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the lower 48 States.\n  However, Cuba had more than just a passion to bring new sources of \ngas supply to new customers in new States. He had compassion to build \nup people and the communities in which they lived. Most recently, he \nworked to raise $30 million for the United Way. A passionate golfer, \nCuba was seen nationwide as he appeared in a television commercial with \nTiger Woods championing the Woods Foundation through the Williams World \nChallenge, a PGA golf tournament raising money for children. He was \nalso the chairman-elect of the United Way of America and on the boards \nof Up with People International, the Tulsa Philharmonic Society, the \nNature Conservancy, the March of Dimes and on the Executive Committee \nof the Indian Nations Council of the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Beyond communities and children, Cuba was also a champion of his \nemployees. He was a leader in promoting diversity of ideas, cultures \nand backgrounds. He worked within Williams on its workforce initiatives \nand on opportunities to attract and advance minority talent.\n  Cuba often stated his belief that ``to be a true leader you must have \na vision for the future and be ruthlessly committed and focused on \nmaking that vision a reality. True leaders have the capacity to take a \ndiverse group of employees from all levels and deploy strategies that \noptimize their capabilities. Leaders do not surround themselves with \npeople in their own image, instead they surround themselves with a \ndiverse and highly talented workforce.'' I find these great words to \nlive by, from an outstanding leader whose many contributions will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Cuba was born in Arkansas, held degrees from Washington University \nand St. Louis University and served his country in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. His service with Williams spanned 22 years. Our thoughts and \nprayers go out to his wife Ann, their two children and their three \ngrandchildren. His positive contribution to numerous employees, \ncountless friends and all Oklahomans is greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13352-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13352-S13354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the impact of \nour existing energy policies on America's environment and public \nhealth.\n  Energy touches every aspect of our lives, from the fuels that heat \nour homes and businesses, to the electricity that powers our lights, to \nthe electricity that powers our lights, to the gasoline that runs our \ncars, airplanes and other forms of transportation.\n  Unfortunately, our current energy use comes at a price.\n  We are heavily dependent on oil imported from politically unstable \nareas of the world. Vehicle emissions are one of the major air \npollutants, yet our vehicle fuel efficiency standards have been at a \nvirtual standstill for more than a decade, and we have made very little \nmovement toward real use of alternative, nonpetroleum fueled vehicles.\n  Emissions from our Nation's power plants degrade air quality, pollute \nour water, and contribute a whopping 40 percent of our national carbon \ndioxide emissions, the main cause of global warming. We in the \nNortheast live downwind from virtually the entire Nation. Pollution \nfrom many of the Nation's most industrialized regions makes its way to \nmy State, bringing acid rain that is destroying Vermont's forests and \nlakes, and mercury that is contaminating our fish. Regional haze \nsignificantly reduces visibility in the Northeast, diminishing views in \nthe Green Mountains and across our beautiful Lake Champlain, and \naffecting other of our most scenic natural areas.\n  So I have a very personal interest in how energy is used and \ndeveloped in this country.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I also \nhave a very strong interest in how energy use affects our national air \nquality, water quality, and wildlife. I am concerned about emissions \nthat cause global warming, and that harm our natural environment and \nthe health of our children, our seniors and those who suffer from \nrespiratory diseases.\n  We must also manage to have affordable energy without having to \ndestroy pristine natural areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  Nuclear energy is also an important component of our energy mix. We \nmust find ways to deal with the environmental and public health risks \nassociated with production, storage and disposal of nuclear energy. We \nmust also thoroughly and quickly address facility security, an issue of \ncompelling concern for nuclear as well as chemical plants following the \nattacks of September 11.\n  As chairman of the Senate EPW Committee, I have held numerous \nhearings on these issues. I have also introduced legislation that would \nmandate strict emissions standards and create incentives for the use of \nclean, alternative power. I have introduced legislation that would \nprovide tax incentives to support alternative fuel and new technology \nvehicles. And I have introduced legislation to promote alternative \nenergy sources through the use of renewable energy trading credits, \nthrough the establishment of matching funds to States to promote energy \nefficiency programs and through net metering which gives consumers \ncredit for their own production of solar or wind energy.\n  I will continue to review emissions from the electricity and \ntransportation sectors and related air, water and human health concerns \nin the EPW Committee in the upcoming session.\n  I wish to express my strong commitment to continuing to work with \nSenator Daschle and Senator Bingaman on legislation to advance our \nnational energy policy in the right direction. I congratulate them on \nintroduction of\n\n[[Page S13353]]\n\nS. 1766, the Energy Policy Act of 2001. This comprehensive energy \npackage sends a strong message about our need to achieve energy \nefficiency, and to diversify into clean, domestically produced \nrenewable energy.\n  I applaud my colleagues for stepping forward on these issues. It is \nimperative that we create a national energy policy that will provide \nadequate and affordable energy supplies, but will leave a heritage of \nclean air, clean water and pristine wild places, while also reducing \nharmful carbon emissions that destabilize our global climate. Senators \nDaschle and Bingaman and their staffs have put in long hours to make \nthis a consensus bill, and I commend them for their leadership on these \ncomplex issues.\n  Certainly there is much to support in the Daschle/Bingaman \nlegislation.\n  I thank them for including a modified version of S. 950, the Federal \nReformulated Fuels Act, a bill that was approved by the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee earlier this year. That \ninclusion should help reduce MTBE contamination of water supplies and \nenhance fuel suppliers' flexibility in meeting market demand. That part \nof the bill also includes a provision to grow the renewables share of \nthe transportation fuels market. That benefits the environment and \nreduces our petroleum dependency.\n  I am glad to see provisions in the Daschle/Bingaman bill allowing \nthose who generate wind, solar and other clean renewable energies to \nconnect to the energy grid, and to receive credit for their renewables \ngeneration through net metering. These provisions are essential for \nallowing entry of renewable technologies into the market. While some \nissues in these provisions still need to be worked out, I strongly \nsupport addressing them in comprehensive energy legislation.\n  I also support the bill's provisions on efficiency standards for \nhomes, schools and public buildings, as well as the efficiency \nstandards for appliances and other consumer and commercial products.\n  I support the provisions that fund additional research and \ndevelopment for expanding our energy efficiency technologies, for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, and for promoting renewable energy.\n  Having long been a champion of energy assistance to low-income \nfamilies, I applaud the provisions which increase funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Programs, LIHEAP, the Weatherization \nAssistance Program and the State Energy Programs. Price spikes in home \nheating fuels hit low-income consumers the hardest. We should give \nstrong support to these programs which help families pay their bills, \nand which address the underlying energy efficiency problems associated \nwith high energy costs such as better airsealing, insulation, and \nfurnace and cooling replacements.\n  The Daschle/Bingaman legislation also sets us on a path to seriously \naddress global climate change. The bill directs the development of a \ncomprehensive energy research and development strategy to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. it incorporates a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution urging the administration to re-engage constructively on \ninternational negotiations on climate change. And, the legislation \ncreates a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reporting and registry \nsystem.\n  For all its good provisions, however, the bill has several serious \nshortcomings. These shortcomings must be addressed if we are to meet \nour obligation for a clean, effective and responsible energy policy.\n  The renewable energy portfolio standard in the bill falls well below \nwhat is technologically achievable. In so doing, it fails to capitalize \non the very realistic goal of significantly diversifying our energy \nsupply with clean, domestic resources.\n  Consistent with my longstanding interest in renewable energy, in \nAugust of this year I introduced S. 1333, which sets a renewable \nportfolio standard, or RPS, of 20 percent by the year 2020.\n  An RPS is a market-based mechanism that uses tradable ``renewable \nenergy credits'' to enable utilities to gradually increase the \npercentage of electricity produced from renewables such as wind, \nbiomass, geothermal and solar energy. Twelve States, including Texas, \nhave successfully enacted RPS requirements.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration \nestimates that an RPS providing 20 percent of U.S. electricity from \nwind, solar, geothermal and biomass energy by 2020 would raise consumer \nelectricity prices by only 0.7 percent in 2010, and by 2020, total \nconsumer electric bills would actually be declining with an RPS. Yet, \nthe Daschle/Bingaman bill imposes a requirement of only 10 percent by \n2020.\n  I note that even this 10 percent is a vast improvement over existing \nproposals. The administration to date has refused to endorse any RPS, \ndespite successful introduction of an RPS in Texas and other States. HR \n4, the House-passed energy bill, contains no RPS. Instead, HR 4 directs \napproximately $30 billion in taxpayer subsidies to traditional oil, gas \nand coal production. This is both unwise and unacceptable.\n  It is essential that this Congress reverse the trend of overreliance \non fossil fuels, a trend that weakens our national security and limits \neconomic and technological opportunities in the energy and commercial \nsectors. Like most of my colleagues, I too believe we must decrease our \ndangerous addiction to foreign oil. However, this will not be \naccomplished by spending billions of dollars on subsidies to promote \nthe status quo. In a world where the U.S. is 56-percent dependent upon \nforeign imports, but holds only 3 percent of the oil reserves, we are \nfoolish at best to undervalue emerging renewable technologies. I will \ncontinue to work in the upcoming session with my colleagues and the \nadministration to raise our commitment to wind, solar and other clean \nand domestically produced renewable energy by enacting a strong \nrenewable portfolio standard.\n  I am encouraged by provisions in S. 1731, the farm bill being \nconsidered on the floor this week, that will provide mandatory spending \nto promote the expanded use and production of renewable energy in the \nagricultural sector.\n  The bill provides grants to farmers, ranchers and small businesses to \nconvert biomass into fuels, chemicals and other products. It also \nfinances the purchase of renewable energy technologies such as windmill \nturbines. It provides specific financial aid to rural electric coops \nand utilities to aid in the development of renewable energy, and \nrequires Federal agencies to purchase biobased products.\n  These are types of creative measures needed to strengthen renewable \nenergy in this country.\n  Comprehensive energy legislation must also address global climate \nchange. Fossil fuel combustion accounts for more than 85 percent of \nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\n  While the Daschle/Bingaman bill does have many sound provisions \naddressing global climate change, I am deeply concerned that \nadministration of the greenhouse gas database is not placed with the \nEPA. EPA is clearly the agency most qualified and appropriate to run \nthis program. No other agency has the experience with air emissions \ndata or the capability to run such a program more effectively. The \nAgency already collects detailed carbon dioxide emissions information \nfrom the utility sector, and leads the Federal agencies in preparation \nof the national inventory, pursuant to the Global Climate Protection \nAct of 1987 and other authorities. Placing this responsibility \nelsewhere in the Federal bureaucracy seems duplicative and illogical.\n\n  The Daschle/Bingaman Energy Policy Act of 2001 also leaves out \nseveral key provisions which are essential to a balanced energy policy. \nThese include a public benefits trust fund, tax incentives for energy \nefficiency and renewable energy technologies, and updated CAFE, or \ncorporate average fuel economy, standards. It is my understanding that \nit is the leader's intention to include provisions in all three areas \nbefore the bill comes to the floor.\n  A public benefits trust fund is necessary to provide local funding \nfor clean energy programs, and to encourage energy efficiency in the \nelectricity system. My bill, S. 1333, would establish a State matching \ngrant program. Eligible areas on which the States can spend the grants \ninclude energy efficient programs; investments in promising renewable \nenergy technologies; low-income energy assistance; and universal access \nto the transmission grid. I urge Senate Daschle to include a\n\n[[Page S13354]]\n\nsimilar provision in any final energy package, along with other tax \nincentive programs for promoting renewables and energy efficiency.\n  As to CAFE standards, it almost goes without saying that improving \nthe fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks is of the highest priority. \nThe National Academy of Sciences tells us what we already know, which \nis that improving fuel efficiency will save consumers money, cut \ngreenhouse gas emissions and decrease our dependence on foreign oil. \nEfficiency in both cars and trucks, and in the electricity sector, are \nessential to cutting emissions and addressing global warming.\n  As chairman of the Environment Committee, the environmental and \npublic health impacts of emissions are on the top of my list of \nconcerns. I will be considering legislation that would cap greenhouse \ngas emissions from the transportation sector, which is responsible for \napproximately one-third of U.S. emissions.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Daschle and Bingaman and my \nother colleagues to ensure strong provisions in the energy package to \naddress these issues.\n  I also note that S. 1766 contains provisions that would exempt \nhydraulic fracturing, a natural gas production technique, from \nregulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Legislation proposing \nthis has been referred to the EPW Committee, and I intend to hold \nhearings on this matter at the earliest possible time in the upcoming \nsession. Once the EPW Committee has acted on this matter, it is likely \nI will have amendments to propose to this provision.\n  S. 1776 also reauthorizes the Department of Energy contractor \nprovisions of the Price Anderson Act. The EPW Committee will be holding \nhearings early in the session on Price Anderson reauthorization of \ncommercial nuclear powerplants licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, as well as on security at nuclear powerplants. Senator Reid \nand I will work with the leader on appropriate language to be included \nin any energy package debated on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13354-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13354-S13355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO ESTIMATE ON H.R. 3009\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Based on information from \n     the International Trade Commission and other trade sources, \n     CBO estimates the ATPA program would reduce revenues by $17 \n     million in 2002 and by $101 million over the 2002-2006 \n     period.\n       Under current law, ATPA does not extend preferential \n     treatment to footwear that is ineligible for treatment under \n     the generalized system of preferences (GSP), tuna packed in \n     cans, petroleum and certain products derived from petroleum, \n     watches and watch parts containing material that is the \n     product of countries not receiving normal trade relations \n     (NTR) treatment, certain sugars and molasses, and certain \n     leather goods. H.R. 3009 would allow the President to extend \n     duty-free treatment to those products. CBO expects that all \n     imports of these products would receive duty-free treatment.\n       Tuna packed in cans would receive duty-free treatment for \n     amounts equal to 20 percent of United States production (in \n     kilograms) for the preceding calendar year. Under current \n     law, all imports of tuna packed in cans are subject to a \n     tariff-rate quota. Global imports of tuna packed in cans are \n     subject to a rate of duty of 6 percent when imports in \n     kilograms are less than 20 percent of United States \n     production. Thereafter, imports of tuna packed in cans are \n     subject to a rate of duty of 12.5 percent. Based on \n     information from the National Marine Fisheries Service, the \n     United States Customs Service, and the International Trade \n     Commission, CBO expects that imports from the ATPA program \n     would rapidly fill the global quota for imports, and would \n     continue to receive duty-free treatment until ATPA imports \n     equaled the quantitative limit of 20 percent of U.S. \n     production. Based on information from the above sources, \n     CBO does not expect ATPA imports to exceed the global \n     quota limit. CBO estimates that the provision that would \n     alter the treatment for canned tuna would reduce revenues \n     by $2 million in 2002 and by $10 million over the 2002-\n     2006 period.\n       Under current law, certain apparel articles that are the \n     product or manufacture of an ATPA beneficiary country are \n     entitled to preferential treatment. The bill would allow \n     apparel articles assembled from fabrics formed or knit-to-\n     shape in the United States and certain other apparel articles \n     to receive duty-free treatment. Apparel articles assembled \n     from fabrics produced in the ATPA region would also receive \n     preferential treatment if they do not exceed certain \n     percentages of imports on apparel articles. All preferential \n     treatment would expire after February 28, 2006. Based on \n     information from the International Trade Commission, the \n     Office of Textiles and Apparel in the Department of Commerce, \n     and private-sector sources, CBO estimates that if enacted, \n     all provisions that expand ATPA treatment to new products \n     (including canned tuna) would reduce revenues by $19 million \n     in 2002 and by $101 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Miscellaneous Trade Provisions (Title II). H.R. 3009 would \n     provide temporary duty-free treatment to ceiling fans from \n     Thailand through July 30, 2002. The bill also would provide \n     duty-free treatment to certain steam or vapor generating \n     boilers used in nuclear facilities through December 31, 2006. \n     Based on information from the International Trade Commission \n     and other trade sources, CBO estimates that, if enacted, \n     these provisions would reduce revenues by $7 million in 2002 \n     and by $19 million over the 2002-2006 period. H.R. 3009 also \n     would alter a program that has provided refunds of duty to \n     certain wool manufacturers. This change is detailed in the \n     section describing changes to direct spending. CBO estimates \n     that this provision would increase revenues by $1 million in \n     2002 and by $3 million over the 2002-2003 period.\n       Direct spending\n       Under current law, certain manufacturers of selected wool \n     articles are eligible for refunds of duties paid on those \n     articles. H.R. 3009 would change the method of which those \n     payments to manufacturers are computed and would appropriate \n     about $36 million for\n\n[[Page S13355]]\n\n     the payments, which must be made by April 2003. Based on \n     information from the Customs Service, CBO estimates that this \n     provision would increase direct spending by about $24 million \n     in fiscal year 2002 and by about $12 million in fiscal year \n     2003.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up procedures for \n     legislation affecting receipts or direct spending. The net \n     changes in governmental receipts that are subject to pay-as-\n     you-go procedures are shown in the following table. For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the current year, the budge year, and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in receipts...........................................      -43      -44      -49      -60      -23        0        0        0        0        0\nChanges in outlays............................................       24       12        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Impact on state, local, and tribal governments: The bill \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state, \n     local, or tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On October 10, 2001, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for H.R. 3009 as ordered reported by the \n     House Committee on Ways and Means on October 5, 2001. This \n     estimate reflects changes to several provisions. The \n     alteration of the tariff-rate quota program for imports of \n     canned tuna from ATPA countries, the inclusion of \n     preferential treatment for imports of ceiling fans from \n     Thailand and certain steam or vapor generating boilers, the \n     removal of the provisions affecting the Caribbean Basin \n     Economic Recovery Act and the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act, and the alteration of the wool import program would \n     further reduce revenues, relative to the earlier version of \n     H.R. 3009, by $2 million in 2002, would lessen the reduction \n     of revenues by $29 million over the 2002-2006 period, and \n     would lessen the reduction of revenues by $45 million over \n     the 2002-2011 period. The alteration of the wool import \n     program would increase direct spending, relative to the \n     earlier version of H.R. 3009, by $24 million in 2002, and by \n     $36 million over the 2002-2003 period.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Revenues: Erin Whitaker (226-\n     2720).

Mr. President, I rise today to provide a perspective \non the recent Senate confirmation of John Walters to the position of \nDirector of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In the coming \nmonths, I intend to raise certain issues with Mr. Walters regarding his \nstated positions about the priorities of his office as it deals with \nour country's domestic drug policy, and I hope my colleagues will do \nthe same.\n  First, I urge President Bush and Mr. Walters to keep their public \ncommitment to focus on the severe addiction problems faced in our own \ncountry and to significantly improve the infrastructure of private and \npublic drug and alcohol treatment and prevention programs. On May 10, \n2001, President Bush made a firm public commitment to invest an \nadditional $1.6 billion in new funding for drug and alcohol treatment \nover the next five years. Investing in drug and alcohol treatment is \nnot only a critically important public health priority that will save \nthe lives of millions Americans across this nation, it will also save \ntax dollars. Research has shown that health care, child welfare, and \ncriminal justice costs decrease, and the productivity of individuals \nwho receive proper treatment helps improve the health and the economy \nof our country as they return to work, pay taxes, and care for their \nfamilies.\n  In addition to investing in public funding, John Walters and the \nWhite House Office of National Drug Control Policy should support the \npassage of full addiction treatment parity legislation so that private \ninsurance can be the first line of defense for the millions of \nAmericans who are employed, have health care, but are struggling with \nthe disease of addiction, and are routinely denied adequate care. By \ncontrast, federal employees enjoy full treatment parity for addiction \ntreatment, and it is time for the rest of Americans to have this health \ncare benefit as well. President Bush and John Walters should continue \nthe support for improving private insurance coverage by supporting \npassage of full substance abuse parity legislation.\n  Strengthening the drug and alcohol treatment and prevention services \nhas taken on greater importance in the aftermath of the tragedies of \nSeptember 11th. Stress and trauma associated with these event, and the \nensuing international events and economic downturn will continue to \nstrain the personal, psychological, and economic resources of \nindividuals and families across our nation. Unfortunately many of them \nwill turn to drugs and alcohol as a way to cope with these pressures, \nand may develop serious addiction disorders. In a special report issued \nin response to the terrorist attacks, the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse reviewed the research literature and reported that, ``Stress is \none of the most powerful triggers for relapse in addicted individuals, \neven after long periods of abstinence. . . . Studies have reported that \nindividuals exposed to stress are more likely to abuse alcohol and \nother drugs or undergo relapse.'' Researchers funded by the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse have reported increases in the street sales of \ndrugs in New York City after the events of September 11th. Reports from \ndrug treatment and prevention providers across the nation have shown an \nincrease in the need for treatment and prevention services following \nthese recent events.\n  Working to destigmatize the disease of addiction so that individuals \nwho suffer from this disease will seek treatment is imperative. \nAmericans will be looking to the President and John Walters as the \nDirector of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to provide the \nleadership and to shape this message to the country that addiction can \nbe successfully treatment, and to support this message by providing \nadequate funding. I urge John Walters to find innovative ways for the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy to work closely with recovering \ncommunities, national organizations, state associations of treatment \nand prevention providers, anti-drug coalitions, families, employers, \nand other community leaders to reduce stigma and promote recovery, \ntreatment, and prevention nationwide.\n  Finally, President Bush has nominated a highly qualified individual, \nDr. Andrea Barthwell, to serve as the Deputy Director for Demand \nReduction for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Dr. Barthwell \nis extraordinarily qualified for this position and the Administration \nwould be fortunate to have her expertise readily available as the lead \nWhite House advisor on domestic drug and alcohol treatment and \nprevention issues. In addition to being a physician who has long \npracticed addiction medicine, Dr. Barthwell presently serves as the \nPresident of the American Society of Addiction Medicine and is on the \nboard of three federal advisory committees for the National Institute \non Drug Abuse, the\n\n[[Page S13356]]\n\nFood and Drug Administration, and the Center for Substance Abuse \nTreatment. Dr. Barthwell also has worked with policy makers at the \nhighest levels of state and federal government. I urge the Senate to \nconfirm Dr. Barthwell's nomination as soon as possible. Her \ncontributions will be invaluable as the White House implements the \nPresident's addiction treatment expansion initiative, one which could \ngo a long way to help our country effectively deal with the serious \ndomestic drug addiction problem that it faces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13356-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to commend the fiscal year 2002 \nDefense authorization conferees, particularly Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner, for retaining the language adopted by the Senate with regard to \nreforming the Federal Prison Industries.\n  During consideration of the Defense authorization bill, the Senate \nvoted 74-24 to table an amendment that would have removed the Federal \nPrison Industries reform provision from the bill.\n  Section 821 of the bill, which has now been endorsed by the \nconference and adopted overwhelmingly by both the House and the Senate, \nends FPI's ``mandatory source'' status as a supplier of products to the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD. When this bill becomes law, FPI will be \nrequired to compete for future Department of Defense contracts that \nhave been previously monopolized under FPI's ``mandatory source'' \nstatus dating back to 1934. Most importantly, this provision will \nenable the Department of Defense to determine, for itself, whether the \nFPI can best meet the Department's needs in terms of price, quality, \nand time of delivery. If the DOD determines that the FPI product is not \nthe best one available, the Department can purchase a more competitive \nproduct to meet its needs.\n  I would like to point out that by eliminating the Federal Prison \nIndustries' mandatory source status, this reform affects another \ncontroversial marketing scheme that the FPI developed in recent years. \nAs a result of this bill, the FPI will no longer be able to require \nDefense contractors to use their products. Let me give an example of \nwhat this means: when the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, NAVFAC, \nthe Corps of Engineers, Air Force, or any other Defense agency issues a \ncontract for architect-engineer, A/E, services, the A/E firm cannot be \nforced to specify FPI products, such as office furniture systems, in \nits designs and specifications. It is my view that architects and \nengineers should be free to specify products, such as modular office \nsystems, interior design, and other products, that provide the highest \nquality design, best value, and greatest functionality to the Federal \nGovernment. Should the FPI continue to mandate that subcontractors use \nFPI products it would be in direct conflict with the underlying \nprovisions of the Defense authorization language--in effect \ncircumventing congressional intent.\n  Mr. President, I also want my colleagues to know that there are still \na number of issues related to the practices of the Federal Prison \nIndustries that Congress must address in the near future. Senator Levin \nand I have introduced a broader initiative--S. 1295--that seeks to make \na number of needed, government-wide reforms affecting the sales and \nservices by FPI. We are also working with the bipartisan team of \nRepresentatives Hoekstra, Frank, Collins, Maloney, and Sensenbrenner of \ntheir companion bill, H.R. 1577. It is my hope that when we return in \nJanuary, Congress will take up comprehensive Federal Prison Industry \nreform. It is also my strong desire that the Bush administration \naddress this issue administratively. Many of the problems we are \nexperiencing with the FPI have not been the result of legislative \naction, but rather administrative expansion. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Levin and Senator Warner in oversight of the \nimplementation of this provision in the Defense Department's \nacquisition regulations.\n  I have a long record of interest in the issue of unfair government \ncompetition with the private sector. When the government needs \ncommercially available products and services, the government should go \nto the competitive, private sector market to procure those services. \nSuch full and open competition leads to the highest quality, the most \nfair and reasonable price, and the overall best value for the taxpayer. \nI am pleased the Congress is taking another step in that direction by \nenacting the FPI reforms in this bill. Once again, I commend Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner for their leadership, and I thank them for the \ncooperation they have extended to me in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13356-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13356-S13357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PACIFIC SALMON RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senator Boxer introduced last Thursday, \nDecember 13, 2001, the Pacific Salmon Recovery Act that will grant \nFederal funding for State and Tribal salmon recovery efforts in \nCalifornia, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. I would like to \nthank her and her staff for their hard work and for Senator Boxer's \ndetermination to have a bipartisan bill on salmon recovery. I also \nwould like to thank my colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, Senators \nSmith and Wyden from Oregon, and Senator Feinstein from California, for \ntheir valuable input that clearly helped to create responsible and \neffective bipartisan legislation to recover salmon. I enjoyed working \nwith all of them and their staff.\n  For over 20 years, California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, \nhave attempted mightily to sustain salmon runs in river basins \nthroughout the West and, along with the Federal Government, have \ninvested billions of dollars in that effort.\n  Many individual citizens in my State of Idaho and some special \ninterest groups from around the country have quite frequently \ncriticized justly the expenditures of these large sums of money for \nsalmon recovery. The criticism often pointed to poor coordination among \nState, Federal, and Tribal fish and wildlife agencies, as well as to \nineffective recovery programs developed either by those agencies or \nunder their supervision.\n  The Pacific Salmon Recovery Act, S. 1825, takes aim at these \ninfirmities and establishes a framework that will ensure better \ncoordination and more effective recovery programs. I am convinced that \nwe'll get better ``bang for the buck'' if this bill is enacted.\n  However, salmon recovery is complex. Recent scientific research has \nunderscored the difficulty in finding quick solutions to salmon \nrecovery. Scientists have been candid in stating unequivocally that \nthere is no ``silver bullet'' that can cure what is causing diminishing \nsalmon returns. The focus on dam removal during the last several years \nhas retarded progress in recovering salmon. The majority of a salmon's \nlife cycle is spent in the ocean. It is there that the salmon nourishes \nitself and prepares for the arduous journey back to spawning areas. \nWhat is becoming increasingly clear from new ocean research is that \nwarm ocean temperature is causing a severe reduction in the ocean's \nsalmon carrying capacity. More research in this area will provide \nhelpful insight as to what can be done to adjust to that devastating \nfact. The recent change to colder Pacific Ocean temperatures is widely \ncredited for the record salmon returns that the Pacific Northwest has \nexperienced this year. It is my hope that a more open dialogue on ways \nto approach salmon recovery will ensure continued progress on effective \nmeasures that will both recover these fish and protect the economy of \nthe West. It is my belief that this bill will enhance the prospect of \nachieving that goal.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill. For example, it \nauthorizes $350 million a year over the next five years to be spent on \nsalmon recovery, a sizable amount that I hope will be appropriated by \nCongress each of those years. But I would like to highlight the peer \nreview provisions in particular. Those provisions require each State or \nTribal science based recovery activity to undergo scientific peer \nreview before that activity will be funded with Federal money. It is \nmodeled on the very successful peer review requirement contained in the \nNorthwest Power Act for State and Tribal salmon recovery programs that \nget Pacific Northwest ratepayer money.\n  Ensuring accountability for large expenditures of taxpayer money is \nessential to keep the trust of the American taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S13357]]\n\n  The American taxpayers are entitled to a fair accounting and an \nobjective review of the underlying science that supports many of the \nvery expensive recovery plans, particularly the salmon supplementation \nand habitat restoration programs, that will be developed by the States \nand participating Tribes.\n  The peer review requirement in this bill will provide the reasonable \nassurances of competency for those expensive programs that the taxpayer \ndeserves.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from Idaho, California, and Oregon for \ntheir strong support and commitment to include Idaho in the quest to \nachieve successful salmon recovery in the West and for their tireless \nefforts over the last several months to draft the appropriate \nlegislative framework in which to accomplish the complex task of \nrecovering those marvelous and important fish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13357-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TOP GOVERNMENT ETHICS AWARD\n\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to highlight the \nrecognition given to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \noutstanding job they have done and the recognition they are receiving \nfor their employee ethics programs.\n  The Office of Government Ethics has announced that VA's Office of \nGeneral Counsel received their Outstanding Ethics Program Award. The \naward was presented on December 13 by Amy Comstock, the director of the \nethics office.\n  VA has the largest centralized ethics program in the Federal \nGovernment and is the second largest Federal department with 219,000 \nemployees scattered nationwide and hundreds of facilities. Ethics \nissues are administered through the Office of General Counsel, both in \nVA's central office and through its 23 regional counsel office, who \nreview financial disclosure reports and conduct annual ethics training. \nThese efforts are supported by human resources staff.\n  In addition, VA's ethics issues are particularly complex. VA's \nmission is so broad and many of its employees have outside activities. \nFor example, many VA physicians are also on faculty at affiliated \nuniversities and conduct outside research.\n  It is critical that our Federal agencies live up to the expectations \nof the Americans people, particularly of the nation's veterans whom we \nserve. This award demonstrates how a centralized and proactive approach \ncan yield tremendous results. I am pleased to see VA's efforts being \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13357-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              REAR ADMIRAL (SELECT) PATRICK W.

Dunne, United States Navy, as he departs the Navy's \nOffice of Legislative Affairs and assumes command of U.S. Naval Forces \nin Guam. Captain Dunne is a Naval Officer of the finest caliber who has \nestablished an impeccable reputation in the Navy and with the Congress \nthrough his multiple tours as a Congressional Liaison.\n  A career submariner, Captain Dunne graduated from the United States \nNaval Academy in 1973. As a junior officer, he has served with \ndistinction at sea, both in the fast attack submarines USS Batish and \nUSS Baton Rouge, and the fleet ballistic missile submarine USS \nNathanael Greene. In May 1985, Captain Dunne was selected as Naval Aide \nto President Reagan. In addition to his normal duties, he was \nresponsible for the coordination of all military support for the \nReykjavik Summit with President Gorbachev. Following this eventful \ntour, Captain Dunne assumed command of the attack submarine USS \nBaltimore, home ported in Norfolk, VA. During his command, Baltimore \ncompleted a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and the operational \nevaluation of one of the Navy's newest submarine sonar systems.\n  Captain Dunne then began his first of three tours at the Navy's \nOffice of Legislative Affairs as the Congressional Liaison Officer for \nSubmarine Programs. Following this tour, Captain Dunne returned to sea, \nassuming command of the submarine tender USS Frank Cable home ported in \nCharleston, South Carolina. Under his command, Frank Cable was awarded \nthe Meritorious Unit Commendation for its exceptional support of the \nsubmarines assigned to Submarine Squadron Four. Subsequent staff tours \ninclude serving as the Head, Plans and Programs for the Director, \nSubmarine Warfare on the Chief of Naval Operation's staff, and his \nsecond tour in the Office of Legislative Affairs, this time as the \nDirector of Naval Programs.

We wish Pat, and his lovely \nwife Dianne, our very best as he continues his already distinguished \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13357-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BERNICE FOX\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a long-time \nNew Mexican, Bernice Fox, who is retiring after an amazing record of \nservice in the public and private sectors. Her work in these areas has \nspanned 63 years, a most remarkable achievement.\n  Bernice Fox, born in Bloomington, Illinois in 1920, has lived in New \nMexico for almost 40 years. In the private sector, she owned and \noperated motels and apartments, and she worked as a legal secretary for \nseveral New Mexican attorneys.\n  In 1993, instead of enjoying the retirement that most of us would be \nseeking at the age of 73, Bernice Fox began still another career in \nsupport of the Department of Energy at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \nin Carlsbad, New Mexico. She was present to witness the opening of that \nremarkable facility, the world's only permanent repository for \ntransuranic radioactive wastes.\n  Now Bernice Fox is planning to retire from the Department of Energy \nat the end of this year. I salute her for her long service to the \ncitizens of New Mexico and the nation. Whether her next career involves \nreal retirement or still another challenge, I salute Bernice Fox on her \nlong history of contributions.\n  Bernice Fox is being honored with her own special day by proclamation \nof the Governor of New Mexico. It is only fitting that Congress further \nhonor her with this statement today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/17/senate-section/article/S13357-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GEORGE A.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass S. 1271, the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2001.\n\n[[Page S13362]]\n\n  As my colleagues know, small businesses are the backbone of our \neconomy and significantly important to the fiscal health of the United \nStates. Small businesses constitute more than 90 percent of this \nNation's employers, employ 53 percent of the private workforce, and \ncreate approximately 74 percent of this country's new jobs.\n  While on the whole, America's small business owners are successful, \nthe numerous Federal paperwork requirements that they must face has, I \nbelieve, have had a negative impact on further entrepreneurial growth \nin the United States. There is little doubt that America's small \nbusiness owners could be even more successful if they were able to \ndevote more time and resources to their businesses instead of mountains \nof Federal paperwork. That is why I introduced S. 1271. This ``good \ngovernment'' legislation continues the efforts on the part of Congress \nto streamline and reduce paperwork burdens on small businesses and help \nincrease the productivity of American business.\n  The Office of Management and Budget--OMB--has estimated that the \nFederal paperwork burden is 7.2 billion hours annually, at a cost of \nsome $190 billion per year. Small business owners are particularly hurt \nby regulatory and paperwork burdens. The Small Business \nAdministration--SBA--estimates that the costs to small businesses are a \nstaggering $5,100 per employee. While many of these requirements are \nimportant and necessary, the high costs of understanding them and \ncomplying with them can sometimes prevent small businesses from being \nable to expand or even stay afloat. In some cases, this burden can \ndeter entrepreneurs from opening in the first place.\n  The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2001 will help improve the \nability of small business owners to understand and comply with Federal \nregulations and paperwork mandates through the following helpful \nprovisions:\n  A requirement for OMB to annually publish in the Federal Register and \non the Internet a list of the compliance assistance resources available \nto small businesses;\n  A requirement for each Federal agency to establish a single point of \ncontact to help small business owners fill out forms and comply with \nfederal regulations;\n  A requirement for each federal agency to make further efforts to \nreduce paperwork for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees;\n  The establishment of an interagency task force to develop an \ninteractive government web-site to help each small business owner \nunderstand which federal paperwork requirements and regulations apply \nto his or her business;\n  An amendment to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct--SBREFA--to require that each agency maintain information on the \nnumber of enforcement actions in which civil penalties are assessed, \nthe number of such actions against small entities, the number of such \nactions in which civil penalties are reduced or waived, and the \nmonetary amount of each reduction or waiver.\n  As the bill was introduced just this past July, I am pleased that the \nSenate has taken action in considering this important legislation, and \nI am also pleased that the bill enjoys bipartisan support. I would \nparticularly like to thank Senator Blanche Lincoln for joining me in \nintroducing this bill, and I thank the co-sponsors of S. 1271, Senators \nBond, Leahy, Jeffords, Conrad, Miller, Lieberman, Carper, Cleland, \nBunning, Thompson, Collins, Dayton, and Kerry for their strong support.\n  I also thank the many business groups who have helped us craft a \nsolid bill with their suggestions and those who have lent their support \nto this legislation, particularly: the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the American Farm \nBureau Federation; the Cleveland Growth Association; the Associated \nBuilders and Contractors; the National Association of Convenience \nStores; the American Feed Industry Association; the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers; the National Tooling and Machining \nAssociation; National Small Business United; the National Restaurant \nAssociation; the National Pest Management Association; the Academy of \nGeneral Dentistry; the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation; the Small Business Coalition for Regulatory Relief; the \nSmall Business Legislative Council; the Small Business Survival \nCommittee; the Agricultural Retailers Association; the Associated \nGeneral Contractors; the Automotive Parts and Service Alliance; the \nFood Marketing Institute; the National Automobile Dealers Association; \nthe National Business Association; the National Roofing Contractors \nAssociation; the Society of American Florists, and the North American \nEquipment Dealers Association.\n  Further, I thank public interest groups such as OMB Watch for their \nvaluable input. I also thank the administration for their support of \nthis bill and for the valuable input of OMB in helping to make this \nbill more effective in helping our nation's small business owners. And \nsince the House of Representatives passed a similar version of S. 1271 \nthis past March, I hope that we will have a final bill for the \nPresident's signature very soon.\n  Once again, I am pleased that the Senate has acted to provide relief \nto small business owners. This bill will help save time and money and \nwill allow small business owners the ability to better understand and \ncomply with Federal regulations and paperwork requirements. It is good \nfor the country and good for our economy and I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support in passing this bill today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today in support of Senator \nVoinovich's legislation, the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of \n2001, as well as my amendment to improve the legislation for the \nbenefit on America's small businesses.\n  While legislation such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act have made great \nstrides in helping to ease the regulatory burden on our small \nbusinesses, more work remains to be done.\n  In the report prepared by the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy on the recommendations of the White House Conference on \nSmall Business in 1995, the Office of Advocacy stated that.\n\n       Federal, state and local governments impose numerous \n     requirements on the operation of businesses. The burdens \n     associated with these requirements are often exacerbated by \n     substantial paperwork and record-keeping requirements. In \n     addition to the cost and administrative burdens, small and \n     growing businesses have difficulty simply keeping abreast of \n     the various regulatory and paperwork requirements.\n\n  Six years later, this statement is still true.\n  While I support the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act, I think it \nis important to point out that I objected to an original request to \npass this legislation by unanimous consent because the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, which I chair, has jurisdiction \nover some of the issues included in this legislation. Additionally, the \nexpertise of the Committee on issues of importance to small businesses \ncan only serve to enhance any legislation designed to help our Nation's \nsmall businesses. That being said, Senator Voinovich and I have \naddressed my questions about the legislation and agreed to an \namendment. I believe the bill is better because of our work.\n  The legislation originally called for the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget to appoint members to the ``Task Force'' created \nin the legislation from the various agencies listed in the bill. \nAlthough I had no objection to the Task Force being led by the OMB \nDirector, I did have reservations about the OMB Director selecting the \nparticipants, a function that should be vested with each agency head. \nThe amendment makes this change.\n  Additionally, my amendment has a provision stating that in any report \nissued by the Task Force, minority views must be included. This \nprovision has been added as a result of my consultations with SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy, who were concerned that reports issued on small \nbusiness issues may not reflect the views of small business advocates. \nBy allowing minority opinions, any report issued by the Task Force will \nat the very least contain concerns raised by the small business \ncommunity.\n  My amendment also adds the National Ombudsman to the list of \nrecipients bi-annual reporting on the number of enforcement actions \ntaken by agencies. The National Ombudsman, located\n\n[[Page S13363]]\n\nat the SBA, serves as a confidential resource to field complaints and \ncomments from small businesses about the regulatory process and actions \ntaken by regulatory agencies. Additionally, the National Ombudsman \nrates Federal regulatory agencies on their treatment of small \nbusinesses and issues a report card. Therefore, I felt it appropriate \nthat agency information regarding regulatory enforcement be shared with \nthe National Ombudsman.\n  Finally, my amendment makes a technical change in the legislation to \nreflect the name change of the Senate Committee on Small Business to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, which occurred on \nJune 29th of this year.\n  I believe the changes my amendment makes will provide additional \nsupport for our small businesses suffering from paperwork burdens, and \nI ask my colleagues to support the amendment and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating thereto be placed in the Record. The \ncommittee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was \nagreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1271), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Paperwork \n     Relief Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.
