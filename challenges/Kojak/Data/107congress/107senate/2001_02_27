Mr. President, one of the most important things we do in \nthe Senate throughout the year is to put together a budget. The budget, \nof course, on its face, is how we spend the money. However, it is much \nmore than that. It sets the priorities of the Senate and the Congress \nand the Government, what the Government will do throughout the year, by \nadjudicating and allocating these expenditures to certain areas.\n  In addition, of course, it has to do with the broader issue of what \nsize Government we have, what is the role of the Government, and what \nis the role of the Federal Government vis-a-vis other governments. So \nit is one of the most important documents and one of the most important \nactivities we engage in during the entire year.\n  The President this evening will lay forth his priorities for \nbudgeting, which, of course, will be very important. He will set out \nthe expenditure level for this country. These things all become very \nimportant. We are going to hear more about it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1593-10", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1593-S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, tonight we will hear from President Bush \nas he presents the budget. I remember when I first came to this town as \na very young man back in the 1960s, one of my wise mentors commented \nthat every President enjoys a honeymoon, and it lasts until he offers \nhis first budget. Once we get down to the money, the platitudes stop; \nthat is when the honeymoon ends.\n  I suppose tonight we will see the end of whatever honeymoon President \nBush is experiencing as people begin to disagree with his priorities \nwith respect to the money. That is as it should be.\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\n We should get away from the generalities and, frankly, the hyperbole \nof the political campaign and down to the realities of governing as \nquickly as possible.\n  I can't help but think back over my first experience as a Member of \nthis body some 8 years ago when President Clinton presented his first \nbudget. I was a brand-new Member of the minority. I had gone through \nthe campaign with President Clinton. He and I had both campaigned on \nthe same thing: Change. He, of course, wanted to change the Presidency; \nI wanted to change the Congress. He succeeded; I didn't. But I at least \ngot elected back into a Congress where the Republicans were very much \nin the minority.\n  In his campaign, President Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut. \nBut when he stood before America on that first occasion and presented \nhis first budget, he said things were so much different once he had \ngotten into the Presidency than he had thought they were when he was \nrunning for the Presidency he had to not only rescind his call for a \ntax cut but ask for a tax increase.\n  One of the things I am looking forward to tonight is that President \nGeorge W. Bush will not change from the position he took in the \ncampaign. He promised he would campaign for a tax cut, for tax relief, \nand I understand tonight he will, in fact, propose that on which he \ncampaigned--tax relief.\n  He will propose a number of other things. We will go down them in the \nstandard checklist, laundry list fashion of politicians, and say that \nis too much for this, that is not enough for that, we are in favor of \nthis, but we want to amend that. And we will go down it as if this is a \nchecklist that is cast in bronze. We will fight over the details.\n  Again, I have learned that is what goes on around here. In fact, \nhowever, if we can step back from that process for a minute, we should \nrealize the economy is not a checklist. The economy is a constantly \nshifting, constantly changing series of literally millions of \npriorities on the part of individuals. Individuals change jobs; \nindividuals graduate from college; individuals start businesses; \nindividuals see their businesses fail. Sometimes large corporations see \ntheir businesses fail. The best projections come to sometimes \nunpleasant surprises.\n  Look, for example, at what was billed as the largest merger in the \nhistory of the automotive industry, Daimler and Chrysler. Daimler, the \norganization from Germany, thought they were buying the crown jewel of \nthe American automobile industry in Chrysler, the most profitable of \nthe big three in America, only to discover a few years later their \nprojections had gone awry and they were facing mountains of red ink. \nNow they are scrambling to change.\n  We are looking at the best projections we can find with respect to \nwhat will happen in the American economy over the next 10 years, and we \nare setting down some priorities as to how we will respond if, indeed, \nthose projections come to pass. I make here a very bold prediction: The \nprojections we have before us for the next 10 years will not be \naccurate.\n\n  That is a very far limb I am going out on, I realize, but I feel \nconfident with that. I will be even more specific: They will either be \ntoo good or too bad. We have never had the experience of any Federal \nagency making projections over the coming years with anything like the \npinpoint accuracy we presume when we debate budgets around here. We \nstand here and we say this is so many billion too high for this and so \nmany billion too low, and so on. Then reality comes in, and we are \nalways stunned that it is different from our projections.\n  When I first came here 8 years ago and debated President Clinton's \nfirst projections, we were being told with absolute certainty that we \nwere facing budget deficits as far as the eye could see and we had to \nhave this tax increase to deal with these overwhelming deficits. Now we \nare being told we are facing budget surpluses that will go on as far as \nthe eye can see into the trillions of dollars.\n  I happen to think we will, indeed, see surpluses but they will not be \nin the exact order of magnitude that our current projections say they \nwill. They will be, I say with great confidence, either higher or \nlower. It is similar to the question someone asked of, I believe it was \nJ.P. Morgan, when they said, ``What will the stock market do today?'' \nthinking he was the greatest expert on the stock market. He looked at \nhis questioner with great sagacity, and he said: ``It will fluctuate.''\n  What will the economy do? It will grow or it will shrink, and it will \ndo so in a pattern that is virtually impossible to estimate with the \nexactness that we get budget figures. To say the total surplus over the \nnext 10 years will be exactly $5.6 trillion is an exercise in \nguessing--creative guessing, educated guessing, well-researched \nguessing, but it is still guessing.\n  So as we get into the budget President Bush will give us, and as we \ngo through the necessary exercise of adopting exact numbers, let us \nrecognize that this is an exercise we go through every year. Every year \nwe adjust the budget, every year we adjust our guesses, every year we \ntry to do a little better than we did the year before, and every year \nwe have a year's more hard data behind us that we hope will help guide \nus where we are going in the future.\n  We now know, for example, when President Clinton said we were in a \nserious recession as we were adopting the budget in 1993, if we look \nback at the economic data, the recession in fact ended in 1991. It \nstill felt like a recession, but we were, in fact, not in one. I think \nwe took some steps that, in retrospect, we probably should not have \ntaken on the basis of what things seemed to be rather than on the basis \nof what things were.\n  All right, having said that, let me comment on what I see in \nPresident George W. Bush's budget. He is setting out his priorities. I \nthink that is what we should focus on: What are the priorities that \nthis President hopes this Congress will adopt as we look to the future.\n  My own guess of the future surplus is that it is going to be better, \nin terms of Federal income, than $5.6 trillion. I think the $5.6 \ntrillion number which has been adopted as the best summary of the \nvarious estimates is probably low. If I were the CEO of a business \nlooking at this kind of forecast, I would say let's get fairly \naggressive at trying to grow the business, let's get fairly aggressive \nat taking those steps that will prepare us for the prosperity that we \nthink lies ahead.\n\n  I think there are those who say: No, no, the $5.6 trillion number is \ntoo high; let us get very conservative; let us get very restrictive \nwith what we do with the money in this budget. My own gut tells me that \nis the way to make sure we do not hit the $5.6 trillion, that we \nconstrict the growth, and we see to it that this economy gets less \nrather than more in the future.\n  But these are the President's priorities as I understand them. Let me \njust list them and then talk about whether or not it is a good set of \npriorities. His first priority has to do with improving our educational \nsystem. I think our educational system since the demise of the Soviet \nUnion has become the No. 1 survival issue for the United States. If we \ndo not get our educational system geared to the needs of the future, we \nwill pay a huge price in the future. So his priority of improving \neducation strikes me as the right budgetary priority, the thing that \nshould be first.\n  Next is protecting Social Security. That has become the Holy Grail of \nAmerican politics. Every politician says he wants to protect Social \nSecurity. It is to be expected that President Bush will put it right \nnext to education.\n  Next, preserve Medicare. I have a little bit of a reaction to that \nlanguage, ``preserve Medicare,'' because I have found that everybody \nwho deals with Medicare in its present structure hates it. Oh, they \ndon't hate the idea of having money to deal with their health care \nproblem, but the structure is absolutely devastating. Yes, from a \nbudgetary standpoint I think what the President is going to propose is \nwise. But I hope as we go through that process we can start talking \nabout changing Medicare so human beings can understand it.\n  Just a quick vignette: I have a constituent who came to me and she \nsaid: I am a very intelligent person, I think. I am a college graduate, \nand I have a professional life. I take care of my mother's medical \nproblems, and my mother is on Medicare.\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\n  She said: I am totally defeated by the paper that comes through the \nmail to me with respect to mother's Medicare, and I finally adopted \nthis strategy. I throw everything away, and once a month I call the \nSalt Lake Clinic where my mother is being treated and I say, ``How much \nmoney do I owe you?'' And they give me a number, and I write them a \ncheck.\n  She said that is the only way she can deal with the complexities that \ncome out of Medicare.\n  A much younger man who came to me when we were out in our home States \ncelebrating Presidents Day said: My father just went on Medicare. I had \nno idea how disastrously complicated that really is and how far short \nof really meeting his needs it is.\n  So let's not get carried away in the political rhetoric of preserving \nMedicare to think that the Medicare system as it is currently running \nmakes any sense at all. Let us understand that if we are going to fund \nMedicare--and President Bush recommends that we do--we have the \nresponsibility to do some fairly heavy lifting between now and the time \nthat funding comes along, to examine the way Medicare is run.\n  I hope Secretary Thompson, as the new Secretary of HHS, will take a \nlong, hard look at HCFA and say what can be done to make the Medicare \naccounting process and examination of claims process intelligible to \nhuman beings because it is clearly not that at the moment.\n  All right: Education, Social Security, Medicare--defense. One of the \nthings we have seen over the last 8 years has been what used to be \ncalled the peace dividend. Ever since Ronald Reagan and George Bush's \nfather, Bush the 1st, or Bush the 41st--whatever shorthand title we \nwish to put on him--ended the cold war and the Soviet Union \ndisappeared, we have seen the defense budget as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product decrease dramatically. We should see that happen. That \nis the peace dividend we should hope for.\n  When President Clinton used to stand and say this is the smallest \nGovernment in a generation, basically he was talking about the Defense \nDepartment. All of the shrinking of civilian jobs in the Government, of \nwhich he was so proud, occurred primarily in the Defense Department. We \ngot to the point where we went a little too far with that. Our defense \nbudget is now a smaller percentage of the gross domestic product than \nit was prior to World War II.\n  It is back to the 1939-1940 level. It is beginning to show. We do not \nneed the kind of defense we needed during the cold war, but we need a \ndefense that can deter anyone who would like to take us to world war \nIII. It is appropriate that President Bush has listed that as his next \npriority.\n  Improving health care. I have already talked about improvements I \nwould like to see in Medicare. President Bush recognizes that this is \nan area where we need to spend more, not less.\n  Interestingly, many Republicans say any kind of government \nexpenditure is bad. They want to cut anything. And any budget cut that \ncomes along, they immediately clear. This is an area where we should \nnot be cutting because it is an investment that will, indeed, pay huge \ndividends in the future. I am delighted, as one who has supported \ndoubling the funding for NIH and other basic research in health care, \nto note that President Bush is going to double the funding for medical \nresearch on such important health issues as cancer. I look forward to \nthe country reaping the benefits of that kind of investment.\n  The fact that President Bush can talk about that kind of an increase \neven as he is talking about presiding over a smaller government \ndemonstrates that this is a man who has his priorities straight. This \nhas been a Republican initiative right from the first. It started with \nSenator Connie Mack of Florida who has had personal experience with the \nravages of cancer. He didn't just have a knee-jerk response to those \nexperiences but began to look into what was being done at the National \nInstitutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute, and came back \nto the rest of us and said this is good, sound investment.\n  Hearings were held. Testimony was taken. We Republicans led the way \non seeing to it that basic health research would be increased very \nsubstantially in this country because we recognized the dividends that \nwould pass.\n  I am delighted to note that President Bush is going to carry on that \nRepublican initiative that began on the floor of this Senate with \nSenator Mack from Florida and is proposing this kind of an increase for \nNIH medical research.\n  Next, the environment. We hear an enormous amount of conversation \nabout the environment. We must cut back on this; we must do that, and \nso on. Frankly, if you dig into it, from my point of view, much of it \nis based on what is being called junk science.\n  Junk science, to summarize it very quickly, is that science that is \nproduced and then taken to the media rather than for peer review. \nScientists come to a conclusion and then call a press conference rather \nthan turning to other scientists to say where they went wrong. Once the \nmedia has hold of it and has spread it, then there is no calling it \nback. Then it gets set into the public mind, and the public culture is \nabsolute truth. Those who try to catch up with it after the fact always \nhave difficulty. We have seen examples of that. One that rankled the \nagricultural field was the excitement over the alar scare where film \nstars suddenly became scientists and testified before the Congress \nabout all of the apples being tainted. Checking into it carefully and \ndoing peer review indicated that, in fact, alar was not going to poison \nevery man, woman, and child in the United States. But the scare had a \ntremendous impact on apple growers. Frankly, parents wanted kids to eat \nmore apples. And it has taken a long time for the reality to catch up \nwith that kind of junk science.\n  When we are talking about the environment, let's not talk about junk \nscience. Let's talk about some significant investments in the \nenvironment that make sense.\n  President Bush is proposing fully funding the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which is a $900 million commitment, and he is giving \nEPA the second highest operating budget in its history which, for \nwhatever it is worth, happens to be $59 million higher than the request \nfrom President Clinton.\n  I am not at all impressed with the idea that we must spend more than \nPresident Clinton in a certain area. But since there are those in the \nmedia who think President Clinton was the example of how you fund \nefforts on the environment, I think it is important to point out that \nGeorge W. Bush is not cutting back on that kind of commitment.\n  Those are his priorities. Identify first; then the standard, Social \nSecurity and Medicare; a new one for the administration, which is \ndefense, funding for health care research, and activities to protect \nthe environment. Those are a pretty good series of priorities, in my \nview.\n  But there are two others that are in this particular budget that are \ndifferent from what we have seen. One is a commitment to pay off the \ndebt.\n  When I first got here 8 years ago, we were told with the same \nconfidence that we are being told about surpluses how we would have \ndeficits as far as the eye could see. Those deficits have disappeared. \nThey have turned into surpluses because the economy has--surprise--\ngrown faster than anybody anticipated it would and registered those \nprojections, inaccurate as that. As that is going on, we must continue \nto pay down the debt. George W. Bush said we will do that.\n  It comes down to this: He says: These are my priorities; these are \nthe priorities I recommend to the Congress. Once these priorities are \nfully funded, we have this much left over. And what do we do with the \nmoney left over? He says we do two things: First, we pay down the debt; \nsecond, we give whatever is left back to the people who have been \novercharged for the Government services they have been buying with \ntheir taxes.\n  I think that is an appropriate arrangement of the money. Here is the \npriority. Here is what we are going to spend it on. Yes, we are going \nto be spending more than we were spending in the past, but we still \nhave this much left.\n  What do we do with that which we have left? We pay our debts and we \ngive money back to people whom we have overcharged. Could anything be \nfairer than that? Can anything be simpler than that? But the big fight, \nof course, is going to be on the last item--giving money back to those \nwho have been\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\novercharged. Who are they? Maybe the people who should get the money \nback shouldn't be the people who sent it here in the first place. Maybe \nthe money should not go back to the people who were overcharged but to \nthe people who never shopped in the first place.\n  That would be the conversation we would have if this were a business. \nOf course, it wouldn't be cast in those terms because this is not a \nbusiness. This is a government. As a government in a democracy, this \nmeans there are votes to be courted. There are special interest groups \nto be satisfied. When we get back to that area of money to be given \nback to those who have been overcharged, that is where the heat will \ncome. That is where the rhetoric will come. That is where the shouting \nwill come. That is where we will have our most bitter debates.\n  I, for one, am encouraged by the fact that the heart of President \nBush's tax plan is the reduction of the marginal rate. This is why.\n  First, there is the question of fairness. Should anybody be required \nto pay more than a third of his or her income to the Federal \nGovernment? If you take a poll--there are those who live by polls in \nthis Chamber--and ask the American people what should be the highest \ntotal anybody should pay, over the years the numbers have stayed pretty \nstable. It is 25 percent. Most Americans think no one should be forced \nto pay more than 25 percent of his or her income into the Federal \nGovernment. We are now close to 40. President Bush is saying no. Let's \nbring that number back to a third. Let's bring that number back to 33. \nI don't think that is unreasonable. I think it fits with where the \nAmerican people think we ought to be.\n  The second reason why I think we ought to bring down the top rate \nfrom roughly 40 to a third is because I recognize that it is in that \narea that the American entrepreneurial machine takes hold. Look at our \ncounterparts in Europe. Japan: I have owned a business in Japan. I have \nbeen involved in a joint venture with companies in Europe. I know that \nin those countries they have many of the things we have. You think they \nare almost identical. They have big corporations. They have hard-\nworking people. They have a well-educated workforce. The one thing they \ndon't have that is almost uniquely American, with perhaps the exception \nof Hong Kong, is they do not have the entrepreneurial spirit. And where \ndo the entrepreneurs fund their businesses? They fund their \nbusinesses--the growth, the new jobs, the new creation--at the edge of \nthe marginal tax rate.\n  If you bring the top marginal tax rate down from 40 percent to 33 \npercent, you are going to see a whole host of new industries, new \nenterprises, and new activities spring up that will make it possible \nfor the higher end of the projection of what will happen in the economy \ncome to pass.\n  Mr. President, that is a brief overview of the President's proposal. \nI look forward to hearing him flesh it out tonight in his presentation \nto the joint session of Congress. I express my delight that we are \ngoing to hear this President stand true to the things he said during \nthe campaign. It will be a refreshing change.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah for his \nremarks about the budget.\n  I have had some White House briefings on what would be in the \nPresident's budget. It is so refreshing to see a President, who made \npromises, and tonight is going to unveil his plans to keep the promises \nhe made to the American people.\n  I, as one Member of the Senate, am certainly going to try to help the \nPresident keep those promises because I, too, made those promises to \nthe American people because I believe we can treat this budget as any \nfamily in America treats their household budget; that is, we can make \npriorities. We can decide what we want to spend more money to do, what \nwe want to spend less money to do, and where our priorities are going \nto be for saving our own money. That is the theory behind the \nPresident's budget.\n  He is basically saying: We are going to cover our priorities. We are \ngoing to increase spending in the priority areas. We are going to flat \nline the areas that are not priorities or areas where the project is \ncomplete. And we are going to have more of our own money back in our \npocketbooks. At the same time, the President is going to pay down the \ndebt at the greatest rate that we can pay it down. I think that is a \nbalanced approach.\n  Let's talk about some of the priorities. One that I am very pleased \nthe President is going to put forward is the No. 1 priority, which is \neducation. Public education is the foundation of our country. It is \nwhat makes us different from most other countries in the world; and \nthat is we want public education to give every child the chance to \nreach his or her full potential; that they can go to public schools all \ntheir life, and they will have a great education that will allow them \nto do whatever they want to do in life. That is the American way. We \nhave fallen behind in that dream. The President wants that dream to \ncome back. And Congress is going to support him. We are going to make \nsure every child can reach his or her full potential in this country \nwith a public education.\n\n  So we are going to target those funds so that when the local school \ndistrict wants to do creative things--wants to have teacher incentives, \nwants to encourage people to come from careers into the classroom, or \nfrom military retirement into the classroom--we will allow that \nalternative certification to bring that person in to give language or \nmath or science that is not able to be offered in that school unless we \ndo some creative recruiting.\n  Those are the kinds of things that we want to foster with the Federal \nfunds. We want the decisions to be made at the local level. We want \ngoals to make sure every child can read by the third grade because we \nknow if a child cannot read in the third grade, they are going to start \nfalling behind. Of course, they are not going to be able to pass \nalgebra if they do not have the basic reading skills. So we take one \nstep at a time. And we start with the basics. That is what the goals \nwill be.\n  Secondly, tonight our President is going to call for prescription \ndrug benefits and options under Medicare. That is very important. \nFifteen years ago, people would have had to go in the hospital; they \nwould have to have major surgery to treat an illness. Today, that can \nbe done with drugs. And, yes, those prescription drugs are expensive. \nSo we need to make sure we are covering those drug costs and giving \npeople the options to be able to afford the drugs they need to stay \nhealthy, while at the same time having their other living expenses be \ncovered.\n  So we want to have a prescription drug option in Medicare. We want to \nhave benefits for those who cannot afford it. That is going to be a \npriority in the President's budget.\n  We are going to keep national defense as our highest priority. We are \ngoing to make sure our military is strong and ready. I have visited our \ntroops in the field all over the world. I know morale has been low. We \nhave not focused enough on our national defense and the people who are \nserving in our military. So we are going to have pay raises, we are \ngoing to upgrade the health care for our military personnel and their \nfamilies, and we are going to make sure they have quality housing.\n  Just last week, in Texas, I was at Fort Sam Houston and I walked \nthrough housing where the paint was peeling. That is not acceptable. We \nare not going to have that for our military personnel. We are going to \ngive them good, quality housing and health care. We are going to make \nsure their children have quality education, especially on the bases \nthat have school districts within the bases. We are going to step up to \nthe plate to make sure we are doing what is necessary to give our young \npeople, who are the dependents of military personnel, a quality public \neducation.\n  So we are going to do those things to upgrade our military. And we \nare going to make sure we have the quality equipment and the training \nto give these people who are pledging their lives for our freedom the \nchance to do their jobs, and to do it right. We are going to support \nour military.\n  These are areas where we are going to increase spending.\n  I believe Congress will support President Bush's initiatives in the \nbudget.\n  Also, another priority we have not talked very much about is a rainy \nday\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nfund. President Bush is going to put in place a rainy day fund. Some \npeople are concerned that maybe our economy will go soft. We do not \nwant to get into a deficit again. So he is going to suggest we have a \nrainy day fund. And I am going to support him all the way. I will \nintroduce legislation to make sure we have a rainy day fund, just like \nevery home in America will have if they have a quality budget in their \nhomes--a rainy day fund for emergencies.\n  So those are the priorities we will have in our budget. But it is no \nless of a priority that we also pay down the debt and that we have more \nmoney for taxpayers in their own pocketbooks because they are sending \ntoo much to Washington in income taxes.\n  It is very important that people be able to keep more of the money \nthey earn because people are paying higher taxes than they have ever \npaid in peacetime. We need to give them some relief, particularly \nbecause the economy is a little soft right now. We want people to have \nthe confidence they can spend their money.\n  But we also want them to be able to save some of their money. So we \nare going to have a balanced plan that will pay down the debt and will \ngive tax relief for hard-working Americans--for every hard-working \nAmerican. We are going to have priority spending, and we are going to \ndo what every household in America will do; that is, provide for the \npriorities in our budget and not spend more in the areas where we do \nnot need to spend more and target those areas where we know we are \ngoing to have to do a better job than we have been doing in national \ndefense, in education, in prescription drug options. Those are the \nthings we will focus on in this budget.\n  I am so pleased our President is showing the leadership we have \nneeded in this country to go in the right direction for responsible \nstewardship of our taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and look forward to introducing the \nlegislation and working with others who have already introduced \nlegislation to accomplish the goals that will be outlined tonight by \nthe President of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address my colleagues for a \nfew minutes about the budget proposal that the President will put \nforward tonight. I look forward to the proposal. I think it is going to \nhave a number of priorities for the country and the direction in which \nthe country should move. These priorities include fiscal restraint, \ndebt reduction, and responsible tax relief. It is these three areas \nthat I want to address briefly today. The President will put forward a \nbudget request that certainly has plenty of spending in it--in my \nestimation, probably too much. It is a $1.9 trillion budget. That is a \nvery large proposal. It includes responsible tax relief--$1.6 trillion \nin tax relief over a 10-year period of time. This will set the stage \nfor an honest discussion of taxes and needed tax cuts.\n  As colleagues know, the budget surplus projected by the Congressional \nBudget Office is lower than it would have been without the increases in \nspending by Congress over the past few years.\n  I have a chart that points out what happens with surpluses. We should \nbe saving the surplus and cutting taxes with it, however people say: We \nhave all this money, let's spend it. This is what happened during the \nspending spree in the last 6 months of last year, which reduced the 10-\nyear surplus by $561 billion alone. That happened during a 6-month \nperiod at the end of last year. There is an iron rule of government \nthat if you have money lying on the table, it is going to be spent. We \nneed to pay down the debt and cut taxes; we don't need these sizes of \nspending increases across the board. We need increases in some areas, \nand we need to cut spending in other areas.\n  The second point is fiscal discipline, particularly in the area of \ncorporate welfare. Now is the time, as we look at re-prioritizing--\nputting more money in some areas and less in others--to address \ncorporate welfare and zero these areas out, putting funds from these \nareas in such places as the President has proposed, and increasing the \nbudget for the National Institutes of Health.\n  The President is proposing an increase in NIH funding of $2.8 \nbillion, or almost 14 percent. I think this is something for which we \ncan all be proud. It is a basic research function. It helps us in \ndiscovering what we can do to live longer, healthier lives. That is \nvery good. Let's take the increase in funding from places like \ncorporate welfare and put it into NIH without a huge growth in the \noverall spending.\n  I am particularly heartened that the President is looking at doing \nexactly this--cutting in some areas to produce increases in other \nareas. Yet, at the same time, the President is trimming the growth of \nGovernment spending down to a 4-percent growth rate. This constitutes \nimportant increases in funding for programs in Government that deserve \nmore funding, as well as reductions in other areas of Government that \nneed to be reevaluated.\n\n  I want to point out two other things because there are a number of \npeople saying the size of the tax cut is too big. It is $1.6 trillion \nover a 10-year period. To give the overall example of what is taking \nplace, here is a pie chart of the Bush tax cut as a portion of the \ntotal revenue during this 10-year time period. Total revenue is $28.4 \ntrillion; the Bush tax cut is $1.6 trillion. The Bush tax cut proposal \nis a small portion of total revenue. In a situation where we are \novertaxing the public, we can afford to do this.\n  What about the allocation of this surplus that we have? Are we using \nenough to pay down the debt? The answer is, yes, we are. We should pay \ndown the debt, and we can pay down the debt. The remaining surplus is \n$1.1 trillion; the Bush tax proposal is $1.6 trillion. The Social \nSecurity and Medicare funds set-aside are $2.9 trillion. This is an \nallocation of where the overall surplus is going. Most of it is going \nto Social Security and Medicare.\n  So what we need is a good, honest debate about tax cuts.\n  A final point I want to make is about triggers on tax cuts. Some say, \nwell, OK, we will do tax cuts, but if our receipts aren't as large as \nprojected, if the surplus isn't as big as it is projected to be, let's \ncut the size of this tax cut. I don't think that is a good idea. Tax \ncuts need to be firmly in place for the community and the Nation to be \nable to react and say: I am going to have more confidence and \nwherewithal to spend if I know the tax cut will be here.\n  I don't think triggers are a good idea. But if triggers get put in \nfor a smaller tax cut--say, if our receipts are lower than we project \nand we put in a trigger to make the tax cut smaller--we should say if \nthe surplus is bigger than projected, let's have a trigger for a bigger \ntax cut. If we are going to produce a trigger for a smaller one, let's \nlook at a trigger for a bigger tax cut if receipts are larger than \ncurrently being projected in the budget.\n  This is an exciting time for us in the country as we look at the \nprospects of the new President putting forward his budget allocations. \nThere is going to be a lot to talk about, in a positive sense, on \nfiscal restraint, debt reduction, and tax relief--important topics for \nthis body and for the American public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, we are talking about the budget this \nmorning, about the tax reductions that the President will speak of this \nevening, I think talking about the importance of how the budget is \narranged, how it matches the needs of our people, of our country. It \nseems to me, as I think I mentioned before, it is one of the most \nimportant decisions we will make, and that is the allocation and indeed \nthe priorities of what our program will be in the coming year.\n  I want to just talk in more general terms perhaps about some parts of \nit. First of all, I think in most everything we do here, we ought to \ntry to have a vision of what it is we are seeking to accomplish a \nlittle way down the road and, hopefully, sometimes quite a way down the \nroad, 10 or 20 years. What do we want the country to look like in 10, \n20 years? What is it we want to do during the next year? That has a \ngreat deal of impact on what we do with financing and with the budget.\n  Of course, one of the priorities has been security and defense. I \nthink, clearly, it is time to take a long look at that and make \nadditional investments in our military and in our defense.\n  One of the things that needs immediate attention is the welfare of \nour military men and women. I think all of us have taken the occasion \nto visit military bases--in some cases overseas--such as Warren Air \nForce Base in Cheyenne, WY. Last year, I had the opportunity to return \nto the base where I served in the military, Quantico, VA. The first \nplace they took me, in terms of their needs, was housing for the \nmilitary.\n  The President has indicated his desire to immediately increase \nspending for salaries for the military, housing, and health care. There \nis no question that ought to be one of our priorities.\n  Following that, there ought to be a substantial review of our \nmilitary strategic needs, because changes have taken place in the world \nand changes have taken place in military structures. That is a wise \nthing to do in terms of further funding. It seems to me that priority \nis one that encompasses a notion that we want to take better care of \nthose men and women who have volunteered to be in the service to \nprotect their country, and then take a long look at our capacity to \ndeal with today's threats and the threats we will see tomorrow.\n  Education: Every time one takes a poll or asks questions of folks in \nmy State or nationwide, education is generally the No. 1 issue. It is \neasy to be for education, but it is a little bit more difficult to \nfigure out what to do about it. Nevertheless, I think all will agree \neducation is a high priority, that education is something we have to \nlook to down the road. What is more important than providing a good \neducation for the young people who are going to be running this world?\n  We find ourselves with some differences about how we do that. A \nstrong feeling has existed that Washington ought to decide what the \nmoney is for; it ought to be sent from Washington with attached \ninstructions as to how to use it. I believe strongly that the needs in \nMeeteetse, WY, are different from the needs in Pittsburgh. Local people \nin the States ought to have the opportunity to use those dollars as \nthey see fit, with some accountability, so we can ensure ours kids are \ngetting the best education and can have a successful life. Again, I \nhope we can see what we want for education.\n  I am particularly interested in the third priority the President has \nlaid out, and that is energy. We have some problems in energy. \nHopefully, some of them are short term. We have some long-term \nopportunities to do the things in the field of energy that we want to \nhappen. One of them is to improve and increase domestic production so \nwe are not totally dependent on OPEC and overseas imports of foreign \nenergy. That is not wrong necessarily, but we become a victim of \nimports.\n  We need an energy policy. We have not had an energy policy over the \nlast number of years. The policies are fairly broad, and they are \nimplemented in more detail, but it is my view that we need a policy for \nenergy. It ought to be one that encourages domestic production, and \nthere are many ways to do that. Some, I suppose, will be by way of \ntaxes. I am not as excited about that as I am the opportunity to \nencourage domestic production.\n  I spent last week in Wyoming. Wyoming is one of the large energy \nproducers in this country. We have an opportunity to increase our gas \nproduction--we are doing that now--and we have an opportunity to \nincrease oil production. We are the largest producer of coal in the \nNation. Coal is a basic resource but can even be better as we do \nresearch. Domestic production is one part of a basic policy.\n  Research: We need to continue research. One area is to make coal \ncleaner and to enrich coal so we get more Btu's out of coal and bring \nthe transportation costs down.\n  We want to do more with air quality, and we can. In almost any \ninstance, it is fair to say when you have large electric generators, up \nin the 1,500-megawatt area, coal is the most efficient producer of \nenergy, and we need to research that.\n  We need diversity of energy sources. I am a great supporter of \nnatural gas, but we find ourselves overly dependent on natural gas. \nNatural gas is a flexible fuel that can be used not only for stationary \ngeneration but also can be used for many other things.\n  I hope we will have some diversity, that we will have hydro, coal, \nand oil. We ought to also be working on diversity of renewable energy. \nWe can do more in renewables than we have in the past, and that ought \nto be part of our basic policy.\n  Transportation: Energy has to be moved. We see the problem in \nCalifornia. Part of the problem is the unwillingness or the inability, \nat least the absence of transmission lines and pipelines, to move \nenergy. Some people don't like to see transmission lines. They won't \nsee them because it will be dark. That is the choice we have to make. \nWe need to do that. It is increasingly difficult to get the easements \nto do that.\n  Conservation: Part of our policy ought to be the more efficient use \nof energy so that we can get more out of our energy and renewables, as \nI have mentioned. Of course, one of our goals, one of our missions, \nought to be a reasonable price for the consumers. We have seen that \nchange in the last several months. That is not something we want to \ncontinue.\n  We ought to be looking at defense, education, and energy. Medicare is \nvery important to health care. It needs to be revised. There have been \na number of efforts to do that. We have not completed those efforts. We \nneed to include some aspect of pharmaceuticals.\n  What do we want to see in the future? I happen to be cochairman of \nthe conference on rural health care in our caucus. Rural health care is \na little different from health care in the large cities. Not every \nlittle town in every State is going to have all kinds of medical care. \nThey are not going to have specialists. We need an outreach so that all \npeople in this country have access to health care. It needs to be done \ndifferently. We need telemedicine. We need to do a number of things. \nThat is another goal we need to pursue and envision where we want to \nbe.\n  Social Security: If we do not do something with Social Security, \nthese young people here, who now have 12.5 percent of their salaries \nwithdrawn when they work, will not have benefits. We can change that. \nWe are going to be talking about individual accounts that can be \ninvested in the private sector, that can be invested in equities or \nbonds and can offer a much higher return so they will have benefits.\n  I hope, rather than seeking to find a political item to work on for \nthe election of 2002, we can take a longer look at these issues and say \nhere is where we want to be and here is what it takes to do that. We \nhave a great opportunity in terms of tax relief, our budget, our \nspending, and we have that opportunity now. I hope we take full \nadvantage of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1599-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1599-S1603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I won't speak for the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Kansas, or Republicans but I will speak for \nmyself and I hope many in my party.\n  First, I start with what I think people in Minnesota and people in \nthe country mean by civility. I don't think they mean there should be \nno debate. I think people are all for passionate debate. They just want \nto make sure it is civil debate. What I say on the floor of the Senate \nis based upon what I honestly believe is good and right for Minnesota \nand my country, but it is not at all directed at any of my colleagues \non the other side in any personal way, nor is it directed at the \nPresident in any personal way.\n  Second, another operational definition before I go forward with my \ncomments: what do people mean by ``the center''? I think people want us \nto govern at the center of their lives. I will say something I heard my \ncolleague from Wyoming mention and I agree. Part of what people are \nfocused on is education--no question. People are focused on health \nsecurity. People are very focused on affordable child care, which I \nview as education. It is silly to define education as kindergarten \nthrough 12. I think it is pre-K all the way to age 65. Elderly people \nand other working families are focused on the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Many can't afford it. People are also focused, of course, on how \nto have a small business or a family farm or have a job from which they \ncan support their family.\n  Those are issues that are terribly important to people, and there are \nother issues as well. One we will deal with within the next month will \nbe reform and how we can really move to a political process which, \nhopefully, will be less dependent on big money and more dependent on \nbig and little people.\n  I want to speak directly, given this introduction, to the President's \ntax cut. We have heard from a number of Senators about specifics, so I \ndon't need to go over them. To make a very long story short, after we \ntake this $1.6 trillion tax cut and add additional costs, interest that \nhas to be paid, and after we look at what we have by way of surplus--\nthat is to say, non-Social Security, non-Medicare--basically, what we \nhave is a tax cut that represents a Robin-Hood-in-reverse approach to \npublic policy. That is what we have when, depending upon whose estimate \none believes, the top 1 percent of our population gets anywhere from 40 \nto 45 percent of the tax benefits of the Bush plan. Unbelievable. It is \nsimilar to a subsidy in inverse relationship to need.\n  Now, again, understand--a Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cut has the \nwealthy benefitting. At the same time, let me take the President's \nwords in his inaugural speech about leaving no child behind. At the \nsame time, one-third of the children in America today live in families \nwho will not receive one dime from this tax cut; 50 percent of African \nAmerican children live in families in our country who will not receive \none dime from this tax cut; and about 57 percent of Latino, Latina \nchildren live in families who will not receive one dime from this tax \ncut because none of it is refundable.\n  If you live in a family with an income of less than $27,000 a year, \nyou receive no benefit.\n  The argument is, they don't pay any taxes. These families pay payroll \ntax; they pay sales tax. You better believe they pay taxes. These are \nsome of the children who are most deserving in terms of being given a \nchance to reach their full potential. It is not in this tax cut \nproposal.\n  While on the one hand we have most of the benefits going to the top 1 \npercent, we have very few of the benefits going to those families and \nthose children most in need. It is outrageous.\n\n  One amendment I will prepare when we bring this reconciliation bill \nto the floor will be an amendment to make the child credit refundable. \nThen we can help a lot of children and a lot of families. For all \nSenators who say, ``we are for children, we are for children, we are \nfor children, we are for the future, leave no child behind,'' I want to \ngive them a chance to vote on that.\n  Let me go on and make another point which I think is the second and, \nto me, the most devastating critique of this tax cut proposal by \nPresident Bush. It is not unlike 1981. If we do this, there will be \nprecious little for any investment in any other areas--I think by \ndesign. I think this is an administration, in spite of its rhetoric \nabout leaving no child behind, which basically believes most citizens \nshould be on their own.\n  So there will not be the funding to make sure senior citizens can \nafford prescription drug costs. No question about it. There will not be \nthe funding for expanding health care coverage for our citizens. No \nquestion about it. And there certainly will not be the funding for \neducation and to leave no child behind.\n  Now, the President tried to argue the other day--it has already been \nshot down--that there is a huge increase in the education budget. Mr. \nPresident, some of it was forward funding from this past year. As it \nturns out, over the last 5 or 6 years, this is the smallest percentage \nincrease we have seen except for one out of the last 5 years. That \nhardly represents some dramatic, new investment in children.\n  So my question is, How do you leave no child behind when only 2 \npercent of the children who could benefit from early Head Start--2 \nyears of age and under, the most critical years for learning--right now \nbenefit? That is all the funding we have. And there are really no \nadditional resources for early Head Start. Only 50 percent of the \nchildren who can benefit from Head Start--that is, to give a head start \nto the children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds--and there is \ngoing to be a pittance for any additional funding--when 11 percent of \nthe children who could benefit from affordable child care--that is just \nlow-income families, much less working families, much less moderate-\nincome, middle-income families--11 percent who are of the eligible \nchildren right now are able to benefit because we so severely underfund \nearly childhood development.\n  So we have a President who says he is committed to education, we have \na President who says he will leave no child behind, and we have tax \ncuts that go to the wealthy. But will they benefit the families--one-\nthird of the children who live in low- and moderate-income families, \nhalf of the children who live in low- and moderate-income families? We \nhave a tax cut proposal that makes it impossible for us to invest in \nthe health and skills and intellect and character of our children. \nFrankly, ``leave no child behind'' becomes just a slogan, and I express \nindignation about this.\n  There will be a pittance to make sure our children are kindergarten \nready, and then when it comes to some of the K-through-12 programs, let \nme be really clear. Right now, the Title 1 Program for low- and \nmoderate-income children is funded at the 30-percent level. There is, \nagain, a pittance in this budget for any increase in that funding.\n  The IDEA program for children with special needs is vastly \nunderfunded. In my State of Minnesota, from the Governor to Democrat to \nRepublicans, they say: Live up to your 40-percent funding commitment, \nFederal Government. Then we would have some additional resources to do \nother things for children.\n  Guess what. In this budget we will see a pittance when it comes to \nany increase in funding for the IDEA program for children with special \nneeds.\n  We have an education program called Leave No Child Behind, which is \ngoing to rely on testing, testing which makes it clear that we should \nnot rely on one single standardized multiple-choice test which everyone \nwho does testing says we should not do, which is educationally \ndeadening; it puts the kids in a straitjacket; it puts the teachers in \na straitjacket. We will not have that.\n  What we will do is take a lot of schools in this country that have \nbeen underfunded because they are in districts that are property-tax \npoor--not rich; they can't have the same resources; they don't have the \nsame resources as the most affluent of suburbs--schools where children \ncome from homes where English is the second language, children who come \nfrom homes where families have to move two or three or four times a \nyear because of inadequate housing, children who come from homes where \nthey are hungry when they come to school, children who come from homes \nwhere they\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\nhaven't had the good developmental child care; they haven't been read \nto; they don't know how to use the computer; they haven't had any of \nthose opportunities; they come to kindergarten way behind--this budget \ndoes nothing to make sure these children will have the same chance as \nother children to reach their full potential. Instead, we have tax \ncuts, 40 percent plus of the benefits going to the top 1 percent of the \npopulation.\n  We have testing. All we are going to do is set up these kids, these \nschools, and these teachers for failure. We are providing none of the \nresources and none of the tools to make sure these children can achieve \nand do well, but we are going to have tests and we are going to test \nkids starting as young as age 8, every single year, and then we are \ngoing to say after 3 years: Schools, if you don't make the grade, we \nwill flunk you and we will move to vouchers.\n  I think the people who deserve an F grade are the White House and \nthose people in the House and the Senate who do not seem to be willing \nto be held accountable for the health, skills, intellect, and character \nof all the children in our country. That, to me, merits a failing \ngrade.\n  I hope my party does not join in this tax-cutting frenzy. I hope we \nwill focus on honest tax cuts that benefit working families, middle-\nincome families and moderate-income families. I hope we focus on a \nchild care credit for all families so we will be helping all children. \nI hope we get the help where it is needed. I hope this is not just one \nhuge bonanza for wealthy people.\n  Frankly, I say to Democrats, this is our moment of truth. Above and \nbeyond tax cuts that work for citizens in this country, we want to make \nsure there are resources for investment. We must be willing to draw the \nline and say to President Bush and Republicans: You go with your tax \ncut plan, 40 to 44 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent; \nwe go for investment in children and education. President Bush, you \ngo for a tax cut plan with 44 percent of the benefits going to the top \n1 percent; we go for expanding health care coverage. President Bush, \nRepublicans: You go for a tax cut plan that is Robin Hood in reverse, \nwith most of the benefits going to wealthy people; we go for making \nsure our parents and grandparents can afford prescription drug \ncoverage. President Bush, you go for your tax cut, Robin Hood in \nreverse, going to wealthy people in this country; we go for affordable \nhousing--that is what we are about. We are supposed to be the party of \nthe people, so let's try to make sure the tax cuts, in combination with \nthe investment, benefit the vast majority of people in this country.\n\n  I think it is terribly important for Democrats to find their voice \nand for us to be as strong as possible, both in opposition to President \nBush's tax cut proposal going mainly to the wealthy and in enunciation \nof what we stand for. We stand for some tax cuts that are honest tax \ncuts that benefit the majority of families and citizens in our country, \nnot leaving out those families who are most in need of help, and in \naddition investment in our children, in education, in health care. That \nis what we are about.\n  I am lucky enough to be friends with Marian Wright Edelman, director \nof the Children's Defense Fund, and her husband Peter, two wonderful \npeople of justice. The theme of the Children's Defense Fund has been \n``Leave no child behind.'' That is what they are all about. President \nBush is now talking about, ``Leave no child behind.''\n  ``Leave no child behind'' I take seriously. ``Leave no child behind'' \nis a beautiful way of calling on all of us in the United States of \nAmerica to be our own best selves. But if ``Leave no child behind'' is \njust an empty slogan and we do not back up the rhetoric with resources, \nand we don't put our money where our mouth is, and we don't make the \ntrue investment, which is not in this tax cut proposal or in the budget \nwe are getting from this President, then, frankly, we will have engaged \nin just symbolic politics. We will not have done well for children, all \nthe children in our country. That will be a profound mistake, and I \nthink we will not be the better for it.\n  Without trying to sound pseudo-anything, I look forward to this \ndebate. I am going to have a lot of amendments that are going to focus \non leaving no child behind. Education, leave no child behind; health \ncare, leave no child behind; housing, leave no child behind; violence, \nleave no child behind. We are going to have votes on all of these. If \nmy colleagues have a better proposal for how not to leave any child \nbehind, I am all for it. I certainly do not see it in the proposal of \nthe President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nspeeches this morning on the Republican side of the aisle about the \nPresident's State of the Union Address this evening. It is clear the \nfocal point of the President's speech will be his proposed tax cut.\n  It is interesting when I read the newspapers across Illinois and here \nin Washington, DC, that the President is having a difficult time \nconvincing the American people that his tax cut is the right thing to \ndo. I have been around politics and politicians for decades. I cannot \nthink of an easier task than to sell people on the idea of cutting \ntheir taxes. But it appears the President is having a tough time making \nthe sale even though he has suggested this is good for the economy and \nthat it will provide additional spending power for people in America.\n  Folks are a little skeptical. I think they have a right to be \nskeptical. If you take a look at the President's proposed tax cut, you \nwill find that Americans like the idea of a tax cut until you suggest \nto them that we really make choices here on Capitol Hill and in \nWashington, DC--that you have to make a choice between a tax cut and \nsomething else. Frankly, when it gets down to those choices, the \nsupport of the American people for the President's proposed tax cut \nstarts to dwindle dramatically because I think the American people \nunderstand the whole notion of a tax cut is based on an educated guess \nof what our economy and our Government will look like--not just next \nyear but 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years from now.\n  To say these projections are inaccurate is to be kind because, \nfrankly, they are not much more reliable than a weather report. Imagine \na weather forecast for a month from now. Would you take the umbrella or \nnot based on such a forecast? I doubt if many families would not. Yet \nthe President would have us basically say we will now chart the course \nof America's Government spending for the next 10 years based on these \nprojections and guesses from economists in Washington.\n  Former President Harry Truman used to say he was looking throughout \nhis professional career for a one-armed economist because he said then \nthey wouldn't be able to say, ``on the other hand.'' He knew, as we \nknow, that even the best economists disagree. Even the best economists \nare frequently wrong.\n  Most of the surplus the President is using as a basis for his tax cut \ndoesn't even arrive on Capitol Hill under their projections until 5 \nyears from now. Almost 75 percent of it starts to arrive in the last 5 \nyears of the 10-year period.\n  So it is reasonable to ask if we are thinking about projections in \nour economy 5 years from now, how good were these same economists 5 \nyears ago when they had to make an educated guess about what America \nwould look like today. There are a lot of factors that go into that \nguess. You have to try to assume what the growth of the economy is \ngoing to be, the number of people employed. You have to take \nproductivity and inflation into account.\n  Five years ago, the very best economists sat down with the very best \ncomputers and then said this fiscal year we would experience a $320 \nbillion deficit. That was their best guess 5 years ago. What do we \nfind? Right now we are experiencing a $270 billion surplus. They missed \nit by $590 billion 5 years ago.\n\n  This evening the President will begin his speech with the assumption \nthat the economists are right; that we should really base all of our \nplans and our policies based on economic projections 5 to 10 years from \nnow. I think people are genuinely skeptical; they\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\nunderstand we have had similar messages from previous Presidents. It \nwasn't that many years ago that President Ronald Reagan arrived in \ntown. He suggested when he was elected in 1989 that a massive tax cut \nwas the best thing for America. He proceeded to convince a bipartisan \ngroup in Congress to vote for that tax cut. The net result of that tax \ncut was, frankly, a rocky road for the economy throughout his \nPresidency.\n  Frankly, I never would have been elected to the House of \nRepresentatives had the economy not been so bad in central Illinois in \n1982, the second year of the Reagan Presidency. And equally, if not \nmore important, those tax cuts on top of his spending program led to \nrecord deficits. We started accumulating more red ink and debt in \nWashington than ever in our history after President Reagan had \nconvinced the Congress that a tax cut was the best medicine for \nAmerica.\n  Fortunately, in the last 8 years we have seen a turnaround. We have \nseen a fiscally responsible approach. We have seen not only a reduction \nin Federal spending, a reduction in the size of Government, but an \nunprecedented era of prosperity. I think the American people value that \nprosperity more than the promise of a tax cut. They understand that \nlike most free market economies, you will have your downturns. And we \nare in one of them. I hope it is short lived and shallow. No one can \nsay.\n  But we want to do the right things here in Washington at this moment \nwith this President to make certain we get back on that track we were \non for 8 years under the previous administration.\n  I can recall in 1993 when the issue came to this Senate floor and to \nthe House of Representatives where I served, and President Clinton \nsuggested we had to take the deficit seriously. We had to put in a \ncombination of spending cuts and tax increases to finally get rid of \nthe deficit. Not a single Republican supported that proposal--not one. \nIt passed in the Senate because Vice President Gore cast the tie-\nbreaking vote.\n  We have layers of Republican quotes projecting that this idea of \ngiving, I guess, strong medicine to the American economy would be a \ndisaster; that it would really put an end to any prospect of economic \ngrowth. Yet we found exactly the opposite occurred.\n  It is curious to me that President Clinton could come forward as he \ndid in 1993 with a projection for our economy that worked, give us the \nhard news, face the lumps in the next election, and really come up with \na plan to help America. Most families and businesses agreed. For the \nlast 8 years, we have seen 22 million new jobs created in America, more \nhome ownership than ever in our history, inflation under control, the \nwelfare rolls coming down, violent crime coming down, and an expansion \nacross the board in the economy in virtually everything but the \nagricultural sector.\n  We want to return to that. But many of us believe a President's \nresponsibility when it comes to leadership is not just to say what is \npopular. Being for a tax cut is a popular thing to say. Yet the \nPresident is having a tough time selling it.\n\n  One of the reasons he is having a tough time selling it is when you \ntake a look at the tax cut, you find out the top 1 percent of wage \nearners in America under President Bush's tax cut receive 42.6 percent \nof all of the tax benefits. The bottom 90 percent--people below about \n$64,900 in income--receive 29 percent of the benefits.\n  The President's response is that is not fair to say because the \npeople in the top 1 percent pay all the taxes; they should get a bigger \ncut. Not so. The people in the top 1 percent in America pay 21 percent \nof the Federal income taxes. They get 42.6 percent of President Bush's \ntax cut.\n  Who are these people? These are folks with an income above $319,000 a \nyear. These are people with an average income of $900,000. These are \nthe big winners tonight.\n  So when you hear the applause after the President says we need a tax \ncut for America, you are going to hear it the loudest from the top 1 \npercent. They are the big winners. The folks in the bottom 80 percent \nare not. These people in the top 1 percent will receive an average of \n$46,000 in tax cuts under President Bush's tax plan, while the people \nin the lower 60 percent, for example, will receive an average tax cut \nof $227 a year.\n  So the President would have us risk the future of our economy by \nbasing a tax cut on projections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years from now; \nand then he would turn around and, with those projections, have us \nenact a tax cut not for the average working person, not for middle-\nincome families, not for people in Illinois struggling to pay heating \nbills and tuition costs but, no, for people who make at least $25,000 a \nmonth. They are the big winners.\n  Frankly, what it does, in putting all of this money into the tax cut, \nis it ties our hands when it comes to important priorities for America. \nLet me give you an example, for just a minute. The national debt is \n$5.7 trillion. That is our mortgage. We have accumulated most of it in \nthe last 14 or 15 years. It is a mortgage that costs us every single \nday in interest payments. How much is the interest payment on our old \nmortgage? It is $1 billion a day--$1 billion in Federal taxes collected \nevery day to pay interest on old debt in America.\n  What could we do with $1 billion a day in America? Boy, I can think \nof some things. Education, health care, investment in America's \ninfrastructure, medical research--these are items which I think most \nAmerican families value. But we take that amount of money from families \nand businesses and individuals each day--$1 billion--to pay interest on \nold debt.\n  Frankly, if we want to leave our children a great legacy, it is not a \nlegacy of giving a fat tax break to the wealthiest people in America. \nThe best legacy for our kids is to pay down this debt.\n  Let's burn the mortgage. Let's get it over with. If we are in a time \nof surplus, let's balance the books once and for all. Shouldn't that be \nour first priority?\n\n  If we go with the President's tax cut, let me tell you what it means. \nMaybe not in the first year, but in the next several years we are going \nto find our hands tied when it comes to investing in America.\n  I doubt there is anybody in this country who would argue with the \nfollowing statement: The future of America is going to be found in our \nclassrooms. If we do not have good teachers, quality schools, and \nstudents learning, can we hope the 21st century will be an American \ncentury? I do not think so. The President has put that in as a priority \nbut a much lower priority. The first priority is a big tax cut for the \ntop 1 percent of wage earners in America.\n  I wish to mention one other thing. I see my colleague from \nConnecticut. I am going to defer to him in a moment.\n  Senator Mikulski of Maryland came up with a term today which I think \nis important to think about. She said: We not only have a mortgage, we \nhave a balloon payment coming. Do you know what a balloon payment is? \nWhen the baby boomers reach Social Security age and when they decide \nthey need Social Security and Medicare--guess what--the current system \nis going to be truly taxed, and many of us are going to have to answer \nas to whether or not, when we had a surplus, we prepared for that \nballoon payment.\n  If you have a home and you know a balloon payment is coming, you \nbetter get ready for it because then you are going to have to refinance \nthe home if you don't have the amount to pay. We are not going to have \nthe money to pay into Social Security and into Medicare if the \nPresident's tax cut goes through as proposed. He will take the money \nout of education. He is going to make a proposal, I understand, to \nprivatize Social Security, by taking money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund. He already raids the Medicare trust fund to pay for this \ntax cut, primarily for the wealthiest people in America.\n  So you say to yourself, now I understand why the President is having \na tough time selling what seems on its surface to be such a popular \nidea--the tax cut. If a politician can't sell a tax cut, how is he \ngoing to sell the American people on a tough decision, something that \nis painful? The President is not having good luck selling it because \nthe American people are skeptical. They think it is far more important \nto empower families across America to get this economy moving again. \nThey think it is far more important to make\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\nnecessary improvements in our future--in education, in health care, and \na prescription drug benefit under Social Security, Medicare.\n  Important, as well, is to pay down the national debt. You will not \nhear much said about that tonight. It will be mentioned in passing that \nwe are going to take care of all these things--not to worry. But the \nbottom line is, we know that is not the case. We need to be concerned \nabout it. We need to accept fiscal responsibility, as we did 7 or 8 \nyears ago, in the hopes we can return to the prosperity of our economy \nwhich we saw a few months ago.\n  I will listen carefully to the President's speech tonight. I am sure \nmy colleague from Connecticut will, as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Illinois for yielding the floor but also for his very astute and \ntargeted comments.\n  This is an important day. I rise to speak, with my colleagues, about \nexactly the same matters that Senator Durbin addressed because they are \nat the heart of our prosperity as a nation and the future of every \nsingle American; and that is the state of our economy, the tax cuts \nthat President Bush will be advocating tonight, and the strategies that \nwe must adopt if we are to create the widest opportunities for the \nlargest number of our fellow Americans.\n  The President and all of us with him are facing a moment of truth \ntonight. This is an important evening because the lives of every \nAmerican will be affected for years to come by how Congress and the \nadministration resolve the important fiscal and economic questions that \nour Nation faces.\n  I am afraid, as the President prepares to address Congress and the \nNation tonight, that he is reaching for the wrong medicine. The \nAmerican economy appears to have a slight head cold right now. If we \ntake the medicine President Bush is offering, I am afraid we are going \nto have a bad case of pneumonia.\n  I have spoken before about my opposition to the size and substance of \nthe President's proposed tax cut. It is a tax cut we can ill afford, \nbased on money that has not yet materialized, and it gives the most to \nthose who need it the least.\n  But the trouble with the President's plan is not just a matter of \nnumbers; the trouble is also with the values that it represents, such \nas the value of work and rewarding work. Because instead of helping \nthose who are working hard around our country to become wealthy, \nPresident Bush's tax proposal rewards those who already are wealthy and \ndo not need the tax cut he is going to give them. Instead of expanding \nopportunity, and other great American values, the Bush tax cut \nthreatens our prosperity. Instead of honoring our obligations to our \nparents and our children, the Bush tax cut leaves America unprepared to \nadequately invest in education, health care, retirement security, and \nnational security.\n  I am not opposed to tax cuts. I know my friend from Illinois, and our \nother colleagues, are not opposed to tax cuts either. I am for tax cuts \nthat honor America's values and prolong America's prosperity. I am for \ntax cuts that are prowork, profamily, and progrowth. I am for tax cuts \nthat fit into the context of an overall sound budget framework because \nour hard-won prosperity will surely wither if we do not balance tax \ncuts with significant debt reduction and targeted investments that \nbenefit the greatest number of our citizens.\n  For 8 years, we have enjoyed a steady and remarkable level of growth \nthat actually has revolutionized longstanding assumptions about \neconomic expansion. After two decades of low growth, low productivity, \nand high unemployment in the 1970s and the 1980s, technological \ninnovations--remarkable technological innovations--dramatically \nimproved the economy and have brought us the closest I have ever seen \nin my lifetime to true full employment.\n  Now we are experiencing an economic downturn. It is not a recession, \nas some, including some in the Bush administration, have called it. But \nit is a slowdown in our rate of growth. We have a number of tools at \nour disposal to keep the growth going.\n  I want to sound the alarm today that unless we deal wisely with the \nbounteous growth we have had, we risk throwing it all away. Then the \ncurrent temporary slowdown will, in reality, become a recession. That \nis what is on the line as we gather to hear President Bush's State of \nthe Union tonight.\n\n  The fact is that a new economy has emerged. Yet the administration's \npolicies seem rooted in the old economy. When you count interest costs \nand other revenue expenses, the Bush tax cut plan weighs in at $2.3 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. It would consume 96 percent of the \nentire non-Social Security and non-Medicare surplus, leaving, by my \nreckoning, just $100 billion for all other investments that we need to \nmake in national security, retirement security, education, prescription \ndrug benefits, and worker training. The money left over, therefore, is \nclearly not enough.\n  What if the surpluses do not materialize? Remember, although we have \nhad 3 good years, all this talk of the trillions of dollars we are \narguing about spending is talk about projections; it is not money in \nthe bank. What if those surpluses don't materialize? Well, then, I \ndon't see how the administration, based on its budget plan and bloated \ntax plan, would have any other options but to either raid the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds or to radically slash Government \nspending. Indeed, I say that President Bush's tax cut threatens to \nreturn us to the failed economic experiments of an earlier era of \nballooning deficits, high interest rates, high unemployment, and high \ncapital costs for business as well.\n  There is another serious shortcoming to the administration's plan. I \nwant to talk about it in a bit of detail for a few moments this \nmorning. President Bush's tax cut plan contains no business and growth \nincentives which actually could help the economy lift itself out of the \nslowdown it is in now and regain the extraordinary high levels of \ngrowth we have enjoyed for years. With apologies to Gertrude Stein, \nthere is no ``there'' there when it comes to spurring on the New \nEconomy or innovation or productivity that have been the central \ndriving forces of it for America and America's families over the last \nseveral years.\n  Let's look at some of the tax cut proposals President Bush is going \nto recommend and see how they relate to the central question of how do \nwe get our economy growing vigorously again.\n  The estate tax. I am leaving aside whether you are for or against it \nbut trying to gauge the impact on the question of economic growth. The \nestate tax changes create no economic or investment incentives. The \nmarriage penalty reform corrects a fairness problem. The broad rate \nchanges being described largely benefit an economic elite, as Senator \nDurbin's chart showed. At least a third--depending on your reckoning, \nas much as 43 percent--is going to people whose average income is \n$900,000. That won't stimulate the economy.\n  It is hard to find very many economists, including those who are for \nthe Bush tax cut, who say it will have the effect of getting us out of \nthe economic slowdown we are in that has dropped the markets and begun \nto lead to some layoffs. You can be for the Bush tax cut on various \ngrounds, and you can be against it on various grounds, but I don't hear \nvery many people arguing that it is the way to stimulate the economy. \nWhy? Because it won't move through the economy rapidly enough to have \nan effect where it would count.\n  The fact is that the economic downturn that we have now is primarily \nfocused on the technology sector of the economy. That is why I think we \nneed to think about incentives for growth in that very same technology \nsector which has driven the growth we have had over the last 8 years. \nSo what are the tools or how might we use a tax cut better?\n  First, let me address what I think would be the most equitable way to \nreturn some of the dividends of our hard-won prosperity to those who \nneed it most. It is just fairness to help those families reward those \nwho are working hard to raise themselves up in America as a matter of \nequity. For most Americans, the most crushing tax burden is not the \nincome tax. The tax that they\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\npay most to Washington is not the income tax; it is the payroll tax, \nthe money taken out of their paychecks. It is a regressive tax. It is, \nin fact, a tax on work.\n  Many of us here have been putting together proposals that we think \nwould reduce the work penalty by giving every working American a \nrefundable tax credit. That means it would go to people who don't pay \nincome taxes because their income is so low. Unlike the Bush tax cut, \nwhich would bestow at least one-third of its benefits on the top 1 \npercent, whose average is income is $900,000, the payroll tax credit we \nare talking about would provide real tax relief to middle-class working \nfamilies and to the lower income workers--not people who are not \nworking, but workers, those I have talked about who pay payroll taxes \nor have it taken out of their paychecks but have no income tax \nliability. Beyond that is fairness in sharing our growth with those who \nneed it most.\n  I think we have to act on business tax incentives that will target \nthe drivers of economic growth in our time in the new economy: Capital \ninvestment, a skilled workforce, and productivity. While large \nbusinesses have been driving our productivity gains by implementing \ninformation technology, small firms, which still account for 98 percent \nof employers, have been moving more slowly into the new economy simply \nbecause they can't afford its entry fees. A potential fix here would \ngive small companies tax credits to invest--and invest now--in \ninformation technology. This is like servers and network hardware, \nbroadband hookups, computers, and e-business software. Small business, \nafter all, accounts for 40 percent of our economy and 60 percent of the \nnew jobs; but fewer than one-third of small businesses are wired to the \nInternet today.\n  This is a stunning statistic: Those that are wired--the small \nbusinesses wired to the Internet--have grown 46 percent faster than \ntheir counterparts that are unplugged. If we encouraged small business \nowners to strive for information technology efficiency now, and phased \na credit out in a few years--if we couldn't afford it anymore--we could \nkeep productivity growing and help us grow out of the current economic \ndownturn.\n  Let me talk about a second potential business tax incentive tool, and \nthat would be one that would zero out--eliminate--capital gains taxes \nfor long-term investments in entrepreneurial firms.\n  I have long supported, since I came to the Senate in 1989, cuts in \ncapital gains to spur growth and encourage a strong venture capital \nmarket. I remember being one of six members of my party who stood to \nsupport the capital gains tax cut proposal that then- President Bush \nproposed. Capital gains have been purged, in my opinion. We finally \nadopted a broad-based capital gains cut in 1997, and I think that cut, \nand earlier more targeted forms of it, have encouraged the boom in \nentrepreneurship and startups that have institutionalized innovation in \nthe United States.\n  This country's entrepreneurial depth is an asset we must nurture, and \nwe can do so by cutting the capital gains rate to zero for long-term \ninvestments in startups, small entrepreneurial firms.\n  In the new economy, finally, employers need a knowledgeable labor \nforce that adds value to the new technology. Right now, employers are \ninvesting too heavily in remedial education to make up for failures in \nthe performance of our K-12 school system. Employers who are making \nthese remedial education investments to bring our workforce into the \nnew economy should be encouraged to do so with a new education tax \ncredit system--a business education tax credit system.\n  For the same reason, I am supportive of tax relief for low- and \nmiddle-income families struggling to pay the cost of their children's \ncollege education. We are talking about a tax deduction for up to \n$10,000 a year that is spent by families in this country to educate \ntheir children or themselves.\n  Those are three proposals where business tax cuts would have a direct \neffect on sustaining economic growth and getting us back to the boom in \nthe American economy that we seem to temporarily have left.\n  At the end of the debate which President Bush will begin tonight, the \nbest approach, of course, is the responsible approach; the approach \nthat embraces the highest values and most far-reaching and broadly \nshared goals of the American people.\n  The goal of any tax cut and prosperity plan cannot be short-term \npolitics. It has to be the long-term economic interests and values of \nthe American people.\n  We are poised at a crossroads: After 8 years of economic good \nfortune, we can go forward and continue to pay down the debt, offer \nsensible, broad-based tax cuts that are both personal and business, and \nbegin paying the IOUs we already owe for retirement benefits for baby \nboomers; or we can turn back, choosing policies that will undermine our \nproductivity, reward the few, and leave education, health, retirement \nsecurity, and our national defenses underfunded.\n  That is a big choice with serious consequences for each and every \nfamily and each and every individual in our country. I know the \nAmerican people want to move forward toward expanded opportunities and \ncontinued prosperity. That is the heart of what it means to be an \nAmerican. I hope we, their representatives, in Congress and in the \nadministration, from both parties, will have the common sense in good \ntimes we had when they were bad to build on 8 years of success with \nfiscal discipline and sound economic policies and humane investments in \nour future.\n  That is what is on the line tonight as all of us in both Chambers and \nthe American people listen to President Bush deliver his first State of \nthe Union.

Mr. President, the last election demonstrated clearly and \ngraphically the importance of education as a concern to the American \npeople. It is perhaps their highest priority. They have indicated \noverwhelmingly in poll after poll that education reform and improvement \nis something they desperately want and that this Nation desperately \nneeds. They have also indicated their top priority for the use of the \nFederal budget is investment in education. Indeed, 81 percent of \nindividuals polled recently indicated they would approve of a bold \nnational commitment to improve education similar to our commitment to \nbuild the Interstate Highway System and to do many other projects of \ncritical importance to the American public.\n  It is, indeed, fitting then that President Bush would embrace this \nnotion of education reform. I commend him for his interest. I welcome \nthe beginning of a very serious debate about how we can at the Federal \nlevel assist local communities to improve elementary and secondary \neducation in the United States.\n  We should begin, I believe, by recognizing that over the past 8 \nyears, we have made progress. We established in Goals 2000 a focus on \neducational reform. In the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in 1994, we insisted that high standards be the \nbenchmark and the measuring rod of our commitment to educational \nreform.\n  We have also over the last few years passed legislation to diminish \nclass size and to repair and renovate crumbling schools throughout this \ncountry. So we begin this process with success, but we also begin with \nthe idea that we have to do much more, and we have to do it together.\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\n  We recognize that historically, constitutionally, and culturally, \neducational policy is the province of State and local governments.\n  The Federal Government does play a role, and we have played this role \nquite robustly since 1965. The role may be described as encouraging \ninnovation at the local level and also overcoming inertia at the local \nlevel so that every student in America, particularly students from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, have the opportunity to seize all the \nopportunities of this great country. This has been our role since 1965.\n  A characteristic of Federal participation in elementary and secondary \neducation is that it is targeted, particularly with respect to low-\nincome students. We have an obligation to continue this support. We \nhave an obligation to continue to work with the States and localities, \nin a sense as their junior partner, but as their important partner, to \nensure that every child in this country will have the ability to \nachieve and obtain a quality public education.\n  President Bush's proposal at this juncture is an outline, it is a \nprospectus, it is a vision, if you will, for some of the things he \nwould like to see done to improve education. There are elements which \nwe all share, including concentration and focus on high standards and \naccountability, emphasis on reading, teacher quality, and school \nsafety. And there are other elements with which we disagree.\n\n  Among the first order of these elements is the notion of vouchers. I \nam pleased to see or at least sense that the President has retreated a \nbit from his campaign discussions about vouchers, recognizing this is \nnot the answer for addressing the needs of our public school system. We \nhave to emphasize parental involvement, teacher preparation, resources \nto improve curriculum--things that have to be done in the context of \npublic education.\n  I hope if we continue to emphasize these approaches and deemphasize \nvouchers that we will make much more progress as we work on educational \nreform in this Congress.\n  There is another aspect of the President's proposal that has drawn, I \nthink, justifiable criticism. That is the notion of block granting all \nof the Federal funds, essentially giving the States a check and saying: \nDo what you will.\n  We recognize that we are, as I said previously, the junior partners \nin this enterprise. Federal spending is roughly 7 percent of all \nspending on elementary and secondary education. Our focus has always \nbeen on assisting the neediest children.\n  To put all of our funds into a block grant and simply hand it over to \nthe States would, I think, lead to a loss of focus, and, more \ndangerously, a loss of emphasis by Federal dollars on those poor \ndisadvantaged students. There are many examples of how a block grant \nhas distorted what was a good program before. One which comes to mind \nis library books. Back in 1965, we specifically committed, as an aid to \nlocal school systems, to provide funding to acquire library books. In \nfact, many of the books on the shelves today, if you open them up, are \nstamped ``ESEA, 1965.'' It was a successful program. It put books on \nthe shelves. But, more importantly, it put books in the hands of \nstudents throughout this country.\n  Years ago, this specific program was rolled into a larger block \ngrant. What we have seen is that libraries throughout this country in \nthe schools in America are not what they should be. We have seen books \non the shelves that are grossly out of date. Interestingly enough, an \neffort on my part to publicize and address the lack of appropriate \nlibrary books through bipartisan legislation was reported in the \nWashington Times on February 20. Most interesting, though, was a \nresponse on February 23 by a school librarian that showed some of the \nreal frustrations that school personnel face with the lack of focused \nFederal funding for specific programs.\n  This school librarian, who has worked for 27 years, saw the article \nand then described the problem in her words.\n\n       The money coming down for spending has been diverted by \n     administrators for technology, she says. The computers are \n     bought with book money and the administrators can brag about \n     how wired the schools are. The librarians are ordered to keep \n     the old books on the shelves and count everything, including \n     unbound periodicals and old filmstrips dating back to the \n     1940s.\n       And most of all keep their mouth shut about the books--just \n     count and keep quiet. Now do you wonder why librarians keep \n     quiet?\n\n  The point is, there is an advantage and value in Federal programs \nthat have specific and explicit policy choices for localities. What we \nsometimes get in flexibility is lost in focus. We should be conscious \nand careful as we embrace educational reform to be very clear about \nthose programs we believe should be supported specifically--something \nlike library books--and make sure our education funding is not lumped \ninto some vast category where local administrators, under severe \npressure, can find ways to distort our intent to support a specific \nprogram.\n\n  There is another aspect, too, of the issue of block grants. People \nwill say: This is not about money. If you just give the States more \nflexibility, they don't need the extra money.\n  It turns out that most public school reform is based not only upon \nadministrative changes but increased resources for schools. That is the \ncase in Texas. Preceding Governor Bush's term, in fact, going back \nseveral terms before that, Texas embarked on a process of \nredistributing its local school aid. In fact, today it is one of those \nStates which takes resources from wealthy districts and gives them to \npoor districts. That process began before the testing regime was put in \nplace in Texas.\n  One can argue that as much as testing might have been a source of \nimprovement, just as much or perhaps more was the fact that now for the \nfirst time, local school systems are getting the needed funding to \nconduct the kinds of programs--buying technology, professional \ndevelopment--that are so necessary.\n  We have to be conscious, too, as we talk about the Federal role, to \nrecognize if we are going to talk big, we have to have the resources to \nback it up. It is not all done simply by changing the chairs around the \ntable, by talking about noneconomic reforms, nonresource reforms.\n  There is another issue, too, that the President has advanced. This is \nan issue for which I commend him. It is an issue in terms of \naccountability that I fought for in 1994, along with my colleague, \nSenator Bingaman.\n  I was a Member of the other body. Senator Bingaman was here. In the \ncontext of the debate on Goals 2000, we attempted for the first time to \ntalk about not only standards that children must achieve, but the \nresources those schools must have so these children can meet those \nstandards.\n  During the course of this debate, we ran into significant opposition, \nprincipally opposition from our colleagues on the Republican side. They \nobjected, sometimes in principle, to the notion we would be telling \nlocal school systems what to do.\n  I think this debate was important because it recognized for the first \ntime that Federal resources should not be committed without tough \nstandards of accountability, and that these tough standards should be a \nway to move the system forward. It recognized when we have tough \nstandards and adequate resources you are more likely to get the kind of \nimprovement in educational quality that we all desperately want.\n  After the Goals 2000 debate, we started discussions on the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \nThis legislation focused on changes to title I. In the context of this \ndebate, I proposed several amendments which would deal with corrective \naction, to essentially require local school districts to identify those \nschools that were failing the State standards, and then develop a plan \nof action that would bring those schools up to the State standards.\n  Once again, we ran into opposition. I was successful in passing an \namendment that exists today in law that requires the State to take \ncorrective action for title I schools following several years of \nfailing to meet the State educational standards. That is on the books \ntoday. In fact, the States are already identifying those schools that \nare not performing up to standards.\n  In 1998-99, 8,800 schools were identified as needing improvement by \nthe States. Now, interestingly enough, the States are not required to \ntransmit specific school names to the Federal Department of Education, \nso we don't\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\nknow specifically what schools are failing, but we know there are at \nleast 8,800 schools throughout the country that are not meeting State \nstandards.\n  Unfortunately, because of the time to work through the process of \nevaluation and corrective action, it is not yet clear whether or not \nthe States have taken effective corrective action. But this notion of \naccountability, this notion of making sure the States look at their \nschools, evaluate their schools, propose corrective action and follow \nthrough is not a new idea. It exists today for the title I schools. I \nhope in the process of this debate and reauthorization we can expand \nthe concept of accountability to all schools, that we can put in place \nreal accountability standards, and that these standards will move \nforward dramatically the educational achievement of our children \nthroughout the United States.\n  Again, another aspect of the President's proposal related to \naccountability is his insistence to date that we mandate States to \nrequire testing of each student from grades 3 to 8 in order to receive \nFederal education funding. We all recognize that testing is an \nessential part of education, but I hope we all recognize that testing \nalone is not sufficient to improve our schools. Once again we have to \nhave the resources and once again we have to have the commitment to \nensure that the resources go to those schools that are most in need.\n  Tests should be an indicator of how well a school is doing, but they \nshould not be a high-risk evaluation of an individual child, in my \nview. They are diagnostic tools. We can use them to see generally how \nwell a school is doing. But, as we have been cautioned by the National \nResearch Council, ``no single test score can be considered a definitive \nmeasure of a student's knowledge,'' and that ``an educational decision \nthat would have a major impact on a test taker should not be based \nsolely or automatically on a single test score.''\n  As we approach this issue of testing, let me be clear: If we are \nevaluating how a school or school system is doing as a way to provide \nadditional resources or additional corrective action, these tests can \nbe valuable. But if we allow these tests on a one-time basis to \ndetermine the future of students, we will be making a very significant \nmistake.\n  Also, we should understand the science of testing is a difficult one \nindeed, and there are many consequences, both intended and unintended, \nfrom the application of testing in schools. Again, I think it is \nappropriate to look at the example of Texas since it is so much in the \nforefront of our discussions these days. The Texas Assessment of \nAcademic Skills, the TAAS, the test that is used in Texas, has been \npromoted as almost miraculous in its ability to generate significant \ngains in educational improvement. But there is evidence that indeed the \nsuccess reflected in TAAS is not also shown when other tests are \napplied to roughly the same group of students in Texas. The National \nAssessment of Educational Progress is a well recognized test, and \nstudies have shown significant differences between the success rates of \nstudents in Texas on that test versus the success rate touted by Texas \nofficials using their own tests.\n  We have to be very careful about State tests because there is both \nthe technical difficulty of developing those tests and also the \npolitical pressure to make tests that everyone will succeed in passing \nbecause it helps avoid tough choices about helping schools and tough \nactions about ensuring that schools that do not work are adequately \naddressed.\n  So we have a situation where we have to be careful about the test. We \nalso have to be careful about the effect on students. One other \nstatistic from Texas is that students who are leaving high school short \nof a diploma and taking a GED instead has increased in Texas \nsignificantly from approximately 47,000 in 1989 to 74,000 in 1996. That \nis an increase of 57 percent. The increase nationally was only 26 \npercent. So we have to ask ourselves, were people dropping out or being \nsubtly or not so subtly encouraged to leave because of the testing \nregime that was in place in Texas?\n  There is another aspect that I alluded to: Not just those who choose \nto take the GED but those who choose to leave school entirely, forfeit \nthe opportunity to improve their education, at least temporarily, and \nseek other means, either working or simply just leaving school. Once \nagain, if you look at the cohort class of 1991, the year TAAS was \nimplemented, the percentage of students who progressed from grade 6 to \ngraduation dropped from 65 percent to 55 percent for black and Hispanic \nstudents and from 75 percent to 68 percent for white students. Once \nagain you have to ask yourself: Is this testing causing unintended \nconsequences: Dropouts and alternate approaches to educational \nattainment, like the GED? We have to be careful as we go forward.\n\n  We also have to consider another characteristic, and that is whether \nor not all the students taking the test are being counted in the test \nresults. Another statistic in Texas is the increase in those students \nwho are being classified as ``in special education,'' who are then not \ncounted in a school's accountability ratings.\n  Again, we have to be very careful as we go forward on this testing \nissue to ensure that these tests are benchmarks of school performance \nand are not unfairly marking students on a one-time basis for success \nor failure, or driving students away from school when in fact school \ncould be more beneficial.\n  The other factor, too, and something we have to be very much \nconcerned about, is that these testing regimes cost money. It has been \nestimated that in my State of Rhode Island, if we were to adopt the \nPresident's proposal, each year we would have to spend $3.2 million \nsimply for test development. On top of that, funding would be needed to \nimplement and administer the tests. That is a significant amount of \nmoney in a very small State to devote just to testing, because we also \nwant to do many other things: We want to improve professional \ndevelopment, we want to improve parental involvement, and we want a \nhost of other things that cost money. If all the extra resources, new \nresources at the local level, are tied up in testing, that is going to \ntake us away from other important initiatives.\n  As a result, I believe if we are going to embark on any form of \nmandated Federal testing, the Federal Government should provide this \ntesting money, which is an additional cost that has not yet been \nrecognized by the President's proposal. This brings us, of course, to \nthe notion of how much money will there be for educational reform in \nthis administration.\n  Everyone wants education reform. We are about to embark on a process \nof debate and deliberation that will lead, I believe, rather quickly, \nto a new reauthorization. But whatever we do depends upon how much we \nare willing to support this legislation with real resources. The \nPresident last week announced he is proposing a $4.6 billion increase \nin education spending which, by his calculation, will be an 11.5-\npercent increase in educational spending in our budget.\n  Let's look a little more closely at those numbers. First, the \nPresident's proposal disregards the fact that we have already advanced \nfunded $2.1 billion in last year's appropriation for the coming year. \nSo you have to, I think, fairly, subtract that $2.1 billion we have \nalready committed in terms of evaluating how much extra money is going \nto education. When you do that, you find out the increase is not 11.5 \npercent but it is 5.7 percent, about $2.4 billion extra.\n  You also have to put this in context. That is a 5.7-percent increase, \nwhich would be less than what we have done in the last 4 out of 5 \nyears. So one can ask, where is all this extra money? Where is this \nmassive commitment, this bold innovation to fix American education? \nWhere is it? Indeed, if you look back over the last 5 years, we have \nbeen averaging up to 13-percent increases in educational spending. We \nneed the money as well as the rhetoric. I hope whatever we do \nlegislatively in terms of authorization we match with robust \nappropriations.\n  There is another aspect of the budget with respect to education. This \neducational increase is not solely devoted to elementary and secondary \neducation, because we also have a significant support system for higher \neducation. When you look at that, the money available just for \nelementary\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\nand secondary education in the President's proposal is about $1.6 \nbillion. Again, that is not the robust, huge sums that we need to start \nan educational revolution in conjunction with the States.\n  If you look at the President's proposal, his commitment to Reading \nFirst, which is his literacy program, is $900 million. That is far \nabove what we are spending for literacy now. If that commitment is \nmade, then less than $1 billion would be available for all the other \nprograms, including title I, new testing provisions, teacher quality, \nsafe schools, and afterschool programs.\n  So we really have to ask ourselves, is there anything beyond the \nrhetoric, beyond the rhetoric?\n  Are there resources that are going to go into this educational \nreform? If we don't commit the money, then this will be an exercise \nthat will be ineffective in addressing the reality of the public \neducation problem in this country.\n  I believe we have to have real education reform. I believe we can do \nit. We should build on the success of the past. We should recognize \nthat we already have in place accountability provisions of title I \nschools upon which we can build. But we also have to do other things \nsuch as reinvigorate our direct support of library materials. We have \nto ensure that there is effective parental involvement. We have to \nprovide teachers with sustained, effective, and intensive mentoring and \nprofessional development, as well as provide principals with effective \nleadership training. We have to help schools and communities work \ntogether to address not just the educational challenges of children but \nsome of the health care and social challenges that detract from their \neducation. We can do this, and we should do this.\n  I hope over the next several weeks and months, throughout the \ndeliberations on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will \ncome together on an elementary and secondary education development plan \nthat will be significant and meaningful, that will be built on our past \nsuccess, and that will assist States and localities, and that we will \nfind the funds necessary to translate our words into deeds. By doing \nso, we will realize educational improvement in America and ensure well-\neducated young people who can not only man the increasingly complex \npositions in our economy but continue to be citizens who will sustain \nand move the country forth.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my colleague, \nSenator Murkowski, for his efforts in developing the National Energy \nSecurity Act of 2001. This act represents a collection of critically \nimportant actions; actions that can move the Nation beyond the almost \nperpetual energy crises that we've experienced in the last few years.\n  Our Nation has not followed or even developed a comprehensive energy \nstrategy for far too long. We've all paid the price for that omission. \nMajor changes in energy availability and prices are devastating the \nlives of many of our citizens.\n  We have seen oil prices gyrate in the last two years by over three \ntimes. At one extreme, we destroyed much of our ability to develop new \noil and gas wells. At the other extreme, we impacted the Nation's \neconomy. And throughout the last few years. we have prohibited \nexploration and utilization of public lands that could have been \nimpacting some of our most critical shortages.\n  Natural gas prices have more than tripled just this year in many \nparts of the country. The impact on millions of our citizens has \ncreated another major crisis.\n  We have seen the economy of California, the sixth largest economy \nwhen compared to all the nations of the world, brought to its knees by \nthe recent energy shortages. Blackouts have struck in unpredictable \npatterns, disrupting lives. Unfortunately, California is only the first \nof many areas that are likely to be impacted by the lack of past \ncoherent policy.\n  It has been terribly frustrating to me to recognize that most of \nthese problems were caused by our own actions, or lack of actions. We \nhave had help falling into these traps, of course, from OPEC for \nexample. But much of these problems are completely predictable. Actions \ncould and absolutely should have been taken to drastically mitigate the \nseverity of the impacts.\n  I appreciate that Senator Murkowski has taken care in his bill to \nrecognize and emphasize that there is no one ``silver bullet'' to solve \nour nation's energy problems. His bill creates opportunities for all of \nthe major energy sources to maximize their contribution to our nation's \nenergy needs; that's the only credible approach to the severity of the \ncurrent issues.\n  His bill recognizes that no single energy source represents a vast \nuntapped resource, ready for immediate exploitation. It recognizes that \nsolutions have to include options that impact our needs in the near \nterm, like more natural gas and safe pipelines, as well as approaches \nthat have much longer lead times, like nuclear power and renewables. \nAnd while natural gas enables relatively near term impacts with only \nmodest pollution concerns, it is a finite resource and any credible \nnational energy policy has to address a future without readily obtained \nsupplies of natural gas.\n\n  Solutions have to build on our existing major national energy \nproviders, like the coal and nuclear plants that provide more than 70 \npercent of our electricity today. And where these large providers have \nrisk areas, like air emissions from coal and a credible national \nstrategy for spent nuclear fuel, we must work diligently to address the\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\nrisk areas. Where the past administration argued that these risks meant \nwe should minimize the contribution from these sources, we should \ninstead face the reality that these sources represent some of our major \nnational strengths and end biases against their success.\n  The days of arguing for massive research and incentives only for one \nsingle source of energy and only for improved efficiency, as if they \nalone can solve our nation's long term energy needs, must be put far \nbehind us. They need to be recognized for what they are, important \ncomponents of a coherent national energy strategy, and absolutely not a \n``silver bullet.''\n  This National Energy Security Act addresses virtually all of these \nwidely divergent, but critically important, areas of national policy. I \nenthusiastically support the act as a vitally necessary step in \nachieving the energy stability that our citizens demand.\n  In selected areas, like coal and nuclear, additional bills may prove \nuseful to target actions on these specific sources. I'm working on such \na bill for nuclear energy, and Senator Byrd has a legislative thrust \nfor clean coal. These bills can build on the National Energy Security \nAct and strengthen it in some key areas.\n  I salute the efforts of the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee for his untiring efforts to advance this bill. It's \nnot easy to include in one package a set of initiatives that impact all \nof the major sources of our Nation's energy. From new incentives for \noil and gas exploration, to improved pipeline safety, to creation of \nvitally needed new domestic oil fields, to major expansion of our \ncurrent woefully inadequate clean coal programs, to strong support for \nrenewables, and to measures to ensure that nuclear energy remains a \nviable and strong option for our Nation's energy needs--this bill \ncovers the whole range.\n  I'm proud to join Senator Murkowski as a cosponsor of his National \nEnergy Security Act of 2001 and urge my colleagues to join in \nsupporting this key initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1607-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOSEPH ALLBAUGH\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, today marks a special day in the lives \nof tens of thousands of American families. Families who have adopted \nchildren from other nations, providing them with safe environments, \ngood food, a good education, and most importantly, loving homes.\n  Traditionally, adoptive families have had to endure a lengthy and \nexpensive bureaucratic process, and navigate through a daunting maze of \npaperwork, as they have tried to secure U.S. citizenship for their \nforeign-born adopted children. All that changed first thing this \nmorning when the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 took effect. This \nimportant act of Congress, which passed the Senate unanimously last \nOctober, cleared the way today for approximately 75,000 children \nadopted from abroad to become Americans. When these children went to \nsleep last night, they were in naturalization limbo. When they woke up \nthis morning, they were citizens of the United States of America. I \nsend my warmest welcome to these new young Americans.\n  In some cases, adoptive parents were not aware of the need to file \napplications for citizenship for their adopted children. Many of these \nchildren grew up to discover they were not considered U.S. citizens. \nSome have faced the possibility of having to return to a country they \nhave never known. The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 corrected this \ninjustice.\n  Today, families in Colorado and across this Nation, celebrate the \nautomatic citizenship of foreign-adopted children who meet the \nrequirements outlined in the act. For the O'Neil family of Englewood, \nColorado among many such families across the state and our nation, it \nis a day of great joy.\n  Today is a day when we greet many new U.S. citizens. I wish to extend \nmy congratulations to our newest and youngest citizens and their \nfamilies, as well as to my colleagues who worked so diligently to make \nthis day possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1607-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1607-S1608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one of the first times I ever came to the \nDirksen Senate Office Building, a location where I now have my Senate \noffice, was on December 12, 1969, some 20 months after my injury in \nVietnam, when I was summoned to appear before the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs about how the Veterans Administration was handling \nreturning Vietnam war veterans. That meeting was chaired by a tall, \nlean Senator from California named Alan Cranston and it was the start \nof a three decade friendship. Thus, in 1974 after experiencing what \nhopefully will prove to be my only electoral defeat, in the Democratic \nPrimary for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, one of the first people I \nturned to was Senator Cranston, who generously accepted my offer to \ncome out to California to campaign for his successful re-election. \nThen, after the General Election, he came to my aid by serving as \nguest-of-honor at a fund-raising dinner to pay off my campaign debt. \nAnd to top it off, Senator Cranston helped me get a job as a special \ninvestigator for the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, which is where \nI was serving when President Carter selected me to head the VA, in no \nsmall part because of the strong recommendation of Alan Cranston.\n  I hope this short discourse makes it clear the debt of gratitude that \nI personally owed to Senator Cranston, but more importantly, it is \nindicative of the kind of man Alan was: dynamic, thoughtful, \ncompassionate. He touched many lives, including veterans who benefited \nfrom his tireless commitment especially on behalf of Vietnam era \nveterans, future generations of Americans who today and for all time to \ncome will benefit from his far-sighted commitment to the protection of \nour land, air and water and for citizens of the world who benefit from \nhis long-time commitment to world peace, a cause he continued to pursue \ntill the end of his life through the Global Security Institute.\n  Another part of the Cranston legacy is perhaps somewhat less known to \nthe general public: his efforts on behalf of the disabled. When Alan \nCranston came to the Senate in 1969, those with disabilities had \nvirtually no legal protections against various forms of discrimination \nand indeed faced many barriers, physical and otherwise, to just getting \nin to the halls of government. To Alan Cranston, that was unacceptable. \nHe led the efforts to enact the landmark Federal Rehabilitation Act of \n1973 which outlawed discrimination against the disabled in all \nfederally funded programs.\n  Among its many provisions, the 1973 law: Required federally funded \nbuildings to be made accessible; promoted the hiring and advancement of \nqualified persons with disabilities by the Federal Government; and \nestablished the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance \nBoard, which has responsibility for setting standards for accessibility \nand for assisting and enforcing compliance with accessibility laws. I \nwas honored to be named to that Board by President Carter in 1979.\n  Throughout the remainder of the 1970's Alan worked to revamp \nfederally assisted State vocational rehabilitation programs by his \nsponsorship of laws that gave priority to the most seriously disabled \nand, most importantly, required a focus and follow-through on \nemployment. In 1980, he sponsored successful legislation to make these \nsame improvements in vocational rehabilitation programs for veterans. \nAnd in 1990, Senator Cranston was a leading co-sponsor of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, which in many ways was a culmination of two\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\ndecades of leadership by Senator Cranston on behalf of fairness and \nopportunity for persons with disabilities.\n  It was a great honor to have known and worked with Alan Cranston. Our \ncountry is a better place because of his achievements, which we \ncelebrate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1608-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nCentennial Anniversary of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology in Gaithersburg, which will occur on March 3, 2001.\n  NIST and its scientists, researchers, and other personnel have a \ntremendous list of accomplishments over the last 100 years. Through its \nsupport of industry and its development of critical technology \nmeasurements, standards, and applications, NIST has played a critical \nrole in our Nation's technological advances and, indeed, has helped to \nrevolutionize the U.S. economy.\n  Initially founded as the National Bureau of Standards, NIST is our \nNation's oldest Federal laboratory. In fact, the Institute's mission \nwas first stated in the Articles of Confederation and the U.S. \nConstitution, making it as old as the Republic itself. The initial \npurpose of the Institute was to establish authoritative national \nstandards of quantities and products. In its first three decades, NIST \nmainly served industries working to modernize by improving physical \nmeasurements, standards development, and testing methods. During this \ntime, the Institute played an instrumental role in the creation of such \ncritical 20th century innovations as the measurement of electricity, \nimprovement of product assembly techniques, development of the aviation \nand automobile industry, and the creation of the radio.\n  After aiding the military effort during World War II, the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology and its workforce helped to \ndevelop many of the scientific innovations that have enabled our modern \neconomy to flourish. NIST was able to foster and improve measurements \nof temperature, force, time, and weights. These and other technical \nimprovements enabled the U.S. space program, aviation and naval \nindustries, and perhaps the most importantly, the computer industry to \nexcel.\n  In 1988, in part to emphasize its diverse range of activities, the \nNational Bureau of Standards was renamed the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology. Today, the Institute continues to act as a \nbehind-the-scenes specialist in the systems and operations that \ncollectively drive the U.S. economy, including satellite, communication \nand transportation networks, and our laboratories, factories, \nhospitals, and businesses.\n  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work closely with a \nnumber of individuals at the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology and I can personally attest to the high caliber, quality, \nand commitment of its workforce. NIST employs many of our Nation's most \ndedicated and talented scientists, as is evidenced by its legacy of a \nnumber of Nobel-Prize winners.\n  More recently, I along with the rest of the Maryland delegation have \nworked with the Institute on a comprehensive ten year initiative to \nupgrade its laboratory infrastructure, which is expected to be \ncompleted by the year 2004. It is our hope that through this effort, \nwith upgraded facilities, to match the quality of its personnel, NIST \nwill be able to continue advancing the scientific and technological \ninfrastructure of U.S. industry into the 21st Century.\n  Again, we take great pride in the accomplishments of the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, in the people that work there, \nand in having the Institute in Maryland. I commend NIST for its 100 \nyears of success and remarkable achievements and am confident that it \nwill continue its remarkable track record of advancing science and \ntechnology for hundreds of years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1608-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1608-S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SONNY O'DAY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on February 7, 2001, the State of \nMontana bid farewell to a favored son from Laurel, Montana. ``Sonny \nO'Day,'' the Kid from Meaderville, was a local hero and businessman who \nheld his family, friends and fans close to his heart.\n\n               Sonny O'Day (Charles A. George), 1913-2001\n\n       Sonny O'Day, the Kid From Meaderville, boxed his final \n     round, hung up his gloves, snuffed his famous stogie, and \n     exited the ring quietly in his sleep on Wednesday, January \n     31.\n       Sonny, whose legal name was Charles Augustus George, was \n     born Carlo Giorgi on March 8, 1913, to David and Rosa, \n     Ragghianti, Giorgi in Lucca, Italy. His father was killed \n     during World War I. Rosa emigrated to America with her three \n     children to marry her brother-in-law, Angelo Giorgi, in 1920. \n     They passed through Ellis Island, where the family name was \n     Americanized to ``George,'' and took the train through the \n     vast expanses of their new country to the Montana mining \n     community of Meaderville, in Butte.\n       Sonny loved all sports and was a natural athlete. Starting \n     to box as a 10-year-old, Sonny was a protege of Butte's Pat \n     Sullivan Boxing Club. He represented the club in amateur \n     fights throughout the State. He also was an avid football \n     player, swimmer and diver. The City Championship football \n     photograph of his Franklin School team was proudly displayed \n     in his Wall of Fame.\n       Sonny was privately religious and moral, and proudly \n     remembered his years as an altar boy at St. Joseph's Parish.\n       His life-long commitment to family began early when he held \n     his dying mother in his arms at age 14. After her death, \n     Sonny gathered his younger sister and invalid stepfather, \n     Angelo, escorting them back to the family villa in Italy. \n     After Angelo's death, Sonny immediately returned to the U.S. \n     to avoid being conscripted into Mussolini's army.\n       Upon returning from Italy in the early 1930's, the 16-year-\n     old orphan arrived in New York City, where he was told his \n     pugilism could earn him money. He paid his dues sleeping in \n     an Eastside gym and in Central Park in order to get his big \n     break. Lying about his age, he fought amateur bouts until an \n     agent spotted him and said, ``You've got talent, kid, but the \n     Irish control the game. Nobody is gonna come see an Italian \n     boxer!'' Sonny's reddish hair and freckles were the perfect \n     fit to a new identity--Sonny O'Day--and new birthdate--St. \n     Patrick's Day.\n       Spanning the next 17 years, welterweight Sonny fought 529 \n     fights, lost 32 and had, as Sonny used to say, ``some draws \n     and the rest wins,'' in Madison Square Garden, Sunset Garden, \n     and other major venues throughout the United States. He first \n     met World Heavy Weight Champion Jack Dempsey when he refereed \n     one of Sonny's early fights.\n       Living by the adage: ``Smile and the world smiles with you, \n     cry and you cry alone,'' Sonny was known to greet strangers \n     with his famous smile, booming voice, crunching handshake, \n     and the introductory greeting, ``Shake the hand that shook \n     the world!''\n       His love of Butte was as strong as his handshake. He rarely \n     called the city by name. To him, it was ``The Sacred City,'' \n     and Butte cherished him in return, calling him ``The Mayor of \n     Meaderville,'' ``The Meaderville Phantom,'' and ``Butte's \n     Boxing Star.''\n       Sonny took his professional boxing earnings and opened two \n     famous Butte nightclubs in the late 1930's: The Savoy and \n     Melody Lane. There, he entertained sports and Hollywood \n     greats including Gene Tunney, Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton.\n       He proudly served the U.S. Army during World War II, and \n     married Carra Burton on September 20, 1944, while stationed \n     in Gadsden, Alabama. The couple returned to Montana after the \n     war where he established his bar and tavern in Laurel.\n       Sonny O'Day's ``Boxing Hall of Champions,'' complete with a \n     boxing ring, was his passion. He entertained beneath his \n     pictures and memorabilia with stories that rhapsodized his \n     listeners. He loved every minute of it, and bragged that he \n     would never retire. Children came in for free candy, and \n     parents came in for Sonny to give the kids their first \n     lessons in self-defense. Sonny's bar was a local tourist \n     attraction for years, and is listed as one of Montana's \n     favorites in a number of publications.\n       Sonny's St. Patrick's Day celebrations were legendary for \n     thousands of fans who descended on the community. It was \n     customary for the Governor--Republican or Democrat--to call \n     Sonny on St. Patrick's Day to wish him happy birthday. In \n     1986, Governor Ted Schwinden decided a phone call wasn't good \n     enough, and came to Laurel to host Sonny's St. Patrick's Day \n     party. The Laurel Chamber of Commerce surprised Sonny on St. \n     Patrick's Day 1995 by honoring him for 50 years of business. \n     The highlight was a celebrated bout between Sonny and special \n     guest Todd Foster, fellow Montana boxing welterweight and \n     1988 Olympian. Foster allowed Sonny his final knockout punch \n     for the ``Downtown Laurel Businessmen's Crown.''\n       In 1952, Golden Gloves Boxing came to Montana, and Sonny \n     helped train these young fighters. At the Shrine Temple in \n     Billings, Golden Gloves championships of an eight-State \n     region took place, and Sonny refereed the very first bout and \n     many more over the years.\n       When boxing turned professional in Montana, Sonny served on \n     the State Athletic Commission for 26 years under seven \n     different governors. This led him to bring 77\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\n     professional bouts to Montana, including three world \n     championship fights. As chairman of the Commission, he \n     promoted the Gene Fullmer-Joey Giardello Middleweight \n     Championship of the World title match on April 29, 1960, in \n     Bozeman.\n       Basements and gyms all over Billings and Laurel were the \n     sites for years to come as Sonny trained young fighters. He \n     estimated that he helped develop 2,500-3,000 fighters during \n     those years.\n       The Student Council of Eastern Montana College, now Montana \n     State University-Billings, originated the annual Sonny O'Day \n     Smoker, a fund raiser that entertained the greater Billings \n     area from 1975-81.\n       Sonny's civic community service included 30 years as a \n     Kiwanian, including service as a State Lieutenant Governor; a \n     lifetime member of the Elks; and a founding member of the \n     Montana Gambling Commission. Although he was a \n     professional boxer, he did not believe in corporal \n     punishment, and his daughters fondly remember they never \n     received anything but love from ``those registered \n     hands!'' Whenever the mines in Butte went on strike, he \n     would spearhead caravans of trucks to take food and \n     presents to the miners. He never forgot to feed the alley \n     cats--even on holidays. For a man who had earned his \n     living by the ``manly act of self-defense,'' as Sonny \n     called it, those who knew him saw a gentle soul who \n     lavished kisses and never hesitated to cry tears of \n     sadness or joy.\n       His love of cooking was legendary, and no one could enter \n     his home without being invited to dinner. His family never \n     knew who Sonny would bring home to dinner. Jack Dempsey, \n     Sugar Ray Seale, numerous governors and senators, including \n     Mike Mansfield, sat at the family table in Laurel.\n       Sonny never forgot his Italian roots, and continued to \n     visit and support his sister and her family in Lucca until \n     her death. Visits to the family villa in Lucca rejuvenated \n     him. He was especially proud of the family legacy: The \n     Ragghianti Art Museum, renowned in the province of Tuscany.\n       Sonny is survived by his wife of 56 years, Carra Burton \n     George; his three daughters: Mary-Glynn, Terry, Cromwell of \n     Missoula and grandchildren Charlie, Lauren and David; Nancy, \n     Sam, Talboom of Green River, Wyo. and grandchildren Justin, \n     Carlee, and Jake; and Shelley, Larry, Van Atta of Billings \n     and grandchildren John, Nick, and Marissa; sister-in-law Lois \n     George and her children Michael and Mary Grace, of San Diego, \n     Calif.; and nieces Elisa Mussi and Lalla Volpi, and nephew \n     Carlo Volpi, of Lucca, Italy. He was preceded in death by his \n     parents; brother Gus George; sister Mary Volpi; and son-in-\n     law John Pingree.\n       God surely must be dancing in Heaven, knowing you're \n     joining Him, Sonny; just as you surely will tell Him, ``It's \n     all in the footwork.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1609-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN HONOR OF THE FIFTH GRADERS AT SHOEMAKER SCHOOL IN MACUNGIE, \n                              PENNSYLVANIA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I stand before you today to \nrecognize a select number of outstanding students from Macungie, \nPennsylvania. I was honored to hear of a tremendous service that these \nfine young boys and girls did at Shoemaker School in November of last \nyear.\n  Seventy-five fifth graders in the Community Service Club of Shoemaker \nSchool conducted a walk-a-thon to raise money for paralyzed veterans \nacross the United States through the Paralyzed Veterans of America. The \nwalk-a-thon occurred over several school days, where the children \nwalked during breaks during the school day. Some children even \nsacrificed their lunches and walked in the rain and cold weather just \nto raise a few more dollars.\n  These fine young Americans set a wonderful example to men, women, and \nchildren everywhere. With a little initiative and a lot of heart, the \nfifth graders at Shoemaker School were able to help paralyzed veterans \nthroughout our great Nation. I commend each and everyone of these \ndedicated, selfless children, and it is an honor for me to recognize \nthem today. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1609-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1609-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1609-4", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE EMERGENCY DECLARED WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF \nCUBA'S DESTRUCTION OF TWO UNARMED U.S. REGISTERED CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT IN \n    INTERNATIONAL AIRSPACE NORTH OF CUBA ON FEBRUARY 14, 1996 IS TO \nCONTINUE IN EFFECT BEYOND MARCH 1, 2001--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                   7\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

I want to \nthank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the \nWhite House to discuss important issues. We are off to a good start. I \nwill continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been \nkind and candid, and I thank you for making a new President feel \nwelcome.\n  The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath. On the \nsteps of this building, I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws, \nand I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in \nWashington. I hope America is noticing the difference. We are making \nprogress. Together, we are changing the tone of our Nation's capital. \nAnd this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital--because in the \nend, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, but by \nwhat we are able to accomplish.\n  America today is a nation with great challenges--but greater \nresources. An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very \ndifferent pictures of our country. One would have warning signs: \nincreasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, \npersistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture \nwould be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a \nmilitary that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, \ntechnology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest \nstrength, concerned citizens who care for our country and for each \nother.\n  Neither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge \nand invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture \nto repaint the other--to direct the advantages of our time to solve the \nproblems of our people.\n  Some of these resources will come from government--some, but not all. \nYear after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an \nold, tired argument: on one side, those who want more government, \nregardless of the cost; on the other, those who want\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\nless government, regardless of the need.\n  We should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a \ndifferent course. Government has a role, and an important one. Yet too \nmuch government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity \nand the private economy. Our new governing vision says government \nshould be active, but limited, engaged, but not overbearing.\n  My budget is based on that philosophy. It is reasonable and it is \nresponsible. It meets our obligations and funds our growing needs. We \nincrease spending next year for Social Security and Medicare and other \nentitlement programs by $81 billion. We have increased spending for \ndiscretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate \nof inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national \ndebt, and then when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the \npeople who earned it in the first place.\n  A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. \nExcellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner \nenvironment, a stronger defense--these are all important needs and we \nfund them.\n  The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our \nchildren's education. Education is my top priority and by supporting \nthis budget, you will make it yours as well.\n  Reading is the foundation of all learning, so during the next 5 \nyears, we triple spending, adding another $5 billion to help every \nchild in America learn to read. Values are important, so we have \ntripled funding for character education to teach our children not only \nreading and writing, but right from wrong.\n  We have increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we \nknow a good education starts with a good teacher. And I have a \nwonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much, I married \none. Please help me salute our gracious First Lady, Laura Bush.\n  Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession \nthat will shape our future: teaching. Laura will travel across America, \nto promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in our \nschools and in programs such as Head Start.\n  When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the \ndifference. Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie \nfunding to higher standards and accountability for results.\n  I believe in local control of schools: we should not and we will not \nrun our public schools from Washington. Yet when the Federal Government \nspends tax dollars, we must insist on results.\n  Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every \nyear, between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know \nwhether all our children are learning--and I want to know, because I \nrefuse to leave any child behind.\n  Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk \nabout ``teaching to the test.'' But let us put that logic to the test. \nIf you test children on basic math and reading skills, and you are \n``teaching to the test,'' you are teaching . . . math and reading. And \nthat is the whole idea.\n  As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet \nthem. So we must streamline the dozens of Federal education programs \ninto five and let States spend money in those categories as they see \nfit.\n  Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve, and the support \nto do so. Yet if they do not, if they continue to fail, we must give \nparents and students different options--a better public school, a \nprivate school, tutoring, or a charter school. In the end, every child \nin a bad situation must be given a better choice, because when it comes \nto our children, failure is not an option.\n\n  Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of \nMedicare and Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the \nhealth care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare \nbudget over the next 10 years.\n  My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough \nto fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug \nbenefit for low-income seniors. No senior in America should have to \nchoose between buying food and buying prescriptions.\n  To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not \ndiverted to any other program--my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of \nthe Social Security surplus for Social Security and for Social Security \nalone.\n  My budget puts a priority on access to health care--without telling \nAmericans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must \nchoose.\n  Many working Americans do not have health care coverage. We will help \nthem buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. And to \nprovide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next 5 years \nwe will double the number of people served at community health care \ncenters.\n  And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage \nyet worry their insurance company does not care and will not pay. \nTogether, this Congress and this President will find common ground to \nmake sure doctors make medical decisions and patients get the health \ncare they deserve with a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care \nthey need, not be forced to go to court because they did not get it. We \nwill ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims, but \nfirst, let us put in place a strong independent review so we promote \nquality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.\n  My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives \nhope to many who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are \nwith one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer, a \nfine representative and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley. God bless \nyou, Joe. And I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to \nhave the Congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  My New Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new \ntechnologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more \nwelcoming. For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we \nmust continue to break down barriers to equality.\n  The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our \ncountry strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United \nStates military. I am requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay \nand benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women in uniform \ngive America their best and we owe them our support.\n  America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through \ntheir military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a \nbillion dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and \nfaster decisions on benefit claims.\n  My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of \ntoxic Brownfields. And I propose we make a major investment in \nconservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Our National Parks have a special place in our country's life. Our \nparks are places of great natural beauty and history. As good stewards, \nwe must leave them better than we have found them, so I propose \nproviding $4.9 billion in resources over 5 years for the upkeep of \nthese national treasures.\n  And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and \ndisadvantaged. We must encourage and support the work of charities and \nfaith-based and community groups that offer help and love one person at \na time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in America, to \nfight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence, to provide a \nhot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children. Government \nshould welcome these groups to apply for funds, not discriminate \nagainst them.\n  Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. And \ngovernment should not fund religious activities. But our Nations should \nsupport the good works of these good people who are helping neighbors \nin need.\n  So I am proposing allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or \nnot, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this \ncould encourage as much as $14 billion a year in new charitable \ngiving--money that will save and change lives.\n  Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for \na Federal Compassion Capital Fund with a focused and noble mission: to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\na mentor to the more than 1 million children with a parent in prison, \nand to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, \ndrug addiction, and other difficult problems.\n  With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome \nMayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and \ncommunity organizations to make a difference in Philadelphia and he has \ninvited me to his city this summer, to see compassion in action.\n  I am personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor \nStreet is a Democrat. Let the record show that I lost his city. But \nsome things are bigger than politics. So I look forward to coming to \nyour city to see your faith-based programs in action.\n  As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too \nmany of our citizens have cause to doubt our Nation's justice when the \nlaw points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals. All \nour citizens are created equal and must be treated equally. Earlier \ntoday I asked Attorney General Ashcroft to develop specific \nrecommendations to end racial profiling. It is wrong. We must end it.\n  In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our Nation's brave police \nofficers. They protect us every day, often at great risk. But by \nstopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our \npolice officers earn and deserve.\n  My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing \noperations, it has funded our Nation's important priorities, it has \nprotected Social Security and Medicare, and our surpluses are big \nenough that there is still money left over.\n  Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. \nI have listened, and I agree.\n  My budget proposal pays down an unprecedented amount of public debt. \nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you \nwill join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years.\n  At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt \nthat is available to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than \nhas ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history.\n  We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of \nthe future. We should approach our Nation's budget as any prudent \nfamily would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional \nspending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we may need to \nincrease defense spending, we may need additional money for our \nfarmers, or additional money to reform Medicare. And so my budget sets \naside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs . . \n. that is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable \nsupporting this budget.\n\n  We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent, we have \nfunded our priorities, we have paid down all the available debt, we \nhave prepared for contingencies--and we still have money left over.\n  Yogi Berra once said: ``When you come to a fork in the road, take \nit.'' Now we come to a fork in the road. We have two choices. Even \nthough we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on more \nand bigger government. That is the road our Nation has traveled in \nrecent years. Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That is \nfar more than our economy grew, far more than personal income grew and \nfar more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on that road, you \nwill spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay \nother bills.\n  Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so \nwe must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American \npeople spend their own money to meet their own needs, to fund their own \npriorities and pay down their own debts. I hope you will join me and \nstand firmly on the side of the people.\n  The growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government \nis charging more than it needs. The people of America have been \novercharged and on their behalf, I am here to ask for a refund.\n  Some say my tax plan is too big, others say it is too small. I \nrespectfully disagree. This tax relief is just right.\n  I did not throw darts at a board to come up with a number for tax \nrelief. I did not take a poll, or develop an arbitrary formula that \nmight sound good. I looked at problems in the tax code and calculated \nthe cost to fix them.\n  A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so \nwe lowered the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third \nof the money they earn in Federal income taxes, so we lowered the top \nrate to 33 percent. This reform will be welcome relief for America's \nsmall businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate, and help \nfor small business means jobs for Americans.\n  We simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax rates from \nthe current five rates to four lower ones: 10, 15, 25, and 33 percent. \nIn my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out . . . every one who \npays income taxes will get tax relief.\n  Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we \nreduced the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support \ntheir children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. It \nis not fair to tax the same earnings twice--once when you earn them, \nand again when you die, so we must repeal the death tax.\n  These changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two \nchildren will save $1,600 a year on their Federal income taxes. Sixteen \nhundred dollars may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to \nmany families. Sixteen hundred dollars buys gas for two cars for an \nentire year, it pays tuition for a year at a community college, it pays \nthe average family grocery bill for 3 months. That is real money.\n  With us tonight, representing many American families, are Steven and \nJosefina Ramos. Please help me welcome them. The Ramoses are from \nPennsylvania, but they could be from any one of your districts. Steven \nis a network administrator for a school district, Josefina is a Spanish \nteacher at a charter school, and they have a 2-year-old daughter, \nLianna. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in \nFederal income taxes; my plan will same them more than $2,000. Let me \ntell you what Steven says: ``Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to \nmy family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of \npaying off our personal debt in two years.'' After that, Steven and \nJosefina want to start saving for Lianna's college education. \nGovernment should never stand in the way of families achieving their \ndreams. The surplus is not the government's money, the surplus is the \npeople's money.\n\n  For lower-income families, my tax relief plan restores basic \nfairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress \nsupporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every \nadditional dollar she earns. Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed \nat nearly 50 percent. This sends a terrible message: You will never get \nahead. But America's message must be different: We must honor hard \nwork, never punish it.\n  With tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the \nwaitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest \npercentage reductions. And millions of additional American families \nwill be removed from the income tax rolls entirely.\n  Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic \nexpansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest \nrates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job \nall by themselves.\n  Forty years ago and then twenty years ago, two Presidents, one \nDemocrat and one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, \nadvocated tax cuts to--in President Kennedy's words--``get this country \nmoving again.''\n  They knew then, what we must do now: To create economic growth and \nopportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who \nbuy goods and create jobs.\n  We must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has \ntestified before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to \nstimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you to give our \neconomy an important jump start by making tax relief retroactive.\n  We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act \nnow because we have other things to do. We must show courage to \nconfront\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\nand resolve tough challenges: to restructure our Nation's defenses, to \nmeet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social \nSecurity.\n  America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present \npeace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work \nwith our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of \nfreedom. We will work for free markets and free trade and freedom from \noppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is \ntheir friend.\n  We will promote our values, and we will promote peace. And we need a \nstrong military to keep the peace. But our military was shaped to \nconfront the challenges of the past. So I have asked the Secretary of \nDefense to review America's armed forces and prepare to transform them \nto meet emerging threats. My budget makes a downpayment on the research \nand development that will be required. Yet, in our broader \ntransformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our \ndefense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around.\n  Our Nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the \n21st century, threats that are more widespread and less certain. They \nrange from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants and rogue \nnations intent on developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect \nour own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must \ndeploy effective missile defenses.\n  And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and \nreduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs.\n  A strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom. Yet \nthe cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves \nand our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and \nproducts that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade \nbrings greater political and personal freedom.\n  Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate \nfar-reaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong \nhand of presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.\n  As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high costs \nof energy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national \nenergy policy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has \nresulted in high prices and uncertainty. I have asked Federal agencies \nto work with California officials to help speed construction of new \nenergy sources. And I have directed Vice President Cheney, Commerce \nSecretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and other senior members of \nmy Administration to recommend a national energy policy.\n  Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at \nhome while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more \nelectricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative \nenergy sources and conservation, and we must. America must become more \nenergy independent.\n  Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be \nreforming Medicare and Social Security.\n  Medicare's finances are strained and its coverage is outdated. \nNinety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form \nof prescription drug coverage . . . Medicare does not. The framework \nfor reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux and \nCongressman Thomas, and now, it is time to act. Medicare must be \nmodernized. And we must make sure that every senior on Medicare can \nchoose a health plan that offers prescription drugs.\n  Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim \nSocial Security benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows that Social \nSecurity is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only \nhave a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country \nwill one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll \ntaxes, or a radical cut in retirement benefits. There is a better way.\n  This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social \nSecurity. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. \nReform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the \nbenefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must \nreturn Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offer \npersonal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.\n  Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on \nthe money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must \nincrease that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound \ninvestments at a higher rate of return.\n  Ownership, access to wealth, and independence should not be the \nprivilege of a few. They are the hope of every American . . . and we \nmust make them the foundation of Social Security.\n  By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible \nwith our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And, we \ncan add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and \ncampaign finance reforms.\n  The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great \ncountry. America is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much \nhas been given to us, and much is expected.\n  Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our \ngood will must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisanship is more than \nminding our manners, it is doing our duty.\n  No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. At \nso many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the \ncollected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk \nthrough Statuary Hall, and see those men and women of marble, we are \nreminded of their courage and achievement.\n  Yet America's purpose is never found in statues or history. America's \npurpose always stands before us.\n  Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our Nation \nhas always shown in times of crisis. And our courage issue by issue, \ncan gather to greatness, and serve our country. This is the privilege, \nand responsibility, we share. And if we work together, we can prove \nthat public service is noble.\n  We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to \naccomplish, and promises to keep. Juntos podemos, together we can. We \ncan make Americans proud of their government. Together we can share in \nthe credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and \njust--and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens, the \nhighest possible praise: well done, good and faithful servants.\n  Thank you. Good night. And God Bless America.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to grant a Federal Charter to Korean War Veterans \nAssociation, Incorporated, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \ntogether with Senators Warner, Campbell, and Murray, which would grant \na Federal Charter to the Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated. \nThis legislation recognizes and honors the 5.7 million Americans who \nfought and served during the Korean War for their struggles and \nsacrifices on behalf of freedom and the principles and ideals of our \nnation.\n  The year 2000 marked the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. In June \n1950 when the North Korea People's Army swept across the 38th Parallel \nto occupy Seoul, South Korea, members of our Armed Forces--including \nmany from the State of Maryland--immediately answered the call of the \nU.N. to repel this forceful invasion. Without hesitation, these \nsoldiers traveled to an unfamiliar corner of the world to join an \nunprecedented multinational force comprised of 22 countries and risked \ntheir lives to protect freedom. The Americans who led this \ninternational effort were true patriots who fought with remarkable \ncourage.\n  In battles such as Pork Chop Hill, the Inchon Landing and the frozen \nChosin Reservoir, which was fought in temperatures as low as fifty-\nseven degrees below zero, they faced some of the most brutal combat in \nhistory. By the time the fighting had ended, 8,176 Americans were \nlisted as missing or prisoners of war--some of whom are still missing--\nand over 36,000 Americans had died. One hundred and thirty-one Korean \nWar Veterans were awarded the nation's highest commendation for combat \nbravery, the Medal of Honor. Ninety-four of these soldiers gave their \nlives in the process. There is an engraving on the Korean War Veterans \nMemorial which reflects these losses and how brutal a war this was. It \nreads, ``Freedom is not Free.'' Yet, as a Nation, we have done little \nmore than establish this memorial to publicly acknowledge the bravery \nof those who fought the Korean War. The Korean War has been termed by \nmany as the ``Forgotten War.'' Freedom is not free. We owe our Korean \nWar Veterans a debt of gratitude. Granting this Federal charter--at no \ncost to the government--is a small expression of appreciation that we \nas a Nation can offer to these men and women, one which will enable \nthem to work as a unified front to ensure that the ``Forgotten War'' is \nforgotten no more.\n  The Korean War Veterans Association was originally incorporated on \nJune 25, 1985. Since its first annual reunion and memorial service in \nArlington, Virginia, where its members decided to develop a national \nfocus and strong commitment to service, the association has grown \nsubstantially to a membership of over 17,000. A Federal charter would \nallow the Association to continue and grow its mission and further its \ncharitable and benevolent causes. Specifically, it will afford the \nKorean War Veterans' Association the same status as other major \nveterans organizations and allow it to participate as part of select \ncommittees with other congressionally chartered veterans and military \ngroups. A Federal charter will also accelerate the Association's \n``accreditation'' with the Department of Veterans Affairs which will \nenable its members to assist in processing veterans' claims.\n  The Korean War Veterans have asked for very little in return for \ntheir service and sacrifice. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation and ask that the text of the measure be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my comments.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated.....120101''.....\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 393. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage charitable contributions to public charities for use in \nmedical research, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation, the Paul Coverdell Medical Research Investment Act.\n  Under the current tax code, deductible charitable cash gifts to \nsupport medical research are limited to 50% of an individual's adjusted \ngross income. This bill would simply increase the deductibility of cash \ngifts for medical research to 80 percent of an individual's adjusted \ngross income. For those individuals who are willing and able to give \nmore than 80 percent of their income, the bill also extends the period \nan individual can carry the deduction forward for excess charitable \ngifts from five years to ten years.\n  In what is perhaps the most important change for today's economy, the \nbill allows taxpayers to donate stock without being penalized for it. \nAmericans regularly donate stock acquired through a stock option plan \nto their favorite charity. And often they make the donation within a \nyear of exercising their stock options. But current law penalizes these \ndonations by taxing them as ordinary income or as capital gain. These \ntaxes can run as high as 40 percent, which acts as a disincentive to \ncontribute to charities. How absurd that someone who donates $1,000 to \na charity has to sell $1,400 of stock to pay for it. The person could \nwait a year and give the stock then, but why delay the contribution \nwhen that money can be put to work curing disease today. The Paul \nCoverdell MRI Act is premised on a simple truth: people should not be \npenalized for helping others.\n  PriceWaterhouseCoopers, relying on IRS data and studies of charitable \ngiving, conducted a study on the effects of the Paul Coverdell MRI Act. \nIt concluded that if the proposal were in effect last year there would \nhave been a 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent increase in individual giving in \n2000. This amounts to $180.4 million additional dollars in charitable \ndonations for medical research dollars that would result in tangible \nhealth benefits to all Americans. If the additional giving grew every \nyear over five years at the same rate as national income, a billion \ndollars more would be put to work to cure disease. Over the course of \nten years, the number jumps to $2.3 billion in new money for medical \nresearch. For many research efforts, that money could mean the \ndifference between finding a cure or not finding a cure.\n  The returns from increased funding of medical research not only in \neconomic sayings to the country, but in terms of curing disease and \nfinding new treatments could be enormous. The amount and impact of \ndisease in this country is staggering. Each day more than 1,500 \nAmericans die of cancer. Sixteen million people have diabetes, their \nlives are shortened by an average of fifteen years. Cardiovascular \ndiseases take approximately one million American lives a year. One and \na half million people have Parkinson's Disease. Countless families \nsuffer with the pain of a loved one who has Alzheimer's. And yet these \ndiseases go without a cure. We must work towards the day when they are \ncured, prevented, or eliminated--just like polio and smallpox were \nyears ago.\n  Increased funding of medical research by the private sector is needed \nto save and improve American lives. New discoveries in science and \ntechnology are creating even greater opportunities than in the past for \nlarge returns from money invested in medical research. The mapping of \nthe human genome is but one example. Dr. Abraham Lieberman, a \nneurologist at the National Parkinson's Foundation, was quoted in \nNewsweek as saying that the medical research community today is \n``standing at the same threshold that we reached with infectious \ndisease 100 years ago.''\n  The Paul Coverdell MRI Act encourages the financial gifts that will \nenable that threshold to be overcome. I hope you will join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make an urgent supplemental appropriation for \nfiscal year 2001 for the Department of Defense for the Defense Health \nProgram; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as many Senators know, there has been a \nmajor problem in funding for health care for military families and \nmilitary retirees since 1993. Budgets for the Defense Health Program \nhave been submitted to Congress without requesting enough spending to \ncover all known medical and health care expenses.\n  This problem has been recurring year after year because budget \nofficials in the Department of Defense had been ``low balling'' their \npredictions of inflation in DoD's Defense Health Program; they have \nprojected medical inflation at or below the overall economy's rate. \nMeanwhile, medical care costs have grown well above the national \ninflation rate.\n  Since 1996 DoD has projected an average annual inflation rate of 1.8 \npercent in the Defense Health Program, but the actual average rate over \nthat time period is 4.9 percent.\n  Just last year, DoD predicted 2.1 percent inflation for the Defense \nHealth Program in 2001; experts are predicting the rate to be 7.9 \npercent.\n  This unacceptable budgeting practice has resulted in expenses being \nincurred but no funds to pay the bills. Congress has responded by \nfunding these gaps with additional spending, usually in emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bills.\n  While we have addressed the problem when we ultimately learn the size \nof the funding gap, the inappropriate budgeting practices of the past \nhave had a major negative impact on military service men and women, \nmilitary retirees, and the dependents of both.\n  When military medical personnel and civilian providers do not know if \nor when they will receive full funding, appointments for healthcare can \nbe complicated, and the services rendered can be delayed or degraded. A \nsystem that many already find troublesome can become exasperating.\n  This problem is not small; it directly affects an active beneficiary \npopulation of almost six million, including 1.5 million active duty \nservicemen and women, 1 million retirees, and 3.3 family dependents.\n  For several years the problem has been growing, from approximately \n$240 million in 1994 to as much as $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2000. \nCoincident with the enactment of ``Tricare for Life'' and other new \nhealth care benefits in the Defense Authorization Act for 2001, the \nproblem has remained at this all time high level and is currently \nestimated to be $1.2 billion for 2001. Some predict it may ultimately \nbe $1.4 billion before the year is over.\n  President Bush has already pledged that he will fully fund Tricare \ncosts in 2002 at an estimated $3.9 billion, and I have every \nexpectation that with the proper advice he will also fully fund all \n2002 Defense Health Program costs. However, the earlier 2001 funding \ngap remains, and I believe Congress can and should act as promptly as \npossible to fully fund all known costs.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing legislation to provide a supplemental \nappropriation of the currently estimated $1.2 billion for the Defense \nHealth Program for 2001.\n  Because the money is needed on an urgent basis, I will discuss how we \ncan address this matter with the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee when he convenes a meeting of the Defense Subcommittee on \nFebruary 28 to conduct hearings on the Military Health System. I fully \nexpect that we will act as promptly as possible and in time to address \nreal needs.\n\n  I am also announcing four specific recommendations for the Defense \nHealth Program I will make as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nfor the 2002 congressional budget resolution:\n  Sufficient budget authority and outlays to enable the enactment of \nthe 2001 appropriations legislation I am introducing today.\n  An additional $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2002 to accommodate actual \ninflation in DoD health care, rather than the unrealistic under-\nestimate left by the officials of the outgoing Administration.\n  To accommodate future inflation, the budget resolution will also \nprovide the requisite amounts of budget authority and outlays to \naccommodate 5 percent inflation for the next ten years. While I have \nevery expectation that President Bush and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nwill address this underfunding in the 2002 budget, I am adding these \namounts, totaling $18 billion over 10 years, just in case their review \nof the defense budget has not yet addressed the unacceptable budgeting \npractices of the past.\n  In its current estimates, the Congressional Budget Office has not \nincluded additional discretionary spending in its ``baseline'' for the \n``Tricare for Life'' program. The technical reasons for this are \nesoteric, but the money is substantial, $9.8 billion over 10 years. If \nthis money were not also added now, we would just be engaging in \nanother form of underfunding.\n  Congress and the executive branch have made various promises to both \nactive duty and retired military personnel for their healthcare and the \nhealthcare of their dependents. It is unacceptable to make these \npromises but not to include in the budget the money required to make \ngood on them. The steps I am taking today are the first steps toward \nmaking that happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 395. A bill to ensure the independence and nonpartisan operation \nof the\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nOffice of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration; to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Independent Office \nof Advocacy Act of 2001. This bill is designed to build on the success \nachieved by the Office of Advocacy over the past 24 years. It is \nintended to strengthen that foundation to make the Office of Advocacy a \nstronger, more effective advocate for all small businesses throughout \nthe United States. This bill was approved unanimously by the Senate \nduring the 106th Congress; however, it was not taken up in the House of \nRepresentatives prior to the adjournment last month. It is my \nunderstanding the House Committee on Small Business under its new \nchairman, Don Manzullo, is likely to act on similar legislation this \nyear.\n  The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal \nGovernment. It is part of the Small Business Administration, SBA/\nAgency, and its director, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the \nOffice is also intended to be the independent voice for small business \nwithin the Federal Government. It is supposed to develop proposals for \nchanging government policies to help small businesses, and it is \nsupposed to represent the views and interests of small businesses \nbefore other Federal agencies.\n  As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the \nindependent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also \na part of the President's administration. As you can imagine, those are \nsometimes difficult roles to play simultaneously.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2001 would make the Office \nof Advocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent \nadvocate within the executive branch acting on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the \nOffice of Advocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses regardless \nof the position taken on critical issues by the President and his \nadministration.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2001 would direct the Chief \nCounsel to submit an annual report on Federal agency compliance with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act to the President and the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business. The Reg Flex Act is a very \nimportant weapon in the war against the over-regulation of small \nbusinesses. When the Senate first debated this bill in the 106th \nCongress, I offered an amendment at the request of Senator Fred \nThompson, chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, that would \ndirect the Chief Counsel for Advocacy to send a copy of the report to \nthe Senate Government Affairs Committee. In addition, my amendment also \nrequired that copies of the report be sent to the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary. \nI believe these changes make good sense for each of the committees to \nreceive this report on Reg Flex compliance, and I have included them in \nthe version of the bill being introduced and debated today.\n  The Office of Advocacy as envisioned by the Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act 2001 would be unique within the executive branch. The \nChief Counsel for Advocacy would be a wide-ranging advocate, who would \nbe free to take positions contrary to the administration's policies and \nto advocate change in government programs and attitudes as they impact \nsmall businesses. During its consideration of the bill in 1999, the \nCommittee on Small Business adopted unanimously an amendment I offered, \nwhich was cosponsored by Senator John Kerry, the committee's ranking \nDemocrat, to require the Chief Counsel to be appointed ``from civilian \nlife.'' This qualification is intended to emphasize that the person \nnominated to serve in this important role should have a strong small \nbusiness background.\n  In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be \nthe eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal \nGovernment. Over time, it has been assumed that the Office of Advocacy \nis the ``independent'' voice for small business. While I strongly \nbelieve that the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel should be \nindependent and free to advocate or support positions that might be \ncontrary to the administration's policies, I have come to find that the \nOffice has not been as independent as necessary to do the job for small \nbusiness.\n  For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy comes from the \nsalaries and expense account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated \nby the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall \nstaff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time \nemployees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. Today's allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually on-\nboard as the result of the longstanding hiring freeze at the SBA. The \nindependence of the Office is diminished when the Office of Advocacy \nstaff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for new programs and \nadditional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the discretion of the \nAdministrator.\n  In addition, the General Accounting Office, GAO, undertook a report \nfor me on personnel practices at the SBA, GAO/GGD-99-68. I was alarmed \nby the GAO's finding that during the past eight years, the Assistant \nAdvocates and Regional Advocates hired by the Office of Advocacy shared \nmany of the attributes of schedule C political appointees. In fact \nRegional Advocates are frequently cleared by the White House personnel \noffice--the same procedure followed for approving Schedule C political \nappointees.\n\n  The facts discussed in the GAO report cast the Office of Advocacy in \na whole new light. The report raised questions, concerns and suspicions \nregarding the independence of the Office of Advocacy. Has there been a \ntime when the Office did not pursue a matter as vigorously as it might \nhave were it not for direct or indirect political influence? Prior to \nreceipt of the GAO Report, my response was a resounding ``No.'' But \nsince receipt of the GAO report, a question mark arises.\n  Let me take a moment and note that I will be unrelenting in my \nefforts to insure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy \nin all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all small \nbusinesses. However, so long as the administration controls the budget \nallocated to the Office of Advocacy and controls who is hired, the \nindependence of the Office may be in jeopardy. We must correct this \nsituation, and the sooner we do it, the better it will be for the small \nbusiness community. As our government is changing over to President \nBush's administration, this would be a opportune time to establish, \nonce and for all, the actual independence of the Office of Advocacy.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2001 builds a firewall to \nprevent the political intrusion into the management of day-to-day \noperations of the Office of Advocacy. The bill would require that the \nSBA's budget include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy. No \nlonger would its funds come from the general operating account of the \nAgency. The separate account would also provide for the number of full-\ntime employees who would work within the Office of Advocacy. No longer \nwould the Chief Counsel for Advocacy have to seek approval from the SBA \nAdministrator to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n  The bill would also continue the practice of allowing the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nAdvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by federal law and the Office of Personnel Management, (OPM). \nI believe this special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Council to hire quickly those persons who can best \nasset the Office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  Mr. President, the Independent Office of Advocacy Act is a sound \nbill. It is the product of a great deal of thoughtful, objective review \nand consideration by me, the staff of the Committee on Small Business, \nrepresentatives of the small business community, former Chief Counsels \nfor Advocacy and others. These individuals have also devoted much time \nand effort in actively participating in a committee roundtable \ndiscussion on the Office of Advocacy, which my committee held on April \n21, 1999. As I stated earlier, the\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\nCommittee on Small Business approved this bill by a unanimous 17-0 \nvote, and it was later approved unanimously by the Senate. I urge each \nof my colleagues to review this legislation closely.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) excessive regulations continue to burden United States \n     small businesses;\n       (2) Federal agencies are reluctant to comply with the \n     requirements of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     continue to propose regulations that impose disproportionate \n     burdens on small businesses;\n       (3) the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration (referred to in this Act as the ``Office'') is \n     an effective advocate for small businesses that can help to \n     ensure that agencies are responsive to small businesses and \n     that agencies comply with their statutory obligations under \n     chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, and under the Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public \n     Law 104-121; 106 Stat. 4249 et seq.);\n       (4) the independence of the Office is essential to ensure \n     that it can serve as an effective advocate for small \n     businesses without being restricted by the views or policies \n     of the Small Business Administration or any other executive \n     branch agency;\n       (5) the Office needs sufficient resources to conduct the \n     research required to assess effectively the impact of \n     regulations on small businesses; and\n       (6) the research, information, and expertise of the Office \n     make it a valuable adviser to Congress as well as the \n     executive branch agencies with which the Office works on \n     behalf of small businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, Kit \nBond, in introducing the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act.'' This \nlegislation will help ensure the Small Business Administration's (SBA) \nOffice of Advocacy has the necessary autonomy to remain an independent \nvoice for America's small businesses. I would like to thank the \nChairman and his staff for working with me and my staff to make the \nnecessary changes to this legislation to garner bipartisan support.\n  This legislation is similar to a bill introduced by Chairman Bond, \nwhich I supported, during the 106th Congress. While this legislation \nreceived strong support in the Senate Committee on Small Business and \non the floor of the Senate, the House did not take any action. I am \nhopeful that this legislation will be enacted during the 107th \nCongress.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act rewrites the law that created \nthe Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy to allow for \nincreased autonomy. It reaffirms the Office's statutory and financial \nindependence by preventing the President from firing the advocate \nwithout 30 days prior notice to Congress and by creating a separate \nauthorization for the Office from that of SBA's. It also states that \nthe Chief Counsel shall be appointed without regard to political \naffiliation, and shall not have served in the Administration for a \nperiod of 5 years prior to the date of appointment.\n  The legislation also makes women-owned businesses an equal priority \nof the Office of Advocacy by adding women-owned business to the primary \nfunctions of the Office of Advocacy, wherever minority owned business \nappears. It also adds new reporting requirements and additional \nfunctions to the Office of Advocacy with regard to enforcement of the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA. The \nprovisions regarding SBREFA are already a part of existing law in \nChapter 6 Title 5 of US Code, and will now, rightly, be added to the \nstatute establishing the Office of Advocacy.\n  But at its heart, this legislation will allow the Office of Advocacy \nto better represent small business interests before Congress, Federal \nagencies, and the Federal Government without fear of reprisal for \ndisagreeing with the position of the current Administration.\n  For those of my colleagues without an intimate knowledge of the \nimportant role the Office of Advocacy and its Chief Counsel play in \nprotecting and promoting America's small businesses, I will briefly \nelaborate its important functions and achievements. From studying the \nrole of small business in the U.S. economy, to promoting small business \nexports, to lightening the regulatory burden of small businesses \nthrough the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, the Office of Advocacy has \na wide scope of authority and responsibility.\n  The U.S. Congress created the Office of Advocacy, headed by a Chief \nCounsel to be appointed by the President from the private sector and \nconfirmed by the Senate, in June of 1976. The rationale was to give \nsmall businesses a louder voice in the councils of government.\n  Each year, the Office of Advocacy works to facilitate meetings for \nsmall business people with congressional staff and executive branch \nofficials, and convenes ad hoc issue-specific meetings to discuss small \nbusiness concerns. It has published numerous reports, compiled vast \namounts of data and successfully lightened the regulatory burden on \nAmerica's small businesses. In the area of contracting, the Office of \nAdvocacy developed PRO- Net, a database of small businesses used by \ncontracting officers to find small businesses interested in selling to \nthe Federal government.\n  The U.S. Congress, the Administration and of course, small \nbusinesses, have all benefitted from the work of the Office of \nAdvocacy. For example, between 1998 and 2000, regulatory changes \nsupported by the Office of Advocacy saved small businesses around $20 \nbillion in annual and one-time compliance costs.\n  Mr. President, small businesses remain the backbone of the U.S. \neconomy, accounting for 99 percent of all employers, providing 75 \npercent of all net new jobs, and accounting for 51 percent of private-\nsector output. In fact, and this may surprise some of my colleagues, \nsmall businesses employ 38 percent of high-tech workers, an \nincreasingly important sector in our economy.\n  Small businesses have also taken the lead in moving people from \nwelfare to work and an increasing number of women and minorities are \nturning to small business ownership as a means to gain economic self-\nsufficiency. Put simply, small businesses represent what is best in the \nUnited States economy, providing innovation, competition and \nentrepreneurship.\n  Their interests are vast, their activities divergent, and the \ndifficulties they face to stay in business are numerous. To provide the \nnecessary support to help them, SBA's Office of Advocacy needs our \nsupport.\n  The responsibility and authority given the Office of Advocacy and the \nChief Counsel are crucial to their ability to be an effective \nindependent voice in the Federal Government for small businesses. When \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business held a Roundtable meeting about \nthe Office of Advocacy with small business concerns on April 21, 1999, \nevery person in the room was concerned about the present and future \nstate of affairs for the Office of Advocacy. These small businesses \nasked us to do everything we could to protect and strengthen this \nimportant office. I believe this legislation accomplishes this \nimportant goal.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of the Office of Advocacy and I \nam pleased to join with Chairman Bond in introducing this legislation, \nwhich will ensure that it remains an independent and effective voice \nrepresenting America's small businesses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 396. A bill to provide for national quadrennial summits on small \nbusiness and State summits on small business, to establish the White \nHouse Quadrennial Commission on Small Business, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Small Business.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I am \nintroducing\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\nthe White House Quadrennial Small Business Summit Act of 2001. This \nbill is designed to create a permanent independent commission that will \ncarry-on the extraordinary work that has been accomplished by three \nWhite House Conferences on Small Business. The Small Business \nCommission will direct national and state Small business summits, and \nsmall business delegates from every state will attend the summits.\n  Last year, representatives of small businesses and organizers of \nprior White House Conferences on Small Business worked closely with the \nCommittee on Small Business to develop legislation similar to the bill \nI am introducing today. The bill passed the Senate last year as part of \nthe Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, S. 3121; however, it \nwas dropped in Conference.\n  For the past 15 years, small businesses have been the fastest growing \nsector of the U.S. economy. When large businesses were restructuring \nand laying off significant numbers of workers, small businesses not \nonly filled the gap, but their growth actually caused a net increase in \nnew jobs. Today, small businesses employ over one-half of all workers \nin the United States, and they generate nearly 55 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. Were it not for small businesses, our country could \nnot have experienced the sustained economic upsurge that has been \nongoing since 1992.\n  Because small businesses play such a significant role in our economy, \nin both rural towns and bustling inner cities, I believe it is \nimportant that the Federal government sponsor a national conference \nevery four years to highlight the successes of small businesses and to \nfocus national attention on the problems that may be hindering the \nability of small businesses to start up and grow.\n  Small business ownership is, has been, and will continue to be the \ndream of millions of Americans. Countries from all over the world send \ndelegations to the United states to study why our system of small \nbusiness ownership is so successful, all the while looking for a way to \nduplicate our success in their countries. Because we see and experience \nthe successes of small businesses on a daily basis, it is easy to lose \nsight of the very special thing we have going for us in the United \nStates, where each of us can have the opportunity to own and run our \nown business.\n  The White House Quadrennial Small Business Summit Act of 2001 is \ndesigned to capture and focus our attention on small business every \nfour years. In this way, we will take the opportunity to study what is \nhappening throughout the United States to small businesses. In one \nsense, the bill is designed to put small business on a pinnacle so we \ncan appreciate what they have accomplished. At the same time, and just \nas important, every four years we will have an opportunity to learn \nfrom small businesses in each state what is not going well for them, \nsuch as, actions by the Federal government that hinder small business \ngrowth or state and local regulations that are a deterrent to starting \na business.\n  My bill creates an independent, bipartisan White House Quadrennial \nCommission on Small Business, which will be made up of 8 small business \nadvocates and the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy. Every four years, during the first year following a \npresidential election, the President will name four \nNational Commissioners. In the U.S. Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of each body \nwill each name one National Commissioner.\n\n  Widespread participation from small businesses in each state will \ncontribute to the work leading up to the national Small Business \nSummit. Under the bill, the Small Business Summit will take place one \nyear after the Quadrennial Commissioners are appointed. The first act \nof the Commissioners will be to request that each Governor and each \nU.S. Senator name a small business delegate and alternate delegate from \ntheir respective states to the National Convention. Each U.S. \nRepresentative will be asked to name a small business delegate and \nalternative from his or her Congressional district. And the President \nwill name a delegate and alternate from each state.\n  The delegates to the Small Business Summit must be owners or officers \nof small businesses. Prior to the national Small Business Summit, there \nwill be individual State Summits at which additional delegates will be \nelected to attend the national Summit. Three delegates and three \nalternates will be elected from each Congressional district within the \nstate.\n  The small busines delegates will play a major role leading up to the \nSmall Business Summit. We will be looking to the small business \ndelegates to develop and highlight issues of critical concern to small \nbusinesses. The work at the state level by the small business delegates \nwill need to be thorough and thoughtful to make the Small Business \nSummit a success.\n  My goal will be for the small business delegates to think broadly, \nthat is, to think ``out of the box.'' Their attention should include \nbut not be restricted to the traditional issues associated with small \nbusiness concerns, such as access to capital, tax reform and regulatory \nreform. In my role as Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I \nwill urge the delegates to focus on a wide array of issues that impact \nsignificantly on small businesses, including the importance of a solid \neducation and the need for skilled, trained workers.\n  Once the small business delegates are selected, the Small Business \nCommission will serve as a resource to the delegates for issue \ndevelopment and for planning the State Conferences. The Small Business \nCommission will have a modest staff, including an Executive Director, \nthat will work full time to make the State and National Summits \nsuccesses. A major resource to the Small Business Commission and its \nstaff will be the Chief Counsel for Advocacy from the SBA. The Chief \nCounsel and the Office of Advocacy will serve as a major resource to \nthe Small Business Commission, and in turn, to the small business \ndelegates, by providing them with both substantive background \ninformaiton and other administrative materials in support of the State \nand National Summits.\n  Mr. President, small businesses generally do not have the resources \nto maintain full time representatives to lobby our Federal government. \nThey are too busy running their businesses to devote much attention to \neducating government officials as to what is going well, what is going \npoorly, and what needs improvement for the small business community. \nThe White House Quadrennial Small Business Summit will give small \nbusinesses an opportunity every four years to make its mark on the \nCongress and the Executive Branch. I urge each of my colleagues to \nreview their proposal, and I hope they will agree to join me as \ncosponsors of the ``White House Quadrennial Small Busines Summit Act of \n2001.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act \nof 1990 to authorize additional rounds of base closures and \nrealignments under the Act in 2003 and 2005, to modify certain \nauthorities relating to closures and realignments under that Act; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould authorize two rounds of U.S. military installation realignment \nand closures to occur in 2003 and 2005. I am pleased to have Senators \nLevin, Hagel, Lieberman, Kyl, Reed, Kohl, Voinovich, Feingold, Jeffords \nand DeWine as co-sponsors of this bill.\n  Although I would prefer to say that this is a new idea--it isn't. In \n1970, the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, ``Fithugh Commission'') made \nreference to ``consolidation of military activities at fewer \ninstallations would contribute to more efficient operations and would \nproduce substantial savings.'' In 1983, the President's Private Sector \nSurvey on Cost Control, ``Grace Commission'' made strong \nrecommendations for military base closures. In 1997, the Quadrennial \nDefense Review recommended that, even after four base closure rounds in \n1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995, the Armed Forces ``must shed excess \ninfrastructure.'' Likewise, the 1997 Defense Reform Initiative and the \nNational Defense Panel ``strongly urged Congress and the Department of \nDefense to move quickly to restore the base realignment and closure, \nBRAC, process.''\n  Mr. President, we have too many military bases. The cold war is over. \nWe will never have a requirement for as many bases as we have today. \nClearly we could save, according to most conservative estimates, \nsomewhere between $3 and $4 billion a year of taxpayer dollars that are \nnow expended unnecessarily on keeping military bases open.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, former Secretaries Dick Cheney and \nWilliam Cohen, nearly all the Service Chiefs and other respected \ndefense experts have been consistent in their plea that the Pentagon be \npermitted to divest themselves of excess infrastructure beyond what was \neliminated during the prior rounds of base closings. Through the end of \n1998, the Pentagon had closed 97 major bases in the United States after \nfour previous rounds of BRAC. Since then, it has closed none. Moreover, \nthe savings from closing additional unneeded bases should be used for \nforce modernization purposes.\n  We have heard over the last several years of the dire situation of \nour military forces. We have heard testimony of plunging readiness, \nmodernization programs that are decades behind schedule, and quality of \nlife deficiencies that are so great we cannot retain or recruit the \npersonnel we need. As a result of this realization, there has been a \ngroundswell of support in Congress for the Armed Forces, including a \nnumber of pay, retirement and medical benefit initiatives and the \npromise of a significant increase in defense spending.\n  All of these proposals are excellent starting points to help rebuild \nour military, but we must not forget that much of it will be in vain if \nthe Department of Defense is obligated to maintain 23 percent excess \ncapacity in infrastructure. When we actually look for the dollars to \npay for these initiatives, it is unconscionable that some would not \nlook to the billions of dollars to be saved by base realignment and \nclosure. Only 30 percent of the defense budget funds combat forces, \nwhile the remaining 70 percent is devoted to support functions such as \nbases. Continuing to squander precious dollars in this manner will make \nit impossible for us to adequately modernize our forces for the future. \nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated repeatedly that they desire more \nopportunities to streamline the military's infrastructure. We cannot \nsit idly by and throw money and ideas at the problem when part of the \nsolution is staring us in the face.\n\n  This proposed legislation offers a significant change to present law. \nUnder this legislation, privatization in-place would be permitted only \nwhen explicitly recommended by the Commission. Additionally, the \nSecretary of Defense must consider local government input in preparing \nhis list of desired base closures.\n  Total BRAC savings realized from the four previous closure rounds \nexceed total costs to date. Department of Defense figures suggest \nprevious base closures will save, after one-time closing costs, $15 \nbillion through fiscal year 2001, $25 billion through fiscal year 2003 \nand $6.1 billion a year thereafter. Additional needed closures can save \n$20 billion by 2015, and $3 billion a year thereafter. Sooner or later \nthese surplus bases will be closed anyway. The sooner the issue is \naddressed, the greater will be the savings that will ultimately go \ntoward defense modernization and greater pay raises for service \nmembers.\n  Previous base closure rounds have had many success stories. For \nexample, after England Air Force Base closed in 1992, Alexandria, \nLouisiana benefitted from the creation of over 1,400 jobs--nearly \ndouble the number of jobs lost. Across the U.S. about 60,000 new jobs \nhave been created at closing military bases. At bases closed more than \n2 years, nearly 75 percent of the civilian jobs have been replaced.\n  In Charleston, South Carolina, where the number of defense job \nlosses, as a percentage of the work force, was greater than at any \nother base closure location, 23 major entities are reusing the former \nNavy facilities and providing more than 3,300 jobs and another 13 more \ncivilian industrial applications are pending adding soon even more \nnewly created jobs to that number. Additionally, roughly 75 percent of \nthe 6 million square feet of leasable space on the base is occupied. \nThis is comparable to the successes in my home state of Arizona with \nthe closure of Williams Air Force Base in the Phoenix East Valley. This \nis not to say that base closures are easy for any community, but it \ndoes suggest that communities can and will continue to thrive.\n  We can continue to maintain a military infrastructure that we do not \nneed, or we can provide the necessary funds to ensure our military can \nfight and win future wars. Every dollar we spend on bases we do not \nneed is a dollar we cannot spend on training our troops, keeping \npersonnel quality of life at an appropriate level, maintaining force \nstructure, replacing old weapons systems, and advancing our military \ntechnology.\n  We must finish the job we started by authorizing these two final \nrounds of base realignment and closure. I urge my colleagues to join us \nin support of this critical bill and to work diligently throughout the \nyear to put aside local politics for what is clearly in the best \ninterest of our military forces.\n  Mr. President, I believe this measure is long overdue. I believe the \nadditional $3 to $4 billion a year we could save by closing unnecessary \nbases could be used for the betterment of the quality of life of our \nmen and women in the military. I believe it is hard to understand why, \nwhen the overwhelming majority of outside opinion, whether it be \nliberal or conservative organizations that are watchdogs of our defense \npolicies and programs, all agree we have too many bases. We needed \nthese bases during the cold war and we needed them very badly. They \nobviously contributed enormously to our ability to win the cold war. No \none envisions future threats that would require the\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\nnumber of bases that are part of our military establishment today.\n  I hope that the chairmen of the Armed Services Committee in past \nyears who have strongly opposed base closing rounds will now join with \nme and others in seeing this legislation through the Armed Services \nCommittee and to the floor of the Senate.\n  It makes sense. I believe that the record is replete with examples of \nbases that have been closed which ultimately after a period of a few \nyears have ended up of greater benefit to the surrounding communities \nthan when the bases were military bases. But more importantly than \nthat, we simply can't afford some of them as we make the tough \ndecisions and follow the President's guidance on the fundamental \nreevaluation of our systems technology and weapons systems that we need \nto make in order to meet the challenges of the post-cold-war era. A \npart of that is to make available as much funding as possible not only \nfor the quality of life of the men and women in the military but for \nour ability to develop a viable missile defense system, and to bring to \nour military the best equipment that this Nation's technology can \nprovide.\n  I hope we will move on this issue. I anticipate, hopefully, that the \nadministration will also, again as past administrations have, support \nanother round of base closings.\n  I ask unanimous consent the bill be referred to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill \nwill be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill to \nauthorize two additional base realignment and closure rounds be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 397\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join my \ncolleague from the Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain, along with \nour cosponsors Senators Lieberman, Voinovich, Reed, Kyl, Hagel, Kohl, \nFeingold, DeWine, and Jeffords in introducing legislation that allows \nthe Department of Defense to close excess, unneeded military bases.\n  For the past four years, former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen asked \nthe Congress to authorize two additional base closure rounds. But \nCongress did not act.\n  We have a new Congress, a new President, and a new Secretary of \nDefense, but we also have some unfinished business to attend to. Base \nclosure is one of the most important examples. And as we promised we \nwould be, Senator McCain and I and our cosponsors are back.\n  General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nother chiefs have repeatedly said we need to close more military bases, \nand I expect they will once again tell us we need to realign or close \nmore bases when the President's budget is submitted later this year.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is intended to start the \ndebate, and I hope the administration will make a similar legislative \nproposal to the Congress.\n  This legislation calls for two additional base closure rounds, in \n2003 and 2005, that would basically follow the same procedures that \nwere used in 1991, 1993 and 1995, with two notable exceptions.\n  First, the whole process would start and finish two months later in \n2005 than it would in 2003 and did in previous rounds, to give a new \nPresident, if there is one in 2005, sufficient time to nominate \ncommissioners.\n  Second, under our legislation, privatization in place would not be \npermitted at closing installation unless the Base Closure Commission \nexpressly recommends it.\n  In a November 1998 report, the General Accounting Office listed five \nkey elements of the base closure process that ``contributed to the \nsuccess of prior rounds''. Our legislation retains all of those key \nelements. GAO also stated that they ``have not identified any long-term \nreadiness problems that were related to domestic base realignments and \nclosures, that ``DOD continues to retain excess capacity'' and that \n``substantial savings are expected'' from base closures.\n  Mr. President, every expert and every study agrees on the basic \nfacts--the Defense Department has more bases than it needs, and closing \nbases saves substantial money over time, usually within a few years.\n  The April 1998 report the Department of Defense provided to the \nCongress clearly demonstrated that we have excess capacity. For \nexample, the report showed that by 2003:\n  The Army will have reduced its classroom training personnel by 43 \npercent, while classroom space will have been reduced by only 7 \npercent.\n  The Air Force will have reduced the number of fighters and other \nsmall aircraft by 53 percent since 1989, while the base structure for \nthose aircraft will be only 35 percent smaller.\n  The Navy will have 33 percent more hangars for its aircraft than it \nrequires.\n  Experts inside and outside of Government agree with the Defense \nDepartment on this issue. As the Congressional Budget Office stated in \na letter to me, ``the [DoD] report's basic message is consistent with \nCBO's own conclusions: past and future BRAC rounds will lead to \nsignificant savings for DoD.''\n  Every year we delay another base closure round, we waste about $1.5 \nbillion in annual savings that we can never recoup. And every dollar we \nwaste on bases we do not need is a dollar we cannot spend on things we \ndo need.\n  The new administration is now undertaking several strategy reviews. \nIt is possible that those reviews will conclude that the military we \nwant for the future needs exactly the base structure we have today and \nthat all our forces are in exactly the right place and none of them \nneed to be realigned to different locations. It is possible that they \nwill conclude Secretary Cohen and General Shelton didn't know what they \nwere talking about and we really don't have any excess infrastructure.\n  I will be astounded if any serious defense review reaches such a \nconclusion. But even if it did, it is important to understand that this \nlegislation does not prejudge or pre-empt these reviews. What it does \nis prepare us to act whatever the result of those reviews.\n  Should the new administration decide they don't want to propose any \nclosures or realignments, this bill would not force them to. It \nauthorizes two more rounds; it does not require them. And the Defense \nDepartment would have ample time to conclude their reviews before the \nfirst round would start in 2003, so the results of their strategy \nreviews could be fully incorporated into the force structure plan the \nnew rounds would be based on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Levin, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 398. A bill to combat international money laundering and to \nprotect the United States financial system, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the United States must do more to \nstop international criminals from legitimizing their profits from the \nsale of drugs, from terror or from organized crime by laundering money \ninto the United States financial system.\n  That is why today, along with Senators Grassley, Sarbanes, Levin and \nRockefeller, I am introducing the International Counter-Money \nLaundering and Foreign Anticorruption Act of 2001, which will give the \nSecretary of the Treasury the tools to crack down on international \nmoney laundering havens and protect the integrity of the U.S. financial \nsystem from the influx of tainted money from abroad. During the 106th \nCongress, the House Banking Committee reported out this legislation \nwith a bipartisan 33-1 vote.\n  Money laundering is the financial side of international crime. It \noccurs when criminals seek to disguise money that was illegally \nobtained. It allows terrorists, drug cartels, organized crime groups, \ncorrupt foreign government officials and others to preserve the profit \nfrom their illegal activities and to finance new crimes. Money \nlaundering provides the fuel that allows criminal organizations to \nconduct their ongoing affairs. It has a corrosive effect on \ninternational markets and financial institutions. Money launderers rely \nupon the existence of jurisdictions outside the United States that \noffer bank secrecy and special tax or regulatory advantages to non \nresidents, and often complement those advantages with weak financial \nsupervision and regulatory regimes.\n  Today, the global volume of laundered money is estimated to be 2-5 \npercent of global Gross Domestic Product, between $600 billion and $1.5 \ntrillion. The effects of money laundering extend far beyond the \nparameters of law enforcement, creating international political issues \nwhile generating domestic political crises.\n  International criminals have taken advantage of the advances in \ntechnology and the weak financial supervision in some jurisdictions to \nsmuggle their illicit funds into the United States financial system. \nGlobalization and advances in communications and technologies allow \ncriminals to move their illicit gains faster and farther than ever \nbefore. The ability to launder money into the United States through \nthese jurisdictions has allowed corrupt\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nforeign officials to systematically divert public assets for their \npersonal use, which in turn undermines U.S. efforts to promote stable \ndemocratic institutions and vibrant economies abroad.\n  In December 2000, a federal interagency working group in support of \nthe President's International Crime Control Strategy released an \nInternational Crime Threat Assessment. This report states that \ninternational banking and financial systems are currently being used to \nlegitimize and transfer criminal proceeds and that huge sums of money \nare laundered in the world's largest financial markets including the \nUnited States. The report warns that international criminal groups will \nuse changes in technology and the world economy to enhance their \ncapability to launder and move money and may be able to cause \nsignificant disruption to international financial systems.\n  In October 2000, the General Accounting Office determined that Euro-\nAmerican Corporate Services, Inc. had formed more than 2,000 \ncorporations for Russian brokers. From 1991 through January 2000, more \nthan $1.4 billion in wire transfer transactions was deposited into 236 \naccounts for these corporations opened at two United States banks. More \nthan half of these funds were then transferred out of the U.S. banking \nsystem. The GAO believes that these banking activities raise questions \nabout whether the U.S. banks were used to launder money.\n  In February 2000, State and Federal regulators formally sanctioned \nthe Bank of New York for ``deficiencies'' in its anti-money laundering \npractices including lax auditing and risk management procedures \ninvolving their international banking business. The sanctions were \nbased on the Bank of New York's involvement in an alleged money \nlaundering scheme where more than $7 billion in funds were transmitted \nfrom Russia into the bank. Federal investigators are currently \nattempting to tie the $7 billion to criminal activities in Russia such \nas corporate theft, political graft or racketeering.\n  In November 1999, the minority staff of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee on Investigations released a report on private \nbanking and money laundering. The report describes a number of \nincidences where high level government officials have used private \nbanking accounts with U.S. financial institutions to launder millions \nof dollars from foreign governments. The report details how Raul \nSalinas, brother of former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas, used \nprivate bank accounts to launder money out of Mexico. Representatives \nfrom Citigroup testified at a Subcommittee hearing that the bank had \nbeen slow to correct controls over their private banking accounts.\n  Earlier this month, the Minority Staff of the U.S. Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, headed by Senator Carl Levin, released \na report that reveals that most U.S. banks lack appropriate anti-money \nlaundering safeguards on their correspondent accounts. This report \nproves that high risk foreign banks that are denied their own \ncorrespondent accounts at U.S. banks can get the same access by opening \ncorrespondent accounts at other foreign banks that have U.S. accounts. \nThe report recommends that U.S. regulators and law enforcement offer \nincreased assistance to help banks identify high-risk foreign banks.\n  During the 1980s, as Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I began an investigation of the Bank of Credit and \nCommerce International (BCCI), and uncovered a complex money laundering \nscheme. Unlike any ordinary bank, BCCI was from its earliest days made \nup of multiplying layers of entities, related to one another through an \nimpenetrable series of holding companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, \nbanks-within-banks, insider dealings and nominee relationships.\n  By fracturing corporate structure, record keeping, regulatory review, \nand audits, the complex BCCI family of entities was able to evade \nordinary legal restrictions on the movement of capital and goods as a \nmatter of daily practice and routine. In designing BCCI as a vehicle \nfundamentally free of government control, its creators developed an \nideal mechanism for facilitating illicit activity by others.\n  BCCI's used this complex corporate structure to commit fraud \ninvolving billions of dollars; and launder money for their clients in \nEurope, Africa, Asia and the Americas. Fortunately, we were able to \nbring many of those involved in BCCI to justice. However, my \ninvestigation clearly showed that rogue financial institutions have the \nability to circumvent the laws designed to stop financial crimes.\n  In recent years, the U.S. and other well-developed financial centers \nhave been working together to improve their anti-money laundering \nregimes and to set international anti-money laundering standards. Back \nin 1988, I included a provision in the State Department Reauthorization \nbill that requires major money laundering countries to adopt laws \nsimilar to our own on reporting currency or face sanctions. This \nprovision led to Panama and Venezuela negotiating what were called \nKerry agreements with the United States decreasing their vulnerability \nto the placement of U.S. currency by drug traffickers in the process.\n  Unfortunately, other nations--some small, remote islands--have moved \nin the other direction. Many have passed laws that provide for \nexcessive bank secrecy, anonymous company incorporation, economic \ncitizenship, and other provisions that directly conflict with well-\nestablished international anti-money laundering standards. In doing so, \nthey have become money laundering havens for international criminal \nnetworks. Some even blatantly advertise the fact that their laws \nprotect anyone doing business from U.S. law enforcement.\n\n  Last year, the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body \nestablished to develop and promote policies to combat financial crime, \nreleased a report naming fifteen jurisdictions--including the Bahamas, \nThe Cayman Islands, Russia, Israel, and the Philippines--that have \nfailed to take adequate measures to combat international money \nlaundering. This is a clear warning to financial institutions in the \nUnited States that they must begin to scrutinize many of their \nfinancial transactions with customers in these countries. Soon, the \nFinancial Action Task Force will develop bank advisories and criminal \nsanctions that effectively drive legitimate financial business from \nthese nations, depriving them of a lucrative source of tax revenue. \nThis report has provided important information that governments and \nfinancial institutions around the world should learn from in developing \ntheir own anti-money laundering laws and policies.\n  Last year, the Financial Stability Forum released a report that \ncategorizes offshore financial centers according to their perceived \nquality of supervision and degree of regulatory cooperation. The \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) began a new \ncrackdown on harmful tax competition. Members of the European Union \nreached an agreement in principle on sweeping changes to bank secrecy \nlaws, intended to bring cross-border investment income within the net \nof tax authorities.\n  The actions by the Financial Action Task Force, the European Union \nand others show a renewed international focus and commitment to curbing \nfinancial abuse around the world. I believe the United States has a \nsimilar obligation to use this new information to update our anti-money \nlaundering statutes.\n  The International Counter-Money Laundering and Anticorruption Act of \n2001, which I am introducing today, would provide the tools the U.S. \nneeds to crack down on international money laundering havens and \nprotect the integrity of the U.S. financial system from the influx of \ntainted money from abroad. The bill provides for actions that will be \ngraduated, discretionary, and targeted, in order to focus actions on \ninternational transactions involving criminal proceeds, while allowing \nlegitimate international commerce to continue to flow unimpeded. It \nwill give the Secretary of the Treasury--acting in consultation with \nother senior government officials and the Congress--the authority to \ndesignate a specific foreign jurisdiction, foreign financial \ninstitution, or class of international transactions as being of \n``primary money laundering concern.''\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\n Then, on a case-by-case basis, the Secretary will have the option to \nuse a series of new tools to combat the specific type of foreign money \nlaundering threat we face. In some cases, the Secretary will have the \noption to require banks to pierce the veil of secrecy behind which \nforeign criminals hide. In other cases, the Secretary will have the \noption to require the identification those using a foreign bank's \ncorrespondent or payable-through accounts. If these transparency \nprovisions were deemed to be inadequate to address the specific problem \nidentified, the Secretary would have the option to restrict or prohibit \nU.S. banks from continuing correspondent or payable-through banking \nrelationships with money laundering havens and rogue foreign banks. \nThrough these steps, the Secretary will help prevent laundered money \nfrom slipping undetected into the U.S. financial system and, as a \nresult, increase the pressure on foreign money laundering havens to \nbring their laws and practices into line with international anti-money \nlaundering standards. The passage of this legislation will make it much \nmore difficult for international criminal organizations to launder the \nproceeds of their crimes into the United States.\n  This bill fills in the current gap between bank advisories and \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, IEEPA, sanctions by \nproviding five new intermediate measures. Under current law, the only \ncounter-money laundering tools available to the federal government are \nadvisories, an important but relatively limited measure instructing \nbanks to pay close attention to transactions that involve a given \ncountry, and full-blown economic sanctions under the IEEPA. This \nlegislation gives five additional measures to increase the government's \nability to apply pressure effectively against targeted jurisdictions or \ninstitutions.\n  This legislation will in no way jeopardize the privacy of the \nAmerican public. The focus is on foreign jurisdictions, financial \ninstitutions and classes of transactions that present a threat to the \nUnited States, not on American citizens. The actions that the Secretary \nof the Treasury is authorized to take are designated solely to combat \nthe abuse of our banks by specifically identified foreign money \nlaundering threats. This legislation is in no way similar to the Know-\nYour-Customer regulations that were proposed by bank regulators in \n1999. Further, the intent of this legislation is not to add additional \nregulatory burdens on financial institutions, but, to give the \nSecretary of the Treasury the ability to take action against existing \nmoney laundering threats.\n  Let me repeat, this legislation only gives the discretion to use \nthese tools to the Secretary of the Treasury. There is no automatic \ntrigger that forces action whenever evidence of money laundering is \ndetermined. Before any action is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nin consultation with other key government officials, must first \ndetermine whether a specific country, financial institution or type of \ntransaction is of primary money laundering concern. The Treasury \nSecretary will develop a calibrated response that will consider the \neffectiveness of the measure to address the threat, whether other \ncountries are taking similar steps, and whether the response will cause \nharm to U.S. financial institutions and other firms.\n  This legislation will strengthen the ability of the Secretary to \ncombat international money laundering and help protect the integrity of \nthe U.S. financial system. This bill has been supported by the heads of \nall the major federal law enforcement agencies.\n  Today, advances in technology are bringing the world closer together \nthan ever before and opening up new opportunities for economic growth. \nHowever, with these new advantages come equally important obligations. \nWe must do everything possible to insure that the changes in technology \ndo not give comfort to international criminals by giving them new ways \nto hide the financial proceeds of their crimes. This legislation is a \nfirst step toward limiting the scourge of money laundering and will \nhelp stop the development of international criminal organizations. I \nbelieve this legislation deserves consideration by the Senate during \nthe 107th Congress.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kerry, \nGrassley, and Levin in introducing the International Counter-Money \nLaundering and Foreign Anti-Corruption Act of 2001, ``ICMLA''. This \nlegislation is identical to a bill I co-sponsored last year.\n  Money laundering poses an ongoing threat to the financial stability \nof the U.S. It is estimated by the Department of the Treasury that the \nglobal volume of laundered money accounts for between 2-5 percent of \nthe global GDP. Although serious efforts to combat international money \nlaundering began in the mid-1980's, recent scandals about the \ninvolvement of some the most prominent U.S. banks in money laundering \nschemes have highlighted key weaknesses in current laws.\n  The ICMLA is designed to bolster the United States' ability to \ncounter the laundering of the proceeds of drug trafficking, organized \ncrime, terrorism and official corruption from abroad. The bill broadens \nthe authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, ensures that banking \ntransactions and financial relationship do not contravene the purposes \nof current anti-money laundering statutes, provides a clear mandate for \nsubjecting foreign jurisdictions that facilitate money laundering to \nspecial scrutiny, and enhances reporting of suspicious activities. The \nbill similarly strengthens current measures to prevent the use of the \nU.S. financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials \nand to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens \nof countries to whom such assets belong.\n  First, Section 101 of the ICMLA gives the Secretary of the Treasury, \nin consultation with other key government officials, discretionary \nauthority to impose five new ``special measures'' against foreign \njurisdictions and entities that are of ``primary money laundering \nconcern'' to the United States. Under current law, the only counter-\nmoney laundering tools available to the federal government are \nadvisories, an important but relatively limited measure instructing \nbanks to pay close attention to transactions that involve a given \ncountry, and full-blown economic sanctions under the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act, ``IEEPA''. The five new intermediate \nmeasures will increase the government's ability to apply well-\ncalibrated pressure against targeted jurisdictions or institutions. \nThese new measures include: 1. requiring additional record keeping/\nreporting on particular transactions, 2. requiring the identification \nof the beneficial foreign owner of a U.S. bank account, 3. requiring \nthe identification of those individuals using a U.S. bank account \nopened by a foreign bank to engage in banking transactions a ``payable-\nthrough account'', 4. requiring the identification of those using a \nU.S. bank account established to receive deposits and make payments on \nbehalf of a foreign financial institution, a ``correspondent account'', \nand 5. restricting or prohibiting the opening or maintaining of certain \ncorrespondent accounts. The Democratic staff of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee recently completed an investigation and published results \ncritical of certain correspondent banking activities.\n  Second, the bill seeks to enhance oversight into illegal activities \nby clarifying that the ``safe harbor'' from civil liability for filing \na Suspicious Activity Report, ``SAR'', applies in any litigation, \nincluding suit for breach of contract or in an arbitration proceeding. \nUnder the Bank Secrecy Act, ``BSA'', any financial institution or \nofficer, director, employee, or agent of a financial institution is \nprotected against private civil liability for filing a SAR. Section 201 \nof the bill amends the BSA to clarify the prohibition on disclosing \nthat a SAR has been filed. These reports are the cornerstone of our \nnation's money-laundering efforts because they provide the information \nnecessary to alert law enforcement to illegal activity.\n  Third, the bill enhances enforcement of Geographic Targeting Orders, \n``GTO''. These orders lower the dollar thresholds for reporting \ntransactions within a defined geographic area. Section 202 of the bill \nclarifies that civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Bank \nSecrecy Act and its regulations also apply to reports required by\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nGTO's. In addition, the section clarifies that structuring a \ntransaction to avoid a reporting requirement by a GTO is a criminal \noffense and extends the presumptive GTO period from 60 to 180 days.\n  Fourth, Section 203 of the bill permits a bank, upon request of \nanother bank, to include suspicious illegal activity in written \nemployment references. Under this provision, banks would be permitted \nto share information concerning the possible involvement of a current \nor former officer or employee in potentially unlawful activity without \nfear of civil liability for sharing the information.\n  Finally, Title III of the bill addresses corruption by foreign \nofficials and ruling elites. Earlier this year, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the financial \nservices regulators, issued guidelines to financial institutions \noperating in the U.S. on appropriate practices and procedures to reduce \nthe likelihood that such institutions could facilitate proceeds \nexpropriated by or on behalf of foreign senior government officials. \nTitle III would help build upon efforts to combat corruption by foreign \nofficials and ruling elites. It provides that the U.S. government \nshould make clear that it will take all steps necessary to identify the \nproceeds of foreign government corruption which have been deposited in \nU.S. financial institutions and return such proceeds to the citizens of \nthe country to whom such assets belong. It also encourages the U.S. to \ncontinue to actively and publicly support the objectives of the \nFinancial Action Task Force on Money Laundering with regard to \ncombating international money laundering.\n  The ICMLA addresses many of the shortcomings of current law. the \nSecretary of Treasury is granted additional authority to require \ngreater transparency of transactions and accounts as well as to \nnarrowly target penalties and sanctions. The reporting and collection \nof additional information on suspected illegal activity will greatly \nenhance the ability of bank regulators and law enforcement to combat \nthe laundering of drug money, proceeds from corrupt regimes, and other \nillegal activities.\n  The House Banking Committee passed the identical anti-money \nlaundering bill by a vote of 31 to 1 on June 8, 2000. I hope that we \ncan move this legislation expeditiously in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 399. A bill to provide for fire sprinkler systems, or other fire \nsuppression or prevention technologies, in public and private college \nand university housing and dormitories, including fraternity and \nsorority housing and dormitories; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague \nSenator Dodd to re-introduce the College Fire Prevention Act. This \nmeasure would provide federal matching grants for the installation of \nfire sprinkler systems in college and university dormitories and \nfraternity and sorority houses. I believe the time is now to address \nthe sad situation of deadly fires that occur in our children's college \nliving facilities.\n  The tragic fire that occurred at Seton Hall University on Wednesday \nJanuary 19th, 2000 will not be long forgotten. Sadly, three freshman, \nall 18 years old, died. Fifty-four students, two South Orange \nfirefighters and two South Orange police officers were injured. The \ndormitory, Boland Hall, was a six-story, 350 room structure built in \n1952 that housed approximately 600 students. Astonishingly, the fire \nwas contained to the third floor lounge of Boland Hall. This dormitory \nwas equipped with smoke alarms but no sprinkler system.\n  Unfortunately, the Boland Hall fire was not the first of its kind. \nAnd it reminded many people in North Carolina of their own tragic \nexperience with dorm fires. In 1996, on Mother's Day and Graduation \nDay, a fire in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill killed five college juniors and \ninjured three others. The 3-story plus basement fraternity house was 70 \nyears old. The National Fire Protection Association identified several \nfactors that contributed to the tragic fire, including the lack of fire \nsprinkler protection.\n  Sadly, there have been countless other dorm fires. On December 9, \n1997, a student died in a dormitory fire at Greenville College in \nGreenville, Illinois. The dormitory, Kinney Hall, was built in the \n1960s and had no fire sprinkler system. On January 10, 1997, a student \ndied at the University of Tennessee at Martin. The dormitory, Ellington \nHall, had no fire sprinkler system. On January 3, 1997 a student died \nin a dormitory fire at Central Missouri State University in \nWarrensburg, Missouri. On October 21, 1994, five students died in a \nfraternity house fire in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. The list goes on and \non. In a typical year between 1980 and 1998, the National Fire \nProtection Association estimates there were an average of 1,800 fires \nat dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, involving 1 death, 70 \ninjuries, and 8 million dollars in property damage.\n  So now we must ask, what can be done? What can we do to curtail these \ntragic fires from taking the lives of our children, our young adults? \nWe should focus our attention on the lack of fire sprinklers in college \ndormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. Sprinklers save lives. \nIndeed, the National Fire Protection Association has never recorded a \nfire that killed more than 2 people in a public assembly, educational, \ninstitutional, or residential building where a sprinkler system was \noperating properly.\n  Despite the clear benefits of sprinklers, many college dorms do not \nhave them. New dormitories are generally required to have advanced \nsafety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements are \nrarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings. In 1998, 93 percent \nof the campus building fires reported to fire departments occurred in \nbuildings where there were smoke alarms present. However, only 34 \npercent of them had fire sprinklers present.\n  At my state's flagship university at Chapel Hill, for example, only \nsix of the 29 residence halls have sprinklers. A report published by \nThe Raleigh News & Observer in the wake of the Seton Hall fire also \nnoted that only seven of 19 dorms at North Carolina State University \nare equipped with the life-saving devices, and there are sprinklers in \ntwo of the 10 dorms at North Carolina Central University. At Duke \nUniversity, only five of 26 dorms have sprinklers.\n  The legislation I introduce today authorizes the Secretary of \nEducation, in consultation with the United States Fire Administration, \nto award grants to States, private or public colleges or universities, \nfraternities, or sororities to assist them in providing fire sprinkler \nsystems for their student housing and dormitories. These entities would \nbe required to produce matching funds equal to one-half of the cost. \nThis legislation authorizes $100 million for fiscal years 2002 through \n2006.\n  In North Carolina, we decided to initiate a drive to install \nsprinklers in our public college and university dorms. The overall cost \nis estimated at 57.5 million dollars. Given how much it is going to \ncost North Carolina's public colleges and universities to install \nsprinklers, I think it's clear that the $100 million that this measure \nauthorizes is just a drop in the bucket. But my hope is that by \nproviding this small incentive we can encourage more colleges to \ninstitute a comprehensive review of their dorm's fire safety and to \ninstall sprinklers. All they need is a helping hand. With this modest \nmeasure of prevention, we can help prevent the needless and tragic loss \nof young lives.\n  Parents should not have to worry about their children living in fire \ntraps. When we send our children away to college, we are sending them \nto a home away from home where hundreds of other students eat, sleep, \nburn candles, use electric appliances and smoke. We must not compromise \non their safety. In short, the best way to ensure the protection of our \ncollege students is to install fire sprinklers in our college \ndormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\n                                 S. 399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``College Fire Prevention \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire occurred at a \n     Seton Hall University dormitory. Three male freshmen, all 18 \n     years of age, died. Fifty-four students, 2 South Orange \n     firefighters, and 2 South Orange police officers were \n     injured. The dormitory was a 6-story, 350-room structure \n     built in 1952, that housed approximately 600 students. It was \n     equipped with smoke alarms but no fire sprinkler system.\n       (2) On Mother's Day 1996 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a \n     fire in the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity House killed 5 college \n     juniors and injured 3. The 3-story plus basement fraternity \n     house was 70 years old. The National Fire Protection \n     Association identified several factors that contributed to \n     the tragic fire, including the lack of fire sprinkler \n     protection.\n       (3) It is estimated that between 1980 and 1998, an average \n     of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, \n     involving 1 death, 70 injuries, and $8,000,000 in property \n     damage were reported to public fire departments.\n       (4) Within dormitories, fraternities, and sororities the \n     number 1 cause of fires is arson or suspected arson. The \n     second leading cause of college building fires is cooking, \n     while the third leading cause is smoking.\n       (5) The National Fire Protection Association has no record \n     of a fire killing more than 2 people in a completely fire \n     sprinklered public assembly, educational, institutional, or \n     residential building where the sprinkler system was operating \n     properly.\n       (6) New dormitories are generally required to have advanced \n     safety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements \n     are rarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings.\n       (7) In 1998, 93 percent of the campus building fires \n     reported to fire departments occurred in buildings where \n     there were smoke alarms present. However, only 34 percent had \n     fire sprinklers present.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $100,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 through \n     2006.\n\n     SEC. 4. GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Program Authority.--The Secretary of Education, in \n     consultation with the United States Fire Administration, is \n     authorized to award grants to States, private or public \n     colleges or universities, fraternities, and sororities to \n     assist them in providing fire sprinkler systems, or other \n     fire suppression or prevention technologies, for their \n     student housing and dormitories.\n       (b) Matching Funds Requirement.--The Secretary of Education \n     may not award a grant under this section unless the entity \n     receiving the grant provides, from State, local, or private \n     sources, matching funds in an amount equal to not less than \n     one-half of the cost of the activities for which assistance \n     is sought.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application.--Each entity desiring a grant under this \n     Act shall submit to the Secretary of Education an application \n     at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require.\n       (b) Priority.--In awarding grants under this Act, the \n     Secretary shall give priority to applicants that demonstrate \n     in the application submitted under subsection (a) the \n     inability to fund the sprinkler system, or other fire \n     suppression or prevention technology, from sources other than \n     funds provided under this Act.\n       (c) Limitation on Administrative Expenses.--An entity that \n     receives a grant under this Act shall not use more than 4 \n     percent of the grant funds for administrative expenses.\n\n     SEC. 6.

ADMISSIBILITY.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any application \n     for assistance under this Act, any negative determination on \n     the part of the Secretary of Education with respect to such \n     application, or any statement of reasons for the \n     determination, shall not be admissible as evidence in any \n     proceeding of any court, agency, board, or other entity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 400. A bill to lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Roberts, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 401. A bill to normalize trade relations with Cuba, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 402. A bill to make an exception to the United States embargo on \ntrade with Cuba for the export of agricultural commodities, medicines, \nmedical supplies, medical instruments, or medical equipment and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am introducing today a series of bills \nthat would end the embargo on trade with Cuba and normalize our \neconomic relations with this country that is a mere ninety miles off \nour shore. I should add that Congressman Charles Rangel is offering a \nset of companion bills in the House today.\n  Last July, I led a small group of Senators to Havana. During our \nbrief visit, we met with Fidel Castro. But we also spent three hours \nwith a group of six dissidents who had spent years in prison, yet have \nchosen heroically to continue their dissent from within Cuba. We met \nwith the leader of Cuba's largest independent NGO. It was clear to me \nthat our Cuba policy was outdated and needed fundamental change.\n  I have long fought against unilateral economic sanctions, unless our \nnational security was at stake. The Cuba embargo is a unilateral \nsanction, but our national security is not at stake. The Defense \nDepartment has concluded that Cuba does not represent any security \nthreat to this nation. None of our closest allies supports the embargo. \nNor do any of our trading partners in the Americas.\n  Unilateral sanctions do not work. The embargo has not changed the \nbehavior of the Cuban government and its leadership. It has not changed \nthe behavior of Fidel Castro. But the embargo has hurt the people of \nCuba. And the embargo has hurt American farmers and businesses, as our \nAsian, European, and Canadian competitors have rushed in to fill the \ngap in the Cuban market.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission released a report on the \neconomic impact of U.S. sanctions on Cuba. The ITC found that the \nembargo costs US exporters, farmers, manufacturers, and service \nproviders between $650 million and one billion dollars a year in lost \nsales. This is intolerable.\n  We should lift the embargo. We should engage Cuba economically. We \nshould engage the people of Cuba.\n  The bills I am introducing today do just that. The first bill, on \nwhich I am joined by Senators Roberts, Lincoln, and Dorgan, is the \n``Free Trade with Cuba Act'', that would lift the embargo completely. \nThe second bill, on which I am joined by Senators Roberts and Lincoln, \nis the ``United States-Cuba Trade Act of 2001'', that would remove Cuba \nfrom Jackson-Vanik treatment and provide normal trade relations status \non a permanent basis. The third bill, on which I am also joined by \nSenators Roberts and Lincoln, is the ``Cuban Humanitarian Trade Act of \n2001'', that removes the restrictions on food and medicine exports \nimposed in the last Congress, repeals the codification of travel \nrestrictions, and removes limitations on remittances to individual \nCuban citizens.\n  I am not suggesting that we embrace Fidel Castro. Far from it! His \nleadership, his treatment of his own people, his failed economic, \npolitical, and social policies--these are unacceptable to all \nAmericans. But the world has changed since the United States initiated \nthe embargo forty years and ten Presidents ago. It does us no good to \nwait until Castro is gone from the scene before we begin to develop \nnormal relations with the Cuban people and with Cuba's future leaders. \nIf we fail to develop those relationships now, the inevitable \ntransition to democracy and a market economy will be much harder on all \nof the Cuban people. And events in Cuba could easily escalate out of \ncontrol and put the United States in the middle of a dangerous domestic \ncrisis on the island.\n  Jim Hoagland, in a recent Washington Post column, wrote about his \nconcern ``when sanctions linger too long and become a political \nfootball and a substitute for policy, as is the case today in Cuba.'' \nThis accurately describes where we are today.\n  To help further edify my colleagues on this issue, I would like to \nenter into the record a column from the February 9 Wall Street Journal \nby Philip Peters, Vice President of the Lexington Institute, who \nexplains how changes in U.S. policy can help the Cuban people who \ncontinue to suffer under Castro's policies of political and economic \nrepression.\n  The three bills that I am offering today serve our national interest, \nwill\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nhelp us move toward a peaceful transition in the post-Castro era, and \nwill help the Cuban people now. I urge support from all my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2001]\n\n          ``Let Yankee Tourists Shower Dollars on Cuba's Poor\"\n\n                           (By Philip Peters)\n\n       In her final press conference as Secretary of State, \n     Madeleine Albright's message to the Cuban people was \n     succinct. In reference to the aging Fidel Castro she said, \n     ``I wish them the actuarial tables.'' It was an odd statement \n     on behalf of a superpower that could have used the previous \n     eight years to exercise considerable influence on its small \n     island neighbor.\n       It was also a fitting end to the Clinton administration's \n     passive approach to Cuba policy, where the impulse to \n     reassess strategy was nearly always trumped by the imperative \n     of avoiding political risk in Florida. Even in 1998, when \n     Republican leaders such as Sen. John Warner and former \n     Secretary of State George Shultz urged the creation of a \n     presidential bipartisan commission--a golden opportunity to \n     conduct a long overdue post-Cold War review that could have \n     included the full range of Cuban-American voices--politics \n     held the Clinton White House back.\n       President Bush has an opportunity to make a fresh start. \n     Today's strict embargo policy, based on the goal of denying \n     hard currency to the Cuban government, made sense during the \n     Cold War when Cuba was a genuine security threat and \n     Washington had reason to make Cuba an expensive satellite for \n     the Soviet Union to maintain.\n       Today, with sanctions twice tightened during the 1990s, \n     Fidel Castro remains firmly in power. With the Soviet-era \n     security threat gone, it is time to recognize that isolating \n     Cuba from commerce and contact with Americans is \n     counterproductive because it reduces American influence in \n     Cuba. President Bush's Cuba policy is not yet defined, but \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that ``We will only \n     participate in those activities with Cuba that benefit the \n     people directly and not the government.''\n       This standard sounds good in theory, but in practice it is \n     impossible to achieve. Virtually every form of economic \n     activity with Cuba benefits both the people and the \n     government. Today, European and Canadian trade, investment \n     and tourism benefit Cuban state enterprises. But they also \n     increase the earnings of Cuban workers, expose Cubans to \n     foreigners and non-socialist ideas, bring capitalist business \n     practices, and reshape the Cuban economy to fit its \n     comparative advantages in the global system. This adds up to \n     humanitarian benefits for the Cuban people, and a head start \n     on a future transition to a more market-oriented economy.\n       U.S. economic activity also benefits both the state and the \n     people of Cuba. Family remittances, estimated by the United \n     Nations at over $700 million annually, bring more foreign \n     exchange than sugar exports. Many of these dollars land in \n     the Cuban treasury when Cubans spend them in state retail \n     stores. U.S.-Cuba phone connections allow families to \n     communicate, but generate over $70 million a year for the \n     state phone company. A strict application of Secretary \n     Powell's own standard would cut off these valuable benefits.\n       The trick, then, for an administration that seems to want \n     to end unilateral trade sanctions everywhere but Cuba, will \n     not be to reach for Secretary Powell's unattainable standard. \n     Rather, it will be to choose among forms of engagement that \n     serve America's humanitarian interest in helping Cubans to \n     prosper, our long-term economic interest of nudging Cuba \n     toward a market economy, and our political interest in \n     exposing Cubans to Americans and American ideas.\n       President Bush could begin by supporting the congressional \n     consensus, expressed last year by greater than three-to-one \n     majorities in the House and Senate, to lift all restrictions \n     on food and medicine sales. This step would begin to reverse \n     the implicit assumption in U.S. policy that American \n     interests are somehow served if products such as rice, \n     powdered milk, and drugs are more scarce or expensive for \n     Cubans to acquire. It would also support the calls by Cuban \n     dissidents such as Elizardo Sanchez and the Christian \n     Liberation Movement for an end to this part of the embargo. \n     It ``hurts the people, not the regime,'' Mr. Sanchez says, \n     and is ``an odd way of demonstrating support for human \n     rights.''\n       President Bush could then end all restrictions on Cuban-\n     American remittances, now limited to $1,200 a year, and on \n     family visits, which are permitted only in cases of \n     ``humanitarian emergency'' a cruel regulation that forces \n     families to lie by the thousands each December when they \n     visit relatives at Christmas.\n       Finally, the president could support an end to the travel \n     ban imposed on Americans--a mistaken policy that treats free \n     contact between American and Cuban societies as a detriment \n     rather than an opportunity. ``If we have a million Americans \n     walking on the streets of Havana, you will have something \n     like the pope's visit multiplied by 10,'' independent \n     journalist Manuel David Orrio told the Chicago Tribune in \n     1999. A Havana clergyman told me last month that visiting \n     Americans ``would permeate this place with the idea of a free \n     society.''\n       Like other international travelers, Americans' spending \n     would boost Cubans' earnings in hotels and restaurants and \n     expand Cuba's incipient private sector. An influx of U.S. \n     travelers would immediately create a shortage of lodging that \n     would be filled partially by Cubans who legally rent rooms in \n     their homes. Demand for the services of artisans, taxis and \n     private restaurants would also increase, adding to the \n     disposable income that sustains other entrepreneurs, from \n     carpenters and repairmen to food vendors and tutors.\n       As this sector, now 150,000 strong, gains income and \n     expands, demand would increase for the freely priced, \n     privately sold produce in Cuba's 300 farmers markets, \n     benefitting farmers across Cuba who have no contact with \n     tourists. Americans would experience ``the interface between \n     the entrepreneurial folks'' that President Bush lauds as a \n     virtue of open trade with communist China, to say nothing of \n     the value of their personal contact with Cubans. This may be \n     why a Florida International University poll shows a slim \n     majority of Cuban-Americans, and three fourths of the most \n     recent Cuban immigrants, supporting an end to the travel ban.\n       A policy opening of this type would leave the trade embargo \n     largely intact for future review, and it would do nothing to \n     diminish America's stark opposition to Cuban human rights \n     practices. However, it would increase concrete support to the \n     Cuban people, and it would spur the development of free-\n     market activity in the post-Castro Cuba that is now taking \n     shape.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 403. A bill to improve the National Writing Project; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr President, today, I am introducing legislation \nreauthorizing the National Writing Project, the only Federal program to \nimprove the teaching of writing in America's classrooms.\n  Literacy is at the foundation of school and workplace success, of \ncitizenship in a democracy, and of learning in all disciplines. The \nNational Writing Project has been instrumental in helping teachers \ndevelop better teaching skills so they can help our children improve \ntheir ability to read, write, and think.\n  The National Writing Project is a twenty-seven-year old national \nnetwork of university-based teacher training programs designed to \nimprove the teaching of writing and student achievement in writing and \nhas had federal support since 1991. Successful writing teachers attend \nInvitational Summer Institutes at their local universities. During the \nschool year these teachers provide workshops for other teachers in the \nschools. At 167 sites in 49 states, the National Writing Project trains \nover 100,000 teachers every year.\n  The program has become a national model for other disciplines and is \nnow recognized by the Department of Education as an important part of \nnational education policy. The program also generates an average of \n$6.32 in private, state, and local funds for every federal dollar \nappropriated. The National Writing Project is making teachers better at \ntheir jobs.\n  I introduced the National Writing Project Act for the first time in \n1990. Since then, I have worked with other Senators to ensure that it \nhas remained a program that supports states and local schools in their \nefforts to have better teachers. Last Congress when I introduced this \nbill, it was cosponsored by 52 Senators. I hope it will receive even \ngreater support in the 107th Congress. I invite other Senators to join \nme in sponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 404. A bill to provide for the technical integrity of the FM radio \nband, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nallow our communities and churches to benefit from low-power radio \nservice.\n  Mr. President, low-power FM radio service provides community based \norganizations, churches, and other non-profit groups with a new, \naffordable opportunity to reach out to the public, helping to promote a \ngreater awareness of local issues important to our communities. As \nsuch, low-power FM is supported by many national and local \norganizations who seek to provide the public with increased sources of \nnews\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\nand perspectives in an otherwise increasingly consolidated medium.\n  Last Congress, special interests forces opposed to low-power FM \nradio, most notably the National Association of Broadcasters and \nNational Public Radio, mounted a vigorous behind-the-scenes campaign to \nkill low-power FM radio. And unfortunately, these special interests \nsucceeded in attaching an appropriations rider in the dead of the \nnight--without a single debate on the floor of the Senate--that \neffectively did just that.\n  Mr. President, the Low Power Radio Act of 2001 seeks to remedy this \nderailment of the democratic process. The Low Power Radio Act of 2001 \nwill allow the FCC to license low-power FM radio service, while at the \nsame time protecting existing full-power stations from interference. \nSpecifically, the legislation directs the FCC--the expert agency with \nthe experience and engineering resources to make such a determination--\nto determine which, if any, low-power radio stations are causing \ninterference to existing full-power stations, and determine what the \nlow-power FM station must do to alleviate it. Thus, this legislation \nstrikes a fair balance by allowing non-interfering low-power FM \nstations to operate without further delay, while affecting only those \nlow-power stations that the FCC finds to be causing harmful \ninterference in their actual, everyday operations. This is totally \nconsistent with the fact that low-power FM is a secondary service \nwhich, by law, must cure any interference caused to any primary, full-\npower service.\n  This legislation will provide an efficient and effective means to \ndetect and resolve harmful interference. By providing a procedural \nremedy that authorizes the FCC to impose damages on frivolous \ncomplaints, the bill will discourage the creation of low-power stations \nmost likely to cause harmful interference while at the same time \ndiscouraging full-power broadcasters from making unwarranted \ninterference claims.\n  In the interests of would-be new broadcasters, existing broadcasters, \nbut, most of all, the listening public, I urge the enactment of the Low \nPower Radio Act of 2001.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Low Power Radio Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to ensure the technical \n     integrity of the FM radio band, while permitting the \n     introduction of low power FM transmitters into such band \n     without causing harmful interference.\n\n     SEC. 3. HARMFUL INTERFERENCE PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any low-power FM radio licensee determined \n     by the Federal Communications Commission to be transmitting a \n     signal causing harmful interference to one or more licensed \n     radio services shall, if so ordered by the Commission, cease \n     the transmission of the interfering signal, and may not \n     recommence transmitting such signal until it has taken \n     whatever action the Commission may prescribe in order to \n     assure that the radio licensee that has sustained the \n     interference remains able to serve the public interest, \n     convenience and necessity as required by the Commission's \n     rules.\n       (b) Complaint.--Any radio service licensee or subcarrier \n     program provider may file a complaint with the Commission \n     against any low-power FM radio licensee for transmitting a \n     signal that is alleged to cause harmful interference. The \n     complaint shall be filed in a form, and contain such \n     information as, prescribed by the Commission.\n       (c) Expedited Consideration.--In any complaint filed \n     pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b), the Commission \n     shall render a final decision no later than 90 calendar days \n     after the date on which the complaint was received by the \n     Commission.\n       (d) Punitive Damages.--In any final decision rendered \n     pursuant to this section, the Commission is authorized to \n     impose punitive damages not to exceed 5 times the low-power \n     FM station's costs if the Commission finds that the complaint \n     was frivolous and without any merit or purpose other than to \n     impede the provision of non-interfering low-power FM service.\n       (e) Section 316(a)(3) of Communications Act.--Section \n     316(a)(3) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     316(a)(3)) shall not apply to a complaint filed pursuant to \n     this section.\n       (f) Rules.--The Commission shall adopt rules implementing \n     the provisions of this section within 45 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (g) Harmful Interference Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``harmful interference'' means interference \n     which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service \n     or of other safety services or that seriously degrades, \n     obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a radio service operating \n     in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Federal \n     Communications Commission.\n       (h) Repeal of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) Restoration of Communications Act.--Section 336 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 336) is amended by \n     striking subsection (h) and redesignating subsection (i) as \n     subsection (h).\n       (2) Nullification of action under repealed provision.--Any \n     action taken by the Federal Communications Commission under \n     section 336(h) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     336(h)) as added by section 143(a) of Division B of A Bill \n     Making miscellaneous appropriations for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes (106 Pub. \n     L. 554; Appendix-H.R. 5666) before the date of enactment of \n     this Act is null and void.\n       (3) Repeal.--The Act entitled A Bill Making miscellaneous \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, \n     and for other purposes (106 Pub. L. 554; Appendix-H.R. 5666) \n     is amended by striking section 143.\n\n     SEC. 4. DIGITAL RADIO TRANSITION.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission shall complete all \n     rulemakings necessary to implement the transition to digital \n     radio no later than February 23, 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 407. A bill to amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to provide for the \nregistration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, in order to \ncarry out provisions of certain international conventions, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce implementing \nlegislation for the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement \nConcerning the International Registration of Marks, Protocol. I have \nintroduced identical bills in the last two Congresses, but the Senate \nunfortunately did not consider those bills. Chairman Hatch has joined \nme in introducing this legislation, and I thank him for his leadership \non this and other intellectual property matters of such critical \nimportance to the economy and industry of our country.\n  This bill is part of my ongoing effort to update American \nintellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and \nprotect American interests both here and abroad. The Protocol would \nhelp American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized \ncompanies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international \nmarkets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark \napplication procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of \nthe U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the \nUnited States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' \ninternational trademark registration process, which would be an \nenormous benefit for American businesses. This bill is one of many \nmeasures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to \nensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in \ntoday's world of changing technology and complex international markets.\n  Over the past few years, Senator Hatch and I have worked together \nsuccessfully on a number of initiatives to bolster trademark protection \nand keep our trademark laws up-to-date. For example, in the 104th \nCongress, we supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, \nenacted to provide intellectual property rights holders with the power \nto enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would \ncause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality. In the 105th \nCongress, we introduced legislation, S. 2193, to implement the \nTrademark Law Treaty. S. 2193 simplified trademark registration \nrequirements around the world by establishing a list of maximum \nrequirements which Treaty member countries can impose on trademark \napplicants. The bill passed the Senate on September 17, 1998, and was \nsigned by the President on October 30, 1998. I am proud of this \nlegislation since all American businesses, and particularly small \nAmerican businesses, will benefit as a result.\n  Also, in the 105th Congress, I introduced S. 1727 to authorize a \ncomprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level \nDomains on trademark and other intellectual property rights. This bill \nbecame law as part of\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nthe Next Generation Internet Research Act, S. 1609, which was signed \ninto law on October 28, 1998.\n  In the 106th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together for \nenactment of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which \nprotects against the registration, in bad faith with intent to profit, \nas a domain name of another person's trademark or the name of a living \nperson. This bill was passed as part of the FY 2000 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill on November 29, 1999.\n  Also in the 106th Congress, we worked to pass the Trademark \nAmendments Act, which enhanced protection for trademark owners and \nconsumers by making it possible to prevent trademark dilution before it \noccurs, by clarifying the remedies available under the Federal \ntrademark dilution statute, by providing recourse against the Federal \nGovernment for its infringement of others' trademarks, and by creating \ngreater certainty and uniformity in the area of trade dress protection. \nThe bill passed the Senate on July 1, 1999, and was enacted on August \n5, 1999.\n  Together, these measures represent significant steps in our efforts \nto ensure that American trademark law adequately serves and promote \nAmerican interests.\n  The legislation I introduce today with Senator Hatch would ease the \ntrademark registration burden on small and medium-sized businesses by \nenabling them to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries \nwith a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark \nOffice. Currently, in order for American companies to protect their \ntrademarks abroad, they must register their trademarks in each and \nevery country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple \ncountries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a \nprocess which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American \ncompanies seeking international trademark protection.\n  I first introduced the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act in the \n105th Congress as S. 2191, then again in the 106th Congress as S. 671. \nThe Judiciary Committee reported S. 671 favorably and unanimously, on \nFebruary 10, 2000. In the House of Representatives, Congressmen Coble \nand Berman sponsored and passed an identical bill, H.R. 769, on April \n13, 1999.\n  Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International \nRegistration of Marks, Agreement has provided an international \ntrademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the \nProtocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained \nterms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In \n1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which \ncorrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American \nparticipation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, \napplications for international trademark extension can be completed in \nEnglish; formerly, applications were required to be completed in \nFrench.\n  Another stumbling block to the United States joining the Protocol was \nresolved last year. Specifically, the European Community, EC, had taken \nthe position that under the Protocol, the EC, as an intergovernmental \nmember of the Protocol, received a separate vote in the Assembly \nestablished by the agreement in addition to the votes of its member \nstates. The State Department opposed this position as a contravention \nof the democratic concept of one-vote-per-country.\n  On February 2, 2000, the Assembly of the Madrid Protocol expressed \nits intent ``to use their voting rights in such a way as to ensure that \nthe number of votes cast by the European Community and its member \nStates does not exceed the number of the European Community's Member \nStates.'' In short, this letter appeared to resolve differences between \nthe Administration and the European Community, EC, regarding the voting \nrights of intergovernmental members of the Protocol in the Assembly \nestablished by the agreement.\n  Shortly after this letter was forwarded by the Assembly, I wrote to \nthen Secretary of State Madeleine Albright requesting information on \nthe Administration's position in light of the resolution of the voting \ndispute. At a hearing of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee on April \n14, 2000, I further inquired of Secretary Albright about the progress \nthe Administration was making on this matter, particularly in light of \nthe fact that differences over the voting rights of the European Union \nand participation of intergovernmental organizations in this \nintellectual property treaty were resolved in accordance with the U.S. \nposition.\n  Subsequently, President Clinton transmitted Treaty Document 106-41, \nthe Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement to the Senate for \nratification on September 5, 2000. Shortly after transmittal, on \nSeptember 13, 2000, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing to \nconsider Protocol. Unfortunately, no further action was taken on the \nProtocol or the implementing legislation before the Congress adjourned.\n  United States membership in the Protocol would greatly enhance the \nability of any U.S. business, whether large or small, to protect its \ntrademarks in other countries more quickly, cheaply and easily. That, \nin turn, will make it easier for American businesses to enter foreign \nmarkets and to protect their trademarks in those markets. The Protocol \nwould not require substantive changes to American trademark law, but \nmerely to certain procedures for registering trademarks. Passage of \nthis implementing legislation will help to ensure timely accession to \nand implementation of the Madrid Protocol, and it will send a clear \nsignal to the international community, U.S. businesses, and trademark \nowners that Congress is serious about our Nation becoming part of a \nlow-cost, efficient system to promote the international registration of \nmarks. I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and my other \ncolleagues for ratification of the Protocol and passage of the \nimplementing legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and the sectional \nanalysis be placed in the RECORD after my statement, as well as any \nadditional statements regarding this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Madrid Protocol \n     Implementation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

AMENDMENTS TO THE TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946\n\n       This section amends the ``Trademark Act of 1946'' by adding \n     a new Title XII with the following provisions:\n       The owner of a registration granted by the Patent and \n     Trademark Office (PTO) or the owner of a pending application \n     before the PTO may file an international application for \n     trademark protection at the PTO.\n       After receipt of the appropriate fee and inspection of the \n     application, the PTO Director is charged with the duty of \n     transmitting the application to the WIPO International \n     Bureau.\n       The Director is also obliged to notify the International \n     Bureau whenever the international application has been ``. . \n     . restricted, abandoned, canceled, or has expired . . .'' \n     within a specified time period.\n       The holder of an international registration may request an \n     extension of its registration by filing with the PTO or the \n     International Bureau.\n       The holder of an international registration is entitled to \n     the benefits of extension in the United States to the extent \n     necessary to give effect to any provision of the Protocol; \n     however, an extension of an international registration shall \n     not apply to the United States if the PTO is the office of \n     origin with respect to that mark.\n       The holder of an international registration with an \n     extension of protection in the United States may claim a date \n     of priority based on certain conditions.\n       If the PTO Director believes that an applicant is entitled \n     to an extension of protection, he or she publishes the mark \n     in the ``Official Gazette'' of the PTO. This serves notice to \n     third parties who oppose the extension. Unless an official \n     protest conducted pursuant to existing law is successful, the \n     request for extension may not be refused. If the request for \n     extension is denied, however, the Director notifies the \n     International Bureau of such action and sets forth the \n     reason(s) why. The Director must also apprise\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n     the International Bureau of other relevant information \n     pertaining to requests for extension within the designated \n     time periods.\n       If an extension for protection is granted, the Director \n     issues a certificate attesting to such action, and publishes \n     notice of the certificate in the ``Gazette.'' Holders of \n     extension certificates thereafter enjoy protection equal to \n     that of other owners of registration listed on the Principal \n     Register of the PTO.\n       If the International Bureau notifies the PTO of a \n     cancellation of some or all of the goods and services listed \n     in the international registration, the Director must cancel \n     an extension of protection with respect to the same goods and \n     services as of the date on which the international \n     registration was canceled. Similarly, if the International \n     Bureau does not renew an international registration, the \n     corresponding extension of protection in the United States \n     shall cease to be valid. Finally, the holder of an \n     international registration canceled in whole or in part by \n     the International Bureau may file an application for the \n     registration of the same mark for any of the goods and \n     services to which the cancellation applies that were covered \n     by an extension of protection to the United States based on \n     that international registration.\n       The holder of an extension of protection must, within \n     designated time periods and under certain conditions, file an \n     affidavit setting forth the relevant goods or services \n     covered an any explanation as to why their nonuse in commerce \n     is related to ``special circumstances,'' along with a filing \n     fee.\n       The right to an extension of protection may be assigned to \n     a third party so long as the individual is a national of, or \n     is domiciled in, or has a ``bona fide'' business located in a \n     country that is a member of the Protocol; or has such a \n     business in a country that is a member of an \n     intergovernmental organization (like the E.U.) belonging to \n     the Protocol.\n       An extension of protection conveys the same rights as an \n     existing registration for the same mark if the extension and \n     existing registration are owned by the same person, and \n     extension of protection and the existing registration cover \n     the same goods or services, and the certificate of extension \n     is issued after the date of the existing registration.\n\n\n                       SECTION 3. EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n       This section states that the effective date of the act \n     shall commence on the date on which the Madrid Protocol takes \n     effect in the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, legislation that will, for the \nfirst time, enable American businesses to obtain international \ntrademark protection with the filing of a single application and the \npayment of a single fee.\n  For many businesses, a company's trademark is its most valuable \nasset. This is illustrated now as never before in the growth of the new \nInternet economy, where so-called ``branding'' is the name of the game \nand the cornerstone of any business plan. Whether a business is an e-\nbusiness or a more traditional Main Street storefront, United States \ntrademark law has proven to be a powerful tool for these businesses in \nprotecting their marks against domestic misappropriation. However, as \nglobal trading increases and multinational businesses grow, worldwide \ntrademark protection is becoming extremely important and desirable. \nUnfortunately, achieving similar protection on an international scale \nhas always been a much more difficult task. This difficulty stems in \nlarge part from the diversity among national trademark laws, as well as \nthe sometimes prohibitive costs of filing individual registrations and \nseeking foreign representation in each and every country for which \ntrademark protection is sought. As a result, American businesses, and \nsmall businesses in particular, are often forced to pick only a handful \nof countries in which to seek protection for their brand names and hope \nfor the best in the rest of the world.\n  In the past, Senator Leahy and I have sponsored a number of bills \naddressing the international protection of intellectual property. In \nthe trademark arena, we strongly supported legislation implementing the \nTrademark Law Treaty. That treaty serves to streamline the trademark \nregistration process in member countries around the world and to \nminimize the hurdles faced by American trademark owners in securing \ninternational protection of their marks. The legislation we introduce \ntoday will build upon those improvements by allowing trademark owners \nto seek international protection with a single application filed in the \nEnglish language with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, \nUSPTO, and with the payment of a single fee. Most important, it paves \nthe way for the USPTO to act as a one-stop shop for international \ntrademark protection without making substantive changes to United \nStates trademark law. Foreign trademark owners must still meet all of \nthe substantive requirements of United States trademark law in order to \ngain protection in the United States based on an international \napplication filed under the Madrid Protocol. In short, it is a win-win \nsituation for American trademark owners.\n  As my colleagues here know, United States adherence to the Madrid \nProtocol was stalled for years over administrative provisions--\nunrelated to the substance of the Protocol itself--relating to voting \nrights. Since 1994, the Administration voiced objections to these \nprovisions, which would allow an intergovernmental organization, e.g., \nthe European Union, a vote in certain treaty matters taken before the \nAssembly, separate and apart from the votes of its member states. \nAlthough matters before the Assembly would largely be limited to \nadministrative matters, e.g., those involving formalities and fee \nchanges, the concern expressed has been that these provisions, which \nappear to violate the democratic principle of one vote for each state, \nwould create an undesirable precedent in future international \nagreements.\n  While this stumbling block to United States accession to the Protocol \nhas been the subject of much negotiation between the United States and \nthe European Union, I am pleased that a successful resolution on this \nissue of voting rights has been reached, and I was pleased that the \nSenate finally received the Administration's request for its advice and \nconsent last year. By passing The Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, \nwe will take an important step in making sure that American trademark \nowners will be able to take full advantage of the benefits of the \nProtocol as soon as it comes into force with respect to the United \nStates. This is a particularly important measure for American \ncompetitiveness, and for the individual businesses in each of our \nstates. I want to thank Senator Leahy for his leadership with respect \nto this legislation, and I look forward to my colleagues' support for \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 408. A bill to provide emergency relief to small businesses \naffected by significant increases in the price of electricity; to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Small Business \nElectricity Emergency Relief Act. As the electricity crisis in \nCalifornia continues, small businesses are being hit hard by the \nincrease in electricity prices.\n  Across California, small business owners are opening their \nelectricity bills only to be in a state of shock. In some cases they \nfind that their bills have doubled, and sometimes even tripled. This \nhas resulted in many small businesses having to close their doors and \nmany more facing severe economic hardship.\n  Under the Small Business Electricity Emergency Relief Act of 2001, \nthe Small Business Administration could make loans to small businesses \nthat have suffered economic injury due to a ``sharp and significant \nincrease'' in their electricity bills.\n  This legislation will provide California's small businesses with some \nmuch needed financial relief.

Con. Res. 17\n\n       Whereas members of the uniformed services of the United \n     States and civilian employees of the United States make \n     significant contributions to the general welfare of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas increases in the levels of pay of members of the \n     uniformed services and of civilian employees of the United \n     States have not kept pace with increases in the overall \n     levels of pay of workers in the private sector;\n       Whereas there is a 32 percent gap between the compensation \n     levels of Federal civilian employees and the compensation \n     levels of\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\n     private sector workers, and an estimated 10 percent gap \n     between the compensation levels of members of the uniformed \n     services and the compensation levels of private sector \n     workers; and\n       Whereas in almost every year of the past 2 decades, members \n     of the uniformed services and civilian employees of the \n     United States have received equal adjustments in \n     compensation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that there \n     should continue to be parity between the adjustments in the \n     compensation of members of the uniformed services and the \n     adjustments in the compensation of civilian employees of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nWarner, Mikulski, Bingaman, and Kennedy in introducing a resolution \nwhich would express the sense of the Congress that parity between \nFederal civilian pay and military pay should be maintained. A \ncomparison of military and civilian pay increases by the Congressional \nResearch Service finds that in 17 of these last 20 years military and \ncivilian pay increases have been identical. Disparate treatment of \ncivilian and military pay goes against longstanding policy of parity \nfor all those who have chosen to serve our Nation--whether that service \nbe in the civilian workforce or in the armed services.\n  In the 106th Congress, an overwhelming majority of the United States \nSenate agreed, and approved a bipartisan pay parity amendment on \nFebruary 24, 1999 by a vote of 94 to 6 during consideration of S. 4, \nthe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines Bill of Rights Act. In \nmany instances, Federal civilian and military employees work side-by-\nside doing the important work of the Nation, and the Senate has \nrecognized that we should not undermine the morale of these very \ndedicated public servants by failing to bring them in line with \nmilitary personnel.\n  The rationales for an increase in military and civilian pay are the \nsame. Both the armed services and the Federal civilian workforce need \nto address critical retention and recruitment problems. This year, the \nGeneral Accounting Office, GAO, has added ``human capital'' as one of \nthe areas of high risk for the Federal government. A wave of potential \nretirements threaten institutional experience and knowledge at every \nlevel. An estimated 53 percent of the Federal workforce will be \neligible to retire by 2004. By that same time, approximately 60 percent \nof the Senior Executive Service, our top civilian managers, will be \neligible for retirement.\n  These vacancies will occur in an era in which those entering the \nworkforce are less likely to join public service. As the GAO has noted, \nthe ``Federal government has often acted as if its people were costs to \nbe cut rather than assets to be valued.'' Congress has continually \nasked Federal employees to make significant sacrifices for the sake of \nour Nation's fiscal health. FEPCA, legislation passed in 1990 to bring \nthe pay of Federal employees in line with that offered in the private \nsector, has never been fully implemented. Between 1993 and 1999, the \nexecutive branch has cut 17 percent of its workforce, totaling 377,000 \nfull time positions. In 1996, Federal employees were forced to make \nhigher contributions to their retirement plans in order to help pay \ndown the national debt. But through it all, Federal employees have \ncontinued to provide high quality service to the American public, \nusually with fewer resources and personnel.\n  One way to ensure the Federal government is able to attract and \nretain qualified public servants is to ensure parity between civil \nservice employees and members of the armed forces. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in support of this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1640-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1640-S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 18--RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND \nCONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PEACE CORPS OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Chafee) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n                            S.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ncelebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Peace Corps. \nMany of my colleagues know of my history as a Peace Corps volunteer in \nthe Dominican Republic, and the great impact that that experience had \non me. Serving outside of the United States and seeing the shortcomings \nof other nations, I grew to appreciate this nation more and more, and \ndeveloped a strong sense of what it means to be an American. And, I was \nproud to share my experiences as a United States citizen with the \npeople I was sent to help. At the end of the day, the smiling faces of \nthe people in the community in which I was stationed made all my hard \nwork worthwhile.\n  My experience as a Peace Corps volunteer was almost 33 years ago, \nwhen the Peace Corps was still a relatively new organization. But, \nunder the leadership of such distinguished directors as Sargent \nShriver, Loret Ruppe, Paul Coverdell, Mark Schneider, and all the other \ndirectors in the Peace Corps history, the organization has grown and \ngrown. I am proud to stand here today and report that from its humble \nbeginnings as a method for Americans to share their expertise and \nassistance with other nations, the Peace Corps has grown into an \norganization that sends more than 7,000 volunteers to 76 different \ncountries a year.\n  These volunteers are really the heart and soul of the Peace Corps. \nThey are the ones at the front lines, working hard and making \nindividual connections with the citizens of the countries in which they \nwork. Since 1961, Peace Corps volunteers have brought a wealth of \npractical assistance to communities in Africa, Latin America, Asia, the \nMiddle East, Eastern Europe, and the Pacific. They have worked at such \ndisparate tasks as halting the spread of AIDS, advising small business \nowners, protecting the environment, educating students, and increasing \nfarm yields. Volunteers have played a vital role in short-term disaster \nrelief and humanitarian efforts. In the face of many personal and \nphysical challenges, Peace Corps volunteers offer their ingenuity and \nan approach to problem solving that is both optimistic and pragmatic. \nAbove all, the Peace Corps enduring success is rooted in volunteer's \ncommitment to leave behind skills that allow people to take charge of \ntheir own futures.\n  Peace Corps volunteers also make a difference at home by continuing \ntheir community service and strengthening Americans' appreciation of \nother cultures. By visiting classrooms, working with community groups, \nand speaking with friends and family members, volunteers help others \nlearn more about\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nthe world in which we live and help build a legacy of service for the \nnext generation.\n  Today, the Peace Corps continues to strengthen existing programs and \nexpand its activities around the world, including new programs in \nMozambique, Bangladesh, and Georgia. The Peace Corps also plans to \ngraduate from several countries where volunteers have made significant \nprogress during a critical period of transformation, including Poland, \nthe Slovak Republic, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n  Current volunteers are somewhat different than the volunteers of the \nearly years when I was a volunteer. The average age has risen from 22 \nto 28, the percentage of women has increased from 35 to 60, the number \nof volunteers with graduate degrees is growing, and today's volunteers \nrepresent the most ethnically diverse group so far. However, today's \nvolunteers share a characteristic with their predecessors that is a \ncornerstone of Peace Corps service--a commitment to the spirit of \nvolunteerism and service that President Kennedy first envisioned 40 \nyears ago.\n  Today, on Peace Corps Day, thousands of returned volunteers will \ncelebrate by sharing the knowledge and insights gained from their \noverseas experiences with school groups and local communities \nthroughout the United States. A series of activities are also planned \nin the Peace Corps countries, where volunteers and their host country \ncolleagues will celebrate their accomplishments and the universal goals \nof partnership and goodwill.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution \ncelebrating the Peace Corps and its worldwide network on the 40th \nanniversary of the Peace Corps, and in honoring Peace Corps volunteers, \npast and present, for their four decades of service to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/27/senate-section/article/S1641-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. McConnell.
