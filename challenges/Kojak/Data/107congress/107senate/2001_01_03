May the awesome vows they take and the immense \nresponsibilities they assume bring them to true humility and to an \nunprecedented openness to You. Save them from the seduction of power, \nthe addiction of popularity, and the aggrandizement of pride. Lord, \nkeep their priorities straight: You and their families first; the good \nof the Nation second; consensus around truth third; party loyalties \nfourth; and personal success last of all.\n  In the 107th Senate, equally divided between Republicans and \nDemocrats, grant them unity and effectiveness to work together to solve \nproblems and grasp the opportunities for our Republic at this \npropitious time.\n  May they never forget that they are here to serve and not to be \nserved.

We believe that this can be \nAmerica's finest hour awaiting leaders imbued with Your power. God of \nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the Lord Jesus Christ, You are our Lord \nand Saviour.

Mr. President, on behalf of the entire Senate, but \nespecially this Senator, I welcome you back to the Senate. This is a \nhistoric day. Never before in the history of our Nation have we had a \n50-50 Senate. I welcome and congratulate all 11 of our newly elected \nSenators and the family members and friends who are here to share this \nimportant day with them.\n  Years after he left the White House, Harry Truman wrote that the \ndecade he spent in the Senate were the happiest years of his life. As \nour new colleagues begin their Senate careers, we hope that they, too, \nare beginning what will be the happiest years of their lives.\n  Several of our departing colleagues are also here with us today. To \nthem we say thank you: Thank you for sharing with us and with our \nNation some of the best years of your lives, thank you for the \ncontributions you have made to our Nation during your years of public \nlife, and thank you for the important contributions you will continue \nto make in the coming years. It has been a pleasure and an honor to \nwork with each of you.\n  The writer Thomas Wolfe said that America is a place where miracles \nnot only happen, they happen all the time. Today we are experiencing \none of those miracles: The peaceful transition of power from one \nCongress to the other. Some people say it will take another miracle for \nthis Congress and administration to find a way to work together. As we \nbegin this historic Congress, let us resolve that we will work in good \nfaith with each other to do the people's business. That is our pledge \nfrom this side of the aisle. We know our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle feel as we do.\n  Finally, on a personal note, it is a high honor to have the privilege \nof officially opening this Senate. When I first ran for Democratic \nleader 6 years ago, I thought if I won, I would be majority leader. I \nmust confess that in 6 years as minority leader, I had a moment or two \nwhen I wondered if that day would ever arrive, but I assure you, I \nintend to savor every one of the next 17 days.\n  I know we are all looking forward to a bipartisan and a productive \n107th Congress that will serve our country well. It is an honor to be a \npart of this Congress and to be able to work, once again, with my \nfriend and my colleague, Senator Lott.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Republican leader be permitted \nto speak.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered. The minority \nleader, Senator Lott, is recognized.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S1-6", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1-S2]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THANKING THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished majority \nleader for this opportunity to speak.\n  I want to extend also the appreciation of the Senate and a grateful \nNation to the Presiding Officer, the Vice President of the United \nStates, for the service he has given to our country.\n\n[[Page S2]]\n\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will remind the Senate that boisterous \ndemonstrations are against the rules.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. It is obvious, Mr. President, you still maintain your sense \nof humor. I want to thank you for your leadership and also for the \nexample you have set through a very difficult time. You took the \nappropriate step, and now we are prepared to move into a transition and \nto a new administration.\n\n\n                         Facing New Challenges\n\n  Here in the Senate also we are having a historic experience. I would \nlike to welcome all of the new Senators who are joining us today. I \ncongratulate them. I look forward to working with the new Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  As Senator Daschle said, I also extend, again, our appreciation to \nthe Senators who may be in the Chamber and who are retiring or leaving \nthe Senate, who have served, most of them, for at least 6 years and \nsome for much longer than that. They have done a lot to make this \ncountry a better place in which to live.\n  I also extend our appreciation to the extended family of the Senate, \nour staff members new and old, and to the families who are in the \ngallery today. I realize we should not be referring to those in the \ngallery, but there are a lot of people who have made an awful lot of \ncontributions and sacrifices to make this day possible for us in the \nChamber. So we have a lot of people we need to thank, and also to \nrealize that we are in a position where we can make this an even better \ncountry.\n  To the new Members, I urge them to take a look around and think about \nthe challenges and opportunities they will have here. It is a unique \ninstitution, created by the founders of this Republic. Quite often we \nare frustrated with the rules--frustrated even today that we are going \nthrough this unique situation--but they had a lot of foresight. They \ncreated this unique Senate that makes sure we take the time to think \nthrough an issue and to have full debate. And while sometimes we \nbelieve, on one side or the other, that we did not have an ample \nopportunity for debate, I am sure we are going to work together to find \na way to give everybody that opportunity over the next 6 years.\n  For those of us who have been here a few years, we also face new \nchallenges. We have one today. I must say it is the first time I have \never been referred to as the minority leader. And while it beats \ncertain alternatives, I liked the other title better. But we are \nshowing here today--and hope we will show during the next 17 days and, \nmore importantly, during the months beyond--that we will always find a \nway to work together.\n  It is quite often not easy to find consensus, as is forced upon us \nquite often in the Senate, but we must strive for it. Quite often \nSenator Daschle and I do our very best to find a logical solution to a \nproblem, and we have 98 other Senators who may not agree with us, but \nwe will continue to work together to make this great Republic--the \nbest, most outstanding the minds of men have ever created--work as it \nshould.\n\n  I look around the Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, and I see men \nand women with the potential to raise this country to an even higher \nlevel, to our highest and our best. I will work as the leader of my \nparty, and in 17 days as the majority leader of the Senate, to find a \nway to make that possible.\n  One bit of information from a housekeeping standpoint. We will have \nsome housekeeping resolutions that we will do in a moment. One of them \nis to begin the introduction of bills on January 22. Senators should be \nprepared to have bills ready. Senator Daschle and I have already talked \nabout the fact that we will do the usual five alternating from one side \nto the other. We will do that for the first 20 bills. There will be a \nlot of other announcements Senator Daschle and I will make.\n  So thank you for this opportunity. I thank you on my side of the \naisle for this leadership role. Together we will go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S2-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2-S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CERTIFICATES OF ELECTION AND CREDENTIALS\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, 213 years ago, the Framers of the \nConstitution created the United States Senate.\n  In all the years since then, only 1,864 Americans have been granted \nthe privilege of serving in this extraordinary body; and that includes \nthe new Senators we welcome today.\n  For every Senator, whether serving in the 18th Century or the 21st, \nwhether beginning one's first term, or--like Senator Byrd--one's \neighth, the opening of a new Congress has always been a time of great \nhope. This Congress is no exception.\n  We have important work ahead of us. We also have--within us--\neverything\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nwe need to do that work wisely and well--if we choose to do so.\n  Never before has America had a 50/50 Senate. Thirty-one State \nlegislatures have dealt creatively with this challenge in the last 30 \nyears, but no U.S. Senate has ever been divided exactly in half.\n  An even split does not necessitate political gridlock--as these \nStates have demonstrated--but does require bipartisanship.\n  Senate Lott and I have had a number of discussions over the past \nweeks about how to organize this Congress so that it is both \nrepresentative and productive. Our conversations have been friendly and \nconstructive, and they are continuing. It is my hope that we will have \na plan soon that our fellow Senators, and our fellow Americans, will \nagree is workable and fair.\n  Another reason this Senate is historic is because it includes--I'm \nhappy to note--a record number of women. Of the 11 new Senators who \njoin us today, 4 are women. In all, there are now 13 women in this \nSenate--the most women ever to serve in the Senate at the same time. I \nam especially proud that 10 of those women are Democrats. In fact, \nthere are more women Senators in our caucus this year than there were \nin the entire Senate last year. That is good news, for women, for \nfamilies, and for this institution.\n  There is one more reason this Senate is historic and that is, the \nextraordinary events that occurred between the election and today.\n  This last Presidential election tested the patience of our people and \nthe strength of our institutions like no other election in our \nlifetime. It was a difficult time for all Americans. But throughout \nthose 5 long weeks of uncertainty--from election night until the \nSupreme Court decision--the American people remained confident that our \nsystem of government was strong enough to withstand the test of a \ncontested Presidential election. They continued to believe that we \ncould resolve the uncertainty, and move on. The challenge for this \nCongress, and this Senate, is to prove worthy of that faith. I am \nhopeful we can.\n  Now, we have a President-elect. His administration is taking shape. \nIn just over 2 weeks, George W. Bush will become our President.\n  I speak for all my colleagues on this side of the aisle when I say we \nare ready to work in good faith with our Republican friends and with \nPresident-elect Bush and his administration to find bipartisan \nsolutions to the challenges facing our Nation. As I have said before: \nBipartisanship is not an option. If we are going to do the work here in \nthe appropriate way, as we have been sent here to do, it is now a \nrequirement.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone understands or accepts that fact. A \ncouple of weeks ago, I read a column by a well-known syndicated \npolitical pundit. The headline read: ``Beware the bipartisanship.''\n  The next day, there was another column. It had a different author, \nbut the sentiment was the same. The headline on that one read: \n``Bipartisan blather.''\n  The writer of the first column said bipartisanship amounted to \n``betrayal'' of one's principles and supporters.\n  The author of the second column was even more succinct and scathing. \nHe called it, bipartisanship, an ``instrument of emasculation.''\n  Both of these men are good writers. They are on talk shows all the \ntime. But they are not--as Teddy Roosevelt put it--``in the arena.'' \nThey have not answered a call to public service, as we have. They \ndidn't look people in the eyes and tell them: ``If you'll vote for me, \nI promise you I will do my level best in the Senate, to pay down the \nnational debt, or create an affordable prescription drug benefit'', or \ndo any of the other things we told people back home we would try to do.\n  They are clever writers, but they did not take an oath to serve their \nNation. We have.\n  We need to use our cleverness to find the bipartisan solutions that \nevaded the last Congress. We need to show the American people that \ntheir faith in our system of government was not misplaced. And I \nbelieve we can.\n  After reading those negative views of bipartisanship, I decided I \nneeded a different perspective, so I reread all seven of the speeches \nfrom the leader's lecture series.\n  For those who may not be familiar with it, the leader's lecture \nseries is the most extraordinary lecture series in the city.\n  I commend my friend, Senator Lott, whose idea it was.\n  Shortly after he became majority leader, he decided that we ought to \ntake advantage of the unusual--perhaps unprecedented--fact that so many \nformer Senate leaders were still alive. As he put it, we ought to find \na way to share with the Nation ``the wisdom and insights that can be \ngained only by a lifetime of service to free people.''\n  The lectures all take place in the majestic Old Senate Chamber, where \nClay and Webster debated the great issues of their day.\n  Over nearly 3 years, we have heard candid recollections and sage \nadvice from seven remarkable leaders. As we begin this new Congress, I \nthought it might be instructive to listen again to what they had to say \nabout what works in the Senate and what this Senate is all about.\n  Mike Mansfield was majority leader from 1959 to 1969. He was also \nAmbassador to Japan under both parties.\n  In the end, he said, the Senate can only function ``if there is a \nhigh degree of accommodation, mutual restraint, and a measure of \ncourage--in spite of our weaknesses--in all of us.''\n  Howard Baker is a friend to many of us. He was the Senate majority \nleader during the Reagan administration and later served as President \nReagan's chief of staff.\n  He said that our ability to settle matters of national importance \npeacefully and honorably in this Chamber is one of the things that sets \nthis Nation apart from so many others.\n  He offered what he called a ``Baker's Dozen Rules for Senate \nLeadership.''\n  Among his rules: ``Have a genuine respect for differing points of \nview. Remember that every Senator is an individual, with individual \nneeds, ambitions and political conditions. Also remember that even \nmembers of the opposition party are susceptible to persuasion and \nredemption on a surprising number of issues.''\n  The third speaker in the series was Robert C. Byrd, the only one of \nthe seven with whom we still have the good fortune to work and learn \nfrom nearly every day.\n  In his more than 40 years in this body, Senator Byrd has served as \nboth majority and minority leader, as President pro tempore, and as \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  In his typically wise lecture, he reminded us that our founders \n``were pragmatists, rather than idealists,'' and that this Senate is \nitself the result of a compromise, the Great Compromise of July 16, \n1787.\n  He went on to say: ``Political polarization . . . is not now, and \nnever has been, a good thing for the Senate.\n  ``I am talking about politics when it becomes gamesmanship or mean-\nspirited, or when it becomes overly manipulative, simply to gain \nadvantage. I am not talking about honestly held views or differing \npolitical positions. Those things enrich our system.\n  ``Americans,'' he said, ``have always loved a good debate. And that \nis what I believe they wish for now: more substantive and stimulating \ndebate, and less pure politics and imagery.''\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  President Bush--the first President Bush--said two of the most \nimportant legislative accomplishments during his Presidency were, \nfirst, the Clean Air Act, which passed as a result of the extraordinary \ncombined efforts of President Bush and George Mitchell; and second, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, whose two strongest champions in this \nbody were Bob Dole and Tom Harkin.\n  He described both measures as ``landmark pieces of legislation that \nbecame a reality only after the White House and the Senate demonstrated \nbipartisanship and compromise.''\n  George Mitchell, my friend and immediate predecessor as Democratic \nleader, recalled the 3\\1/2\\ years he spent chairing the Northern \nIreland peace negotiations after leaving the Senate.\n  Frequently during those negotiations, he said, one party would plead \nwith him to limit debate by the other parties.\n  He never would, explaining: ``I got my training in the United States \nSenate.''\n  After 3\\1/2\\ years of talking, the parties reached an agreement to \nend a conflict that had gone on for hundreds of years.\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\n  Senator Mitchell said he is often asked whether there are common \nlessons that can be drawn from his experience in this Senate and at the \npeace table in Belfast.\n  Yes, he said. And among the most important is this:\n  ``There is no such thing as a conflict that can't be ended. Conflicts \nare created and sustained by human beings. They can be ended by human \nbeings.''\n  That is a lesson worth remembering as this new Congress begins.\n  The sixth speaker in the leader's lecture series is also a friend to \nmany of us--a man to whom I owe a personal debt of gratitude and for \nwhom I have the greatest respect: Robert J. Dole.\n  For 18 months, he and I served as leaders of our parties.\n  That was 6 years ago. My party had just done the unthinkable. We had \nlost the majority in both the House and the Senate. Not only was \nSenator Dole now the majority leader--a position I had hoped to hold--\nbut it was also widely assumed that he would run against a Democratic \nPresident the next year.\n  We could have had a terrible relationship. The fact that we did not \nwas due to Senator Dole's love of this body and this Nation, and to his \nfundamental sense of fairness and decency.\n  He served as Republican leader for 11 years--longer than any \nRepublican in history. In all, he spent 10,000 days in this Senate. Of \nthose 10,000 days, he said, a few stood out especially vividly.\n  One day that stood out, he said, was when he invited former Senator \nGeorge McGovern to join the congressional delegation attending the \nfuneral of former First Lady Pat Nixon:\n\n       (A) reporter asked George why he should honor the wife of a \n     man with whom he had waged a bitter battle for the White \n     House. Senator McGovern replied: ``You can't keep on \n     campaigning forever.'' And George was right.\n\n  It seems to me that is another lesson worth remembering as this \nCongress begins.\n  The seventh speaker, former Vice President Dan Quayle, recalled as \none of his proudest achievements in the Senate was working with Ted \nKennedy to strengthen America's job-training programs in the early \n1980s.\n  He also said that people often ask him how being Vice President \ncompares with being a Senator.\n  He tells them: ``When you are Vice President, it is always impressed \non you that you are No. 2 . . .''\n  But ``when you are a Senator, you are your own person. You have real \nautonomy. You make independent decisions . . . You are, in a way, an \nindependent conscience in this institution.\n  The best word to describe a Senator is: free. He or she is free to \nstand up and debate, free to speak his or her mind, free to act \naccording to his or her best judgment.\n  ``I believe you would concur that the Senate's best debates,'' he \nadded, ``are bipartisan debates.''\n  These are seven remarkable leaders who achieved the highest positions \nin their parties--who know what it means to be in Teddy Roosevelt's \n``arena.''\n  To them, bipartisanship is not emasculating. It is ennobling. It is \nnot betraying the people who sent us here. It is the only hope we have \nof serving them.\n  What is bipartisanship in the 107th Congress? We will need to find \nthe right answer to that question if we are to serve our country well. \nWe will not be able to quantify bipartisanship. Bipartisanship is not a \nmathematical formula. It is a spirit. It is a way of working together \nthat tolerates open debate. It recognizes principled compromise. It \nmeans respecting the right of each Senator to speak his or her mind, \nand vote his or her conscience. And it means recognizing that we must \ndo business differently after an election that gave us a 50-50 Senate \nand an almost evenly divided House. Above all, it means putting the \nnational interest ahead of personal or party interests.\n  This year, as I said, is a historic year for the Senate. This past \nyear was also historic. it was the 200th anniversary of Congress' first \nmeeting in this building.\n  As part of the anniversary celebration, artists are restoring what \nare known as the Brumidi Corridors on the first floor of the Capitol's \nSenate wing.\n  The Corridors were painted more than 150 years ago by an Italian \nimmigrant named Constantino Brumidi, the same man who painted the \nceiling in the Rotunda.\n  He has been called ``America's Michelangelo''--and with good reason.\n  He spent 25 years of his life painting scenes on the walls and \nceilings of this Capitol. It was a labor of love for the country he \nchose as his home.\n  I think I must have walked through those corridors 1,000 times over \nthe years. Every time, I marvel at Brumidi's talents and their beauty.\n  Over the years, Brumidi's original work was covered with layers of \npaint and varnish and dirt. Now, restorers are scraping those layers \noff. And what they are revealing beneath is an even more beautiful \ndepiction of Brumidi's imagination over 100 years ago.\n  I believe the same can be true of this Senate. Many times over the \nlast several years, a layer of bitter partisanship has settled over \nthis body. Even with that disadvantage, it has remained the greatest \nlegislative body in the history of the world, and one in which I am \nproud to serve. But think how much more effective it could be if we \ncould wash away the partisanship.\n  At the first Leaders' Lecture, Senator Lott compared the Old Senate \nChamber to this Chamber. He said that the Old Chamber was more \nintimate, and more beautiful. And he was right. But this Chamber has \none profound distinction that makes all the difference. The Old Chamber \ncelebrates our past. In this Chamber, it is our privilege--and our \nresponsibility--to chart our Nation's future.\n  I look forward to working with Senators on both sides of the aisle, \nand with our new President, to find honorable ways to do the work we \nhave all been sent here to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S10-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the floor, \nI want to tell him how much I appreciate not only the content of what \nhe has stated but the expression that was given. We have a lot of work \nto do.\n  As our leader, we Democrats have watched you over these past 6 years, \nand have marveled at the work you have been able to do. I do agree with \nyou; the Senate has changed remarkably in its composition. It has \nimproved so much with the addition of women. Now 20 percent of our \nconference is made up of women. We are a better Senate for that having \noccurred. We are going to continue to get better.\n  I say to the majority leader that we support you. We acknowledge \nthere are some things we need to work out. I hope in this tone of \ncompromise that the first thing the Republicans will do, during the \ntime they are in the minority status, would be to acknowledge that the \nSenate is 50-50, and as a result of that, because most of the work is \ndone in committees, we have an arrangement where the committees are \nevenly divided. I know our leader has worked hard to accomplish that. I \nhope that can be done between you and Senator Lott. I hope we will not \nhave to have filibusters by the Republicans on a resolution to \nestablish what is a fair, equally divided committee structure in the \nSenate.\n  I also acknowledge the leader for his statement about what we need to \ndo. We have so many things to do: With education, health care, making \nsure that workers are protected, dealing with the difficult problems we \nhave with Medicare, and paying down this huge debt that we owe. I hope \nwe can keep our eye on the prize and not get burdened with partisan \nsquabbling.\n\n  So as one of your loyal lieutenants, I look forward to this next \nCongress and accomplishing things for the people of the State of \nNevada, the people of South Dakota, the people of Louisiana, and the \nwhole country, so that we can walk out of here as proud, when this \nCongress ends, as we are at the beginning of this Congress.\n  Again, I congratulate and applaud the majority leader for his \nremarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S10-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10-S11]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THANKING THE ASSISTANT MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, today we saw new Members of the Senate \nsworn in. It was a pleasure to see a dear personal friend, Maria \nCantwell from the great State of Washington, sworn in as that State's \njunior Senator.\n  When I was visiting with her in the fall, during the maximum \nclimactic days of her campaign, we were talking about the Senate and \ngreat Senators from the State of Washington, and the name of Henry \n``Scoop'' Jackson came up. He has been one of my heroes. As a matter of \nfact, last year I was given the Scoop Jackson Award, and it was a great \nhonor for me to receive it.\n  Scoop Jackson was, of course, known for his stance for a strong \nmilitary, a strong defense, and also a strong commitment to positive \nand progressive social policies. This made him a great statesman from \nthe State of Washington.\n  When Maria and I discussed this, I said: It is interesting; when I \ncame to the Senate 4 years ago, I wound up with Scoop Jackson's desk. \nAs a matter of fact, as my colleagues know, it is a tradition, after \none has served here a while, that they carve their name in the desk \nwhen they leave.\n  This honored desk has Scoop Jackson's name carved in it. It is my \npleasure today to yield to the freshman Senator from the great State of \nWashington and, in the great tradition of Scoop Jackson, to yield to \nher this desk which will be transferred to her shortly. I wish her the \nvery best and a long, lively term in the Senate, particularly in the \ntradition of Scoop Jackson.\n  I welcome Senator Cantwell and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the State of Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Senator Cleland \nof Georgia, for the honor and this gift of a very humble beginning for \nme in the Senate, to have the opportunity not only to work with him and \nmy new colleagues but to be the recipient of such a warm welcome.\n  Senator Jackson was obviously a landmark in our Capitol, as well as \nhis years of dedication in our State. Senator Jackson arrived here in \nJanuary of 1941--he was 28 years old--and started to represent the \nState of Washington, the Second Congressional District, and then later, \nfor 31 years, served in the U.S. Senate.\n  He was a great leader on foreign policy, on human rights, on arms \ncontrol, and on the importance of our environment, with the Jackson-\nVanik amendment, with the National Environmental Protection Act, and a \nvariety of other landmark environmental policies that were so important \nto the State of Washington but also to this country.\n  It is an honor to accept this gift from Senator Cleland of the desk \nof Senator Scoop Jackson, a Senator who was known as one who worked \nacross the aisle in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, one observer of \npublic policy, George Will, called him one of the ``finest public \nservants I have known, who mastered the delicate balance of \ndemocracy.''\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia for this very kind gift and \noutreach on my very first day in the Senate in the hope that I will \ncarry on the Northwest tradition that has been so important to our \nState.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln).

ROBERT BOYER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the service and \ncareer of Mr. Robert Boyer, a member of the senior executive service, \nupon his retirement after 33 years of honorable and distinguished \nservice. Throughout his career, he has epitomized the Navy core values \nof honor, courage, and commitment and has displayed an exceptional \nability to advance the Navy's facilities requirements within the \nDepartment of Defense and the Congress. I commend him for a superb \ncareer of service to the Navy, our great Nation, and my home state of \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. Boyer received the 2000 Presidential Rank of Meritorious \nExecutive for sustained superior performance, leadership and \nmanagement. He has a distinguished reputation as one of the \ngovernment's leaders in strategic acquisition, business innovations, \nand contract initiatives. As the lead senior civilian with the Naval \nFacilities Engineering Command, Mr. Boyer is a visionary, directly \nresponsible for the implementation of new acquisition strategies and \ninnovative operations and organization changes that serve Navy \noperating forces, senior leaders of industry, and other customers \nworldwide. As the Executive Director of Acquisition during the past \nthree years, Mr. Boyer established a creative and ground-breaking an \nacquisition program copied both within and outside the federal \ngovernment. The global scope of his responsibilities and the depth, \nbreadth and sheer quantity of contractual actions under Mr. Boyer's \npurview are staggering. While Mr. Boyer continues to champion \ninnovation and initiative within the entire Command, he continually \nexceeds the execution and performance goals of his Acquisition program. \nHis loyalty and integrity are unequaled, as is the respect that he has \nearned from his workforce. His combination of superior talent, \nleadership acumen and genuine love of his work make him a gifted \nexecutive.\n  Mr. Boyer's acquisition innovations have changed construction and \nservice contracting ashore and set new standards within the Department \nof Defense for programs such as the Public-Private-Venture for the \nFamily Housing and Utility product lines. He has made dramatic \noperational improvements, realigning scarce resources to acquire the \nbest possible value for the Navy. We widely acclaim his innovative \napproaches within the Navy and most recently, focused senior leaders on \nhis acquisition innovations.\n  From December 1991 to May 1996, Mr. Boyer was the Senior Procurement \nExecutive for the Federal Management Agency. In this capacity he \ndirected a nationwide contract, grant, and cooperative agreement \nprogram in support of the Agency's all hazard mission. His duties \nincluded direct support to the multibillion dollar state and local \nmunicipality efforts to improve their disaster mitigation programs, \nresponse, and recovery efforts. From 1971\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nto 1991, Mr. Boyer worked in various acquisition positions within the \nDepartment of Navy. Mr. Boyer served as a U.S. Army Infantry Officer \nfrom 1968 to 1970.\n  Mr. Boyer was born in Annandale, Virginia, but adopted South Carolina \nas his home while attending the Citadel where he earned his Masters in \nBusiness Administration. He is married to the former Julie Mandell. He \nand Julie have a son, Robby, and a daughter, Tracy.\n  Madam President, I wish him and his family the best in his well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S12-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12-S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JANET L. HOFFMAN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the Senate's \nattention the passing of a great and unique woman--Janet L. Hoffman. \nShe was described by the Baltimore Sun as ``a lobbyist whose political \nand financial wizardry helped Baltimore shoulder the burden of urban \npoverty.''\n  I first became acquainted with Janet Hoffman in 1971 as a member of \nthe Baltimore City Council. I came into politics as a fiery protestor \nand had to learn how to turn my protest placards into legislation. \nJanet Hoffman really taught me, guided me and mentored me in the \nstrategy of governance and the wiles of government finance. I learned \nhow to operationalize my good intentions and learned how to budget. She \nwas patient, persistent and a strong advocate for women's rights. She \nwas so proud of seeing me come to the Congress, the Senate and a member \nof the Appropriations Committee.\n  She'd be so proud in having her biography included in the \nCongressional Record on the day that four new women are sworn into the \nUnited States Senate. She would have cheered--and would have wanted to \nmake sure they understood government finance.\n  Mr. President, the Baltimore Sun described Janet Hoffman best. I ask \nthat the Sun's article on her life and legacy be included in the \nRecord.\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Dec. 31, 2000]\n\n            Janet L. Hoffman Dies; Lobbyist, Adviser to City\n\n\n             finance expert steered state aid to Baltimore\n\n                          (By C. Fraser Smith)\n\n       Janet L. Hoffman, a lobbyist whose political and financial \n     wizardry helped Baltimore shoulder the burden of urban \n     poverty, died yesterday of kidney failure at Oak Crest Health \n     Care Center in Parkville. She was 81 and had lived in Mount \n     Washington for many years.\n       A strategist as well as a master of government finance, \n     Mrs. Hoffman used Baltimore's fading power with pre-eminent \n     efficiency, building coalitions and making friends in the \n     highest places.\n       ``She was the best thing the city had in Annapolis,'' said \n     state comptroller and longtime Baltimore mayor William Donald \n     Schaefer. ``Everybody trusted her. She never misled anybody. \n     Her credibility was 100 percent in Annapolis. She was \n     brilliant.''\n       A woman who dressed simply, she walked the corridors of the \n     State House and City Hall in one of the many berets she wore.\n       ``She had a passion for the city that drove her,'' said \n     Marvin Mandel, Maryland's governor in the 1970s. ``Everybody \n     respected her. She was aggressive, too. But in the end, she \n     was one of the most knowledgeable persons in Annapolis.''\n       ``She was the most effective governmental lobbyist in the \n     history of our state,'' said U.S. Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin. \n     ``I owe my sensitivity toward fiscal matters to her.''\n       As Baltimore's first and longest-serving lobbyist in \n     Annapolis, she invented a position soon copied by the state's \n     largest subdivisions as they competed with her for state aid. \n     She continued in the job for 33 years, retiring in 1986 but \n     returning as a consultant periodically until 1996, when she \n     left the State House for good.\n       Then 77, she had served in city or state government for \n     almost a half-century. On her last day of city service, the \n     House of Delegates passed a resolution commemorating her \n     work.\n       She was known in her prime as Maryland's 48th senator, an \n     institutional honor that gave her a ``kick.'' In truth, she \n     had more real power than many of the 47 men and women who \n     earned the title at the polls, and she served far longer than \n     any of them.\n       In marathon lobbying sessions of 1976, she won funding for \n     the Baltimore subway and the downtown Convention Center from \n     the General Assembly. She was so exhausted she collapsed and \n     was driven home by a state trooper.\n       ``I remember going up to the gallery and speaking with \n     Donald Schaefer and Janet,'' Cardin said. ``It was a very \n     dramatic moment, an incredible night.''\n       Earlier in the decade, working with city budget official \n     Charles Benton, she recommended selling what is now BWI \n     Airport to the state and using the proceeds to build the \n     National Aquarium.\n       The trust of those she worked with combined with a keen \n     sense of history to bring her city an annual bonanza of \n     financial aid, including a 1960s realignment of \n     responsibility for welfare that freed the city of strains \n     that might have precluded the downtown renaissance of the \n     1980s. She also created financial formulas to pay for \n     portions of city fire, police, highway and educational \n     expenses.\n       Eight governors were elected during her service: William \n     Preston Lane Jr., Theodore R. McKeldin, J. Millard Tawes, \n     Spiro T. Agnew, Marvin Mandel, Harry R. Hughes, William \n     Donald Schaefer and Parris N. Glendening.\n       ``On the outside she was rough and tough,'' said former \n     Speaker of the House R. Clayton Mitchell Jr., a Kent County \n     Democrat.\n       ``But when you got to know her, she was sweet and lovable. \n     You could rely on her figures. She had a talent and gift for \n     numbers.''\n       Not infrequently, she helped them solve fiscal and \n     political problems. She did it with great mental dexterity, \n     bill-by-bill memory of legislative history and a keen sense \n     of what motivates people. Candid and direct to the end, she \n     said she was leaving finally to make way for new minds.\n       ``A more exploring, fresher approach is needed,'' she said. \n     ``It's hard at my stage to pick up a bill and really read it \n     because I think I know what's in it.''\n       Her first government job came in 1949 when she became the \n     first staff member in the state's newly created Fiscal \n     Research Bureau, which analyzed legislation for the House and \n     Senate. Thirteen years later, she left to do the same work \n     for Baltimore.\n       City legislators and mayors, not governors, were her \n     bosses. A master of the complicated formulas used to \n     redistribute the state's revenue, Mrs. Hoffman made the \n     arithmetic work year after year for Baltimore with categories \n     of aid she sometimes invented--sometimes on the thinnest \n     pretext. Then she sold them to the presiding officers and \n     governors who put them in play.\n       The state treasury's growing importance to a struggling \n     city losing population and power was little appreciated until \n     she took over. She learned that Baltimore department heads \n     were coming to Annapolis to lobby against money bills that \n     would have helped the city. Too much paperwork, they told \n     her. That view changed.\n       She quickly became a presence in the assembly. Unique among \n     public or private lobbyists, she was given access to the \n     Senate lounge and floor by then-Senate President Steny H. \n     Hoyer, now a member of Congress. Her singular status was owed \n     to the trust built over years of service, according to Mr. \n     Schaefer.\n       ``I think she's the smartest woman I ever met in the area \n     of finance,'' the former mayor and governor said in 1996. \n     ``People knew when she told them something, it was right.'' \n     Asked if he gave her authority to act in his absence, Mr. \n     Schaefer said he gave her authority to act in his presence.\n       In the 1960s, with the help of a rural and conservative \n     Senate president, the late William S. James, Mrs. Hoffman \n     managed a restructuring of responsibilities between the state \n     and local governments that shifted the financing of welfare \n     from the subdivisions to the state.\n       Then, like many major U.S. cities, Baltimore was paying a \n     quarter to a third of its welfare costs, a burden that was \n     growing and would have exhausted city resources if the state \n     had not stepped in. Mrs. Hoffman proposed limiting the \n     welfare payments of any state subdivision to a fixed \n     percentage of revenue from its tax rate.\n       ``It meant that while the city's welfare caseload was \n     growing and its tax-paying middle class was leaving, there \n     was a limit on what the city had to spend,'' said William S. \n     Ratchford II, director of the state Department of Fiscal \n     Services. ``If she hadn't worked that out, chances are the \n     city would not have had the wherewithal to do what it did \n     later.''\n       Mrs. Hoffman persuaded legislators that what helped \n     Baltimore was good for the state. The state's major \n     employment center was protected, and other, equally poor, \n     jurisdictions profited from the formulas she devised.\n       Adherents and adversaries alike were at times awed by her \n     forward-looking approach.\n       ``I had the best teacher in the world,'' said Blair Lee IV, \n     son of the former acting governor, Blair Lee III, and a \n     former lobbyist for Montgomery County.\n       ``We'd sit around late at night studying her city bills,'' \n     he said. ``Why would she be trying to change some nondescript \n     little bit of language or numbers in a bill? We looked and \n     looked and crunched and crunched, and finally we'd see that \n     Janet was dealing with something she saw coming 10 years down \n     the road.''\n       One year she pushed a bill that guaranteed a certain level \n     of aid that seemed lower than the sums Baltimore won year \n     after year. Why? Because she knew the formula on which that \n     aid was based would not work in the city's favor forever.\n       ``She could write a communicated budget formula and talk to \n     the least sophisticated legislator,'' Lee said. ``She was a \n     rare creature. She walked both sides of the track.''\n       One year she helped then-Senator Hoyer corral the votes he \n     needed to become senate\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\n     president. Once again, she had picked the right horse.\n       The next summer, she sat on a committee that worked out \n     school funding formulas with then-Lieutenant Governor Lee. It \n     was her payback--and Baltimore's--from Senate President \n     Hoyer.\n       She left in 1996 with concerns about the conduct of public \n     business:\n       ``People are unwilling to explain a broader point of view \n     than one that is readily understood by their local press or \n     their constituents,'' she said. ``The legislature needs a way \n     to see problems resolved structurally without having to have \n     a divisive fight each time.''\n       The former Janet Leland was born on the Upper West Side of \n     New York City into a family of lawyers. She was a graduate of \n     New York University. In 1941 she received a master's degree \n     in public administration from NYU.\n       Her home life was quiet. She kept a garden filled with \n     spring flowers and roses. She also listened to classical \n     music.\n       In 1944 she married Morton Hoffman, an urban and economic \n     consultant, who died in July.\n       Funeral services will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Sol \n     Levinson & Brothers, 8900 Reisterstown Road.\n       She is survived by two daughters, Constance Hoffman Baker \n     of Baltimore and Ellen L. Hoffman of Berkeley, Calif., and \n     four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S13-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. William, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S13-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States a treaty and \nsubmitting sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S13-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Senate be \ninformed that a quorum of the House of Representatives has assembled; \nthat J.

Madam President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Injunction of Secrecy be removed from the following \nconvention transmitted to the Senate on January 3, 2001, by the \nPresident of the United States: Convention on Safety of U.N. and \nAssociated Personnel (Treaty Document No. 107-1).\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent the convention be considered as \nhaving been read for the first time, that it be referred with \naccompanying papers to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered \nto be printed, and that the President's messages be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, with a view to receiving the advice and consent \nof the Senate to ratification, subject to an understanding and a \nreservation, the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and \nAssociated Personnel adopted by the United Nations General Assembly by \nconsensus on December 9, 1994, and signed on behalf of the United \nStates of America on December 19, 1994. The report of the Department of \nState with respect to the Convention is also transmitted for the \ninformation of the Senate.\n  Military peacekeepers, civilian police, and others associated with \nUnited Nations operations are often subject to attack by persons who \nperceive political benefits from directing violence against United \nNations operations. The world has witnessed a serious escalation of \nsuch attacks, resulting in numerous deaths and casualties. This \nConvention is designed to provide a measure of deterrence against these \nattacks, by creating a regime of universal criminal jurisdiction for \noffenses of this type. Specifically, the Convention creates a legal \nmechanism that requires submission for prosecution or extradition of \npersons alleged to have committed attacks and other offenses listed \nunder the Convention against United Nations and associated personnel.\n  This Convention provides a direct benefit to United States Armed \nForces and to U.S. civilians participating in peacekeeping activities \nby including within its coverage a number of types of operations \npursuant to United Nations mandates in which the United States and U.S. \nmilitary and civilians have participated in the past. If the United \nStates were to participate in operations under similar conditions in \nthe future, its forces and civilians would receive the benefits created \nby this instrument. The Convention covers not only forces under U.N. \ncommand, but associated forces under national command or multinational \nforces present pursuant to a United Nations mandate. In situations such \nas we have seen in Somalia, the former Yugoslavia, and Haiti, certain \nattacks on these associated forces would now be recognized as criminal \nacts, subjecting the attackers to prosecution in or extradition by any \nState that is a party to the Convention. As a result, the international \ncommunity has taken a significant practical step to redress these \nincidents. In doing so, we recognize the fact that attacks on \npeacekeepers who represent the international community are violations \nof law and cannot be condoned.\n  By creating obligations and procedures that increase the likelihood \nof prosecution of those who attack peacekeeping personnel, this \nConvention fulfills an important objective under my Directive for \nReforming Multilateral Peace Operations of May 1994, which directs that \nthe United States seek additional legal protections for United States \npeacekeeping personnel.\n  The recommended legislation, necessary to implement the Convention, \nwill be submitted to the Congress separately.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Convention subject to the understanding and reservation that are \ndescribed in the accompanying report of the Department of State, and \ngive its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \nThe White House, January 3, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/03/senate-section/article/S15-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. BAYH.
