Mr. President, last week a number of pharmaceutical \ncompanies announced a new program by which some Medicare enrollees, \nparticularly those at the lower income levels, will be able to access \nprescription drugs at a lower price. Let me compliment them for that. \nThese companies are certainly moving in the right direction by \nrecognizing that price is a very serious problem for a lot of Americans \nwith respect to prescription drugs. The companies that founded Together \nRx are Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, \nBristol-Myers Squibb Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and \nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Pfizer and Eli Lilly have \nseparate programs that they have already announced. I think it is a \nstep forward, and I compliment these companies.\n  We have much more to do, but having been very critical of the \nprescription drug manufacturers for price increases, let me say thanks \nfor these programs because they will benefit a good number of lower \nincome senior citizens.\n  However, let me describe one of the problems that still exists. This \nchart is of a Washington Post article, from within the last month, \n``Prescription Drug Spending Rises 17 Percent in the Last Year.'' There \nhave been double-digit increases year after year after year after year \nfor prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nTaking a prescription drug is not a luxury. It is a necessity. \nPrescription drugs can only save lives if you can afford to access \nthem.\n  We talk a great deal about senior citizens and the need to help them \nby adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program. We do \nthat because senior citizens are about 12 percent of America's \npopulation, but they take one-third of all the prescription drugs. Many \nsenior citizens are taking five, eight, and ten different kinds of \nprescription drugs. The price increases that have been occurring have \nbeen devastating, not just to senior citizens but to all Americans \ntrying to access the supply of prescription drugs they need.\n\n  It is useful to understand that the debate about access to \nprescription medicines is not just a theoretical one. From time to \ntime, I have described to my colleagues the experience I have had \nholding town meetings and hearings across North Dakota and the country \non prescription drug prices. The issue of the pricing of prescription \ndrugs is a very serious one for real people every day.\n  The U.S. consumer is charged the highest prices for exactly the same \nprescription drugs than anyone else in the world. The same pill made by \nthe same company put in the same bottle costs much more in the United \nStates than in other countries.\n  Tamoxifen, to treat breast cancer, is 10 times more expensive in the \nUnited States than in Canada, as an example. I ask unanimous consent to \ndemonstrate the point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am holding here empty prescription drug bottles from \nthe United States and Canada. It is useful to compare the prices of \nthese drugs. This is a drug called Zoloft which is used to treat \ndepression. There are two bottles here; the same tablet made by the \nsame company put in different bottles. But if you buy it in the United \nStates, it is $2.34 per tablet. The same tablet purchased in Canada is \n$1.28. So the same company makes the same pill and puts it into two \ndifferent bottles. The difference is, when an American consumer buys \nit, they pay $2.34. If you buy it in Canada, $1.28.\n  To give another example, Norvasc is a drug used to treat high blood \npressure. You buy it in Canada--same tablet, put in the same bottle, \nmade by the same company, shipped to two different places, the United \nStates and Canada--and it costs 90 cents and in the United States it \ncosts $1.20.\n\n  Cipro is a drug commonly used to treat infections. This bottle holds \na hundred 500 milligram tablets and costs $171 in Canada and $399 in \nthe United States--the same tablet, the same bottle, and manufactured \nby the same company. Often drugs are produced in a U.S. manufacturing \nplant to be sent to Canada and sold at a much lower price. And you have \nthe same thing happening in Italy, France, Germany, England, Sweden.\n  Now, why is that happening and what should we do about it? It is \nhappening because we are the only country in which there is not some \nkind of governmental regulatory system to limit what is charged for \nprescription drugs. Actually, we do have price controls on prescription \ndrugs here in the United States. It is just that the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers are the ones in charge of controlling the price. They \nratchet up the price as high as they possibly can, and the result is an \nindustry that is the financially healthiest in the United States.\n  But these high prices for drugs ultimately affect the relationship \nbetween a doctor and his patient. A doctor from Dickinson treats a \nwoman with breast cancer. The woman, who is on Medicare, comes back to \nthe doctor after having a mastectomy, and the doctor says: ``Here is \nwhat we have to do given the type and grade of your breast cancer. You \nhave to be on some prescription drugs that will substantially lessen \nthe recurrence of breast cancer for you.'' She says: ``What would this \ncost?'' When told what the cost of the drugs would be, she says, \n``Well, doctor, I don't have the money to pay for that. There isn't any \npossible way I can take those prescription drugs. What I will have to \ndo is just take my chances with the breast cancer.''\n  That is repeated in doctor's office after doctor's office around the \ncountry. I have senior citizens telling me they cannot possibly afford \ntheir drugs, so they cut them in half and take only half a dose so it \nwill last twice as long. In the small community of Michigan, North \nDakota with perhaps 300 or 400 people, after a farm meeting one \nevening--a woman in her late 70s grabbed my arm at the end of the \nmeeting and said: ``Mr. Senator, can you help me?'' She began to tear \nup. Her eyes got full of tears and her chin began to quiver, and she \nsaid: ``I am supposed to take these prescription drugs in order to stay \nalive, but I can't afford them. The doctor says that I must take them. \nCan you help me?''\n  This is repeated all over the country. I am talking about senior \ncitizens. But you could be talking about anybody who needs prescription \ndrugs and finds that the prices are simply out of reach. There was a 17 \npercent increase last year in the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Reimportation of drugs from Canada will save our citizens a lot of \nmoney. Dr. Alan Sager from Boston University was a witness at a hearing \nI held at which he described a study that showed that Americans would \nsave $38 billion a year if we paid Canadian prices for prescription \ndrugs. North Dakotans alone would pay $81 million less in a year.\n  Some would say that by allowing the reimportation of prescription \ndrugs, we are trying to import price controls. But what we are trying \nto do is force a repricing of prescription drugs in this country--a \nfairer price for the United States consumer. Why should we pay a dollar \nfor the same market basket of drugs for which the Canadians pay 60 \ncents? Why should we pay a dollar, when virtually every other consumer \nin the world is paying a fraction of that for the same drugs? We should \nnot and it is not fair.\n  There is a law on the books that prevents the reimportation of drugs \nfrom other countries, except by the manufacturer. If this is a global \neconomy, we say let's allow the reimportation of drugs as long as there \nis a clear chain of custody and we can do it safely. I will offer, \nalong with my colleagues, a proposal that would allow licensed \npharmacists and distributors to access that lower-priced, identical \nprescription drug from a Canadian supplier and pass the savings along \nto the U.S. consumer.\n  I understand why the pharmaceutical manufacturers would not like \nthat. But the point is, if this is a global economy, why should it only \nbe good for the big interests? How about for other interests as well? \nWhy should we not allow the reimportation of prescription drugs? The \nsame drug put in the same bottle, manufactured in a FDA-approved plant. \nWhy should we not allow that to be reimported to the U.S. as long as \nthere is no safety concern?\n  All we need is to import a less expensive drug that is identical and \nmade in an approved facility, to be able to provide a substantial \nbenefit to the American consumer. So we are going to be proposing \nanother amendment on that in the coming months. I know that the \nmanufacturers will resist us aggressively. I started by complimenting \nthem on the programs they are developing, but, frankly, we can't \ncontinue to see these cost increases in prescription drugs every year.\n  The miracle of medicine means nothing if you can't afford it. There \nhas been a 12, 15, 16, or 17 percent increase year after year, and it \nis breaking the back of the American consumer and the back of health \nplans. The fact is, it cannot continue. The prescription drug \nmanufacturers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, simply have to understand \nthat.\n  They say that if you do anything that restrict our ability to charge \nthese prices, there will be less research for the new miracle cures. \nBut we have doubled funding to the National Institutes of Health. We \nare providing substantial amounts of public funding for research, from \nwhich the pharmaceutical industry often is a major beneficiary.\n  I might also say, with respect to the pharmaceutical industry, they \nspend as much or more on advertising, marketing, and promotion as they \ndo on research. That is a fact.\n  So I think there is a lot to be done here. I pointed out that the \nindustry has announced some positive steps, but there is much more to \ndo, and we must take the right steps here in the Senate to address this \nissue.\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n  That is why a group of us will, once again, offer an amendment that \ndeals with the reimportation of prescription drugs--this time, only \nfrom Canada, where there can be no safety issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2639-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2639-S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAST-TRACK TRADE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Daschle, the majority leader, has \nnow promised that before the Memorial Day recess, the Senate will be \nconsidering the administration's request for trade promotion authority; \nthat is a euphemism for fast track. Fast-track authority allows an \nadministration to negotiate a trade agreement somewhere and bring it \nback to the Congress, and Congress is told: ``You are not able to \nchange a decimal point, a period, or a punctuation mark. You must vote \nup or down on an expedited basis on that agreement. No changes, no \namendments. No opportunity to make any alterations at all.'' That is \ncalled fast track.\n  Well, let me talk just a bit about this fast track. First of all, it \nis a fundamentally undemocratic proposition. We have negotiated most \nagreements that we have had without fast-track authority. We negotiate \nand have negotiated nuclear arms control agreements. There has been no \nfast-track authority for that. Most trade agreements that have been \nnegotiated have not had fast-track authority.\n  Let me make a couple of comments about trade. First of all, the \nConstitution says--article I, section 8--the Congress shall have the \npower to regulate commerce with foreign nations. That is the Congress \nthat said that. The Constitution says that the Congress has that power, \nnot the President.\n  Fast track itself, in three decades, has been used five times: GATT, \nU.S.-Israel, U.S.-Canada, NAFTA, and WTO. Look at what happened with \nrespect to the trade agreements. Pre-NAFTA, using that as a good \nagreement, it has been one of the worst trade agreements we have ever \nnegotiated. Pre-NAFTA, we had a slight surplus with Mexico and a small \ndeficit with Canada. After NAFTA was fully phased in, we have a big \ndeficit with Mexico, and getting bigger, and a big deficit with Canada. \nWe have people who think this is successful. I have no idea where they \nstudied if they think this is a successful trade relationship.\n  Let's take a look at what is happening in some of these areas of \ntrade. Let me talk, as I have previously, about automobiles and Korea. \nWhy do I do this? Only to point out that the appetite for going off to \nnegotiate a new trade agreement ought to be replaced by an appetite to \nsolve some of the problems that currently exist. But nobody wants to \nsolve problems. All they want to do is negotiate a new agreement.\n  Now, we have automobile trade with Korea. Let me use that as an \nexample. In the last year that was just reported, the Koreans shipped \nus 618,000 automobiles. We were able to ship to Korea 2,800. So for \nevery 217 cars coming in from Korea, we were able to send them 1.\n  Try sending a Ford Mustang to Korea. The Koreans will put up so many \nnon-tariff trade barriers that you would be lucky to sell a single one. \nWhat we have is one-way trade. Korea ships Hyundais and Daewoos to this \ncountry by the boatload, and we cannot get American cars into Korea. \nYet our negotiators seem to move along blissfully happy to talk about \nhow we are going to negotiate the next agreement.\n  How about saying to Korea on cars: Look, you either open your market \nto American automobiles or you ship your cars to Kinshasa, Zaire. Our \nmarket is open to you only if your market is open to us. That ought to \nbe our message.\n  We have a number of problems in our trade with Europe. Here is a \ncolorful example. We cannot get American eggs into Europe for the \nretail market. You cannot buy eggs in Europe if they come from the \nUnited States. Do you want to know why? Because we wash eggs in this \ncountry, and you cannot sell washed eggs in Europe. The Europeans put \nup a rule that says that eggs can only be sold at the retail level if \nthey are not washed, because apparently their producers cannot be \ntrusted to wash their eggs properly.\n  This is a picture of washed versus unwashed eggs, in case anybody \nwants to see the difference. Maybe our Trade Ambassador can take a look \nat this absurd trade barrier.\n  How about selling breakfast cereal in Chile? The Chileans restrict \nthe importation of U.S. breakfast cereals that are vitamin-enriched, as \nmany of our cereals are. They contend consumers already receive enough \nvitamins in their daily diet and there is a health risk from the \nconsumption of too many vitamins. So you cannot sell Total in Chile. \nJust absurd.\n  How about this one? Our cattle operations sometimes give growth \nhormones to their cattle. There is no scientific evidence that the \nhormones do any harm, but the Europeans put up a rule that says that \nbeef from cattle that got hormones cannot get into the EU. I have been \nto Europe and have read the press over there. They depict American \ncattle as having two heads, suggesting that these growth hormones \nproduce grotesque animals like the one pictured here. Our negotiators \nactually tried to do something about this, and took the EU to the WTO. \nThe WTO agreed with the United States, and authorized our country to \nretaliate against the WTO.\n  So what form of retaliation did our negotiators settle on? We took \naction against the Europeans by restricting the movement of Roquefort \ncheese, goose liver, and truffles to the United States. Now that will \nscare the dickens out of another country, won't it? We are going to \nslap you around on goose liver issues.\n  I do not understand this at all. Our country seems totally unwilling \nto stand up for our trade interests.\n  Try to sell wheat flour to Europe. We produce a lot of wheat in \nNebraska and North Dakota. Try to sell wheat flour in Europe. There is \na 78-percent duty to sell wheat flour in Europe.\n  Will Rogers said--I have quoted him many times--that the United \nStates of America has never lost a war and never won a conference. He \nsurely must have been talking about our trade negotiators. It doesn't \nmatter whether it is United States-Canada, United States-Mexico, GATT, \nor NAFTA, this country gets the short end of the stick.\n  The reason I am going to oppose fast track is not that I am opposed \nto expanded trade. I believe expanded trade is good for our country and \ngood for the world. But I believe trade ought to be fair trade, and I \nbelieve our country ought to stand up for its economic interests. When \nother countries are engaging in unfair trade, our trade officials have \na responsibility to stand up and use all available trade remedies on \nbehalf of American workers and American businesses, and say that we \nwill not put up with unfair trade practices.\n\n  I must say that Mr. Zoellick, our current Trade Representative, has \nrecently taken some heat for action against imported steel. The \nAdministration also took some heat for its action against unfair \nimports of lumber. In both cases, I thought the actions were \nappropriate. But the Administration has been widely criticized. This \nweekend, George Will had an op-ed that was very critical.\n  But I hope that nobody is getting the impression that U.S. producers \nare being adequately defended from unfair imports. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. Take the example of Canadian wheat. The \nCanadians use a monopoly agency called the Canadian Wheat Board to \nsubsidize their grain and undersell us all over the world. In February, \nthe U.S. Trade Representative ruled that the Canadians had been using \ntheir monopoly power to undermine the international trading system. But \nto date, the USTR has done nothing about it. Our wheat growers had \nasked for tariff rate quotas to be imposed. USTR found the Canadians \nguilty, but has yet to impose tariff rate quotas. Instead, USTR \nproposes to take the matter to the WTO. By the time the WTO issues a \nruling, our great grandchildren will still be dealing with the problem.\n  I expect a number of my colleagues who will join me in saying to \nthose who want to bring fast track to the floor: Fix some of the \nproblems that exist in the current trade agreements before you decide \nyou want new trade agreements. Fix some of the problems--just a few. \nFix the problem of grain with Canada. Fix the problem of wheat flour \nwith Europe. Fix the problem of automobiles from Korea.\n  How about fixing a couple of the problems dealing with Japan? Almost\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nfourteen years after our beef agreement with Japan, there is a 38.5-\npercent tariff on every pound of beef that still goes into Japan. Japan \nhas a $60 billion to $70 billion trade surplus with us, and they are \nstill hanging huge tariffs on every pound of American beef we ship to \nJapan. How about more T-bones in Tokyo?\n  I am describing a few of a litany of problems in international trade \nthat our country refuses to address. Why? Because we have trade \nnegotiators all suited up. They have their Armani shoes and their \nwonderfully cut suits, and they are ready to negotiate. They will lose \nin the first half hour at the table if history is any guidance.\n  I am saying we ought not grant fast-track authority until our \nnegotiators demonstrate they can fix a few trade problems. I did not \nbelieve Bill Clinton should have fast-track authority when he was \nPresident, and I do not believe George Bush should have fast-track \nauthority. Not until the Administration is willing to demonstrate that \nit is willing to solve a few of the trade problems I have described.\n  Fast track is going to be on the slow track in the Senate. There will \nbe many amendments proposed. I, for one, will offer a good number of \namendments dealing with the issues described. I will also offer an \namendment that says that NAFTA tribunals should not operate in secret. \nWe should not be a party to any deal that determines international \ntrade outcomes behind closed doors.

Mr. President, Secretary Powell at this very moment in the \nMiddle East is striving mightily to effect a cease fire and develop \nmore support for our war on terror, especially to the extent we may \nhave to take military action against the country of Iraq.\n  It is in that context that I discuss today another way the \nadministration has prepared to deal specifically with the threat from \nIraq and other countries similarly situated in the Middle East.\n  On December 13, following a period of high-level negotiations, \nPresident Bush notified Russia of his intent to withdraw the United \nStates from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Since then, I have \naddressed the Senate on the military justification for the President's \ndecision and the question of how much a national ballistic missile \ndefense system will cost. Today, I would like to discuss the \nPresident's constitutional authority to unilaterally exercise the right \nof withdrawal without the consent of the Senate or Congress as a whole.\n  The President withdrew the United States from the treaty pursuant to \nArticle XV, which allows either party to withdraw upon 6 months' notice \nif it determines that ``extraordinary events . . . have jeopardized its \nsupreme interests.'' I believe his action is a proper exercise of the \nauthority of the chief executive to terminate a formal treaty to which \nthe Senate had given its consent pursuant to Article II, Section 2, of \nthe Constitution.\n  The question of Presidential authority is illustrated by the \nfollowing assertion in a New York Times editorial by Bruce Ackerman, a \nprofessor of constitutional law at Yale:\n\n       Presidents don't have the power to enter into treaties \n     unilaterally . . . and once a treaty enters into force, the \n     Constitution makes it part of the ``supreme law of the land'' \n     just like a statute. Presidents can't terminate statutes they \n     don't like. They must persuade both houses of Congress to \n     join in a repeal.\n\n  While the Constitution is silent with respect to treaty withdrawal, \nthe preponderance of writings and opinions on this subject strongly \nsuggests that the Framers intended for the authority to be vested in \nthe President. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution declares that \nthe ``executive power shall be vested in the President.'' And Article \nII, Section 2 makes clear that the President ``shall be Commander-in-\nChief,'' that he shall appoint, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, and receive ambassadors, and that he ``shall have power, by and \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties.''\n  The Constitution approaches differently the duties of Congress, \ngiving the legislative branch--in Article I's Vesting Clause--only the \npowers ``herein granted.'' The difference in language indicates that \nCongress' legislative powers are limited to the list enumerated in \nArticle I, Section 8, while the President's powers include inherent \nexecutive authorities that are unenumerated in the Constitution. Thus, \nany ambiguities in the allocation of a power that is executive in \nnature--particularly in foreign affairs--should be resolved in favor of \nthe executive branch. As James Madison once wrote in a letter to a \nfriend, ``the Executive power being in general terms vested in the \nPresident, all power of an Executive nature not particularly taken away \nmust belong to that department . . .''\n  The treaty clause's location in Article II clearly implies that \ntreaty power is an executive one. The Senate's role in making treaties \nis merely a check on the President's otherwise plenary power--hence the \nabsence of any mention of treaty-making power in Article I, Section 8. \nTreaty withdrawal remains an unenumerated power--one that must \nlogically fall within the President's general executive power.\n  A careful reading of the writings of the Framers strongly also \nconfirms that they viewed treaties differently than domestic law, and \nthat, while they desired to put more authority over domestic affairs in \nthe hands of the elected legislative representatives, they believed \nthat the conduct of foreign affairs lay primarily with the President. \nAs Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson observed during the first \nWashington Administration, ``The constitution has divided the powers of \ngovernment into three branches [and] has declared that `the executive \npowers shall be vested in the president,' submitting only special \narticles of it to a negative by the Senate.'' Due to this structure, \nJefferson continued, ``The transaction of business with foreign nations \nis executive altogether; it belongs, then, to the head of that \ndepartment, except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted \nto the Senate. Exceptions are to be construed strictly.''\n\n  In the same vein is the history of Supreme Court rulings on the \nsubject of presidential powers. The Court has concluded that the \nPresident has the leading constitutional role in managing the nation's \nforeign relations. As one commentator, David Scheffer, noted in the \nHarvard International Law Journal, ``Constitutional history confirms \ntime and again that in testing [the limits of presidential plenary \npowers], the courts have deferred to the President's foreign relations \npowers when the constitution fails to enumerate specific powers to \nCongress.''\n  In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Supreme Court observed that \nresponsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs and for protecting \nthe national security are `` `central' Presidential domains.'' \nSimilarly, in the Department of Navy v. Egan, the Supreme Court `` \n`recognized the generally accepted view that foreign policy [is] the \nprovince and responsibility of the Executive.' ''\n  The case most frequently cited as confirming that the President is \nthe supreme authority in the Nation's conduct of foreign affairs is the \nSupreme Court's 1936 decision in the United States v. Curtiss-Wright \nCorp. In that case, the Court reversed the decision of the district \ncourt, and affirmed the constitutionality of President Franklin \nRoosevelt's declaration of an arms embargo against both sides in the \nconflict between Peru and Bolivia over the Chaco region. As stated in \nthe opinion issued by Justice Sutherland, the power to conduct foreign \naffairs is ``the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the \nPresident as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of \ninternational relations--a power which does not require for its \nexercise an act of Congress.''\n  Treaties represent a central tool for the successful conduct of \nforeign policy. Such international agreements typically reflect the \ncircumstances of particular security or economic conditions which may, \nof course, change\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nover time. As such, in the course of protecting national security, \nrecognizing foreign governments, or pursuing diplomatic objectives, a \nPresident may determine that it is necessary to terminate specific \nUnited States' treaty obligations.\n  That is precisely the subject we are facing with respect to the \nPresident's withdrawal from the 1972 ABM treaty.\n  As the D.C. Circuit stated in Goldwater v. Carter, ``The \ndetermination of the conduct of the United States in regard to treaties \nis an instance of what has broadly been called `the foreign affairs \npower' of the President. . . . That status is not confined to the \nservice of the President as a channel of communication . . . but \nembraces an active policy determination as to the conduct of the United \nStates in regard to a treaty in response to numerous problems and \ncircumstances as they arise.''\n  For these reasons, other unenumerated treaty powers have been \nunderstood to rest within the plenary presidential authority. For \nexample, the President alone decides whether to negotiate an \ninternational agreement, and also controls the subject, course, and \nscope of negotiations. Additionally, the President has the sole \ndiscretion whether to sign a treaty and whether to submit a treaty to \nthe Senate for advice and consent. The President may even choose not to \nratify a treaty after the Senate has approved it. Vesting the power to \nterminate a treaty in the President is consistent with the accepted \nview that other such unenumerated powers are the responsibility of the \nPresident.\n  Furthermore, the executive branch has long maintained that it has the \npower to terminate treaties unilaterally. The Justice Department has \nargued that, ``Just as the Senate or Congress cannot bind the United \nStates to a treaty without the President's active participation and \napproval, they cannot continue a treaty commitment that the President \nhas determined is contrary to the security or diplomatic interests of \nthe United States and is terminable under international law.'' The \nState Department, in a 1978 memorandum advising that the President had \nthe authority under the Constitution to terminate the Mutual Defense \nTreaty without Congressional or Senate action, opined that, ``The \nPresident's constitutional power to give notice of termination provided \nfor by the terms of a treaty derives from the President's authority and \nresponsibility as chief executive to conduct the nation's foreign \naffairs and execute the laws.''\n  One of the most well-known instances of treaty termination in recent \nhistory is former President Carter's decision to withdraw the United \nStates from the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 between the U.S. and \nTaiwan in order to normalize relations with the People's Republic of \nChina. That decision resulted in an extensive debate in the Senate and \namong scholars as to the President's constitutional authority to \nwithdraw the United States from a treaty without the approval of the \nSenate or Congress. Several members of Congress, including former \nArizona Senator Barry Goldwater, filed suit against President Carter, \nand the full Senate addressed treaty termination in a series of \nlegislation that was debated by a number of my distinguished colleagues \nwho remain in this body today.\n  Senator Kennedy wrote a persuasive article for Policy Review in 1979 \nstrongly supporting the notion that treaty termination is an executive \npower not requiring legislative consent. In that article, he argued:\n\n       Article 10 of the treaty in question [the Mutual Defense \n     Treaty] provided for its termination. In giving notice of an \n     intent to terminate the treaty pursuant to that provision, \n     the President was not violating the treaty but acting \n     according to its terms--terms that were approved by the \n     Senate when it consented to the treaty.\n       As Charles C. Hyde, former Legal Advisor to the Department \n     of State, put it in his leading treatise: ``The President is \n     not believed . . . to lack authority to denounce, in \n     pursuance of its terms, a treaty to which the United States \n     is a party, without legislative approval. In taking such \n     action, he is merely exercising in behalf of the nation a \n     privilege already conferred upon it by the agreement'' . . .\n       At the time that each treaty is made and submitted [for the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, Senators] should seek to \n     condition Senate approval upon acceptance of the Senate's \n     participation in its termination. The Senate might have done \n     so when it consented to the 1954 defense treaty with the \n     Republic of China, but it did not. Any attempt, at this \n     point, to invalidate the President's notice of intention to \n     terminate that treaty is not only unwise . . . but also \n     without legal foundation.\n\n  As with the 1954 treaty, the ABM Treaty contains a withdrawal \nclause--article XV(2)--for extraordinary events. That clause states:\n\n       Each party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, \n     have the right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides \n     that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of \n     this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests. It shall \n     give notice of its decision to the other Party six months \n     prior to withdrawal from the Treaty.\n\n  That, of course, is precisely what President Bush did.\n  The President was fully justified in using that withdrawal clause \nunilaterally. Just as the Senate did not condition its approval of the \nMutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan upon its participation in termination \nof that treaty, the Senate also did not place such a condition upon its \napproval of the ABM Treaty.\n  Senator Goldwater's suit over the President's termination of the \nMutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan led to conflicting decisions by the \ntrial and appellate courts and an eventual non-decision by the Supreme \nCourt. The D.C. Circuit had reversed the trial court's decision, and \nupheld President Carter's authority to terminate the Mutual Defense \nTreaty, rejecting the arguments that (1) the advice and consent role of \nthe Senate in making treaties implies a similar role in termination, \nand (2) that, because a treaty is part of the law of the land, a \nminimum of a statute is required to terminate it.\n  The Circuit Court pointed out that the President is responsible for \ndetermining whether a treaty has been breached by another party, \nwhether a treaty is no longer viable because of changed circumstances, \nand even whether to ratify a treaty after the Senate has given its \nadvice and consent. The court said that, ``In contrast to the lawmaking \npower, the constitutional initiative in the treaty-making field is in \nthe President, not Congress.'' Moreover, the court stated that, to \nrequire Senate or Congressional consent to terminate a treaty would \nlock the United States into ``all of its international obligations, \neven if the President and two-thirds of the Senate minus one firmly \nbelieved that the proper course for the United States was to terminate \na treaty.'' It would, therefore, deny the President the authority and \nflexibility ``necessary to conduct our foreign policy in a rational and \neffective manner.''\n  Finally, the court determined that ``of central significance'' was \nthat the Mutual Defense Treaty--as my colleague Senator Kennedy had \nalso pointed out in his article--contains a termination clause that \n``is without conditions,'' and spells out no role for either the Senate \nor Congress. As a consequence, the court concluded, the power to act \nunder that clause ``devolves upon the President.'' The facts are the \nsame with the 1972 ABM Treaty, and, therefore, the law must also be \nconsistent.\n  I should note that President Carter did not stand alone in exercising \nhis power to unilaterally terminate a treaty. According to David Gray \nAdler's The Constitution and the Termination of Treaties, unilateral \nexecutive termination has been practiced since the Lincoln \nAdministration, and seems to be the most commonly used method of \nterminating treaties. And as the D.C. Circuit stated in Goldwater v. \nCarter,\n\n       It is not without significance that out of all of the \n     historical precedents brought to our attention, in no \n     situation has a treaty been continued over the opposition of \n     the President.\n\n  It is interesting to me members of the Senate have also raised the \nissue of the President's authority to withdraw from a particular treaty \nwithout legislative consent in the context of debating the resolution \nof ratification of a treaty. During the Senate's consideration of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, proponents of the CTBT argued that \nSafeguard F of that treaty meant that the President alone could \nexercise the right of withdrawal from the treaty. Safeguard F states:\n\n       If the President of the United States is informed by the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy--advised by \n     the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear \n     weapons laboratories and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic \n     Command--\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\n     that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability \n     of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider \n     to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be \n     certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, \n     would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the \n     standard ``supreme national interests'' clause in order to \n     conduct whatever testing might be required.\n\n  As Senator Biden stated on the Senate floor on October 12, 1999:\n\n       They have to assume, then, that the President, knowing that \n     this stockpile is no longer reliable, would look at the U.S. \n     Congress and say: I, President whomever, next President, \n     certify that we can rely on our stockpile. They either have \n     to assume that or they have to assume their concern about our \n     stockpile is not a problem because the moment the President \n     is told that, he has to call us and tell us and withdraw from \n     the treaty . . .\n\n  Senator Boxer likewise argued that withdrawal from the treaty would \nbe exclusively the responsibility of the President during her remarks \non the Senate floor on October 13, 1999, stating,\n\n       If our stockpile is not safe and reliable, the President \n     will withdraw from the treaty. There doesn't have to be a \n     Senate vote. It's not going to get bogged down in the rules \n     of the Senate. If there is a supreme national interest in \n     withdrawing from the treaty, we will withdraw.\n\n  Indeed, even some Senators openly opposed to the President's decision \nto withdraw the United States from the ABM Treaty have recognized his \nconstitutional authority to make the decision without the consent of \nthe Senate or Congress. In December 2001, Inside Missile Defense quoted \nSenator Daschle on the subject:\n\n       It's my understanding that the President has the unilateral \n     authority to make this decision. But we are researching just \n     what specific legal options the Congress has, and we'll have \n     to say more about that later . . . at this point, we're very \n     limited in what options we have legislatively.\n\n  Similarly, according to a July 2001 article in the New York Times, \nSenator Levin stated,\n\n       The president alone has the right to withdraw from a \n     treaty, but Congress has the heavy responsibility of \n     determining whether or not to appropriate the funds for \n     activities that conflict with a treaty.\n\n  My own view is that while it would be anomalous for Congress to \nwithhold funding for a national missile defense system, Senator Levin \nis correct on both counts: withdrawal is the President's decision and \nany funding for anything must be through Congressional appropriation.\n  In conclusion, I believe history will judge President Bush's notice \nof withdrawal from the 1972 ABM Treaty as equal in importance to his \nhistoric decision to commit the United States to the war on terrorism. \nWith the withdrawal decision, he has paved the way for the United \nStates to work aggressively toward deployment of defenses to protect \nthe American people against the growing threat of a ballistic missile \nattack.\n  In announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the \ntreaty, President Bush acted in accordance with changed international \ncircumstances and our national interests--reestablishing the important \ndoctrine of ``peace through strength'' as the basis for U.S. security \npolicy. And he acted within the authority granted by the Constitution \nto the Chief Executive.\n  I commend the President for arriving at a very difficult decision. As \nwe all know, the role of Congress has not ended with our withdrawal \nfrom the treaty--the annual budget process can be used to either \nundermine or support the President's decision, a matter I will address \nin a future presentation. But for now, an essential first step in \nmoving forward to protect the United States against a serious threat \nhas finally been taken, and the President should be commended for his \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2642-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2642-S2643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ENHANCED BORDER SECURITY AND VISA ENTRY REFORM\n\n  Mr. KYL. In the remaining time I have I would like to address a \nmatter that will be before the Senate as the pending business as soon \nas we conclude morning business; that is, the Enhanced Border Security \nand Visa Entry Reform Act, H.R. 3525. The sponsors of this legislation \nall spoke to the reasons for this legislation on Friday when the matter \nwas brought to the floor at 11:30 by unanimous consent request of the \nmajority leader. I thank Majority Leader Daschle for bringing this \nmatter to the Senate floor so we can dispose of it.\n  A little bit of history is in order. The sponsors of the \nlegislation--Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and myself--had \nworked hard to develop this legislation in the aftermath of September \n11 because we held hearings in two different subcommittees of the \nJudiciary Committee that revealed loopholes in our immigration laws, \nloopholes through which some of the terrorists who came here and \ncarried out their horrible attack on September 11 were able to gain \nentry into the United States. They came on legal visas, visas that in \nsome cases should never have been granted. They were here under student \nvisas, even though they no longer attended the classes they had signed \nup to attend. In the case of some of them, they were out of status by \nthe time of September 11.\n  We set about to identify loopholes in our immigration and visa laws \nthat we could close to make it much more difficult for terrorists to \ngain entry into the United States. That legislation was developed \nbefore the end of last year's congressional session and was actually \nadopted by the House of Representatives just before we adjourned for \nthe year. We attempted to have it adopted by the Senate, but Senator \nByrd objected on the grounds that it required Senate debate, and he \ndidn't want to simply adopt it as a matter of unanimous consent.\n  At the beginning of this year, we sought to find ways to bring the \nbill to the Senate floor for that debate and amendment, if need be, and \nhad not been successful until the end of last week when, as I said, the \nmajority leader successfully propounded a unanimous consent request \nthat the Senate take the bill up. There is no limitation on time nor on \namendments, but there has been such a strong outpouring of support for \nthe bill--indeed, I think there are some 61 cosponsors, and that \nprobably reflects the fact we have not gotten around to all the Members \nof the Senate, that it is clear the bill can pass very quickly as soon \nas we are ready to call for the final vote. But out of deference to \nthose who believed it did need debate, that opportunity has been made \navailable.\n\n  The only people I am aware of who spoke on the legislation on Friday \nwere the four cosponsors: Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and \nmyself. We all laid out the case, to one degree or another, for the \nlegislation and urged our colleagues who may have something to say \nabout it to come to the floor and express themselves. Indeed, if there \nwere amendments, we would be happy to entertain those amendments.\n  We are obviously hopeful there will not be, so we can simply adopt \nthe legislation approved by the House and we can send it to the \nPresident for his signature. Why is this our goal? Each week that goes \nby without this legislation being in place represents an opportunity \nfor a terrorist to gain entry into the United States. We have to close \nthe loopholes. Most of the actions the legislation calls for are going \nto take time to implement, so it is not as if we can slam the door shut \nthe minute the President signs the bill. We have to put into place \nprocedures, for example, whereby the FBI, CIA, international \norganizations, and others can all make available, to the people who \ngrant visas, information that bears upon the qualifications of the \npeople seeking entry to the United States, people who apply for the \nvisas--information that might suggest, for example, that there is a \nconnection with a terrorist group and therefore the visa ought to be \ndenied.\n  That is going to take time to implement, as will other provisions of \nthe legislation. So time is wasting. We know there is no--I was going \nto state it in the negative. I was going to say there is no evidence \nthe terrorists have given up the ghost here. I think there is a lot of \nevidence that they will try to strike us when they believe they can, \nand when they see us as having a point of vulnerability. That is why we \nhave to begin to close these windows of vulnerability as soon as \npossible.\n  The head of the INS has indicated he thinks some of the timeframes \nfor achievement of results under this legislation may even be pretty \ndifficult for INS to meet, which is to say it is all the more important \nto begin now to close these loopholes because it is going to take a \nwhile to get everything\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\nin place, to effectuate all of the pieces of this legislation.\n  That goes back to my point that we have to get this signed as soon as \npossible. If there are amendments to the legislation here on the Senate \nfloor, then it will have to go to a conference committee. That is all \nright, assuming we can get the conference to act quickly and bring the \nbill back to both the House and the Senate. But it is important we do \nthat so the President can sign the legislation.\n  I appeal to my colleagues who have something to say about this, \nespecially those who believed we should not consider it without debate \non the floor, to come to the Chamber and explain their views on it, and \nto offer any amendments if they have amendments, so we can deal with \nthose amendments and get on with our business.\n  I know the majority leader was reluctant to do this before without an \nagreement to have a specific time limit on debate because he wanted to \ncomplete work on the energy bill by the end of this week--as do, I \nthink, almost all of us. I am sure all of us would like to be done with \nthe energy bill. But we are not going to be able to finish that if we \ncannot quickly finish the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \nReform Act.\n  Again, I call upon my colleagues to come over. Let's finish the job \nand get this done.\n\n  I would like to say one other thing because there is a little element \nof confusion about something in section 245(i). Section 245(i) is a \nprovision of the immigration law that allows for people who want to \ngain permanent status in the United States under two specific \nprovisions to do so. Its provisions had terminated with respect to a \nlarge group of people, maybe 200,000 or 300,000 people, who wanted to \ngain permanent residence but whose legal status in the United States \nterminated and therefore they would have had to go back to their \ncountry of origin and apply for that status.\n  What some people wanted to do, including the administration, was to \nextend the period of time that they could make their application and \ncomplete that process so they could be allowed to stay in the United \nStates permanently. Some of this involves reunification of families, \nfor example.\n  In an effort to support the administration and to accommodate the \ninterests of those who wanted to do that, there was an agreement \nbetween Senator Kennedy and myself--and others--about exactly how that \nshould be done. We both committed ourselves to trying to achieve the \nratification of the temporary extension of section 245(i). The House of \nRepresentatives actually passed a second version of the Enhanced Border \nSecurity and Visa Entry Reform Act, a version which included section \n245(i) with it. They did that earlier this year. That bill is pending \nat the desk.\n  It has not been called up for consideration, but I want my colleagues \nto know that is where this debate about section 245(i) comes into \neffect. There are some who believe section 245(i) represents a grant of \namnesty to people. Perhaps one could argue that is, to a limited \nextent, true.\n  They are concerned that it represents the first step in a broader \ngrant of amnesty. I hope that is not the case. But they have some \nconcerns they have expressed about it. I hope we do not confuse the \nissue of 245(i) with H.R. 3525, the bill pending at the desk that we \nwill be taking up again in just a few minutes--we can quickly pass H.R. \n3525, get it to the President for signature, and then deal with section \n245(i)--because I believe we need to deal with it, but I believe it \nwill be easier to deal with outside the context of H.R. 3525.\n  Here is the reason I say that. I urge my colleagues who may be \nthinking about combining the two just to think about this for a moment. \nI believe we have an excellent chance of getting both of these things \npassed. But I think we may have an excellent chance of getting neither \nof them passed if they are combined. The reason is, I am concerned the \nMembers of the House of Representatives may not be as inclined to vote \nfor section 245(i) again as they were before. As a result, if we put \nthis into conference and the question were put to the Members of the \nHouse, I am not certain they would vote for it. Nor am I sure that \nthose who are opposed to section 245(i) in this body would permit it to \ncome to a vote if it had to be brought back to this body as part of the \nBorder Security and Visa Entry Reform Act.\n  So I urge my colleagues who support this to bear with us and \nunderstand we can have both of these things if we treat them \nseparately. Those who oppose 245(i) will have a full opportunity to \ndebate it and amend it if necessary, and to have a vote on it. But I \nhope that in an effort to kill section 245(i), they will not also be \nwilling to kill H.R. 3525. I just tell my colleagues, if you try to \ncombine 245(i) with H.R. 3525, you may be signing the death warrant for \nboth, and I do not think that is the intent, of some people, anyway, \nwho have talked about the possibility of filing an amendment relating \nto section 245(i) on H.R. 3525.\n  So I call on my colleagues to come to the floor and debate this \nlegislation. If they have amendments, let's offer the amendments and \ntry to dispose of them.\n  I see Senator Kennedy is here, with whom I worked closely on this \nlegislation. Frankly, we would not be where we are without all the work \nhe has put into it. I am sure he will join me in asking those who have \nanything at all to say about it to come to the floor and say it so we \ncan get on with it, take our vote, and then get back on the energy bill \nwhich obviously we want to conclude by the end of this week.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I spoke at some length on Friday, and I \nwill only take a few moments now. If there are Members who desire to \nseek recognition to offer an amendment, I will yield the floor.\n  I just want to, as we come back to the discussion at the start of \nthis week, once again underline the importance of the legislation; but, \nsecondly, I want to mention the various groups that are in strong \nsupport of it.\n  Again, I am enormously grateful to my friend and colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, who spends a great deal of time on immigration issues, as do \nSenators Kyl and Brownback. I commend all of them for their wonderful \nwork in helping develop this legislation. They all have spoken very \neffectively on this legislation and have made a very strong case for \nit.\n  I will mention again the various groups that are in strong support of \nthe legislation. It is always a fair indication of the breadth of \nsupport.\n  First of all, we have the principal student organizations that deal \nwith international education. This is extraordinarily important because \none of the most complicated and difficult issues is trying to know, \nwhen educational visas are given, whether the student comes to the \nUnited States; and when they come and gain entrance, whether they \nactually attend the college, whether they attend the classes,\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\nwhether they graduate. They can have those visas for a long period of \ntime, and it is very easy to lose complete track of them.\n  We have worked out a very effective and detailed way of making sure \nthe Immigration Service is going to know the whereabouts of those \nstudents.\n  The Alliance for International Education and Culture Exchange says:\n\n       We have worked with your staffs as the legislation \n     developed and had opportunities for input to help ensure the \n     bill strikes the right balance between our strong national \n     interests and increased security and continued openness and \n     exchange of visitors, students and scholars from around the \n     world. We believe this legislation accomplishes this goal.\n\n  The National Association for International Educators has a similar \nendorsement:\n\n       We have worked closely with your offices. While at the same \n     time maintaining openness to international students and \n     scholars, we also understand the national security issues.\n\n  That is enormously important. We are grateful for their strong \nsupport. The Chamber of Commerce has indicated its strong support for \nthe legislation. The important reliance on biometrics, we had good \nhearings on how we can benefit from the various breakthroughs taking \nplace in that area of science and research. We have worked very closely \nwith the biometric industry, and the International Biometric Industry \nAssociation is strongly in support of the legislation.\n  Another group of supporters includes the broad group of organizations \nthat understand immigration law. The American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation, an organization which spends a great deal of time on \nimmigration and immigration law, has been a strong supporter, as well \nas the various church groups, church world services, and civil rights \ngroups. Supporters include the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nthe Council of La Raza, and the National Immigration Forum. So the \nbasic overall groups we rely on that work on the settlement of \nrefugees, work with immigrants and this settlement, work with various \nfamilies, all reviewed these various provisions. They understand what \nwe are attempting to do, and that is to maintain our historic role in \nterms of the reunification of families.\n  We have important national security issues as well in trying to work \nout that balance. These groups have been very supportive of what we \nhave done, which is, again, reassuring.\n  Finally, the most important compelling letter from the Families of \nSeptember 11. We had wonderful testimony from MaryEllen Salamone, who \nis director of the Families of September 11, in support of this \nlegislation, very moving testimony. I commend those who have lost loved \nones who are channeling their grief into useful and productive and \nconstructive action, in this case, to try to make our country more \nsecure in terms of the dangers of terrorists. Her very strong testimony \nand the support of the Families of September 11th is enormously \nimportant.\n  I am sure there are ways that we could have done this more \neffectively. We have the National Border Patrol Council that is \nstrongly supportive of the program as well.\n  We have tried to balance the various interests we have talked about: \nOne, making sure we are going to collect and have the appropriate \nsharing of information about foreign terrorists--and we set up a very \nimportant and up-to-date technology to be able to get to do that--\ngetting the intelligence about potential terrorists into the hands of \nthe Nation's gatekeepers in real time; it creates the layers of \nsecurity with multiple opportunities to stop someone intent on doing us \nharm; it eliminates opportunities for terrorists to hide \nbehind fraudulent travel documents, which is so important; and it \ndetermines how our Government might best work with the Governments of \nCanada and Mexico to deter terrorists arriving in North America in the \nfirst place and to manage our land borders in ways that deter the \ndangerous passage of people and cargo while facilitating the lawful and \norderly passage of commerce and people who benefit our country.\n\n  This is what we have attempted to do. As I say, we welcome the \nopportunity to consider the amendments or to go into greater discussion \nof the particular provisions as the afternoon goes on. We invite our \ncolleagues who have amendments to offer them. We were ready on Friday \nlast to consider them. We spent some time in the afternoon in the \npresentation. Those Members who had the opportunity to read through the \nrecord will understand both the substance of this legislation and the \nvery broad and wide support. We are hopeful we can make progress \nthrough the course of the afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from West Virginia \nin the Chamber. I know he would like to speak. Any time he stands up, I \nwill end my remarks and allow the Chair to recognize him.\n  I did want to add to the comments Senator Kennedy has made. I am very \npleased that Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Kyl, and I have joined in \nauthorizing this legislation. I am very proud that more than 60 of our \ncolleagues have joined in cosponsoring it. I had a chance on Friday, \nalong with the other Senators, to describe the legislation. I would \nlike to make a few comments now.\n  I sincerely believe, in the wake of September 11, this is the most \nimportant bill this Senate can pass in terms of being able to begin to \nfix what is a very broken system and also to begin to change our \npriorities.\n  Our immigration policies have been in the past largely driven by our \nhumanitarian and economic interests. That has changed today because we \nnow realize that security of our borders is extraordinarily important \nand that our visa system, as a product of many errors and many \ninstances in which it doesn't produce the dividends that it was \nexpected to produce for a lot of reasons, needs changing.\n  Before September 11, just over 300 U.S. Border Patrol agents were \nassigned to the job of detecting and intercepting illegal border \ncrossers along our vast 4,000-mile United States-Canadian border. Nine \nhundred State Department consular officers were assigned to conduct \nbackground checks and issue visas to 6 million foreign nationals \nseeking to enter the United States in a whole host of capacities--as \nstudents, tourists, temporary workers, and as temporary visitors.\n  The State Department's policy was that consular officers did not have \nto perform extensive background checks for students coming from such \nterrorist-supporting states as Syria or Sudan. Only an intermediate \nbackground check was required for Iranian students. More extensive \nchecks were required for students from Iraq and Libya.\n\n  Frontline agencies, such as the INS, were chronically understaffed, \nused obsolete data management systems, and had substantial management \nproblems. We all knew that. Today, the INS does not have a reliable \ntracking system to determine how many of our visitors legitimately \nenter the United States and how many leave the country after their \nvisas expire.\n  It almost seems effortless, the way the terrorists got into this \ncountry. They didn't have to slip into the country as stowaways on sea \nvessels or sneak through the borders evading Federal authorities. Most, \nif not all, appeared to have come in with temporary visas, which are \nroutinely granted to tourists, students, and other short-term visitors \nto the United States.\n  Clearly, our guard was down. September 11 clearly pointed out other \nshortcomings of the immigration and visa system. Just the sheer volume \nof travelers to our country each year illustrates the need for an \nefficiently run and technologically advanced immigration system. Most \npeople don't really realize how many people come into our country, how \nlittle we know about them, and whether they leave when they are \nrequired to leave.\n  Each year, we have over 300 million border crossings of individuals \nfrom other countries. For the most part, these individuals are \nlegitimate visitors to our country. We currently have no way of \ntracking all of them. We had 30.4 million nonimmigrants entering\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\nthe United States during one year, 1999. That is the most recent year \nfor which INS has statistics. Now, 23 million of them entered as \ntourists on the visa waiver program--23 million from 28 different \ncountries. No visas, little scrutiny, no knowledge where they go in the \nUnited States or whether they leave once their visas expire.\n  Another startling fact is that the INS estimates that over 100,000 \nblank passports have been stolen from government offices in \nparticipating countries in the visa waiver program in recent years. \nNow, why is that significant? Right now, countries that participate are \nnot required to report information on missing passports. That will \nchange under this bill. The number of passports reported stolen or lost \nby visa waiver countries is not always entered into the lookout \ndatabase or entered in a timely manner. That, too, will change when \nthis legislation is enacted.\n  Abuse of the visa waiver program poses threats to U.S. security and \nincreases illegal immigration. These visas are often sold on the black \nmarket for as much as $7,500 per visa. Passports from visa waiver \ncountries are often the document of choice for terrorists.\n  Consider this: Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian convicted of plotting to \nblow up the Los Angeles International Airport in 1999, trafficked in a \nnumber of these false passports, at least one of which was linked to a \ntheft from a townhall in Belgium, a visa waiver country. In addition, \ntwo members of an al-Qaida cell who assassinated the Northern Alliance \nleader Ahmed Shah Massoud just before September 11 traveled from \nBrussels to London to Karachi on stolen Belgian passports. Mr. Robert \nReid--the shoe bomber--had a visa from the United Kingdom, another visa \nwaiver country. These are some of the problems our bill seeks to stop \nin the visa waiver program.\n  Each year, more than a half million foreign nationals enter with \nstudent visas. Most recently, 660,000 foreign students entered in the \nfall of 2001. That is just last fall. Within the last 10 years, 16,000 \nhave come from such terrorist-supporting States as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, \nLibya, and Syria.\n\n  The foreign student visa system is one of the most underregulated \nsystems we have today. We have seen bribes, bureaucracy, and many \nproblems with this system that leave it wide open to abuse by \nterrorists and other criminals. For example, in the early and mid \n1990s, in my own State of California, in the San Diego area, 5 \nofficials at 4 California colleges were convicted of taking bribes, \nproviding counterfeit education documents, and fraudulently applying \nfor more than 100 foreign student visas. These are university officials \nin that area who practiced fraud and said students were there when they \nwere not, and they falsified grades. They were convicted for doing so.\n  However, it is unclear what steps the Immigration and Naturalization \nService took to find and deport the foreign nationals involved in that \nscheme. It has been all too clear to those of us on the committee--\nSenators Kennedy and Brownback on Immigration, and Senator Kyl and I on \nthe Technology and Terrorist Subcommittee--that without an adequate \ntracking system, our country becomes a sieve, which is what it is \ntoday, creating ample opportunities for terrorists to enter and \nestablish their operations without detection.\n  Consider these facts:\n  On May 28, 2001--last May--11 months ago, a criminal warrant was \nissued for Mohamed Atta's arrest in Broward County, FL, after he failed \nto appear in court for a traffic violation. On July 5, Atta was pulled \nover for speeding in Palm Beach, FL. At that time, the officer \nconducted a criminal search on Atta and found no outstanding warrants. \nAfter a trip to Spain, in which he allegedly met with coconspirators, \nAtta entered the United States for the final time--that was on July \n19--despite past illegal incidents and the fact that his name was on a \nterrorist watch list. Instead, Atta was allowed into the United States \nas a nonimmigrant visitor after informing an INS officer that he had \napplied for a student visa.\n  One of the hijackers entered on a student visa and, though he never \nshowed up for classes, was never reported because the INS stopped \ntaking such reports in 1988. In other words, the INS doesn't even take \nreports if you don't show up for class when you come in on a foreign \nstudent visa.\n  In December 1999, Ahmed Ressam, otherwise known as the ``millennium \nbomber,'' crossed the northern border into the United States with the \nintent to bomb Los Angeles International Airport. He presented a \nlegitimate Canadian passport under the name Benny Norris, and a \ncomputer check of Norris showed no reason to detain him.\n  However, had they checked the name Ahmed Ressam, they would have \nfound that Ressam had been arrested four times in Canada, had a pending \nwarrant for deportation, and was being investigated by the French and \nCanadian Governments for being a terrorist. It was only because a U.S. \nCustoms agent in Port Angeles, WA, voiced suspicions about his \ndemeanor, causing Ressam to flee on foot, that Ressam was then \narrested.\n  This man had an extensive criminal record and terrorist ties. Yet \nthere was no data system to supply the Border Patrol with such crucial \ninformation.\n  Clearly, existing technologies that employed biometric identifiers \ncould have been used to uncover Ressam's criminal background even \nthough he had used a false name. We do this in our bill.\n\n  We must make it more difficult for foreign visitors to enter our \ncountry using false identification and take sufficient steps to combat \nand prevent identification and visa fraud.\n  The world might well be in an electronic age, but agencies such as \nthe INS are still struggling with the paper-bound, bureaucratic system. \nEven in instances where technological leaps have been made, like the \nissuance of more than 4.5 million smart border crossing cards with \nbiometric data, the technology is still not being used. In other words, \nwe appropriated the money, 4.5 million of these technologically \nsuperior cards were issued, but INS never put in the laser reading \nsystems.\n  According to the Department of Justice inspector general, INS has \napproximately 100 different automated information systems for each \nfunction of the agency. Few of these systems talk to each other. This \nis a stark reminder of how much work needs to be done to fix our broken \nimmigration system.\n  By now, we are all aware of the various proposals that have emerged \nto restructure or dismantle the INS. While restructuring the INS is \ncertainly an idea worth examining, the most immediate need today is for \nCongress to enact this legislation because restructuring it is not \ngoing to cure any of the problems we address in this legislation. \nRestructuring it does not provide additional inspectors, does not \nprovide additional border patrol, does not provide for an interoperable \ndatabase system, does not provide for visa waiver reform, does not \nprovide for student visa oversight monitoring and tracking.\n  Our bill would do just these things. It attempts to transform \nagencies, such as the INS, from a paper-driven bureaucracy to one that \nbetter manages its mission by upgraded information management and \nsharing systems. It would enable the INS and consular offices to access \nvital intelligence information in real time before they issue visas and \npermit entry to the United States.\n  The INS has often argued that it did not have sufficient intelligence \nto prevent the terrorists from entering the United States. However, \nthis failure of intelligence information does not explain why the INS \nwould admit at least three terrorists who clearly were inadmissible at \nthe time they were permitted to enter the country.\n  Last year, in the subcommittee that I chair and on which Senator Kyl \nis the ranking member, we heard the testimony of Assistant Secretary of \nState for Consular Affairs, Mary Ryan. She testified that the consular \nstaff felt terrible because they had granted visas to some of the 19 \nterrorists. At least three of the hijackers, including Mohamed Atta, \nthe alleged ringleader, had stayed in the United States longer than \nauthorized on their previous visits, making their visas invalid. \nBecause the consular officers had no information on these individuals, \nthey had no reason at the time to deny the visas.\n  If the INS had a system in place to identify visa overstayers, this \nmight have enabled both the State Department to further investigate the \nbackgrounds of the terrorists and the INS\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\ninspectors to enforce the law by stopping these terrorists before they \nentered the country.\n  The INS should have had the information at their disposal. They \neither did not collect the information or they did not have the means \nfor the INS inspectors on the front lines to access it.\n  In the wake of September 11, we know the chances of another terrorist \nattack are great, and we know it is unconscionable for our systems to \nallow entry of another terrorist into the United States. Unless we move \non this bill, we cannot possibly remedy the faults in our system.\n  The legislation would require the Attorney General and the Secretary \nof State to issue machine readable, tamper resistant visas that use \nstandardized biometric identifiers. This in itself is a big \nimprovement. I myself have visited streets where in a half hour, one \ncan buy a green card that certainly no layperson can tell the \ndifference between a forged green card produced on this street in Los \nAngeles and a real green card.\n  Our bill allows INS inspectors at ports of entry to determine whether \na visa properly identifies a visa holder and, thus, combats identity \nfraud.\n  Second, it will make visas harder to counterfeit.\n  Third, in conjunction with the installation of scanners at all ports \nof entries to read the visas, the INS can track the arrival and \ndeparture of aliens and more reliably identify aliens who overstay \ntheir visas.\n  The bill also provides that aliens from countries that sponsor \ninternational terrorism cannot receive nonimmigrant visas unless the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of State determine that they do not \npose a threat to the safety of Americans or the national security of \nour country.\n  American embassies and consulates abroad will be required to \nestablish terrorist lookout committees that meet monthly to ensure that \nthe names of known terrorists are routinely and consistently brought to \nthe attention of consular officials, our Nation's first line of \ndefense.\n  The bill contains a number of other related provisions as well, but \nthe gist of the legislation is this: Where we can provide law \nenforcement, more information about potentially dangerous foreign \nnationals, we do so. Where we can reform our border crossing system to \nweed out or deter terrorists and others who would do us harm, we do so. \nAnd where we can update technology to meet the demands of the modern \nwar against terror, we do that as well.\n  As we prepare to modify our immigration system, we must be sure to \nenact changes that are realistic and feasible. We must also provide the \nnecessary tools to implement them.\n  The legislation Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Kyl, and I have crafted \nis an important and strong first step, but this is only the beginning \nof a long, difficult process.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out, this legislation \nis only as good as the appropriations that follow forthwith. The annual \ncost is about $1.1 billion. The 3-year cost is about $3.5 billion. This \nleaves for this year about $753 million that we will have to come up \nwith to meet the cost of the first year. My understanding is that this \nmoney is available in unallocated dollars, but that, of course, has to \nbe checked out, or we should take it from another source.\n  I guess the biggest assurance I can give, as a lowly appropriator, to \nthe distinguished powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is \nI will do my level best to lobby my colleagues to produce the money \nand, with whatever influence I probably do not have with the \nadministration, try to influence the administration, as well, because I \ntruly believe if we are to protect our people, this bill is a \nprerequisite. Unless we tighten up our loopholes and provide the \nfunding for the technology we need, we are going to be nowhere. That is \nnot to say that a terrorist still cannot come in, but it is to say we \ncan make it very much more difficult for them.\n  So I conclude by saying that for some time many of us have been \ncalling for reforms of our visa and border security system. We should \nhave acted in 1993. We did not, and that left us vulnerable to the \nevents of September 11. We are now in a position where we are reacting \nto this latest tragedy, and I think it is really important we act now \nto get this legislation on the books. Then it is up to each and every \none of us to do everything we possibly can to see that it is funded \npromptly and, more importantly, for the Immigration Subcommittee to \nreally exercise oversight over the INS and oversight over the Consular \nAffairs Division of the State Department to see that the necessary \nreforms do get put in place with respect to the visa system.\n  There is not much else I can say, but I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record, without going through it again because I went \nthrough it on Friday, a summary of the bill and also some critical \nstatistics on the number of people coming into our country, and \nparticularly the specific status under which they come and the \nloopholes that exist.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001--Facts and \n                               Statistics\n\n\n                   foreign-born in the united states\n\n       An estimated 30 million foreign-born residents lived in the \n     U.S. in 2000.\n       Between 8 and 9 million are residents without legal status \n     (i.e., either they entered illegally or overstayed a \n     temporary visa)--40 percent of that total were visa \n     overstays.\n       30.4 million nonimmigrants entered the U.S. during 1999 \n     (the most recent year for which the INS has statistics)--23 \n     million of them entered as tourists on the Visa Waiver \n     Program (according to State Department statistics); 6 million \n     of them were issued nonimmigrant visas as students, tourists, \n     temporary workers and other temporary visitors (only 900 \n     State Department consular officers, mostly junior staff, are \n     assigned to issue these visas and conduct background checks); \n     and 660,000 were foreign students who had entered in Fall \n     2001.\n\n                            Foreign students\n\n       660,000 foreign nationals held student visas in Fall 2001--\n     more than 10,000 enrolled in flight training, trade schools \n     and other non-academic programs; and more than 16,000 came \n     from terrorist supporting countries.\n       Some 74,000 U.S. schools are allowed to admit foreign \n     students, but checks of the schools on the current INS list \n     found that some had closed; others had never existed.\n       Exactly six months after the 9/11 attacks, Huffman Aviation \n     in Venice, Fla. received student visa approval forms for \n     Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi. The men were aboard \n     separate hijacked planes that struck the World Trade Center \n     towers, killing thousands.\n\n\n                          visa waiver program\n\n       23 million foreign visitors enter the U.S. each year under \n     the Visa Waiver Program.\n       There are now 28 countries that are included in the \n     program.\n       Earlier this year, Argentina was dropped from the program \n     because of the country's political and economic instability.\n\n                       Current Inspections System\n\n       Because visitors traveling to the U.S. under the Visa \n     Waiver Program do not need a visa to enter the U.S., INS \n     inspectors at U.S. ports of entry are the principle means of \n     preventing unlawful entry of individuals from one of the 28 \n     countries.\n       The primary tool available to INS inspectors during the \n     inspections process is the Interagency Border Inspection \n     System, known as IBIS, which allows INS inspectors to search \n     a variety of databases containing records and lookouts of \n     individuals of particular concern to the U.S.\n       A 1999 Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report found, \n     however, that INS inspectors at U.S. ports of entry were not \n     consistently checking passport numbers in IBIS.\n       INS officers also failed to enter lost or stolen passports \n     from visa waiver countries into IBIS in a timely, accurate or \n     consistent manner.\n       One senior INS official from Miami International Airport \n     told the OIG that he was not even aware of any INS policy \n     that required the entry of stolen passport numbers.\n\n                         Anti-fraud enforcement\n\n       In a report released in February 2002, the U.S. General \n     Accounting Office said that anti-fraud efforts at the INS are \n     ``fragmented and unfocused'' and that enforcement of \n     immigration laws remains a low priority.\n       The report found that the agency had only 40 jobs for \n     detecting fraud in 4 million applications for immigrant \n     benefits in the year 2000.\n\n\n                           national security\n\n       In FY 1999, the Department of State identified 291 \n     potential nonimmigrants as inadmissible for security or \n     terrorist concerns.\n       Of that number, 101 aliens seeking nonimmigrant visas were \n     specifically identified for terrorists activities, but 35 of \n     them were able to overcome the ineligibility.\n       47 foreign-born individuals--including the 19 September \n     11th hijackers--have been charged, pled guilty or convicted \n     of involvement in terrorism on U.S. soil in the last 10 \n     years.\n       41 of the 47 had been approved for a visa by an American \n     consulate overseas at some point. Thus, how we process visas \n     is critically important.\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\n       Only 3 entered without inspection (illegally) into the \n     United States and thereby avoided contact with an immigration \n     inspector at a point of entry.\n       This means that 44 of the 47 had contact with an inspector \n     at a point of entry.\n       Of the 47 terrorists, at least 13 had overstayed a \n     temporary visa at some point prior to taking part in \n     terrorist activity, including September 11th ring leader \n     Mohamed. Therefore, tracking visa overstays is therefore a \n     very important part of terrorism prevention.\n       The terrorists who entered on student visas took part in \n     the first attack on the Trade Center in 1993, the bombing of \n     U.S. embassy in Africa in 1998, and the attacks of September \n     11th. Therefore, how we process and track foreign students is \n     clearly important.\n       Some reports indicate that Khalid Al Midhar, who probably \n     flew American Airlines flight 77 into the Pentagon, was \n     identified as a terrorist by the CIA in January 2001, but his \n     name was not given to the watch list until August 2001.\n       Unfortunately, he had already reentered the United States \n     in July 2001. (I should point out that there is some debate \n     about exactly when the CIA identified him as a terrorist).\n       But, if it really did take the CIA several months to put \n     his name on the list as PBS' Frontline has reported, then \n     that is a serious problem because we might have stopped him \n     from entering the country had they shared this information \n     sooner. This speaks to the issue of sharing information \n     between federal agencies.\n\n                          Absconders/detainees\n\n       In December 2001, INS estimated that 314,000 foreigners who \n     have been ordered deported are at large.\n       More recent estimates released in March 2002 suggest that \n     there may be at least 425,000 such absconders.\n       At least 6,000 were identified as coming from countries \n     considered Al Qaeda strongholds.\n\n\n                        border agency statistics\n\n       There are 1,800 inspectors at ports of entry along U.S. \n     borders.\n       The Customers Service has 3,000 inspectors to check the 1.4 \n     million people and 360,000 vehicles that cross the border \n     daily.\n       The 2,000-mile long Mexican border has 33 ports of entry \n     and 9,106 Border Patrol agents to guard them all.\n       In October 2001, there were 334 Border Patrol agents \n     assigned to the nearly 4,000-mile long northern border \n     between the U.S. and Canada. This number of agents cannot \n     cover all shifts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, leaving some \n     sections of the border open without coverage: The Office of \n     the Inspector General found that one northern border sector \n     had identified 65 smuggling corridors along the 300 miles of \n     border within its area of responsibility; and INS \n     intelligence officers have admitted that criminals along the \n     northern border monitor the Border Patrol's radio \n     communications and observe their actions and this enables \n     them to know the times when the fewest agents are on duty and \n     plan illegal actions accordingly.\n       350 million foreign nationals enter the U.S. each year.\n       The INS estimates that approximately 40 to 50 percent of \n     the illegal alien population entered the U.S. legally as \n     temporary visitors but simply failed to depart when required.\n       An estimated 40 percent of nonimmigrants overstay their \n     visas each year. 9 million illegal and 4 million visa \n     overstayers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act--Summary\n\n       The legislation would:\n       Create interoperable data system.--The Administration would \n     be required to develop and implement an interoperable law \n     enforcement and intelligence data system by October 26, 2003 \n     to provide the INS and State Department immediate access to \n     relevant law enforcement and intelligence information.\n       The database would be accessible to foreign service \n     officers issuing visas, federal agents determining the \n     admissibility of aliens to the U.S. and law enforcement \n     officers investigating and identifying aliens. The bill also \n     prevents and protects against the misuse of such data.\n       Reform the visa waiver program.--The bill would require \n     that each country participating in the visa waiver program \n     issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable biometric passports \n     to its nationals by 2003.\n       Require the reporting of lost or stolen passports.--The INS \n     would be required to enter stolen or lost passport numbers \n     into the interoperable data system within 72 hours of \n     notification of loss or theft. And until that system is \n     established, the INS must enter that information into an \n     existing data system.\n       Require new requirements for passenger manifests.--All \n     commercial flights and vessels coming to the U.S. from \n     international ports must provide manifest information about \n     each passenger, crew member, and other occupant prior to \n     arrival. This section of the bill also eliminates the 45-\n     minute deadline to clear arriving passengers.\n       Require new travel document measures.--Requires all visas, \n     passports, and other travel documents to be fraud and tamper-\n     resistant and contain biometric data by October 26, 2003.\n       Increase scrutiny of nonimmigrants from certain \n     countries.--Prohibits the issuance of nonimmigrant visas to \n     nationals from countries designated as state sponsors of \n     international terrorism, unless the Secretary of State, after \n     consulting with the Attorney General and the heads of other \n     appropriate agencies, determines that the individuals pose no \n     safety or security threat to the United States.\n       Institute student visa reforms.--Reforms the student visa \n     process by:\n       Requiring the Attorney General to notify schools of the \n     students entry and requiring the schools to notify the INS if \n     a student has not reported to school within 30 days at the \n     beginning of an academic term. The monitoring program does \n     not, at present, collect such critical information as the \n     student's date of entry, port of entry, date of school \n     enrollment, date the student leaves school (e.g., graduates, \n     quits), and the degree program or field of study. That and \n     other significant information will not be collected.\n       Requiring the INS, in consultation with the State \n     Department, to monitor the various steps involved in \n     admitting foreign students and to notify the school of the \n     student's entry. It also requires the school to notify INS if \n     a student has not reported for school no more than 30 days \n     after the deadline for registering for classes.\n       Requiring the INS to conduct a periodic review of \n     educational institutions to monitor their compliance with \n     record-keeping and reporting requirements. If an institution \n     or programs fails to comply, their authorization to accept \n     foreign students may be revoked.\n       While the INS is currently responsible for reviewing the \n     compliance of educational institutions, such reviews have not \n     been done consistently in recent years and some schools are \n     not diligent in their record-keeping and reporting \n     responsibilities.\n       Increase more border personnel. This section authorizes an \n     increase of at least 1,000 INS inspectors, 1,000 INS \n     investigative personnel, 1,000 Customs Service inspectors, \n     and additional associated support staff in each of the fiscal \n     years 2002 through 2006 to be employed at either the northern \n     or southern border.\n       Increase INS pay and staffing. To help INS retain border \n     patrol officers and inspectors, this section would raise \n     their pay grade and permit the hiring of additional support \n     staff.\n       Enhance Border patrol and customs training. To enhance our \n     ability to identify and intercept would-be terrorists at the \n     border, funds are provided for the regular training of border \n     patrol, customs agents, and INS inspectors. In addition, \n     funds are provided to agencies staffing U.S. ports of entry \n     for continuing cross-training, to fully train inspectors in \n     using lookout databases and monitoring passenger traffic \n     patterns, and to expand the Carrier Consultant Program.\n       Improve State Department information and training. This \n     section authorized funding to improve the security features \n     of the Department of State's screening of visa applicants. \n     Improved security features include: better coordination of \n     international intelligence information; additional staff; and \n     continuous training of consular officers.\n\n\n               why is this immigration reform necessary?\n\n       Six months to the day after Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-\n     Shehhi flew planes into the World Trade Center, the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service notified a Venice, \n     Florida, flight school that the two men had been approved for \n     student visas.\n       One week later, the INS discovered that four Pakistani \n     crewmen, four Pakistani nationals were reported missing after \n     an INS inspector had inappropriately allowed them to take \n     shore leave after a ship docked in the Norfork, Virginia \n     harbor.\n       On November 30, Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Browback and \n     Kyl introduced this bill to make sure these missteps do not \n     happen again. This bill would help prevent terrorists from \n     entering the United States by exploiting the loopholes in our \n     immigration system.\n       The House passed this bill by voice vote on December 19, \n     2001 and again on March 12, 2002. It is now time for the \n     Senate to act.\n\n                           Facts to consider\n\n       As many as 3.5 to 4 million tourists, students and others \n     legally entered the U.S. with visas, but later became illegal \n     immigrants by remaining in the country long after their visas \n     expire. The INS has acknowledged that the agency has no idea \n     where they are.\n       Each year, we have 350 million border crossings. For the \n     most part, these individuals are legitimate visitors to our \n     country. We currently have no way of tracking all of these \n     visitors.\n       47 foreign-born individuals--including the 19 September \n     11th hijackers--have been charged, plead guilty or convicted \n     of involvement in terrorism on U.S. soil in the last 10 \n     years.\n       41 of the 47 had been approved for a visa by an American \n     consulate overseas at some point. Thus, how we process visas \n     is critically important.\n\n             Other serious problems that have come to light\n\n                            Foreign Students\n\n       Each year, more than 500,000 foreign nationals enter the \n     U.S. with foreign student visas.\n       Within the last ten years, 16,000 came from such terrorist \n     supporting states as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Syria.\n       The foreign student visa program is severely under-\n     regulated. During the 2000-2001 academic year, 3,761 foreign \n     nationals from terrorist supporting countries were admitted \n     into the U.S. on student visas.\n       Before September 11th, the State Department did not perform \n     extensive background\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\n     checks for students coming from Syria or Sudan. An \n     intermediate background check is required for Iranian \n     students and more extensive checks are required for students \n     from Iraq and Libya.\n       Last year, the National Commission on Terrorism warned, \n     ``Of the large number of foreign students who come to this \n     country to study, there is a risk that a small minority may \n     exploit their student status to support terrorist activity.''\n       The problem is that the INS has no idea whether the \n     students are registered at the schools that sponsored them or \n     how many are in the United States today with expired visas.\n       Nor can the INS provide information on the number or the \n     type of institutions who are eligible to accept foreign \n     students into their academic programs. This type of \n     information is essential to INS and the Congress' ability to \n     exercise effective oversight over the visa program.\n\n                       Foreign Student Visa Fraud\n\n       In the early 1990s for example, five officials at four \n     California colleges, were convicted of taking bribes, \n     providing counterfeit education documents and fraudulently \n     applying for more than 100 foreign student visas.\n       When asked what steps the INS took to ensure that the \n     college would comply with the terms of the program in the \n     future, INS staff said no steps were taken. When asked about \n     the fate of the 100 foreign nationals who fraudulently \n     obtained foreign student visas, the INS had no idea.\n\n                              Visa Waiver\n\n       The Visa Waiver Program was designed to enable citizens \n     from 29 participating countries to travel to the U.S. without \n     having to first obtain visas for entry. Earlier this year, \n     Argentina was dropped from the program, so now there are 28 \n     participating countries.\n       An estimated 23 million visitors enter the U.S. under this \n     program. This program has been subject to abuse and has, at \n     times, facilitated illegal entry because it eliminates the \n     need for visitors to obtain U.S. visas and allows them to \n     avoid the pre-screening that consular officers normally \n     perform on visa applicants.\n       As a result, checks by INS inspectors at U.S. ports of \n     entry become the chief and sometimes only means of preventing \n     illegal entry; INS inspectors have, on average, less than one \n     minute to check and decide on each visitor.\n       The INS has also estimated that over 100,000 blank \n     passports have been stolen from government offices in \n     participating countries in recent years.\n       Abuse of the Visa Waiver program poses threats to U.S. \n     national security and increases illegal immigration. For \n     example, one of the co-conspirators in the World Trade Center \n     bombing of 1993 deliberately chose to use a fraudulent \n     Swedish passport to attempt entry into the U.S. because of \n     Sweden's participation in the visa waiver program.\n\n               Information Sharing Among Federal Agencies\n\n       In a Judiciary Subcommittee hearing I held in September, \n     Mary Ryan, the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular \n     Affairs, said that the lack of information sharing is a \n     ``colossal intelligence failure'' and that the State \n     Department ``had no information on the terrorists from law \n     enforcement.''\n       Right now, our government agencies use different systems, \n     with different information and different formats, and they \n     often refuse to share that information with other agencies \n     within our government. This clearly, in view of September \n     11th, is no longer acceptable.\n       I am amazed that a person can apply for a visa and there is \n     no mechanism by which the FBI or CIA can enter a code into \n     the system to raise a red flag on individuals known to have \n     links to terrorist groups and pose a national threat.\n       In the Wake of September 11th, it is hard for me to fathom \n     how a terrorist might be permitted to enter the U.S. because \n     our government agencies aren't sharing information.\n       I am also concerned about the current structure of \n     information technology. An assessment made of the INS \n     management and investment of information technology by the \n     Department of Justice Inspector General revealed the INS \n     cannot ensure that the money it spends each year on \n     information technology will be able to support the service \n     and enforcement functions of the agency.\n       Nor is the agency's information adequately protected from \n     unauthorized access or service disruption. Moreover, the INS \n     currently uses to many different data bases, many of which do \n     not communicate with each other.\n       All these problems point to the dramatic need for change.\n\n\n  What the ``Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act'' does\n\n       This bill protects our nation's openness to newcomers while \n     at the same time adds some prudent steps to our immigration \n     policy to ensure that Americans are safe at home.\n       The bill's major provisions would:\n       Require the administration to create a computerized \n     database system giving INS and the State Department, which \n     issues visas, immediate access to law enforcement and \n     intelligence service information. One of the 19 hijackers, \n     Khalid Almidhar, may have appeared on a CIA watch list--well \n     before he entered the country--that information was not \n     shared with the INS.\n       Require U.S. universities and other educational \n     institutions to notify the INS if a foreign student has not \n     reported to school within 30 days of the start of the \n     academic term. Two of the 19 highjackers came to the United \n     States on student visas yet never showed up for class.\n       Tighten reporting requirements for the 500,000 people \n     admitted annually on student visas.\n       Force airlines and shipping companies to provide passenger \n     and crew manifests for every fight and ship originating at \n     international ports before they arrive in the United States.\n       Require the 28 countries taking part in the Visa Waiver \n     Program, which permits certain of their citizens to travel \n     here for up to 90 days without first obtaining visas, to \n     issue tamper-resistant biometric passports by 2003.\n       Prohibit the issuance of visas to nationals from countries \n     designated as state sponsors of international terrorism \n     unless they are carefully vetted and determined to pose no \n     security threat to the United States. Such countries \n     currently include Iraq, Iran, Syria. Libya, Cuba, North Korea \n     and Sudan.\n       Even if we pass this legislation, it is still possible for \n     a terrorist to sneak into this country and inflict serious \n     harm. But, if we pass this important legislation, we can at \n     least reduce substantially the probability that terrorists \n     such as those who came here prior to September 11th will ever \n     be able to launch that type of attack again.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is an important question. It is one of the questions I \nwanted to raise. Where is the money? Is the President asking for the \nmoney in his budget? Did he ask for it in his supplemental request? \nWhere is the money? Is his administration going to support the \nappropriations for this legislation?\n  This is one of the areas that I had difficulty with last December \nwhen I was importuned by the many Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto give unanimous consent that we take this bill up without any debate, \nwithout any amendments, and pass it.\n  One of the questions I wanted to ask was, What about the funding?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I respond, as best I can?\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator would allow me to finish my question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All right.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  So it is one thing to advocate the passage of an authorization bill, \nand I very much want to support this legislation. I am not against this \nlegislation, and I will vote for it, depending upon what it looks like \nwhen we get ready to pass it. But as an appropriator, as the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, I think I need to ask \nabout the funding. What assurances do we have that this money is going \nto be forthcoming? Is it budgeted? Is the administration supporting the \nbill? Is the administration going to support the monies for it? Are all \nthe Senators who are advocating this legislation going to support the \nrequest for appropriations? Now if the Senator would answer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will take a crack at it, if I may.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is my understanding, certainly Senator Kyl, \nSenator Brownback, and I, along with the Republicans with whom the \nSenator was concerned at our subcommittee meeting, will support the \nappropriation. It is my understanding that roughly $743 million of this \namount is covered in the administration's fiscal year 2003 budget \nrequest. Therefore, the amount not covered is $440 million.\n  It is also my understanding the administration has allocated all but \n$327 million of the $10 billion that was previously allocated for \nhomeland security in last year's emergency supplemental. I, for one, \nwould certainly support my chairman on the Appropriations Committee to \ntake whatever is required from the unspecified $10 billion additional \nfund in the defense budget that was put in by the President. I think as \npart of defense, homeland defense is the most vital part of it, and \nthis certainly provides for that.\n\n  So I hope that is at least a partial answer to the Senator's \nquestion.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator is certainly trying. She is \nmaking the effort, but there are many other Senators who have ideas \nwith respect to that $10 billion. People on the Armed Services \nCommittee certainly have ideas as to the $10 billion, and the \nappropriators, including Senator\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nInouye and Senator Stevens, who are the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, have ideas. So there are \nall kinds of ideas around as to funding.\n  The Senator has mentioned some figures. I would like to be shown that \nthe Senator is correct in her figures. I have some serious questions \nabout funding of this bill, and they need to be answered. This is one \nreason I thought we ought to have a little debate about it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia, for his inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, again I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom California. Her heart is in the right place. She is trying to do \nthe right thing, and I admire her for all of those things. Money is a \nproblem, even for the best of things.\n  Recognizing the need for improved border security, I included nearly \n$1.1 billion for border security in my $15 billion homeland defense \namendment last November. Within that total, I included over $725 \nmillion that the President did not request for the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. That amendment to the Defense bill was defeated \nin the Senate when we could not get the 60 votes required to meet a 60-\nvote point of order.\n  I tried again on the Defense supplemental appropriations bill that \nthe Senate considered in December. I included $335 million above the \nPresident's request for the INS for improvements in border security, \nparticularly along the northern border. Once again, the funding was \nrejected when a 60-vote point of order was raised and we could not get \nthe 60 votes.\n  Finally, in the conference on the Defense supplemental appropriations \nbill, we provided $150 million more than the President's request.\n  Now, as the border security bill pending before us proves, there \ncontinues to be a need for significant infusion of resources to staff, \nto train and to equip the Immigration and Naturalization Service to do \nits job on our Nation's borders. Sadly, in the $28.6 billion \nsupplemental that the President requested just a few days ago, on March \n21, he includes only $35 million for the INS.\n  I ask the question--perhaps it is a rhetorical question--how much is \nrequired of the INS in this bill? How much money does the INS need to \nmeet the requirements of this bill? The President requested a $28.6 \nbillion supplemental just a few day ago, on March 21, and he included \nonly $35 million for the INS. Where is the money coming from to meet \nthe requirements that will be placed on the INS by this bill?\n  I am not being critical of the bill. I want to know the answer. I \nwant the bill to work. That is why I said I wasn't going to agree to \nthe unanimous consent request last December to take up the bill and \npass it in the bat of an eye, without any debate, without any questions \nasked.\n  I am here today. I want to improve this bill. I want to vote for it, \nbut what are the answers to these questions? How much money is being \nappropriated to the INS if it is to meet the requirements of the \npending bill? How much is it going to cost the INS? The President \nrequested, again, $28.6 billion in a supplemental, not yet a month ago, \nMarch 21; it will be 1 month ago this coming Sunday. He asked for $28.6 \nbillion, but he included only $35 million for the INS.\n  The request is particularly weak for providing the resources to \nconstruct border facilities and to equip border personnel and to \nprovide the technology and the computer system necessary for the INS to \neffectively work with other Federal agencies.\n  I ask that question. If one of the authors to the pending bill can \nanswer that question, I would like to know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Senator Byrd asked an important \nquestion about the payment for these measures. As I understand, \nfollowing what my friend and colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, has made available, I am happy to reference to the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, but he obviously has this information. \nIt has designated $5 billion; that is what the INS budget is, $5 \nbillion. In that is the entry exit, which is basically what we are \ntalking about, $380 million; computer infrastructure is the \ndownpayment, $83 million; the land border inspectors, $34 million; air/\nsea inspectors, $51 million; border construction, $145 million; \nRetention, $743 million. This is not all of what we would like to have \nin this authorization. Quite frankly, I think this is a higher priority \nthan other measures, both of which will be in our Defense authorization \nbill, as well as in the supplemental. We will have, hopefully, the \nopportunity to make that case. I will stand shoulder to shoulder with \nthe Senator from California, Senator Brownback, and Senator Kyl to make \nthat presentation to this body and to the appropriators in order to \nfund this measure.\n  I agree, we do not want to misrepresent to the American people that \nwe are doing something on student visas, that we are doing something in \nterms of requiring our intelligence agencies to give information to the \nINS to try to stop terrorists, or that we have backup systems so we \nknow whether the students are going to their colleges or staying in the \ncolleges. All that is included in here.\n  I think we have a strong case. As in many different areas of public \npolicy, we are not able to get all the things we would like, but this \nis a very compelling justification for all of the provisions we have \nincluded in this bill, why we have such a broad support from so many of \nthe different groups and individuals who understand the importance and \nsignificance of this proposal.\n\n  It has been very worthwhile, as the Senator from West Virginia has \npointed out, that with the authorization of this legislation it does \nnot mean all resources are going to be there. Within the President's \nbudget, there is a downpayment for the startup of these proposals and \nwe will have the opportunity as these appropriations try to give this \nthe high priority it deserves.\n  Quite frankly, I think if we are looking over what the nature of the \nthreat is, we know it obviously is military, and that is costing more \nthan $1.5 billion a month. More importantly, it has cost a number of \nAmerican lives. We know that. We know it is intelligence. We know the \nvery substantial amount runs into the billions and billions of dollars \nin terms of intelligence, particularly in human intelligence. We know \nwe need additional resources to pursue and track down money laundering. \nThat is costly. Perhaps we are not spending enough in that area.\n  The good Senator has raised the importance of making sure we will \nhave adequate capability in areas of bioterrorism. I think that is as \nhigh a threat as any of the others. Still, as he has pointed out on \nother occasions, he brought the administration to a more robust \ninvestment in bioterrorism, which I still don't think is adequate to \nconstruct and begin the early detection and containment as well as the \nstockpiling of various medicines but we have made an important \ndownpayment.\n  For me, and I think for others, this area in terms of doing something \nabout the easy access into this country falls right into similar \npriorities. For this Nation, if we haven't got it today, we ought to \nhave it tomorrow. The American people will certainly support, out of a \n$2 trillion budget, $1 billion additional for our national security. \nThat is what we are committed to. Of course, we would obviously welcome \nthe Senator from West Virginia, but I don't think the American people \ncan understand with the case that has been made in a bipartisan way, a \ncompelling way, in terms of where the threat is to our borders, this is \na matter of key national security. It could be as important as \nshortening the length of time of an aircraft carrier battle division \noff the Indian Ocean for a couple of months.\n  This is national security and important. We ought to be able to make \nthe case. I hope we will be able to fund it. We don't have all the \nanswers or all the resources clearly today. We are strongly committed \nto making sure this is going to be funded and going to be put into \neffect. I believe we will be very careful in overseeing and making sure \nit is effective. But as the good Senator has pointed out, we haven't \ngot the resources on this today. This is an authorization. We have \nremaining time before we get into the appropriation.\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nThis has a high national priority in terms of our national security. As \nwe move down the process, we welcome the chairman's help in making sure \nthe protections that will be guaranteed by this legislation for our \npeople will be achieved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is no difference, when it comes to \nstating the compelling need for what the bill seeks to do--there is no \ndifference between the Senator from Massachusetts and myself. We stood \ntoe to toe last year. So did the distinguished Senator from California, \nwho is now presiding, Mrs. Feinstein. We stood toe to toe with each \nother. When I tried to add $15 billion--half was for New York--in the \nstimulus bill for homeland defense, we were together. I am with you \ntoday. We were together then. But a point of order was raised on the \nother side of the aisle against that money. It was the 60-vote point of \norder. We could not find the 60 votes.\n  Then, when the Defense appropriations bill was called up at the end \nof the year--again, there was $7.5 billion for homeland defense in that \nbill, $7.5 billion--a point of order again was raised on the other side \nof the aisle. It was a 60-vote point of order. We did not have the 60 \nvotes on this side of the aisle.\n  So there is no question about the compelling need for these \nadditional items to protect the borders of this country. But what I am \nsaying today is the President of the United States--we saw it in the \npapers, I believe it was today or yesterday--threatened to veto any \nappropriations bill that went beyond what he was requesting. That may \nnot be the exact phrasing, but we are already threatened with a veto.\n  So where is this money coming from? I am only saying we make a \nmistake when we pass legislation here that leaves the American people \nunder the impression we have done something to surmount the problem, \nthat we pass legislation to deal with border security that will \nadequately deal with the problem, will provide the technology, will \nprovide the additional personnel, will provide the money so people can \nsleep on their pillows after this bill passes and it is signed into \nlaw, if it is signed into law, comfortable in the thought that the \nCongress has taken care of the matter quite adequately; we have passed \nlegislation to do it.\n  But where is the money? It is one thing to talk about belling the \ncat, but who is going to bell the cat? That is an old fable.\n  Saying these things, I do not level criticism at the authors of this \nbill. As I said, I intend to vote for it, depending on what it looks \nlike when it comes up for passage. But I raise these legitimate \nquestions. I do not believe anybody in this Chamber can answer them. \nHow much is this bill going to cost? How much is it going to cost? How \nmuch more is going to be put on the shoulders of the INS?\n  We make a serious mistake, when we pass legislation to deal with an \nobvious and compelling problem, when we pass legislation that purports \nto deal with that problem but does not deal with it or is not \nenforceable. I question whether or not some of the deadlines in this \nbill can be met.\n  Let me read for the Senate what Alexander Hamilton says in the \nFederalist No. 25, just a single paragraph. Here is what Hamilton says \nin the Federalist No. 25, and I think we should keep this in mind every \nday when we pass legislation. I think it is very apropos to the \nlegislation we are going to pass here. We are going to pass it, I have \nno doubt about that. Here is what Hamilton said:\n\n       Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the \n     government with restrictions that cannot be observed, because \n     they know--\n\n  They know--\n\n     that every breach of the fundamental laws, though dictated by \n     necessity, impairs that sacred reverence which ought to be \n     maintained in the breasts of rulers towards the constitution \n     of a country, and forms a precedent for other breaches where \n     the same plea of necessity does not exist at all, or is less \n     urgent and palpable.\n\n  That is Alexander Hamilton. That is not Robert Byrd. Let me read it \nagain:\n\n       Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the \n     government with restrictions that cannot be observed, because \n     they know--\n\n  In other words, the wise politicians know--\n\n     because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws, \n     though dictated by necessity, impairs that sacred reverence \n     which ought to be maintained in the breasts of rulers towards \n     the constitution of a country, and forms a precedent for \n     other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not \n     exist at all, or is less urgent and palpable.\n\n  So Hamilton is saying that wise politicians ought to be very cautious \nabout fettering the Government with restrictions that cannot be \nobserved. And that is why I am saying about this bill: Can these \ndeadlines be met? Is the technology available now in order to meet \nthem? Is the technology available so that those deadlines can be met? \nIs the money going to be there? Is the money going to be there for the \npersonnel, for the technology, to meet those deadlines?\n  Hamilton says that if we pass these requirements and they are not \nmet, then this is a breach of the law, although it may be dictated by \nnecessity--as we readily admit that the necessity is there, to do what \nthis bill does. He speaks to that sacred reverence which ought to be \nmaintained in the breasts of rulers towards the constitution of a \ncountry. And he says one breach will lead to other breaches. One breach \nwill be a precedent for other breaches, where the same plea, of \nnecessity, may not even exist.\n  So I consider it to be a pretty serious matter that when we pass a \nbill of this kind, we are going to pass a law that can be observed and \nwill be observed, the requirements will be met, the equipment is there, \nthe technology is there, the money is there, and so we can rest assured \nthat whatever the bill purports to require will be done. That is the \nbasis of my concern.\n  The President's supplemental request for the INS is related to hiring \nmore agents for airports and seaports. Senator Hollings believes we \ngave them enough money in December for this because they cannot hire \npeople fast enough with the money they have. As I understand it, \nSenator Hollings believes that where we are short is in INS \nconstruction of building facilities to house the staff they are hiring. \nTherefore, we are seeking more INS construction in the supplemental.\n  I will be glad to have anyone answer the questions I have asked, if \nthey wish to do so. In the meantime, I will proceed with my statement.\n  Over the last ten years, a vigorous campaign has been waged in behalf \nof immigration. The economic benefits of immigration have been touted \nby businesses, the news media, and politicians. Those who have \nquestioned the benefits of immigration were immediately labeled as \nbeing ``uninformed'' or ``outside of the mainstream.'' The Congress \nquietly passed legislation, without adequate debate or amendments, to \nroll back deadlines and weaken mandates for our border defense \nagencies. As a result, immigrants--illegal and legal--have flowed into \nthis country at a rate of over 1 million immigrants per year.\n  The attacks that occurred on September 11 brought that campaign to a \nscreeching halt as the American people were made acutely aware of just \nhow porous our border defenses had become. Each of the 19 hijackers was \ngranted visas by a U.S. consulate abroad. Three of the September 11 \nhijackers had overstayed their visas and were living in the U.S. \nillegally at the time of the attacks. Seven of the 19 hijackers \nobtained fraudulent ID cards with the help of illegal aliens.\n  The American people must have wondered how the terrorists that \nperpetrated the September 11 attacks could so easily have slipped \nacross our borders and seamlessly blended into society. With all the \ngovernmental requirements placed on law-abiding families simply to own \na dog or to build a tool shed in the backyard, it seems outrageous that \nforeign terrorists could be leasing apartments, opening bank accounts, \nattending school, and invisibly maneuvering through the system while \nplotting their dastardly schemes.\n  The American people are clear in what they now ask from the Congress \nand the Administration--tougher border security and immigration laws, \nmore resources dedicated to our border defenses, and a more vigilant \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. What they have received so far \nis enough to make anyone wonder if Washington ever hears the concerns \nof the people back home.\n  I devoted a large amount of my time last fall to providing additional \nborder\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\nsecurity funds. As some have already indicated, I crafted a $15 billion \nhomeland defense package as part of the economic stimulus bill the \nSenate considered last November. That homeland defense package provided \n$1.1 billion for border security initiatives.\n  Under a presidential veto threat, those funds were removed from the \neconomic stimulus package by a partisan vote on a budgetary point of \norder. Many of the Senators who will support this authorization bill \nvoted against those actual additional border security funds last fall.\n  After the $15 billion homeland defense package was removed from the \nstimulus bill, I offered a $7.5 billion homeland defense package. Of \nthat amount, $591 million was devoted to border security initiatives.\n  Once again, under the threat of a presidential veto, those funds were \nremoved, this time from the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense Appropriations \nbill, by a partisan vote on a budgetary point of order requiring 60 \nvotes to overcome. And once again, many of the Senators who will \nsupport this authorization bill voted against border security funds \nlast fall.\n  Had those funds been approved, that money would be in the pipeline \nright now for hiring and training hundred of additional Border Patrol \nagents. The Administration, instead, chose to wait, and then asked the \nCongress for those same border security funds that it threatened to \nveto just two months earlier. As a result, even if, by the October 1 \ndeadline, those funds are appropriated by the Congress, those funds \nwill not be released until early next year--at the earliest. The \nAdministration effectively delayed hundreds of millions of dollars in \nborder security funds for at least one full year.\n  As for a more vigilant Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nAmerican people must have been shocked--I know that the President said \nhe was shocked--to learn that, six months to the day after the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the INS was still processing paperwork for two of \nthe terrorists who piloted the planes into the World Trade Center \ntowers.\n  They were dead, and internationally recognized as the September 11 \nterrorists. Yet, the INS was still processing the paperwork for them to \nattend a flight school in Florida.\n  In March, the American people learned that the INS mistakenly granted \nspecial waivers to four Pakistani sailors who were aboard a Russian \nship in Norfolk, VA. When the ship sailed for Savannah, GA, 2 days \nlater, the four Pakistani crewmen were missing. An INS inspector \nentered an improper birth date for one of the four missing Pakistanis. \nIf the birth date had been entered correctly, INS would have found that \nthe man had committed an immigration violation in Chicago several years \nago, and, therefore, was not eligible for a visa.\n  To make matters worse, in the midst of a debate on border security, \nthere are efforts underway to add to this legislation, at the request \nof the President, an amnesty provision for hundreds of thousands of \nillegal aliens, including many who have not undergone any background or \nsecurity check.\n  The American people have good reason to raise an eyebrow when they \nhear the Congress and the administration tell them that they are \nworking to tighten our border security.\n  If we are to restore the trust of the American people in our efforts \nto secure our nation's borders, we need to have a serious debate about \nour border defenses and what we can actually do to repair them.\n  That is part of the reason I objected to passing this bill by \nunanimous consent without any debate or amendments. I understand there \nare some amendments that have been agreed upon already which will be in \nthe managers' amendment at the end of the debate when we vote on the \nbill. There are some amendments that have already been agreed upon \napparently by the managers. So the American people, by virtue of at \nleast some debate, can have at least some idea of what is in the bill \nand whether or not it would be successful in tightening our borders.\n\n  We do not know how much money this is going to cost. We do not know \nhow the money will be made available. In a supplemental? By virtue of \nPresidential request in a budget? The President did not request \nanything in his supplemental request.\n  We have tight restrictions on moneys that are appropriated here. They \nhave to come within 302(a) allocations. They have to come within 302(b) \nallocations. Anything over and above has to be labeled an emergency, \nand the President has threatened to veto appropriations that are \nlabeled as emergencies unless he or his administration requests that \nthat be done.\n  So we are in a straitjacket when it comes to appropriations. I know \nthere are Senators who are going to be looking at me, wanting moneys to \nbe appropriated for this bill.\n  So really proponents of this measure have no way of judging whether \nthey will have the necessary support for the appropriations that will \nbe needed later this year to implement many of the provisions of the \nbill. How can taxpayers, who ultimately will be responsible for footing \nthe cost of the bill, be expected to support the long-term financial \ncommitment this bill requires if we do not know now, when we are \ndebating the bill, where the money is coming from?\n  I do not know how enthusiastic or whether the administration will be \nenthusiastic at all about this bill. I do not know how enthusiastic \nthey will be, if at all. And yet the administration tells us we need to \nhave an amnesty provision. Not in this bill. Fortunately, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and others, are \nnot advocating that in this bill.\n  But that 245(i) amnesty bill, that is something that is clearly \nopposed, I believe, by a majority of the American people. Yet the \nadministration says, on the one hand, how careful we have to be, how \ncautious we must be, how much on our guard we must be. The \nadministration has issued how many alerts? Four already? Three or four \nalready. He says, on the one hand, be alert. On the other hand, he \nsays, let's let the illegals in. Let's let them stay. Those who have \nviolated U.S. law, let them stay. What about those people who have \nstood in line, who have followed the procedures by which they can be \nentitled, eventually, to become residents and citizens? How do they \nfeel when as to a group of thousands or hundreds of thousands of others \nwho violate the laws, who make the shortcuts, they see the \nadministration advocating that those who made the shortcuts, those who \nviolated the laws, be given amnesty? Why abide by the laws if you can \nviolate them and achieve your goal even much quicker by violating them? \nWhat is the inducement for following the laws?\n  Now let's take the visa waiver program, for instance. Under this \nprogram, roughly 23 million foreign nationals from 28 countries enter \nthe United States as temporary visitors without obtaining a visa from a \nU.S. consulate abroad. By eliminating the visa requirement, aliens are \npermitted to bypass the State Department background check--the first \nstep by which foreign visitors are screened for admissibility when \nseeking to enter the United States.\n  Proponents of the program are quick to point out that only low-risk \ncountries, mostly Western European, may participate in this program. \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service has reported that hundreds \nof thousands of passports from these countries have been stolen--\nstolen--in recent years. So when you couple these thefts with the fact \nthat, according to the Justice Department's Inspector General, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service has roughly a minute to complete \nan inspection, it is likely that a terrorist with a fraudulent passport \nwill try to slip into the country. That is exactly what happened in \n1992, when one of the conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing tried to get into the country through the visa waiver program \nwith a fake Swedish passport. He was caught, and a search of his \nluggage revealed bomb-making instructions.\n  The pending bill addresses this problem, in part, by requiring stolen \npassport numbers to be entered into a new interoperable database \nsystem. But, as I understand it, such a system is years away from being \ncompleted. In the meantime, the State Department and the INS are not \nable to share information on foreign nationals who enter the country \nunder this program. Well, if it is important enough for the INS and the \nState Department to share information on visa waiver participants, I\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\nsuggest the visa waiver program will remain a serious hole in our \nborder defenses until that interoperable database system is fully \nimplemented.\n  And that is just one problem that Senators will find if they take the \ntime to read through this bill, as I have.\n  Consider section 402, which deals with passenger manifests.\n  Section 402 of this bill requires commercial air and sea vessels \narriving and departing from the United States to provide an appropriate \nimmigration officer with a manifest of who the passengers are who are \non board. In subsection (g), Senators will note that the penalty for \nnot providing these manifests is a $300 fine--I suppose some people \ncarry that much money around as lunch money--a $300 fine for each \nperson not mentioned, or incorrectly identified, in the manifest.\n\n  This penalty, I suggest, is wholly inadequate. What is more, there is \nnothing in this bill to prevent a passenger from providing false \ninformation to the air or sea carriers. This provision, therefore, just \neats around the edges of a significant shortfall in our border \ndefenses. A $300 fine is not much when compared with the safety and \nsecurity of the Nation. But, of much greater concern is the question of \nthe ability of anyone who must take information from passengers and \nfill out the manifest to determine the reliability of the information \nthey have been given by the passenger. It is a joke to assume that \nsomeone with bad intentions would give accurate information to an \nemployee of the airlines, for example. That is not a criticism of \nairline or sea carrier employees.\n  It is, however, a fine example of how many provisions in the bill \nwhich on paper sound good but in reality provide only a false sense of \nincreased security.\n  The same can be said about the October 26, 2003, deadline. That \ndeadline appears five times in different locations throughout the bill. \nFor example, section 303: Not later than October 26, 2003, the Attorney \nGeneral shall install at all ports of entry in the United States \nequipment and software to allow biometric comparison of all U.S. visa \nand travel documents. That sounds wonderful. I don't know why they \npicked October 26--why it shouldn't have been October 1 or November 1. \nWhy October 26? Five times that date is used: October 26, 2003.\n  I don't think that is a realistic deadline. Perhaps someone can \nconvince me otherwise. Let me say it again. Not later than October 26, \n2003, the Attorney General shall--not may, shall--install at all--not \njust a few, not just certain ones, all--ports of entry in the United \nStates equipment and software to allow biometric comparison of all U.S. \nvisa and travel documents.\n  I wonder if that deadline, October 26, 2003, is realistic. We have 62 \nports of entry which are closed 8 hours a day with only an orange cone \nin front. We are years away from being able to provide the \nsophisticated equipment for checking biometric identifiers at all ports \nof entry.\n  Under the regular appropriations process, Congress cannot even get \nthat funding out to the agencies before October 1, 2002, at best. \nAssuming all 13 bills are completed on time by the end of the fiscal \nyear, it could still take months before funds are released to the \nagencies for this purpose. I think it is unwise to set deadlines such \nas that one--so strict--when it is highly questionable as to whether or \nnot those deadlines can be met.\n  As far as I can tell, that deadline is based solely on the fact that \nthe USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law on that same day, October 26, \nin 2001. If that is the case, that is certainly no reason to use a \ndeadline. Senators should be aware that these deadlines appear wholly \nunrealistic, especially the one I have just mentioned.\n  I appreciate the notion that without deadlines, it is difficult to \npress the agencies to act expeditiously. But when such deadlines come \nand go and the promised action has not been taken by the Federal \nGovernment, then Hamilton's admonition is called into focus: The public \nbecomes rightfully disillusioned with the ability of the Government to \ndo what it promises to do. We should put greater stock in the trust and \nconfidence of the American people. Without their continued support of \nthis measure, we lose the political will to act in the Congress, and we \nwill lose consensus elsewhere throughout the Government; that consensus \nrapidly dissipates.\n  The same could be said about the penalties included in this bill for \nthe more than 15,000 universities, colleges, and vocational schools \nacross the country that accept foreign students. There are more than \n500,000 foreign students in the United States who are benefiting from \nthe goodwill of this country and from our investment in education. Many \nof these are nuclear engineering scholars. Many of them are \nbiochemistry students. Many of them are pilot trainees who have access \nto dangerous technology, training, and information.\n  This bill takes some good steps toward setting up a national \nmonitoring system to verify the enrollment status of these students. \nHowever, universities are going to have to play a role in helping the \nGovernment to verify that these foreign nationals are actually showing \nup for class. It has been noted that one of the September 11 hijackers \nentered the United States on a student visa, dropped out of classes, \nand remained here illegally thereafter. But unless this Congress places \nsome tough penalties on universities to comply with the tougher \nreporting requirements contained in this bill, these universities are \nunlikely to take seriously the necessity to comply with these new \nresponsibilities.\n  The legislation gives the INS and the Secretary of State too much \ndiscretion in determining whether or not these educational institutions \nshould be penalized.\n  Let me read from the bill:\n\n       Effect of Failure To Comply.--Failure of an institution or \n     other entity to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting \n     requirements to receive non-immigrant students or exchange \n     visitor program participants under section 101(a)(15) (F), \n     (M), or (J) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(15) (F), (M), or (J)), or section 641 of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1372), may, at the election of the Commissioner of \n     Immigration and Naturalization or the Secretary of State, \n     result in the termination, suspension, or limitation of the \n     institution's approval to receive such students or the \n     termination of the other entity's designation to sponsor \n     exchange visitor program participants, as the case may be.\n\n  Now, why do we say ``may''? We are talking about the failure of an \ninstitution or other entity to comply with the recordkeeping and \nreporting requirements to receive nonimmigrant students or exchange \nvisitor program participants--that failure, as a result of that \nfailure. So if there is a failure to comply with the recordkeeping and \nreporting requirements, it may--``may'' it says--at the election of the \nCommissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Secretary of \nState, may result in the termination, suspension, or limitation of the \ninstitution's approval to receive such students.\n  Why shouldn't we say ``shall'' if an institution is going to be that \nlax and fail to report? We are talking about people's lives here. It \nshould be ``shall'' the election of the Commissioner of Immigration and \nNaturalization, or the Secretary of State ``shall'' result in the \ntermination--that is the end, cut it off--suspension, or limitation of \nthe institution's approval to receive such students or the termination \nof the other entity's designation to sponsor exchange visitor program \nparticipants, as the case may be.\n\n  Senators should understand and should insist that tougher penalties \nare necessary to ensure that this student monitoring system will work; \nand it won't work if we leave it full of holes like that.\n  Similarly, this Congress is quick to pass legislation that will place \nnew requirements and deadlines on the INS without giving adequate \nconsideration to whether that agency is equipped to meet those \nmandates--that agency of all agencies, sad to say.\n  The inevitable result is that the Congress will later have to weaken \nthe mandate or roll back the deadline when the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service fails to comply with the law.\n  Considering the INS's most recent debacles and its apparent inability \nto handle its current workload, I suggest that before we task that \nagency with additional responsibilities and meeting additional \ndeadlines, we should first try to reach some sort of a consensus about \nits organizational structure.\n  So far, the administration has proposed two seemingly contradictory \nINS restructuring plans. The first plan\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\nwould split the INS into an enforcement agency and a separate service \nagency, and the second would consolidate the INS and the Customs \nService within the Justice Department.\n  The House Judiciary Committee marked up an INS restructuring plan \nabout a week ago. As I understand it, Chairman Kennedy and Senator \nBrownback are crafting an INS restructuring plan as well. That is to \nsay nothing of the fact that at least two bills have been introduced in \nthe Congress that consolidate the Border Patrol functions of the INS \nwithin the Homeland Defense Department or Agency.\n  With all of these organizational plans circulating through the Halls \nof Congress, it makes little sense that we are considering a border \nsecurity bill that places new mandates on the INS without addressing \nhow that agency should be structured.\n  The organizational structure of our border defenses should be part of \nany border security debate. The single most important priority that \nshould be driving these policies is the safety of the American people \nand the safety of the American institutions within their own borders.\n  Senators may argue that this issue of coordinating our border \ndefenses was addressed when, in the aftermath of the September 11 \nattacks, the President created the Office of Homeland Security and \nappointed Governor Tom Ridge as its Director. The Federal Government \nneeds a focal point to coordinate its homeland security efforts.\n  Yet the Office of Homeland Security and its Director, in lacking any \nstatutory authority, will find it difficult, I am sure, to fulfill this \nmandate. Governor Ridge can request, but he cannot order, the agencies \ncharged with protecting our homeland to implement his recommendations. \nHe has to rely on the President to resolve agency disputes, which \ninclude opposition to the Director's initiatives.\n  We have already seen the warning signs of the potential troubles that \nlie ahead. In early February, Governor Ridge said that our borders \nremain ``disturbingly vulnerable.'' He cited as a reason that there is \nno ``direct line of accountability.''\n\n  Last year, he proposed that the various border security agencies be \nconsolidated under a single Federal entity, but the agencies charged \nwith border security have resisted this consolidation. While the White \nHouse announced that this week the President would endorse such a \nconsolidation, that effort has been delayed for months because of \nbureaucratic resistance. The authority of the Office of Homeland \nSecurity is only as strong as the President's involvement in that \noffice.\n  Furthermore, under Executive Order 13228, which established the \nOffice of Homeland Security, the President can unilaterally change the \nmandate of the OHS and, in large or small part, channel discretionary \nfunds to the OHS through the White House office budget. Well, the \nNation's Homeland Security Director has declined to testify before the \nCongress to justify the Office of Homeland Security's expenditures or \nto justify his actions in safeguarding the Nation against terrorism. \nNot only does this make it difficult for the Congress to conduct \noversight of appropriated funds and the oversight of our homeland and \nborder security effort, but it limits the Congress from helping the \nOffice of Homeland Security to fulfill its mandate.\n  Fixing the holes in our border defenses will require more than an \ninteroperable database system and biometric identifiers. While they may \nprove worthwhile, these border security initiatives are no panacea for \nborder defense.\n  We need to adopt a different mindset when it comes to the security of \nour borders. We need to consider the organizational structure of our \nborder defenses. We need to acknowledge that we will have to be \ncommitting resources for a long time if we are to close the holes that \nwere exposed by the September 11 attacks.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl for authoring \nthis legislation. But I am sure the bill's proponents understand that \nthe legislation is not the final answer to what ails our border \ndefenses. Meeting the deadlines and requirements set out in this bill \nwill require their continued support for large amounts of funding. I \ndon't know how we can assure that this funding is going to be there \nunder the requirements and restraints under which the Appropriations \nCommittee acts. Without those funds and without their continued \nsupport, the bill is just an empty promise.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on the border security bill that is \nbefore us, and to also note, at the outset, the thousands of people who \nare gathering just outside the Capitol in a statement of support for \nIsrael.\n  It is an important gathering, particularly because of where this \nNation is at this point in time and the importance of where Israel is \nright now: The difficulties and confrontations they have had with \nsuicide bombers, which we witnessed on our soil and which we have dealt \nwith in our own land as well.\n  September 11 brings back very clear memories--vivid, difficult \nmemories for many of us--when suicide bombers took planes in the United \nStates and attacked two buildings in New York, the Twin Towers, the \nPentagon, and a fourth plane that was perhaps headed even for this \nbuilding that went down in a field in Pennsylvania, thanks to the \nheroic efforts of people onboard.\n  Israel is trying to defend her land from suicide bombers and has been \naggressively doing so. I know some people have questions about the \ntactics involved but not dealing with the issue.\n  I certainly would like to state my strong support for Israel, a \nstrong ally of the United States and has been and continues to be a \nstrong ally of the United States, a democracy in a different and \ndifficult region of the world, one that has worked and stood side by \nside with the United States in our times of need, and we should stand \nwith Israel as well.\n  I urge Israel to allow humanitarian groups in to make certain that \npeople are cared for as much as possible; that civilian damage is \nlimited as much as possible.\n  In their dealing with terrorists, I think they should deal and they \nhave dealt clearly aggressively with terrorism. Terrorism must be \nrenounced. Chairman Arafat must renounce terrorism on behalf of the \nPalestinian people and say: No more terrorism. That should be a minimum \nstatement.\n  I hope Chairman Arafat will lead his people toward peace, but I have \nreal doubt whether or not he wants to lead the Palestinian people \ntoward peace. There was an incredible offer on the table from Prime \nMinister Barak--it was less than 2 years ago--and he walked away from \nthat. I question whether or not he is willing to work toward peace. We \nneed somebody within the Palestinian leadership who wants peace.\n  I want to address some of the comments being put forward on the \nborder security bill by our distinguished colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, who is an outstanding Member of the body. I want to \naddress the specific concerns he brought forward on this legislation.\n  I believe we will pass the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \nReform Act of 2001. The House passed it last year. The President wants \nthe bill. It is up to this body to act. I believe we will act, and I \nbelieve we will have a large vote.\n  I am hopeful we can do this within a minimum time period because \nthere is so much other important pending business in front of this \nbody. This is important legislation, but so is the energy bill that has \nbeen before the Senate; so is a bill I have to prevent human cloning, \nto stop human cloning. We need to get a budget through. We need to \nstart through the appropriations process.\n  It is not as if there are not a lot of issues stacked up. This is one \nof the major issues. I think it is time for us to pass this bill. There \nwas actually very little opposition to it in the House. I think most \npeople are very\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\ncomfortable with the main provisions of this bill, and I am hopeful we \ncan work through other provisions without much difficulty.\n  I will note some of the major provisions of this bill for my \ncolleagues who are following this debate: Restrictions on \nnonimmigration visas for aliens coming from countries that sponsor \nterrorism; reform of the visa waiver program; requirement of passenger \nmanifest information for commercial flights and vessels; repeal of the \n45-minute time limit on INS inspections of arriving passengers.\n  That may cause inconvenience for some people. I want to note that, \ntoo, for my colleagues who are watching. The lines could be a bit \nlonger, but we are talking about security in the United States, and it \nmay be necessary for the time to be slightly longer to ensure people \ncoming into our country mean us no harm.\n  In this bill, there is the enhanced foreign student monitoring \nprogram. Several of the people who terrorized us, bombed us on \nSeptember 11 were students. We need to get that procedure under control \nand know where these students are and if they are going to reputable \nschools in the United States.\n  The magnitude of the problem we are dealing with is enormous. \nImmigration, the travel of people, non-U.S. citizens, in the United \nStates is a key issue for our economy, it is a key issue for our \nculture, and it is a key issue for our society in the future. We are a \nland of immigrants. Outside of Native Americans, we all came here from \nsomewhere else. This is a key part of who we are and who we will be in \nthe future.\n  To give some scale of magnitude of the issue with which we are \ndealing, 2 years ago, there were nearly 330 million--330 million--legal \ncrossings over our borders by non-U.S. citizens. That has nothing to do \nwith illegal crossings. There were 330 million legal crossings by non-\nU.S. citizens over our borders. This is a huge bit of commerce. There \nis a great deal of interaction that takes place and is very important.\n  Out of that 330 million crossings universe, we are looking for a very \nsmall portion of those who want to do us harm. I talked on Friday about \nthis being the equivalent of looking for a needle in a hay field--not a \nhaystack, a hay field. We have to be intelligent about this and use the \nmeans at our disposal to find the people who are here trying to do us \nharm.\n  One of the key elements is to make sure we have information sharing \nbetween various agencies--between INS, the Department of State, CIA, \nDIA, FBI, and I would like to think, as well, foreign information from \nforeign intelligence agencies that can point out: These are the people \nwe are watching.\n  If we are looking at 330 million people in a universe and are trying \nto hone this down to several hundred, we need a lot of information.\n  Currently, all this information is in stovepipes, it is stacked up, \nand there is not the cross-communication we need to have. That is one \nof the things that is required in this bill. It takes time to get \ncomputers talking to one another. It is sometimes difficult getting \npeople to talk to one another. Computers have to be wired.\n  We can do that, and we need to do that. That is a key provision of a \nportion of this bill. We are trying to extend the perimeter of the \nUnited States to include both Canada and Mexico.\n  I was at the El Paso INS detention facility about a year ago, and in \nthat detention facility were people from 59 different countries who had \ncome in through Central America, South America, had taken land \ntransportation up and through Mexico, and then crossed over into our \nborders. We need to have that perimeter extended.\n  Within this bill is a push to get that perimeter extended to include \nCanada and Mexico so we get more cooperation and help from them in \ndealing with our perimeter. That is important for us to be able to do.\n  Now there were some questions raised about how will these be paid \nfor? Those are certainly legitimate questions. This is an authorization \nbill. Some of these are authorizing features, not appropriations \nfeatures, but much of this is going to require resources. It is put \nforward by the Department of Justice that the first-year implementation \nof this bill would cost about $1.186 billion. Of that, $743 million is \nin the current Bush budget. That is already put forward in the budget. \nSo we are quite a ways along the way already with what is built into \nthe current Bush budget.\n  Plus, as I understand it, there are still some resources left from \nthe $40 billion supplemental that was put forward last year to deal \nwith the crisis and the current situation. I am supportive and will be \nsupportive of additional resources to make sure we do fully fund this \nat the $1.186 billion level for this first year. Total implementation \ncosts we have at $3.13 billion over the full lifetime of the program. \nThat is the universe of the numbers we are talking about. We are well \non the way to funding this.\n  There has been concern raised about why was this not funded last \nyear? There were people who put forward bills. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee put forward an additional $15 billion \nsupplemental saying, let us fund it now. The President at that time \nsaid: No, I want to try to digest the $40 billion that has already been \nallocated and authorized before we step into another tranche of funds.\n  I thought that was a wise and prudent course. That is why I did not \nat that time support the additional $15 billion; whereas now we have \nhad some months to be able to think this through, to see where the gaps \nand the holes are. The President has built a portion of it into his \nbudget, and we have about another $600 million that we are looking at \nto fully fund this program. That is what we are talking about. I think \nthat is a prudent and wise approach for us. I thought it was at that \ntime. We need time to be able to digest these sorts of changes and \nresources, and I think this is the right way for us to go.\n  We are not getting the cart ahead of the horse. We are doing the \nauthorization, which we are to do before we do the appropriation. So we \nauthorize for what we in the Congress think we should do, and then we \nappropriate to follow on with that. I am committed to seeking those \nresources to get this fully appropriated. I think it is important we do \nthat. Frankly, I like that we are doing this one right because \ntypically or frequently we will do it backwards and not get that done. \nI do believe that with the nature of this priority, the nature of \nborder security, the importance of that for our future and the security \nof our people, this will be able to secure the adequate resources it \nneeds throughout the competition within the appropriations process. We \nshould be able to put these forward and meet the higher priorities for \nthe security needs of the country. The lead requirement for us is to \nprovide for the common defense and, to me, in this day and age, it is \nto provide protection against terrorists.\n\n  We are prosecuting our war overseas now. We are prosecuting it in \nAfghanistan. We have troops in Georgia. We are helping train troops in \nthe former Soviet Union country of Georgia. We have troops in the \nPhilippines as trainers to deal with terrorist groups. There may be \ntroops in some other countries as we go to where the terrorists are to \ndig them out before they come this way, and then we enhance our border \nsecurity so we can deal with the terrorists who try to get on our soil.\n  I think the prosecution of the war is going well at this point in \ntime. It would be my hope, as one of the cosponsors of this \nlegislation, that we could move this through. If people have \namendments, we ask for them to bring the amendments forward so we can \nsee if we can get them handled appropriately. I would hope we could do \nthis without too many amendments so we could get this to the House and \nget it passed. The House has passed this bill twice. We need to get it \npassed.\n  I hope if people do have amendments that they want to bring they \nwould bring them up now so we can deal with the legislation, deal with \nthe amendments, and get the legislation passed and implemented into law \nbecause it has broad support throughout this body.\n  I may make comments at a later time on this legislation, but at this \ntime I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3128\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I will shortly \nsend\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nto the desk, but let me say a few things in regard thereto first.\n  There is an urgent and pressing need for the United States to improve \nthe enforcement of our laws that prohibit the importation of goods that \nare made using forced labor. Countries throughout the world are using \nforced, prison, or indentured labor to cut costs to the bone, increase \nthe export of cheap goods, and drive American manufacturers under. We \nhave to take stronger action to see that U.S. laws that prohibit this \nrepugnant practice are enforced.\n  Since 1930, the United States has had a law on our books that \nprohibits the entry of prison-made goods and requires the U.S. Customs \nService to seize goods destined for our markets that are made utilizing \nforced labor. There are common sense reasons for the Tariff Act of \n1930. The importation of prison-made goods is not consistent with \neither the principles of free trade or human rights. American consumers \nshould not unwittingly be supporting repression in other countries \nsimply by shopping at the local mall.\n  Admittedly it is difficult to enforce laws prohibiting goods made \nusing forced labor. Overall, U.S. Customs officials inspect less than 3 \npercent of all imports, and often those inspections are superficial. \nThere are the problems of sheer volume of imports, the commercial \nrequirements of rapid movement of goods, and other realities of today's \ncommerce but we must endeavor to do a better job. With respect to \nforced labor-made goods, there are issues of fraudulent mis-labeling, \nlack of cooperation of foreign governments, and the existence of a \nsophisticated network of middlemen engaged in transshipment of goods \ndestined for America. For instance, goods made in the vast forced labor \nmanufacturing network in China may arrive in the U.S. from Nigeria. \nSuch is the nature of global commerce today.\n  A number of countries make common use of forced labor--China is but \none of them. One estimate places the number of forced labor facilities \nin China at an astounding 1,114, employing as many as 1.7 million \npeople. Mr. President, that bears repeating. China, a country that \nexports nearly $100 billion in merchandise to the United States, has up \nto 1.7 million forced laborers in 1,114 facilities. Some of these \npeople were sentenced to prison time at hard labor for crimes that they \nactually committed.\n  Others are forced into prison labor camps without so much as a trial, \nbecause of political or religious beliefs, and are subject to torture \nand beatings. In China, if one visits a non-state-sanctioned church, \nfor instance, such an ``offender'' could end up making lawn tractors, \ncordless drills, or soccer balls for U.S. markets.\n  The forced labor facility network is an integral part of the Chinese \neconomy. But, there are no firm numbers on the quantity of forced \nlabor-made goods that eventually find their way from China's extensive \nforced labor network to our shores, shipped here directly or \ntransshipped through other countries. It is anyone's guess as to how \nmuch of the $100 billion in Chinese goods sold in the U.S. each year \nare made, wholly or in part, by forced labor. But there can be no doubt \nthat with a forced labor population of at least 1.7 million, China is \nselling a considerable amount of prison-made goods to the United States \nwhich is the main purchaser of China's exports.\n  China is not the only country that produces and exports forced labor-\nmade goods. The 2001 State Department Country Report on Human Rights \nPractices names Burma, Brazil, and Russia as having serious problems in \nthis area even though it is clearly against our laws for such goods to \ncross our borders.\n  To tackle this problem, my amendment takes three actions. First, it \nrequires all importers of goods into the U.S. to certify and the U.S. \nCustoms Service to ensure, based upon verification of these \ncertificates, that the goods being brought into our country have not \nbeen made with forced labor. Second, the amendment requires \nrenegotiation of two of our agreements with China that deal with the \ninspection of forced labor facilities in China. Third, the amendment \nreauthorizes $2 million for the Customs Service to provide additional \npersonnel to monitor imports and enforce our anti-forced labor import \nlaws.\n  Regarding the first section of my amendment, the requirement for \ncertification of all goods coming into the U.S. to be ``forced labor-\nfree'' is consistent with the practice and intent of other \ncertifications that are required of importers. When agricultural goods \nare brought into the United States, importers must present \ncertifications that the products have been appropriately inspected and \nhave established origins and producers. The World Trade Organization \nhas its own certification requirements for ``green'' products, to \ninsure that imported items are made in an environmentally friendly \nmanner. In fact, the WTO recognizes that certification requirements are \na legitimate tool in combating deceptive trade practices, such as those \nengaged in by countries that try to pass off forced labor-made goods to \nunsuspecting consumers in other countries, by transshipment, \nmislabeling, or other methods.\n  As to the second section of my amendment, there is a need to \nstrengthen our existing agreements with China to improve the ability of \nour Customs investigators to visit suspected forced labor facilities. \nRight now the site inspection and investigation process is beset by \nproblems of interpretation differences and plain old stonewalling. For \nexample, in one instance it took three and one half years for a U.S. \nrequested inspection of a heavy duty machine factory to be carried out.\n  There are two agreements with China going back to 1992 and 1994 which \ngovern our U.S. Customs agents' access to suspected forced labor sites. \nThose agreements are not working. The United States needs to conduct \nthese necessary inspections and investigations in a timely manner. To \neffectively do so, we need to close the loopholes in the present \ninspection agreements.\n  Finally, the third section of my amendment authorizes $2 million for \nCustoms Service personnel to enforce our forced labor import laws. \nCustoms already has 1,100 staff positions that are funded through the \npayment of fees. By authorizing an additional $2 million for the \nenforcement of these laws, the Customs service will be able to hire and \ndedicate more personnel for the specific purpose of discouraging forced \nlabor goods from penetrating U.S. markets.\n  The American consumer deserves to know what is on the shelves when \nthey go shopping. Nobody can tell just by looking at clothes on a rack \nwhich ones were made by legitimate tradesmen and which ones might have \nbeen made in some foreign ramshackle prison. But it is clear that some \ncountries utilize prison labor to gain a leg up in global markets. It \nis a sick and reprehensible practice. It hurts American business and \nfair-trading foreign businesses. It is an insult to our values. And it \nis against our law!\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to help put some teeth in U.S. laws that \nban goods made with prison labor.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3128.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that certification of compliance with section 307 \n    of the Tariff Act of 1930 be provided with respect to all goods \n                    imported into the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. CERTIFICATION REGARDING FORCED LABOR.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Labor \n     Certification Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Certification Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     require that any person importing goods into the United \n     States provide a certificate to the United States Customs \n     Service that the goods being imported comply with the \n     provisions of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \n     U.S.C. 1307) and that no part of the goods were made with \n     prison, forced, or indentured labor, or with labor performed \n     in any type of involuntary situation.\n       (2) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (A) Goods.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``goods'' includes goods, wares, articles, and merchandise \n     mined, produced, or\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\n     manufactured wholly or in part in any foreign country.\n       (B) Involuntary situation.--The term ``involuntary \n     situation'' includes any situation where work is performed on \n     an involuntary basis, whether or not it is performed in a \n     penal institution, a re-education through labor program, a \n     pre-trial detention facility, or any similar situation.\n       (C) Prison, forced, or indentured labor.--The term \n     ``prison, forced, or indentured labor'' includes any labor \n     performed for which the worker does not offer himself \n     voluntarily.\n       (c) Inspection of Certain Facilities.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall renegotiate and \n     enter into a new agreement with the People's Republic of \n     China, concerning inspection of facilities in the People's \n     Republic of China suspected of using forced labor to make \n     goods destined for export to the United States. The agreement \n     shall supercede the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding and 1994 \n     Statement of Cooperation, and shall provide that within 30 \n     days of making a request to the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, United States officials be allowed to \n     inspect all types of detention facilities in the People's \n     Republic of China that are suspected of using forced labor to \n     mine, produce, or manufacture goods destined for export to \n     the United States, including prisons, correctional \n     facilities, re-education facilities, and work camps. The \n     agreement shall also provide for concurrent investigations \n     and inspections if more than 1 facility or situation is \n     involved.\n       (2) Forced labor.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     term ``forced labor'' means convict or prison labor, forced \n     labor, indentured labor, or labor performed in any type of \n     involuntary situation.\n       (d) Authorization of Customs Personnel.--Section 3701 of \n     the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1999 is amended by striking ``for fiscal year \n     1999'' and inserting ``for each of fiscal years 2002 and \n     2003''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now 4:25 on Monday. We were just \nhanded this amendment that is 3\\1/2\\ pages long dealing with the \ncertification regarding forced labor, directed, as I understand, \nprimarily, purposely, towards China and the prison force indentured \nlabor.\n  No one knows better than the Senator from West Virginia the vast \nopportunities for amending pieces of legislation. We try to respond to \nour colleagues by indicating what is currently being considered on the \nfloor so they can make some judgment and informed decision on these \namendments. We are not in the position of being able to do so since we \nwere not afforded an opportunity to see the amendment until just a \ncouple of minutes ago.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I apologize for the amendment not having been shown to the \nSenator. I was under the impression my staff had discussed this \namendment with the Senator. I will be happy to either withdraw the \namendment for the time being or ask that it be set aside so the Senator \nand his staff and others may have an opportunity to look at the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. BYRD. This was inadvertent on my part.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have had an opportunity to talk to two of my \ncolleagues. I conferred with them a moment or two ago. They were not \nfamiliar with this amendment, either.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3128 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will withdraw the amendment now. I again \napologize to the Senator. This was an inadvertant oversight on my part. \nI certainly do not seek to take any unfair advantage of any Senator. I \nnever have. I will withdraw the amendment now and will offer it later \nafter it has been discussed with the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for \nthat purpose?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask a question of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, I am wondering if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill allow me, through the Chair, to ask the distinguished Senator, the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, does the Senator from West \nVirginia at this stage know how many more amendments he may offer?\n  The reason I am making inquiry is we would like to know this evening \nif we are going to have more amendments offered so we know what is \ngoing to take place tonight. We would like to finish the bill in a \nreasonable period of time because energy is waiting whenever we finish. \nDoes the Senator from West Virginia have an idea how many more \namendments he might wish to offer? From the Republican side, we don't \nhave any of which I am aware.\n  Mr. BYRD. I cannot state the number of amendments I have. They are \nnot a great number, I can say that. I am mainly interested in having a \nlittle debate on this bill, and mainly interested in getting some \nanswers from the proponents as to the costs that are involved. I may \nsupport this bill. I have no reason to think I won't support it, if we \ncan arrive at some conclusion as to how much the restrictions and \nrequirements are going to cost.\n\n  We may pass a bill here that is, on the surface at least, a good \nbill. Certainly, there is a compelling need to do the things that this \nbill seeks to do. But as an appropriator, as the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee--and not only that, I should think that all \nSenators would be interested in knowing how much this is going to cost \nand what assurances we have that we will have the money with which to \npay it.\n  Also, I want to know whether the deadlines--and there are several \ndeadlines in the bill--can be met. If we pass legislation that cannot \nbe enforced because it has deadlines that are not enforceable, then the \nAmerican people are going to be disappointed--if we pass legislation \nraising their expectations and then those expectations are not met.\n  I do not say this with criticism of any particular Senator, but as \none who appropriates money here, and as one who sought to get \nappropriations last December for these very purposes, and as one who \nsaw that those two amendments that I offered--one on one bill and the \nsecond one on the final appropriations bill--saw those amendments \nknocked out by virtue of 60-vote points of order. Certainly the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts supported me in those.\n  I wonder, now, from where the money is going to come? I want to feel \nthat the President is going to support this, support the requests for \nit, support the moneys for it, and that Senators who voted against my \namendments last fall--that were for border security, that were for \nhomeland security, that were to provide defenses against biological, \nchemical, and radiological weapons--are going to support it this time. \nI want to know from where the money is going to come, how much it is \ngoing to cost. That is all. I am ready to pass it tonight if somebody \ncan show me those things. I do have two or three amendments that deal \nwith the deadlines. I may have a somewhat more major amendment. I may \nnot have.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, I have conferred \nwith the manager of the bill, Senator Kennedy. As I indicated, we have \nno amendments on the Republican side and none over here. The reason we \nare focusing on the Senator from West Virginia is we want to be able to \nget to energy as soon as possible. So I hope, either through a quorum \ncall--maybe with time for Senator Kennedy to explain to the Senator--I \nknow I listened to Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein speak at some \nlength on this legislation.\n  If there are other questions to be answered, certainly the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is entitled to have answers to those questions \nbefore we vote on this important bill. Whatever the two very \nexperienced and distinguished Senators need to do to make sure the \nSenator from West Virginia has the information he needs, we should do \nthat as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to review very quickly, since we \nhave been asked about this once again, for the costs. That $1.2 billion \n1-year, $3.2 billion total cost of the implementation--the $743 million \nis included in the President's 2003 budget. This includes $380 million \nfor entry-exit data systems; $83 million for computer infrastructure; \n$34 million for land inspectors; $51 million for air and sea port \ninspectors; $145 million for border construction; $50 million for \ndetention construction. There is $444 million additional appropriations \nneeded but the legislation raises the additional fees.\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nThe bill raises machine-readable fees to $65, generating approximately \n$100 million in additional income.\n\n  We believe we can examine the fiscal year 2003 budget, which is, for \nINS, $6 billion--$6 billion: $2 billion in terms of the fees and $4 \nbillion in terms of appropriations. That is the best we can do.\n  But I think we have a pretty good downpayment on what we would do. We \nare prepared, as my colleagues have all said, to make that commitment, \nto try to ensure, in the remaining debate, that we would be able to get \nthe resources.\n  On the question of the border security amendments, we welcome the \nchance to talk with the Senator--or with any other Senator--and review \nthe deadlines and the other damage provisions in the bill to tighten up \nthe restrictions. They include the changes in the passenger manifest \nprovision and student monitoring provisions. I think we ought to be \nable to reach the agreements.\n  But we have set some times and some dates. We are talking about, for \nexample, in the biometric implementation, trying to make passports and \nother documents so they are not subject to fraud. We now have the \nbiometric information, but decisions have to be made as to which one \noffers the best possibility. We have the technology, then, to develop \nthe machines to put them at the border. That takes some time. If we are \ntalking about a year from this October--if is not the right time, the \ncorrect time, we want it to be done as quick as possible.\n  But what we have included in here represents, at least the best \njudgment of the Homeland Security Office; the Biometric Institute; and \nthe NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Trade, which is the \ntechnology arm of the Commerce Department that makes the judgments, for \nexample, in the small business innovative research, about all the new \nkinds of technologies. If there is other information that would support \na different timeframe, we are prepared to do this, but I think we have \nreached that date for the reasons I have explained.\n  I will mention, on the question of the students, how we monitor the \nstudents when they come in here, because I think it is very important \nto understand exactly what we are doing on this. First of all, when the \nstudents come in, the State Department receives the first electronic \nevidence of acceptance from an approved U.S. institution, prior to \nissuing a student visa. The State Department then must inform the INS \nthat the visa has been approved. The INS must inform the approved \ninstitution that the student has been admitted into the country. Then \nthe approved institution notifies the INS when the student has \nregistered and enrolled; and if the student doesn't report for classes, \nthe school must notify the INS not later than 30 days after the \ndeadline for the registration for classes.\n  You can say that is complicated and difficult. It is. Unless you go \nto the new technology, it is impossible. But we have been assured, with \nthe new technology, that kind of process is possible.\n  We have been informed by the universities that they believe it is \nworkable. Maybe there is a different way of doing this. There are \ndifferent timeframes for notification. But those are the ones we have \nworked out with the various groups and institutions that are most \ninvolved in this.\n  As I say, we are glad to go down the list of the timeframes. I know \nmy colleagues and I are glad to go down the list to at least give the \njustification. We have not arrived at these particular dates in a \nuniform way. There was some difference in terms of the time--whether it \ncan be done in 180 days, or whether it can be done in a shorter period \nof time. There was some difference on that. I think there was no \ndifference on the desire for all of us to get it done in the quickest \npossible time and to do it in the quickest possible responsible time. \nThat is uniform. If there can be a change or an alteration in the \nestablishment of the number of days, we are glad to talk about it. \nThere is no magic on the times we set, although they do represent the \nagreement with our colleagues, and also with the administration I \nbelieve that had some difference as well. Those are just some of the \nresponses.\n  If I could have the attention of my colleague from West Virginia, if \nwe could know what the other amendments are as we are coming into the \nevening on Monday, we would be able to sort of have a chance to fully \nevaluate them in order to be able to accept the ones that work \nconsistent with our legislation; we could try to work those out. Then \nwe would be glad to have a good discussion and debate on the floor. \nBut, as the Senator indicated to us, he has several other amendments. \nHe just withdrew one, which we didn't have. We have no idea what the \nother ones are, either. We are doing the best we can. We were here on \nFriday afternoon. We had a good hearing on Friday morning with the \nSenator.\n  But we are here and we are prepared to try to deal with those. We \nwill have a chance to examine this one on forced labor in China, which \nwe did not know was going to be an amendment. If the Senator has others \nthat he is willing to share with us, perhaps we can move this process \nalong to try to accommodate our other colleagues.\n  I was here over the weekend. I plan to be here. I know my colleagues \nwere as well. We are just trying to indicate to our colleagues what our \nsituation is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the distinguished Senator, \nthis Senator is willing to share any of these amendments with the \nSenator. I have already shared with the Senator the amendment which I \nasked to withdraw. I was under the mistaken impression that my staff \nhad discussed this with his staff. I am not seeking to pull any tricks \nhere. As was said in Julius Caesar, there are no tricks in pure and \nsimple faith. I don't have any tricks. I am not seeking to pull any \nfast ones on the Senator. I would be glad to show any of my amendments \nto him. I have but a few amendments. It was an honest mistake, and I \nwas quick to apologize for it when he mentioned it. I hope that settles \nthat. There are no more like that. I would be happy to discuss with the \nSenator the amendments that I have. That pretty much settles it. I \ncan't say that we can do these tonight. I don't think they can be done \ntonight.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine. We had the chance to look over this first \none. If we could have the other ones, if the Senator wants to share \nthose, we would welcome the opportunity to see them. But we have not \nreceived any others from the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I spoke in my speech about the problems that \nI have. The amendments I have deal with those deadlines. There was one \nother amendment that I am not sure I am going to offer, but I do need \nto discuss it with him. It has to do with the Office of Homeland \nSecurity. But I am not sure I will offer it on this bill. I may offer \nit on an appropriations bill, or I may not offer it at all, depending \non how the leader feels about it and how Senator Lieberman feels about \nit. But it can be determined overnight as to whether or not I intend to \noffer that. The other amendments deal, as I recall, with visa waiver \ndeadlines, student penalties, and so on. I discussed the amendment in \nmy statement earlier. I would be happy to discuss these with the \nSenator, or through my staff. On tomorrow, we can probably deal with \nthem, if we can't deal with them tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if it would be helpful to the Senator from \nWest Virginia, I would be happy to address the deadline issue that he \ndiscussed. The Senator from West Virginia raises a good question with \nrespect to those deadlines. Frankly, on two of the three, there is no \ngood answer. The Senator is absolutely correct about that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I didn't understand the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry. It was my understanding that the Senator from \nWest Virginia raised a question about three of the deadlines in the \nbill, and on two of the three there is no good answer. I will give the \nbest answer I can.\n  On the first one, I think there is a good answer. That has to do with \nthe so-called standards for biometrics. On that, there seems to be a \npretty good consensus. That can be developed within the year timeframe \nthat we have in the bill. The Biometric Foundation has provided that \ninformation to us.\n  But the Senator is absolutely correct about the readers--the \nmachines--that\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\nwill have to read the passports or other documents that have this data \nembedded in them.\n  As to precisely how long it will take to get those online, there is \nnot a good specific answer, nor is there an answer as to when we can \nhave the interoperable system developed, which is one of the central \nfeatures of the bill. That is the system that takes data from the FBI, \nthe CIA, and others and makes it available to the consular offices that \nhave to issue the visas.\n  In fact, I was just speaking with the FBI Director this afternoon \nabout what we can do to make this happen as quickly as possible. As \nSenator Kennedy said, everybody wants to make it happen as soon as \npossible. The question is how to do that. I will share with the Senator \nfrom West Virginia some of thinking that went into our putting in those \ndates. If the Senator has other ideas, we can certainly discuss them. I \nregret to say that there has been an attitude among some people at the \nINS that perhaps it has not been--to use the military phrase--as \nforward leading as some of us would like to see in terms of their \nwillingness to tackle some of these problems. I am trying to say it \nnicely. There are a lot of people who work at INS who really work hard, \nand they are trying to do things on time. But I must say that there \nhasn't necessarily been the so-called can-do attitude that some of us \nwould like to see. When we asked them can you do this, or could you do \nthat, what you get back in response is that may take a long time. That \nis going to be really hard.\n  Naturally, we would like to see them take the bull by the horns and \nsay, We will do our best to get that done as quickly as we can. That is \nthe answer we are looking for. We don't necessarily get that.\n  Frankly, what went into some of our thinking in putting some of these \ndeadlines in--they may be pretty tough deadlines to meet--was let us \nget those deadlines in there so the people at INS are going to have to \nwork hard to try to meet the deadlines. They know that we mean business \nand we are trying to get this done as soon as we can. They may not be \nable to meet the interoperable system deadline or the readers deadline, \nboth of which are October 26, 2003.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Our thinking in putting those deadlines in was to try to \ngive them something to shoot for so we could at least get them going to \ntry to get it done as soon as possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what suggestion does the distinguished \nSenator have as to how we might deal with this problem that I \nreferenced?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator partially answered that question \nin previous comments he made. The first is to put a deadline in there \nthat they have to shoot for rather than just, in effect, saying, \n``well, whenever you can,'' because that will probably result in delay. \nSecond, we have to fund the programs adequately. The Senator from West \nVirginia made the point at a hearing we had the other day--he made the \npoint earlier, and he made the point again today, and the Senator from \nWest Virginia is absolutely correct--that we have an obligation, as the \nSenate then, to fund this to the extent that will be necessary.\n\n  We think we have the elements of that built in here, but that will be \nthe other half of what has to be done.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further?\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly will continue to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, it has been said on the floor, more than once today, \nthat the anticipated cost of the bill, as I understand it, would be \nabout $1.1 billion the first year and $3----\n  Mr. KYL. About $3.2 billion.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is $3.2 billion for 3 years.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could, Mr. President, specifically, $3.132 billion. But \nalmost $3.2 billion, yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. And it has also been said that the President asked for $743 \nmillion, is that it? Is that the figure?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, Mr. President, the Senator is exactly correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, my problem is, if you multiply the $743 million by 3, \nthat is going to be roughly $2.1 billion. And yet the figure that has \nbeen used on this floor for the third year is $3.1 billion. So right \nthere we are $1 billion short.\n  So my question is, How do we bridge these gaps? How do we assure the \nSenate today that we will be able to appropriate that kind of money? \nAnd if we do not appropriate that money, these deadlines are not going \nto be met, I don't believe.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could respond briefly on this, Senator Kennedy \nand I have the subcommittee with the primary jurisdiction on this. As \nto the figures being put forward, one is the first-year cost and the \nother is the total cost of implementation. Much of the cost involved \nhere is for equipment because we are getting the biometric equipment \nup. We are getting it in position, in place, and that is why there is \nthe difference in the figure. It is not an even figure over each of the \n3 years. That is what is involved in that question that you raise.\n  If I could also respond on the deadline dates because I think the \nSenator from West Virginia has put his finger on a very important \ntopic. This was a matter of extensive negotiation between the various \npeople involved because these are very aggressive dates. A number of \npeople in the administration raised the concern saying: This is too \naggressive. We don't think we can meet this. Other people within the \nadministration were saying: It may be too aggressive, but we need to \nmeet it, and we are going to push to meet it. There were differences of \nopinion on that.\n  We, as the Members who were negotiating and trying to work this out, \ndecided to go with the earlier date because of the importance of the \nissue. It is just critical we get this interoperable equipment in \nplace, and that we get it done as quickly as possible, and not be left \nin a calendar position further down the road than it needs to be or \njust open-ended, saying, ``just do it as soon as you can.'' A number of \nthe Members did not feel comfortable with that ``do it as soon as you \ncan'' possibility, even though we thought there was a pretty strong \ncommitment from the administration to do it just that way, to do it as \nsoon as you can.\n  But a lot of our colleagues said: No. We want a hard date, an \naggressive date. If we have to come back and work with it again, we \nwill, but we want this thing done; and we want it done now.\n  That is why the aggressive dates, and that is also why the budgetary \nfigures are different for year 1 than being equal throughout the 3 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the main point is, on the question of the \ndeadlines, the Senator from West Virginia raises an absolutely valid \npoint. The question is, What should we do with regard to two of the \ndates? I think we can pretty clearly meet the first one. And we have a \nchoice of setting a later date and, therefore, maybe not spurring them \nto action within a timeframe that really we need to, or setting a more \naggressive date which, of course, we can always extend if we are not \nable to meet it.\n  But there is one other point; that is, the Senator is also correct, \nwe are going to have to get another request from the administration in \nthe final year in the administration's budget to adequately support \nthis. Having the earlier date focuses, then, on getting that money in \ntheir budget, so the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has the \nability to then plan and incorporate that into the overall budget.\n  So that is part of the rationale. It is nothing more magic than that.\n  If the Senator agrees with us--and I think he does--that it is \nimportant for us to get going as soon as possible, then perhaps he can \naccept that rationale, at least for this first year, and then we can, \nof course, see what happens after that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I certainly can understand what the distinguished Senator \nis saying and the reasoning behind the decisions that were made. I am \nonly saying, as I said at the very beginning, if we pass legislation \nthat creates unreasonable expectations on the part of the American \npeople, we lose credibility, our Government loses credibility, and the \npeople lose faith in their\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\nGovernment. That is what Hamilton was worrying about in the Federalist \nPaper No. 25, which I read earlier this afternoon.\n  But now about this money that I talked about, it has been said here \nthere is $743 million in the President's request. But we are talking \nabout 3 years--3 years; that if it were $743 million a year, that would \nbe something like $2.1 or some such billion. Yet the estimated cost for \nthe third year here, as I am told, as I am hearing here, is $3.1 or \n$3.2 billion. So it seems to me that is $1 billion short there.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond to the Senator, the $3.2 billion is the \nestimated total cost over the 3-year period of time. And as Senator \nBrownback said, the request would not come in three equal tranches. So \nyou would not multiply $743 million times 3. The administration would \nhave to include in its next budget an amount of money to make up the \ndifference.\n  Now, there is, we are informed, $327 million not yet expended from \nthe $40 billion supplemental, some or all of which might be made \navailable in the first year, which comes close to meeting the $1 \nbillion amount. But the Senator from West Virginia is correct, there \nwill have to be an amount included in the budget in the subsequent year \nto reach the $3.2 billion. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not have any assurance that money is going to be \nincluded. We do not have any assurance it will be. The President only \nrequested $37 million, I believe it was, in his supplemental, out of \n$27 billion; $35 million for border security--I mean, for the INS. So \nthere we are.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond to that, to some extent, it is a chicken-\nand-egg proposition. You have to have an authorization before you can \nhave an appropriation. And the administration merely has the benefit of \nboth. It can put something in the budget which then encourages us to do \nan authorization or it can respond to an authorization which the \nCongress passes.\n  The intent here, since we have been working with the administration, \nis for the Congress to authorize a program which the administration \nthen is supposed to carry out, and that would include an inclusion in \nthe next budget of an amount of money sufficient to fund the \nauthorization that we provide.\n  Then the chairman of the Appropriations Committee would have the \njurisdiction to determine how much of that to fund in the \nappropriations request.\n  But the idea here is to authorize the program, which gives direction \nto the administration as to what we want it to do. Hopefully, that \ndirection would be then to include that money in the budget. I \ncertainly would be encouraging them to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am sure the Senator would.\n  If I may, Mr. President, just take a further minute.\n  For fiscal year 2003, the President has proposed increasing \nnondefense programs by only 1 percent. He has threatened to veto \nappropriations bills that have ``excessive spending.'' For the INS, he \nhas proposed an increase of only $150 million or about a 2-percent \nincrease.\n  That is not even enough to cover inflation. So if we must do more for \nthe INS, what are we supposed to cut? What are we going to cut if we do \nmore than that for the INS? Veterans programs? Are we going to cut \nveterans programs? Are we going to cut education programs, highways, \nprograms to promote our energy independence, programs dealing with the \nenvironment? What do we cut? If we don't do that, we run afoul of the \nPresident's threat to veto appropriations bills.\n  I thank all Senators for listening. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from West Virginia, \nis it correct that it was not only defense but homeland security that \nis above and beyond the 1 percent; and if that is the case, then could \nnot this money be included within the homeland security part of the \nbudget?\n  I am not certain, but I believe the 1 percent does not include the \nhomeland security requirements.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct, but if we do more for homeland \ndefense, then we are restricted by the President's figures, what he has \nasked. Then we have to take the money out of something else. So what \ndoes it come out of? Veterans programs, education, the environment, \nenergy? That is our dilemma. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about a rally which was held this afternoon on the west side of \nthe Capitol, a pro-Israel rally. Some estimated the gathering at \n100,000. I believe the group was substantially larger than 100,000. \nThere were many people of all denominations represented--all colors, \ncreeds, and racial diversity.\n  The purpose of the rally was to support Israel's right of self-\ndefense. The gathering was attended by many luminaries. I had not seen \nso many people wait so long to speak so briefly at any time that I \ncould recall.\n  I stood, as a matter of fact, with Governor Pataki. We waited an hour \nand a half in the blistering sun to make our presentations.\n  The spirit of the gathering was very emotional, very strong. The \nessential issue at hand was Israel's right of self-defense.\n  In the brief remarks that I made, I emphasized the basic point that \nthe suicide bombers who are plaguing Israel today are identical with \nthe suicide bombers who attacked the United States on September 11. The \nonly difference was that the suicide bombers who attacked the United \nStates were more sophisticated. They hijacked planes and they crashed \nthem into the World Trade Center towers. One of the planes was, I \nthink, headed for this very building, the Capitol, which went down in \nSomerset County, PA, my home State. It was speculative, to some extent, \nas to where it was headed, but many indicators say it was headed for \nthe Capitol. The plane which struck the Pentagon, by many indicators, \nwas headed for the White House.\n  The people of the United States were outraged by that terrorist \nattack, just as the people of Israel are outraged by the suicide \nbombers that have attacked civilian populations. The United States \nresponded, as is well-known, by mounting a powerful military offense, \nwhich went to Afghanistan and crushed the Taliban and al-Qaida in a \nmatter of a few weeks--an undertaking that the Soviets could not \naccomplish in 10 years and the Brits could not accomplish many years \nbefore. Just as we\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\nwould not expect anybody to question our right to go after the al-Qaida \nterrorists who killed thousands of innocent American civilians, that \nwas the theme today in raising Israel's right of self-defense.\n  President Bush has said that there will not be any daylight between \nthe United States and Israel and he has been a strong supporter of \nIsrael. I applaud his decision to send Secretary of State Colin Powell \nto the Mideast. It is a very difficult assignment that the Secretary of \nState now has. It is my hope there may be some moderate Arab leaders \nwho will come forward to be able to have meaningful negotiations. \nPresident Mubarak of Egypt has, for over the past two decades, been a \ntower of strength. Of course, he has been the recipient of \napproximately $2 billion a year for more than the past two decades, \ntotaling close to $50 billion at this point.\n  On a recent trip I made to the Mideast, I had the opportunity to \nvisit with King Abdullah of Jordan, a vibrant young man in his late \nthirties, who is taking over the mantle of his father, King Hussein, \nand is ready, willing, and able to be a voice of reason in the Mideast. \nI also met with the King of Morocco, who is also in his late thirties. \nHe also has promise. So there is a new generation of leadership in the \nMideast.\n  When I was in the Mideast on Tuesday, March 26, I had an opportunity \nto be briefed by General Anthony Zinni, our chief negotiator there, and \nthen had an opportunity to meet with Israel's Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon. Late that evening, I traveled to Ramallah to meet with Yasser \nArafat. I carried forward the administration's message, and that is for \nArafat to make a clear, unequivocal statement in Arabic to stop the \nsuicide bombers. As usual, Chairman Arafat said he would. Of course, \nagain, as usual, nothing has ever been done by him.\n  Then the next day, Wednesday, March 27, there was the suicide bombing \nat the Passover seder in Netanya. Hundreds were wounded and 27 people \nwere killed. It had been my hope that the Saudi peace plan would come \nto some fruition if the Saudis would stand up. I was really chagrined \nto see Saudi Arabia have a telethon for Palestinians and gather some \n$92 million. The thought on my mind was: When was Saudi Arabia going to \nhave a telethon to raise money for the families of the thousands of \nvictims who perished on September 11 in a terrorist attack, with 19 \nterrorists, 15 of whom came from Saudi Arabia?\n  So in the midst of these very difficult times, this was a large \ngathering assembled at the west end of the Capitol--a larger group than \ncustomarily meets for the inauguration of the American President. Here, \nthe crowd went beyond the statue on horseback. The crowd was on all \nsides. It was very emotional, and a very enthusiastic showing of \nsupport for Israel.\n  I thought it might be useful, in the absence of any other Senator, to \nmake this brief report for those who may not have captured it on C-SPAN \nearlier, to get some of the flavor of the passion, emotion, and \ndetermination of this cavalry of more than 100,0000 people.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, apparently, there are people who believe \nthat we are cynical in raising the question of the rights of the \nsteelworkers and coal workers to their medical costs, and some attempt \nto find a cash stream that will help in making the transition for the \nsteel industry as it is consolidated.\n  I want the Senate to know that the motivation for thinking about \nsteel and the steelworkers came from the provisions in the House bill \nH.R. 4, that contains ANWR, that allocated a portion of the bid moneys \nfrom the opening of ANWR to some conservation objectives. We looked at \nthis problem and decided there were some moneys that could be used and \nwhat should be used as far as stimulating the future of our own State.\n  The Alaska gas pipeline is the real focal point of our future \ndevelopment. ANWR is an addition--that is, the drilling in the 1002 \narea on the Arctic coast, that million and a half acres there--and is \nthe immediate objective. But the long-term objective is to find a way \nto transport the natural gas that has been reinjected into the ground \nsince 1968.\n  As oil was produced in the Arctic, the natural gas was separated and \nit was reinjected into the ground. We know there is in excess of 50 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas there--maybe 75 trillion cubic feet of gas. \nBut the point is, as one who is interested in national security, I \nbelieve there are three major industries in this country of great \nconcern to us in time of national problems of a military nature or \nsecurity nature. One is agriculture; the second is oil; and then there \nis steel. When we look at the steel industry, it is the real backbone \nof our manufacturing infrastructure. But it has huge challenges right \nnow, including dumping from overseas producers, and high internal costs \nhave caused bankruptcies. Over 30 steel companies in this country have \nentered bankruptcy since the year 2000. That has impacted 60,000 \nworkers. These 30-plus companies represent more than 21 percent of the \ndomestic steel-producing industry.\n  In 1980, there were more than 500,000 U.S. steelworkers. By 2000, the \nnumber of steelworkers fell to 224,000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics \nestimates that this number will fall to 176,000 by the end of this \ndecade. That would be a 22-percent reduction in steel-related jobs. \nDomestic steel shipments were down 14 percent in the first quarter of \n2001. In the last 3 years alone, 23,000 steel jobs have been lost. \nThose who remain employed in the industry help pay for a portion of the \n6,000 retirees and their benefits. Those benefits represent a promise \nthat was made to previous workers for their contribution to building \nAmerica's military-civilian infrastructure.\n  Our steel industry must undergo consolidation now, but it can only \ntake place if the existing cost structures are addressed. That \nprimarily means taking care of the health care costs for retirees. \nFailure to address that issue will not only impact retirees, it \nthreatens current workers who are faced with the prospect of more mill \nclosings and more lost jobs.\n  Forty-seven percent of the steelworkers are unemployed in \nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Forty-five percent of the steel jobs \nrelate directly to production. Consolidation is an absolute must if we \nare to protect those jobs and failure to address this issue impacts \nsteel States.\n  Why should I be interested in steel? One is defense, as I said. Steel \nis required to build tanks, fighters, transport planes, helicopters, \nships, missiles, and other military items.\n  During hearings in the House and Senate last month, Robert Miller, \nchairman and CEO of Bethlehem Steel, testified on the problems of the \nsteel industry. He told Senators integrated producers provide the \nhighest quality steel for steel applications.\n  Bethlehem Steel is the only domestic company with the capacity to \nprovide the special steel plate that was required to repair the U.S.S. \nCole. Unfortunately, Bethlehem Steel is currently in chapter 11, about \nready to go into chapter 7 bankruptcy. What are we going to do for \nsales for our military ships if we lose our own domestic steel \nproduction?\n  Our interest is in the gas pipeline. Alaska's natural gas pipeline \nwill be over 3,000 miles long, almost as long as the Great Wall of \nChina. It will be the most expensive project financed by private \ncapital in the history of man. It will be totally privately financed.\n  The gas pipeline requires over 3,000 miles of 52-inch pipe that \ncannot be made in the United States at the present time. It requires an \nadditional 2,000 miles of gathering pipelines and production \nfacilities. It will take 5.2 million tons of steel. It will take $3 \nbillion to $5 billion in steel orders. That cannot be done by the \nUnited States steel industry today. They cannot even hope to \nparticipate in the building of that pipeline. They will not participate \nunless the issue of the health care costs for retired employees is \nsettled.\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\n  Just this morning I had a notice from a friend of mine who told me \nthis:\n\n       Presently, there are only two steel mills in the world that \n     are capable of delivering the pipe needed for our pipeline as \n     it is presently designed. The design will require one-half of \n     the world's capability to produce pipe during the period of \n     its construction. If the producers start work on the project \n     this year, it would take until 2010 or 2011 for gas to \n     actually reach the U.S. market. There are over 18 months of \n     work required to complete enough of the design and permitting \n     prior to ordering the pipe. For orders placed in 2003, the \n     pipe materials would be delivered in the year 2007.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

O'BRIEN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina and \nthe Senator from Alaska for their courtesies. I appreciate this \nopportunity to speak on behalf of the circuit court judge who we will \nbe voting on at 5:30 p.m.\n  I am so pleased we are having this vote. I have known Terry O'Brien \nboth personally and professionally for over 22 years. I am proud of my \nassociation and friendship with him. It is not often that we get to \nvote on a close friend in this body.\n  In a few minutes, I and my colleagues will have the opportunity to \nvote to confirm Terry O'Brien to serve on the Tenth Circuit. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee recognized that Terry is highly qualified to serve \nin this position when it unanimously voted him out of committee. While \nthe committee members had an opportunity to review Terry's \naccomplishments and get to know him during his hearing, I would like to \nshare some information about Terry with the rest of my colleagues.\n  After Terry served as a captain in the U.S. Army and worked as an \nattorney at the Division of Land and Natural Resource in the Department \nof Justice, he came back to Wyoming to practice law in Buffalo at the \nlaw firm of Omohundro & O'Brien. Then in 1980, he was appointed to be a \ndistrict judge for the Sixth Judicial District in Wyoming located in \nGillette, WY. As a result, he moved to Gillette where he remained for \n22 years.\n  Terry continued to be our judge until he retired from that position 2 \nyears ago. As mayor of Gillette, I had an opportunity to observe what \nthe local district judge just down the street from my business was \ndoing in the community. Believe me, those who came before him let me \nknow what they thought, too. What I saw and people observed is that \nTerry had a no-nonsense, fair approach to the law and to the parties \ninvolved. He made his decisions based squarely on the law, the facts, \nand careful consideration, and he explained his reasons for what he was \ndoing. Even if you were the party or the attorney who lost, you always \nknew where he stood because he took the time to be certain to explain \nhis reasoning and rationale to you.\n\n  My other observation is that Terry ran his court effectively, \nprofessionally, and efficiently. He never wasted anyone else's time nor \nlet any of the parties or their attorneys waste each other's time, \neither.\n  As to his decisions, they are not full of legal jargon or unnecessary \nwords. Instead, he explains the law so everyone can understand it. To \nme, this makes him a very good judge and an exceptional writer.\n  On a personal level, we have known each other over 22 years. We were \nin the same community for that time and watched each other's children \ngrow up. Terry always cared about our community and made many \ncontributions to it. One notable contribution is the 13 years he served \nas the president and a member of the board of directors of the Campbell \nCounty Health Care Foundation.\n  But the most important thing I want to stress is the fact that I have \ngotten to know Terry both professionally and personally. I can give my \npersonal assurance that our country will benefit from his many talents. \nI am confident he will be a stellar judge for the Tenth Circuit Court, \nand I am proud to make this recommendation to my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  He began his service to our country as a captain in the U.S. Army, \nand I hope you will help him to continue his service as a U.S. Tenth \nCircuit Court judge.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity to talk about my friend, Terry \nO'Brien.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I know we are close to the voting time. I \nrecommend to all of my friends in the Senate that we approve Judge \nO'Brien. Certainly, no one has been as qualified, as my colleague \npointed out.\n  In the appointment process, we had a committee sort through the judge \nprospects in our State, and they came up with Judge O'Brien as the \njudge they thought would be best qualified. I thank the committee for \nmoving this matter along.\n  He is one of the few circuit judges who has been approved, and we \ncertainly look forward to his approval by the full Senate.\n  Again, I recommend him without any question to be a circuit court \njudge in the Tenth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I repeat for emphasis that we have the \nPresident of Finland in our midst today. She will be here to meet the \nSenators as they come in to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

O'BRIEN, OF WYOMING, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will go into Executive session and \nproceed to the consideration of the nomination of Terrence L. O'Brien, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Terrence L. O'Brien, of \nWyoming, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is voting on the 43rd \njudicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reorganized after the Senate majority changed. With \ntoday's vote on Judge Terrence O'Brien to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit, the Senate will confirm its eighth \ncircuit court judge in little more than 9 months, since I became \nchairman this past summer.\n  The Senate is making progress on judicial confirmations. Under \nDemocratic leadership, the Senate has confirmed more judges in the last \n9 months than were confirmed in 4 out of 6 full years under Republican \nleadership. The number of judicial confirmations over these past 9 \nmonths--43 exceeds the number confirmed during all 12 months of 2000, \n1999, 1997 and 1996.\n  During the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years in which a Republican majority most \nrecently controlled the pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate, \n248 judges were confirmed.\n  Some like to talk about the 377 judges confirmed during the Clinton \nadministration, but forget to mention that more than one-third were \nconfirmed during the first 2 years of the\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nClinton administration while the Senate majority was Democratic and \nSenator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee. The pace of \nconfirmations under a Republican majority was markedly slower, \nespecially in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000.\n  Thus, during the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, \njudicial confirmations averaged 38 per year--a pace of consideration \nand confirmation that we have already exceeded under Democratic \nleadership over these past 9 months, in spite of all of the challenges \nfacing Congress and the Nation during this period, and all of the \nobstacles Republicans have placed in our path.\n  I ask myself how Republicans can justify seeking to hold the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate to a different standard than the one \nthey met themselves during the last 6\\1/2\\ years. There simply is no \nanswer other than partisanship. This double standard is most apparent \nwhen Republicans refuse to compare fairly the progress we are making \nwith the period in which they were in the Senate majority with a \nPresident of the other party.\n  They do not want to talk about that because we have exceeded, in just \n9 months, the average number of judges they confirmed per year.\n  They would rather unfairly compare the work of the Senate on \nconfirmations in the past 9 months to 2 years of work of previous \nSenates and Presidents. They say it is unfair that the Democratic-led \nSenate has not yet confirmed as many judges in 9 months as were \nconfirmed in 24-month-periods at other times. I would say it is quite \nunfair to complain that we have not done 24 months of work on judicial \nvacancies in the 9 months we have had since the Senate reorganized.\n  These double standards and different standards are just plain wrong \nand unfair, but that does not seem to matter to Republican's intent on \ncriticizing and belittling every achievement of the Senate under a \nDemocratic majority.\n  Republicans have been imposing a double standard on circuit court \nvacancies as well. The Republican attack is based on the unfounded \nnotion that the Senate has not kept up with attrition on the Courts of \nAppeals. Well, the Democratic majority in the Senate has more than kept \nup with attrition and we are seeking to close the vacancies gap on the \nCourts of Appeals that more than doubled under the Republican majority.\n  The Republican majority assumed control of judicial confirmation in \nJanuary 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be \nreorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, \n2001. During that period from 1995 through July 2001, vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals increased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.\n  When I became chairman of a committee to which Members were finally \nassigned on July 10, we began with 33 Court of Appeals vacancies. That \nis what I inherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, five \nadditional vacancies have arisen on the Courts of Appeals around the \ncountry. Prior to today's vote on Judge O'Brien, the 7 circuit judges \nconfirmed had reduced the number of circuit vacancies to 31. With \ntoday's confirmation, there will be 30 vacancies.\n  Rather than the 38 vacancies that would exist if we were making no \nprogress, as some have asserted, there are now 30 vacancies, that is \nmore than keeping up with the attrition on the circuit courts. Since \nour Republican critics are so fond of using percentages, I will say \nthat we will have now reduced the vacancies on the Courts of Appeals by \nalmost 10 percent in the last 9 months.\n  While the Republicans' Senate majority increased vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic \nmajority 9 months to reverse that trend, keep up with extraordinary \nturnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies by almost 10 \npercent.\n  Alternatively, Republicans should note that since the shift in \nmajority away from them, the Senate has filled more than 20 percent of \nthe vacancies on the Courts of Appeals in a little over 9 months. This \nis progress.\n  Rather than having the circuit court vacancy numbers skyrocketing, as \nthey did overall during the prior 6\\1/2\\ years more than doubling from \n16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has reversed that trend and the \nvacancy rate is moving in the right direction, down.\n  It is not possible to repair the damage caused by longstanding \nvacancies in several circuits overnight, but we are improving the \nconditions in the 5th, 10th and 8th Circuit, in particular. Judge \nO'Brien will be the second judge confirmed to the 10th Circuit in the \nlast 4 months.\n  With today's vote on Judge O'Brien, in a little more than 9 months \nsince the change in majority, the Senate has confirmed eight judges to \nthe Courts of Appeals and held hearings on three others. In contrast, \nthe Republican-controlled majority averaged only seven confirmations to \nthe Courts of Appeal per year. Seven.\n  In the last 9 months, the Senate has now confirmed as many Court of \nAppeals judges as were confirmed in all of 2000 and more than were \nconfirmed in all of 1997 or 1999. It is eight more than the zero \nconfirmed in all of 1996.\n  We have confirmed eight circuit court judges and there are almost 3 \nmonths left until the 1-year anniversary of the reorganization of the \nSenate and the Judiciary Committee and we have already exceeded the \nannual number of Court of Appeals judges confirmed by our predecessors.\n  Overall, in little more than 9 months, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhas held 16 hearings involving 55 judicial nominations. That is more \nhearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any year of its \ncontrol of the Senate. In contrast, one-sixth of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees--more than 50--never got a committee hearing and \ncommittee vote from the Republican majority, which perpetuated \nlongstanding vacancies into this year.\n  Vacancies continue to exist on the Courts of Appeals in part because \na Republican majority was not willing to hold hearings or vote on more \nthan half--56 percent--of President Clinton's Court of Appeals nominees \nin 1999 and 2000 and was not willing to confirm a single judge to the \nCourts of Appeals during the entire 1996 session.\n  Despite the newfound concern from across the aisle about the number \nof vacancies on the circuit courts, no nominations hearings were held \nwhile the Republicans controlled the Senate in the 107th Congress last \nyear. No judges were confirmed during that time from among the many \nqualified circuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, \n2001, or from among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, \n2001.\n  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of \ncircuit and district vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the \nSenate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the \nfirst hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization of the Senate and held that hearing on the day after the \ncommittee was assigned new members.\n  That initial hearing included a Court of Appeals nominee on whom the \nRepublican majority had refused to hold a hearing the year before. We \nheld unprecedented hearings for judicial nominees during the August \nrecess. Those hearings included a Court of Appeals nominee who had been \na Republican staff member of the Senate. We proceeded with a hearing \nthe day after the first anthrax letter arrived at the Senate. That \nhearing included a Court of Appeals nominee.\n  In a little more than 9 tumultuous months, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has held 16 hearings involving 55 judicial nominations \nincluding 11 circuit court nominees and we are hoping to hold another \nhearing soon for half a dozen more nominees, including another Court of \nAppeals nominee. That is more hearings on judges than the Republican \nmajority held in any year of its control of the Senate. The Republican \nmajority never held 16 judicial confirmation hearings in 12 months.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on \njudicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in committee, in contrast \nto the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics \nemployed by some during the period of Republican control. The \nDemocratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the \npast to deny committee consideration of judicial nominees.\n  We have moved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\nprocess from 1996 through 2000. We have made home state Senators' blue \nslips public for the first time.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees.\n  I thanked him during those years for his efforts. I know that he \nwould have liked to have been able to do more and not have to leave so \nmany vacancies and so many nominees without action.\n  I hope and intend to continue to hold hearings and make progress on \njudicial nominees in order to further the administration of justice. In \nour efforts to address the number of vacancies on the circuit and \ndistrict courts we inherited from the Republicans, the committee has \nfocused on consensus nominees for all Senators. In order to respond to \nwhat Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a vacancy crisis, \nthe committee has focused on consensus nominees.\n  This will help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and \nobstruction by confirming as many of the President's judicial nominees \nas quickly as possible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process.\n  It is a critical part of the checks and balances of our system of \ngovernment that does not give the power to make lifetime appointments \nto one person alone to remake the courts along narrow ideological \nlines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the \nmainstream of legal thought, whose decisions would further divide our \nNation.\n  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senators Grassley, Lott, \nSpecter, Enzi and Smith of New Hampshire five Republican Senators who \neach sought a prompt hearing on a Court of Appeals nominee who was not \namong those initially sent to the Senate in May, 2001.\n  In contrast to past practices, we are moving expeditiously to \nconsider and confirm Judge O'Brien, who was nominated in September, \n2001. The committee did not receive his ABA peer review until the end \nof October. He participated in a hearing in March, was reported by the \ncommittee on April 11th and is today being confirmed.\n  Judge O'Brien comes to the Senate highly recommended by friends and \ncolleagues. I was pleased to have him participate in a confirmation \nhearing at the request of Senator Enzi. Judge O'Brien has more than 20 \nyears of experience as a State court judge, has served on his home \nstate's judicial ethics commission, and has a record of community \nservice with organizations such as the United Way and the Rotary Club. \nI congratulate his family on his confirmation to the Circuit Court.\n  I am extremely proud of the work this committee has done since the \nchange in the majority. I am proud of the way we have considered \nnominees fairly and expeditiously and the way we have been able to \nreport to the Senate so many qualified, non-ideological, consensus \nnominees to the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nSenate's confirmation of Terrence O'Brien to serve on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n  I am glad that today we have voted on Terrence O'Brien to serve the \npeople of the West in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit. I am proud to say that Judge O'Brien began his career of \npublic service in the United States Army, rising to the rank of \nCaptain.\n  I might also point out that Judge O'Brien was first appointed to the \nWyoming State bench by a Democrat Governor, once again showing that, \ndespite what Senator Democrats and their special interest groups would \nhave the American people think, President Bush is nominating diverse \nand non-partisan men and women who reflect all the American people, not \njust some.\n  I am proud of this nomination. The President has done right by the \nstates that make up the Tenth Circuit, including my state of Utah.\n  Terrence O'Brien comes to this nomination after a distinguished 20 \nyears of public service as a State district judge in Wyoming. In that \ncapacity, he has heard approximately 13,000 cases and has also managed \nto find time to serve on task forces and commissions to help develop \nthe practices and laws of Wyoming in areas which are of great interest \nto me, including the use of drug courts, child support, judicial \nethics, and split sentencing.\n  A majority of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee has \nrated Judge O'Brien ``well qualified.'' He is a distinguished former \nState court judge with decades of legal experience. He sat for 20 years \non the District Court for the Sixth Judicial District in Campbell \nCounty, WY, and on occasion by designation to the Wyoming Supreme \nCourt.\n  First appointed by merit selection to the State bench in 1980 by \nDemocrat Governor Edward Herschler (D), he was retained by the voters \nin 1982 and every 6 years thereafter until his retirement in 2000. \nJudge O'Brien is not just a distinguished jurist. He is the kind of \ncivic leader we like in my part of the country. He has been an active \nin local civic and philanthropic affairs, having served on the Wyoming \nCommunity College Commission, the Campbell County Corrections Board, \nthe Board of Directors of the United Way of Campbell County, and the \nBoard of Directors of the Campbell County Health Care Foundation.\n  This nominee is just one of the several excellent jurists nominated \nby President Bush, and I am pleased that we have confirmed him today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Terrence L. O'Brien, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit? The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Just a moment ago, the full Senate \nconfirmed Mr. O'Brien for Wyoming's vacant seat on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit by a vote of 98-0.\n  As Wyoming's senior Senator, the responsibility of forwarding \njudicial nominees to the President is a job that I take very seriously. \nI am honored to have had the opportunity to assist in the filling of \nWyoming's seat on the court. In May of 2001, Wyoming's previous judge \non the Tenth Circuit, Wade Brorby, announced his move to senior status.\n  Following that announcement, I quickly formed a selection committee \nin my home State to review qualified candidates. After an extensive \nprocess, the selection committee presented me with three candidates all \nwith exceptional backgrounds to serve on the Tenth Circuit. Terrence \nO'Brien was\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\none of the three candidates I forwarded to President Bush.\n  On August 3, 2001, President Bush formally nominated Terrence O'Brien \nto the Tenth Circuit and the President's decision reaffirmed what I \nbelieved all along--that Judge O'Brien is an outstanding selection to \nfill Wyoming's seat on the court.\n  For 20 years, 1980-2000, Mr. O'Brien served with distinction as a \nState district court judge in Wyoming. During his tenure he earned \ntremendous respect from those who argued cases before him. I cannot \nimagine a finer individual who will join other notable Wyoming jurists \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, including; Wade \nBrorby, James E. Barrett, John Jay Hickey, and John C. Pickett, who by \nthe way, was Wyoming's first judge to sit on the Court.\n  I also want to thank Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy and \nfellow ranking Republican Senator Hatch for their work in reporting Mr. \nO'Brien's nomination. While our Federal judiciary current has 95 \nvacancies, today's confirmation of Terrence O'Brien is a step in the \nright direction. I look forward to the Senate's consideration of other \narticle III U.S. Circuit and U.S. District Court judges.\n  If the mark that Terrence O'Brien left in Wyoming as a district court \njudge is any indication of his resolve and sharp judgment--our Nation \ncan expect great things from a man who's appreciation and respect for \nthe rule of law are without question. Without reservation, I know that \nMr. O'Brien will serve with honor and distinction on the Court of \nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before the distinguished visitor \nentered the Chamber, and before the vote and the statements were made \nby the Senators from Wyoming concerning their nominee, I was discussing \nproblems in relation to the Alaska natural gas pipeline.\n  I think it is something on which the Senate ought to concentrate \nbecause we are clearly going to have to have a gas pipeline to bring to \nmarket the gas which was reinjected into the ground as Prudhoe Bay oil \nwas produced. To bring that to market--50 to 70 trillion cubic feet of \ngas--we need a pipeline 3,000 miles long, gathering pipelines up to \n1,500 miles long.\n  We are now in the position where there are only two steel mills in \nthe world that are capable of delivering this steel pipe as it is \ndesigned.\n  Before the vote, I outlined the number of jobs that we have lost in \nthe steel industry and the situation with the American steel industry. \nFor this gas pipeline, we need 5.2 million tons of steel. We need $3 to \n$5 billion in steel orders. We cannot get that steel unless the U.S. \nsteel industry gets back on its feet.\n  So for that reason, I started to think about how we could use some of \nthe cashflow from the development of ANWR to start the process of the \ngas pipeline. As we examined that, we found the problem was not the \nsteel industry as much as it was the rights of those who have been \nemployed by the steel industry to have their medical care maintained. \nAnd that promise was a benefit that was agreed to many years ago for \nthe contribution these workers had made to the military and civilian \ninfrastructure of the country. It is, as I understand it, a potential \nlien against the steel industry as a whole.\n  We need to find some way to prevent these retirees from losing their \nhealth care coverage so that it will not be a lien against the assets \nof the steel industry as it tries to undergo consolidation now. The \nconsolidation must be done if we are going to have the steel necessary \nto build the Alaska pipeline to bring our gas down to somewhere in the \nMidwest.\n  I was commencing to tell the Senate about two messages that I \nreceived today from a great friend whom I think is one of the most \ncapable engineers in the oil and gas industry, particularly with regard \nto the pipelines and their design.\n  As I said, he told me there are only two steel mills in the world \nthat are currently capable of delivering this pipe. He further told me \nthat the pipe will require one-half of the world's capability to \nproduce the pipe during the period of this order.\n  If the producers restart their work on this project this year, it \nwould take until 2010 or 2011 for the gas to actually be delivered to \nour Midwest--9 years from now.\n  There is over 18 months of work required to complete the design so \nthat it would be possible to order the pipe. For orders placed in 2003, \nthe last pipe materials would be delivered to the field in 2007. That \nwould enable the gas, if everything else goes well, to start being \ndelivered in 2010, as I said.\n  Now, we have linked these issues together because of both the funding \nstandpoint and the impact on national security and because of our \nabsolute need for steel to build our gas pipeline.\n\n  Opening up the North Slope of Alaska to the drilling in what we call \nthe 1002 area will bring a cash bid in 2003 and 2005. We propose to \nmake some of that money available to initiate the process of rebuilding \nthe industry and taking the first steps to assure that the legacy fund \nof the steelworkers and the coal workers would be made whole.\n  Madam President, many people have argued with me about this. The \nHouse bill put money into the conservation account. An interesting \nthing about it is, if the amendment we have is defeated, the oil \nindustry will not proceed, the steel industry will not proceed, the \nnatural gas pipeline will not proceed, but not one of these radical \nenvironmentalists will lose their health care coverage. The American \nsteel retirees are going to be the ones who pay the price in the long \nrun.\n  I received a second message from my friend just before I came back to \nthe Chamber, and that is that 30 percent of the pipeline materials will \nneed to be delivered to the site by 2005, with the remainder to be \ndelivered in 2007, as I said. I did not realize the steel chemistry for \npipelines of this size has never been used. It will be what we call an \nX80-plus steel pipeline.\n  If the project proceeds in the first year, some of the pipe material \nneeded to be manufactured will need to be tested for weldability and \nfor fracture and burst analysis to assure the material chemistry in the \npipe is correct. The timing and cost of all of this is critical to the \npipeline project.\n  In addition to the pipeline pipe, there is a huge amount of normal \nsteel materials required for compressor stations and the largest \nprocessing plant ever to be built.\n  The Alaska natural gas pipeline should be called the ``Full \nEmployment Project for 10 Years,'' maybe 15 years. It will require \nevery person who is capable of working on such an endeavor in the \nUnited States and Canada for a period of over 8 years. It will not be \nbuilt unless we realize the preliminaries must be completed before this \npipeline can be built. It will bring down to what we call the South 48 \nthe equivalent of a million barrels of oil a day, but it will be \nnatural gas--high pressure gas pipeline, 52 inches in diameter, 1-inch \nthick.\n\n  I find it very interesting that as I talk about this subject, the \ncommentators in the newspapers and whatnot say this is just a lot of \nbaloney. These people are trying to link two subjects together. These \nare two subjects that have no individual answer. At the present time, \nwe don't have 60 votes on the amendment to allow the drilling to \ncommence in the 1002 area. We know that.\n  But the steelworkers and coal miners have no other cashflow either. \nThey can't look for another source of money to meet their needs for at \nleast 30 years. There are over 600,000 of them, and our proposal would \nstart a cashflow from this new oil brought into our market. And it is \nmoney that is payable for the bidding process and from royalties on \nthis oil that would help the steelworkers, the coal workers, and the \nindustry to reconstruct itself.\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\n  We have been criticized about this all too often. I see my good \nfriend standing here in the Chamber who might take umbrage at this. But \nduring the time I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we \nprovided $17 billion for American farmers for emergency purposes \nbecause of failures in various parts of the agricultural industry. That \nwas in addition to hundreds of billions of dollars that were spent by \nthe Department of Agriculture in the same period. What do you think \nthat money was used for? It was used to pay for the bills on the John \nDeere tractors. It was used to pay for the farmers' health insurance. \nIt was used to pay for the cost of the agricultural community to \nsurvive during bad times.\n  These are bad times for the steel industry. There is not one bit of \nsteel in my State. We have half the coal of the United States, but we \ndo not have any steel. We have raised a question of trying to find an \nanswer to the steel problem because of our own interest in the steel \nindustry in the future. If there is no steel industry in the United \nStates, we will not have an Alaska natural gas pipeline for years and \nyears.\n  I see no reason why we should be afraid to marry two subjects that, \nif the supporters of each would get together, we would succeed. The \nradical environmentalists of this country have overwhelmed the \nCongress.\n  In 1980, my State faced the problem of a proposal to withdraw 104 \nmillion acres of Alaska for Alaska national interest lands. That is \nwhat the name of the act was, the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act. In 1978, my former colleague, Senator Gravel, had \nblocked that bill in the final minutes of that session, that Congress \nthat ended in 1978.\n  By the end of 1980, we were at the place where there was a bill, but \nwe said we would not support it, could not support it, unless we had \nthe right to explore in the 1002 area, which is known to contain the \nlargest reservoir in the North American Continent. And in a compromise \nentered into in good faith between those of us who represented Alaska \nand Senators Jackson and Tsongas, we got a bill passed which authorized \nthe future drilling in this area and provided an environmental impact \nstatement that showed there would be no adverse impact on the area.\n  Twice the Congress has passed such an amendment and twice President \nClinton vetoed it. Now President Bush, knowing the international \nsituation as it is, has said he wants this area opened to oil and gas \nexploration. We are trying to carry that load of getting the approval \nrequested by the President of the United States. It is in the House \nbill, but it is not in this bill.\n\n  I find it very hard to represent a State such as mine, a new State. I \nhave been in the Senate for all but 9 years that Alaska has been a \nmember of the Union. The one absolute agreement, absolute agreement \nthat we worked on for 7 years was the agreement to assure that this \narea would be explored for its oil and gas potential.\n  When I was in the Department of the Interior during the Eisenhower \nadministration, I helped prepare the order to create the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Range. At that time there was no question that range \nwas created, and it was specifically stated that oil and gas \nexploration could continue in that area, subject to stipulations to \nprotect the fish and wildlife.\n  When we got to this bill, the so-called ANILCA bill, the Alaska \nNatural Interest Lands Conservation Act, we had the proposal to \nwithdraw all of this land, and the House of Representatives, in its \nbill, closed this area to oil and gas exploration. The only basic \nchange that we made in that bill, as it came out of the Senate, the \nonly basic change that was absolutely demanded by the State of Alaska \nand all of us who were elected to represent the State of Alaska--both \nthe State legislature, the Governor, and the three of us in the \ncongressional delegation--was that area had to be available for \nexploration.\n  Senator Jackson, chairman of the committee; Senator Tsongas, author \nof the substitute; agreed to amend that bill to allow for the \nexploration and development of the oil and gas potential, and those in \nthe Chamber now who challenge that are leading the fight to break a \ncommitment that was made to a sovereign State. It was made to us as a \nState that the area would be available for exploration if we did not \noppose any further the proposal to withdraw 104 million acres of land \nfor national purposes in our State.\n  People say, why are you exercised about that? Our whole rights as a \nState were put aside until that issue was settled. The Alaskan people \nwere entitled to select lands for the public land as part of our \nstatehood act; the Native people were entitled to select lands in \nsettlement of their claims. Over 150 million acres of Alaska to be \nselected to benefit Alaskans in the future, it all was put aside until \nthose 104 million acres were set aside. The only thing we asked out of \nthe 104 million acres was the right to explore this area, 1.5 million \nacres on the Arctic coast. That agreement was made.\n  There are people here in the Senate who voted for it who now tell us \nthey are not going to vote to allow that exploration to take place. It \nis enough to strain anybody's conscience, and my conscience is strained \nbecause of the fact that I agreed to that proposition. I agreed to it. \nI believed in the system. I believed that once Congress made a \ncommitment in law, signed by the President of the United States, it \nwould be binding even on future Senators. Apparently, it is not.\n  I warn all Senators, don't trust the Senate. Don't trust a commitment \nthat is made by your colleagues. Don't trust an agreement that you make \nwith the Federal Government. Unless we can get this area opened, there \nis no way I will trust a future agreement that is made here in the \nSenate Chamber with regard to future activity. I will insist that \nanything that benefits my State must be done now, not dependent on \nfuture Congresses in order to carry it out.\n  This is an unfortunate situation as far as I am concerned. I have not \nsaid the last.\n  Let me put this back up so people will see it again.\n  Madam President, this is the introduction to section 1002, the \nJackson-Tsongas amendment, December 2, 1980. It specifically set forth \nthe agreement we had made:\n\n       The purpose of this section is to provide for a \n     comprehensive and continuing inventory and assessment of the \n     fish and wildlife resources of the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an analysis of the impacts \n     of oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and \n     to authorize exploratory activity within the coastal plain in \n     a manner that avoids significant adverse effects on the fish \n     and wildlife and other resources.\n\n  That is the situation. That is the Coastal Plain, 1.5 million acres, \npart of the original Arctic Wildlife Range. That has never been \nwilderness. The balance of the wildlife range is wilderness, but the \nadditions of the wildlife range are not wilderness. This is a concept--\nI really don't know how to deal with it other than to say this was a \nbasic negotiated compromise between the State of Alaska and the people \nof the United States. We were assured that the area would be open.\n  Now, that little red dot there on the chart represents the amount of \nland we have agreed we would be limited to as we go into production--\n2,000 acres of a million and a half acres is what we are asking to be \nable to explore. We know where to drill now. The seismic work was \nauthorized by the 1980 act and has been done. We are ready to drill \nnow.\n  There is oil production right outside of that ANWR area. This is the \nPrudhoe Bay area here and this is Kuparuk Field. This is essential to \nour national security. At the time of the Persian Gulf war, that Trans-\nAlaska pipeline, going from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, carried 2.1 billion \nbarrels of oil a day. Now it carries 950,000 a day. We make up the \ndifference by importing the oil from Iraq. As we buy the oil from Iraq, \nSaddam Hussein sends $25,000 to the families of every one of the \nsuicide bombers. We are paying for the terrorism that comes from Iraq \nbecause we continue to import oil that we could produce ourselves. We \nknow there is oil there. The problem is, not only do we know there is \noil there, but also in this big field up here, as we produce the oil, \nthere is associated gas.\n  There is 50 trillion to 70 trillion cubic feet of gas there that we \nwant to bring down to the 48 contiguous States. This chart will show \nwhere it will go. There are two routes proposed. This green line is the \nroute. It is traversing a corridor that will come down the Alaska\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nHighway and across into Canada and then to the Chicago area. That is \n3,000 miles, and 1,500 miles of gathering pipelines in the area.\n  There is no question that this gas is absolutely needed for our \nfuture. What is the key to that future? I am back where I started. The \nkey is steel. If we don't have steel, we cannot build a pipeline. If \nthe steelworkers don't get that legacy fund fixed, there will not be a \nconsolidation of steel that will make a difference for us. We need the \nsteel industry to come back into its own and for them to be able to \ndeliver their portion of this steel. It will take half of the world's \nproduction for a period of 7 to 10 years to build that gas pipeline. \nThat is why we are suggesting that we marry up the needs of the steel \nindustry and our needs, as the State that wants to pursue development \nof that oil in the 1002 area, the million and a half acres.\n  I think we should do things in the national interest. I am sad to say \nthat it increasingly looks as if it is not going to happen. We are \nstill going to persevere and try to continue to convince people what \nwould be the right and just thing to do here. But, above all, I hope \nevery Senator will examine their conscience and answer the question of \nwhether or not, if a commitment was made to them concerning their State \nby the United States in a law enacted by the Congress, suggested by two \ncolleagues in the Senate, what would their attitude be if when the time \ncame to validate that agreement, the Senate refused to do so?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2666-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2666-S2667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, one of the pieces of legislation I \nthought would be on the floor of the Senate by this time is trade \npromotion authority. I know our majority leader has a lot of problems \nand issues with which he has to deal. I think he has intentions of \nbringing the bill up sometime, but I am trying to encourage the Senate \nmajority leader to bring it up soon because we have so many issues \nbefore us. I want to speak about one of those issues in regard to trade \nand agriculture.\n  Trade promotion authority is so important for us to get down trade \nbarriers that stand in the way of the successful and fair trade of our \nagricultural products with other countries. Without trade, there is not \ngoing to be any profitability in farming. The fact is, we produce 40 \npercent more on our farms than is consumed domestically. So a good \ntrade policy is what is necessary if we are going to have full \nproduction and if we are going to have profitability in farming.\n  We had the pleasure of bringing up a bill that had the support by a \nvote of 18 to 3 of the Senate Finance Committee. That was about 4 \nmonths ago and we still don't have any commitment from the leadership \nto bring this critical, bipartisan trade legislation to the floor by a \ndate certain, so we can plan on that date and be ready for one of the \nmost important issues to come before Congress this year and eventually \nvote on it.\n  We have had several offers: that this bill would come up sometime \nthis spring; one time it was in March; another time, it was soon after \nthe Easter recess; now it is maybe sometime before Memorial Day. There \nis a great deal of uncertainty. During this period of uncertainty, we \nlose opportunities for the United States to be a leader in global trade \nnegotiation.\n  Remember, this is not something new for the United States. This is \nsomething that the United States has been doing since 1947 when the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was first started. Whatever \nsuccess we have had until 1994, when the President's authority ran out, \nhas been accomplished under U.S. leadership. We ought to be proud of \nour leadership and we ought to be looking forward to reestablishing \nthat leadership once again after a period of about 8 years during which \nthe President hasn't had the authority. Then we can continue the good \nthings that happen when trade barriers are reduced.\n  The good things that happen are the creation of jobs. I don't want \npeople to take my word for that. I want to repeat one of the things \nPresident Clinton has constantly said, which I agree with, and that is \nduring his tenure as President, with a rapidly expanding economy--I \nthink in the neighborhood of about 20 million new jobs were created \nduring that term of office--President Clinton would say that one-third \nof those jobs were created because of trade.\n  I am not talking about trade as some abstract political theory or \neconomic theory. I am talking about the good that comes from trade--the \ngood of creating jobs in America, the good that it does for our \nconsumers because of the opportunities to get the best buy for consumer \ngoods.\n  President Clinton's bragging about one-third of the jobs coming from \ninternational trade was a direct result of 50 years of America's \nleadership in the reduction of trade barriers. Two of those major \nagreements were completed in the first year of President Clinton's \nPresidency--the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as the \nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which \nestablished the World Trade Organization as a more permanent forum for \nthe establishment of trade agreements in the future and settlement of \ntrade disputes.\n  I am talking about having a better opportunity for America's economy, \nfor creation of jobs. Again, this is not something from which just \nAmerica benefits. We can look at the economies of Korea, Taiwan, and \nJapan. As we know, after World War II, they were in a terrible state of \naffairs. They were Third World economies. Look at what those economies \nhave done in the last 50 years through the principle of trading and \nthrough the regime that was established under the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade. They were able to expand their economies to the \nadvanced economies they have today.\n  By having trade in the 77 countries in the world that are the most \npoor--Africa and other countries as well--we can help them expand their \neconomies or, as President Kennedy said in his Presidency, trade not \naid, meaning that trade was a better way of helping the developing \nnations to become strong economies rather than the United States just \ngiving something that was not an encouragement for them to advance.\n  When I talk about trade promotion authority, I am not talking about \nsome abstract delegation of authority to the President of the United \nStates to negotiate certain agreements that Congress is going to \ncontrol in the final analysis as we have to vote on that product that \ncomes out of those agreements. We are talking about helping countries \nall over the world because we have an expanding world population, and \nwe have to have an expanding world economic pie. If we do not, we are \ngoing to have less for more people. But with an expanding world \neconomic pie, for sure, with an expanding world population, we are \ngoing to have more for more people, and we are not only going to be \ntalking about a better life for those people, but we are going to talk \nabout more social stability, more political stability and more peace \naround the world.\n  This is a very important issue that we ought to be dealing with in \nthe Senate. Every day we delay in approving bipartisan trade promotion \nauthority for the President is another day that the United States \ncannot advance the interest of our workers or, in the case of my \nremarks today, the interests of America's farmers, ranchers, and \nagricultural producers at the negotiating table as effectively as they \nshould, as effectively as we did in the Uruguay Round starting in 1986 \nand ending in 1993, which resulted in a very favorable agreement or any \ntime since 1947. It is a reality, not some theoretical point.\n  While month after month there has been a delay in this issue coming \nup, our agricultural negotiators are at the table right now in Geneva. \nThey are fighting for better market access for our farmers, but without \ntrade promotion authority, our agricultural negotiators have one hand \ntied behind their backs. There are timetables, there are goals, and \nthere are deadlines in Geneva that have to be met if these negotiators \nare going to accomplish what we want them to accomplish for the good of \nAmerican agriculture.\n\n  Without trade promotion authority, it will not be the United States \nthat will shape the negotiating agenda of\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nthese talks. It will be the countries that want to shield their markets \nfrom competition that will shape the agenda and the timing of these \nnegotiations.\n  This would be a devastating situation for America's export-dependent \nfarm economy, and it will cost virtually every farming family in \nAmerica. Without greater access to world markets, America's family \nfarmers and ranchers will pay more in the form of higher tariffs or \ntaxes than will our competitors. As a result, our farmers will have \nlower prices, lower income, and lost opportunity.\n  I thought I would bring to the attention of the Senate a letter that \nis shown on this chart in its entirety. I am not going to read the \nletter in its entirety. It is from a constituent of mine. He also \nhappens to be a person I know well, not because I socialize with this \nperson, but because he is an outstanding agricultural leader in my \nState and, in that capacity, I get to know some of these people who are \noutstanding farmers, outstanding civic leaders.\n  I received this letter from Glen Keppy and brought it with me so my \ncolleagues can see how a third generation pork producer from Davenport, \nIA, looks at the issue of trade and the relationship between trade and \nthe profitability in farming and, more importantly, the strength of the \ninstitution that we refer to as the family farmer.\n  If I can explain what I mean by a family farmer because some think \nthat might be 80 acres or 500 acres. I am not talking about the size of \nthe farm. I am talking about an institution where the family controls \nthe capital, they make all the management decisions, and they provide \nmost or all of the labor. That is a family farm. That can be a 30-acre \nNew Jersey truck garden; that can be an apple ranch in the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Michigan; that can be a ranch, with cattle on \nthousands of acres, in Wyoming where it takes 25 acres of grass to feed \none cow and calf unit.\n  Mr. Keppy wrote to me about the huge foreign tariffs that are on \npork, averaging in some instances close to 100 percent. He also wrote \nabout other foreign trade barriers that hamper his and other farmers' \nability to export overseas.\n  According to Glenn, and I am going to read the first sentence that is \nhighlighted:\n\n       The only way our family operation will survive over the \n     long term is if we can convince other nations to lower or \n     remove their barriers to our pork exports.\n\n  That comes from some experience. We have learned from some reductions \nof tariffs going into Mexico since the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. We are sending more pork into Mexico. As a result of \nagreements with Japan, more beef is going into Japan. A lot of \nagreements that were made in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade proved that as well.\n  Mr. Keppy knows that where barriers have gone down, it has created \nopportunities for the American farmer. What he is talking about is that \nwe need to continue opening markets, and trade promotion authority is \nthe tool that we give to the President to negotiate. We give to the \nPresident our constitutional power under certain short periods of time \nwith restrictions so the President can sit down at the table and \nnegotiate because, quite frankly, it is not possible for 535 Members of \nCongress to negotiate with the 142 different countries that are members \nof the World Trade Organization.\n  So we give the President this authority. We have done it in the past. \nIt has been very successful. We control the end products because if we \ndo not like it, we do not vote for it, it does not pass, it does not \nbecome law.\n  We also control the process through consultation that we require of \nthe President of the United States. We limit some areas where he might \nbe able to negotiate or not negotiate. We instruct the President to \nemphasize some things over other things. So we are not giving away any \nconstitutional power. We are asking the President, as a matter of \nconvenience, to negotiate for Congress in the exercise of our \nconstitutional control over interstate and foreign commerce.\n  I remember in the Senate at the beginning of this debate on trade \npromotion authority there were some who said it really was not \nnecessary to pass trade promotion authority right away. These critics \nwere wrong then. They are wrong now.\n  To show how one of my constituents feels about this, this is what \nthis family farmer who emphasizes and specializes in pork production, \nMr. Keppy, says, and I would read another sentence:\n\n       To the American farmer, despite the pressing need to \n     improve export prospects and consequently, the bottom line \n     for American farmers, no timetable for considering TPA \n     legislation on the floor of the Senate has been set.\n\n  That is his way of saying that is not a very good environment for \nagriculture at the negotiating table as we are right now in Geneva.\n  He also says in another place in these letters:\n\n       To farmers like my two sons and myself, trade is not a \n     luxury. It is a vital ingredient to our success.\n\n  ``It is the key,'' Mr. Keppy says, ``to our survival.''\n  There are a lot of Glen Keppys whose survival as family farmers \ndepends on trade. So it matters a lot to Mr. Keppy and to all the \nfarmers in America like him when the Senate leadership delays month \nafter month in bringing legislation that is vital to the survival of \nfamily farmers to the Senate.\n  Saying one is for the family farmer and then ignoring or delaying \nlegislation that is vital to the farmers' survival is beyond most \nfarmers' ability to understand. Glen Keppy, his two sons who work with \nhim, and all the family farmers like them whose survival depends on \ntrade hope the Senate Democratic leadership is listening and will \nschedule this bill for debate. More importantly, the family farmers of \nAmerica hope we act on this bill.\n  Again, I know this has been on Senator Daschle's list of important \nthings to get done. I know he knows the importance of it because he is \none of the 18 who voted to bring this out of our Senate Finance \nCommittee, but it is something we have to get done, even if it takes \nworking extra hours, as we are not tonight. I am not complaining about \nnot working nights because none of us want to work at night, but \nsometimes we might have to do it to get the job done.\n  I welcome that opportunity and I thank Senator Daschle for his \nconsideration of my request.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2667-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2667-S2670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENT SUBMITTAL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, in deference to the majority, it will \nbe my intent to send an amendment to the desk. I ask that the amendment \nbe laid over until the appropriate time. This is an amendment that \ninvolves sanctions on Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not want to preclude it, but I am not sure as to \nwhether or not it would be necessary to set aside the existing \namendment, which is the Iraqi oil import ban. I filed this some time \nago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On what measure is the Senator proposing to \nadd the amendment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is a specific ban on imports from Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To which bill is the Senator proposing to add \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It would be an amendment to S. 517.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That measure is not pending at this time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent to submit this amendment as if \nit was in order as a pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My understanding is tomorrow morning is somewhat open \nbecause the majority had indicated they were not going to be taking up \nthe boundary issue, and there was some question of taking something \nelse up. So I simply offer this amendment. Obviously, it is going to be \nup to the leaders if they want to take it, but it would\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nbe my intention to submit it. So my staff has the amendment coming \nshortly. It has already been filed with the clerk. So let me go into \nthe specifics.\n  This amendment would basically end our imports of oil from Iraq until \ncertain conditions were met. First would be that the U.N. certifies \nthat Iraq has complied with Security Council Resolution 687 and has \ndismantled their program to develop and construct weapons of mass \ndestruction. Further, it would end our imports of oil from Iraq until \nIraq ceases to smuggle oil in contravention of Security Council \nResolution 986; further, that Iraq no longer pays bounties to the \nfamilies of suicide bombers wreaking havoc in Israel.\n  Now, I recognize Iraq's oil export program is intended to be used for \nthe benefit of Iraq's suffering people, but my amendment also seeks to \nensure the President uses every means available to support the \nhumanitarian needs of the Iraqi people notwithstanding our ban on oil \nimports.\n  I consider myself somewhat of an internationalist, and I believe \nfirmly in the importance of engagement with other countries, \nparticularly economic engagement. But I am a strong believer, as well, \nin free trade and in the work that many of my colleagues have done to \nreform the economic sanctions policy. However, I draw the line on \neconomic engagement when national security is compromised.\n  I said it before, and I will say it again, our increasing dependency \non unstable overseas sources of oil is compromising our national \nsecurity. In the last week, this Nation has lost 30 percent of our \navailable imports from both Iraq and Venezuela. Last week, Saddam \nHussein urged fellow Arab OPEC members to use oil as a weapon--I repeat \nthat: Oil as a weapon. We saw what happened when aircraft were used as \nweapons in the World Trade Center disaster.\n  Saddam Hussein did that by imposing a 30-day embargo to halt oil \nexports to the United States until the United States forced Israel to \ncave into the demands of the Palestinian extremists.\n  In 1973, the Arab League used oil as a weapon during a time of \nsimilar crisis in the Mideast. Some may remember that. We had gas lines \naround the block. People were blaming government. That was during the \nYom Kippur War.\n\n  At that time, we were 37 percent dependent on imported oil. Still, \nthe Arab oil embargo demonstrated how powerful a weapon oil could be, \nand the United States was brought to its knees at that time in 1973.\n  Today, we are 58 percent dependent on imported oil. Clearly, the \nvulnerability is evident. At that time, the national security \nimplications of energy dependence was obvious to everybody. At that \ntime, there was a decision made to build a TransAlaskan pipeline. It \nwas taken precisely because of our national security implications of \noverdependency on Middle East sources. That was then and this is now.\n  I have charts that show the contribution of Prudhoe Bay to decreasing \nour imports when Prudhoe Bay came online. It was a dramatic reduction \nin imports. Prudhoe Bay has contributed about 25 percent of the total \ncrude oil produced in this country. Prospects for ANWR are even \ngreater. I suggest there is more oil in ANWR than in the entire State \nof Texas.\n  As we look at the changing times, we have to recognize certain things \nstay the same. Nearly 30 years after the Arab oil embargo, we are faced \nwith the same threat we faced in 1973. The difference is that now we \nare nearly 58 percent dependent on imported oil. The stakes are higher. \nThe national security implications are more evident. I wonder what we \nhave learned. The day before Saddam Hussein called on his Arab \nneighbors to use oil as a weapon and begin the 30-day moratorium on \nexports, the United States was importing over a million barrels a day \nfrom Iraq. If you filled up your tank on that day, chances are at least \na half gallon of your tank came from Iraq. That is dollars to Saddam \nHussein. Think about it. This is the same individual who pays bounties \nto suicide bombers. It was $10,000; now it is $25,000. He shoots at our \nsons and daughters who fly missions in the no-fly zone in Iraq; he has \nused chemical weapons on his own people and has boasted that he has the \nweapons to scorch half of Israel.\n  When we innocently fill up a gas tank, we have paid Saddam Hussein \nnearly a nickel of every dollar spent at the pump that day--paid, in \neffect, for the suicide bombers; bought the shells targeted at American \nforces; paid for the chemical and biological weapons being developed in \nIraq which are targeted at Israel.\n  Have we learned our lesson? I ran across an old Life magazine from \nMarch 1991. In a profile of the gulf war, they wrote of Saddam Hussein:\n\n       When he finally fought his way to power in 1979, after an \n     apprenticeship of a few years as a torturer, his first order \n     was the execution of some 20 of the highest-ranking \n     government officials, including one of his best friends. He \n     likes to say ``he who is closest to me is furthest from when \n     he does wrong.'' He grew up in dirt to live in splendor. He \n     is cheerless. And he currently possesses Kuwait.\n\n  This article should be used as a reminder of the costly mistakes for \nnot dealing with him completely. It is almost a play-by-play review of \nthe gulf war, but new names and a new era from 2002 could just as \neasily be inserted in that article. These lessons must not be lost. He \nis our enemy. The world must isolate him, cut him off and coax his \nregime to an early demise.\n  We have not learned our lesson, have we? He is still there because we \nare still buying his oil. Sure, it is masked in an oil-for-food \nprogram, but is it really working? He is still there. I know oil for \nfood isn't supposed to work that way. Saddam Hussein is supposed to use \nthe money for oil, for food to feed the Iraqi people, to buy medicine, \nbut he cheats on the program, buying all kinds of dual-use and \nquestionable material and smuggles billions of dollars of oil out of \nIraq, which directly funds his armies, his weapons, his programs, and \nhis palaces.\n\n  We have had lost lives. A few months ago we had two of our Navy men \ndrown boarding one of his illegal tankers that was going out of Iraq. \nDuring the inspection, the ship simply sank.\n  No matter how you look at it, our purchase of Iraqi oil is absolutely \ncontrary to the national interests of our country. It is indefensible. \nIt must end.\n  My amendment does just that. It would end the new imports of Iraqi \noil until Iraq is proven a responsible member of the international \ncommunity and complies with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\n  I begin this statement by affirming my support for economic \nengagement. I believe deeply in the principles of free trade. I do not \nbelieve, however, in economic disarmament. When, as in the case of oil, \na commodity is not only important to our economy's health, but it is \nalso important to our military's ability to defend this Nation, self-\nsufficiency is a critical matter. No country or group of countries \nshould have the ability to ground our aircraft, shut down our tanks, or \nkeep our ships from leaving port. Yet allowing ourselves to become \ndependent on imports threatens to do just that.\n  In the case of Saddam Hussein, we are dependent, as I indicated, as a \nconsequence of what has happened with the curtailment of imports and \nthe strikes in Venezuela. Thirty percent of our normal imports have \nbeen interrupted, a portion of that by a sworn and defined enemy, \nSaddam Hussein.\n  I will show a chart I referred to earlier because I think it \naddresses and thwarts some of the negative impressions as to how \nsignificant any development in ANWR might be.\n  Looking at history, this particular chart shows, on the blue line, \nproduction in Alaska. In 1976 and 1977 it went up dramatically. The red \nline shows why. We began to build the TransAlaskan pipeline, the TAPPS \npipeline, and we see in 1977 at that time imports peaked, and then they \ndropped dramatically. They dropped in 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, \n1985, and 1986 because we opened Prudhoe Bay. When critics say opening \nup ANWR will not make any difference, history proves them wrong. This \nis the actual reality of what happened to our imports when we opened \nPrudhoe Bay. The imports dropped in 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, \nand 1986. Why did they start going up? Obviously, the demand in the \nUnited States increased. They kept increasing. If you look at the blue \nline, Alaska's production begins to decline. It will decline until we \nface reality and wake up to the fact that we have the capability to \ndevelop ANWR just as we did Prudhoe Bay. But there is the reality that \nthe contribution of opening up a field of the magnitude of ANWR\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nwill certainly be comparable to that of Prudhoe Bay. I think that \ncomparison is evident in the range estimated for the reserves of ANWR--\nsomewhere between 5.6 billion and 16 billion barrels.\n\n  The actual production of Prudhoe Bay has been a little over 10 \nbillion barrels. So if you apply roughly the same scenario, you are \ngoing to see a significant drop in imports from overseas as we increase \nproduction in Alaska. I think that chart really needs to be understood.\n  I wish to conclude by a reference to relying on foreign sources of \noil. I think we all agree history shows us it is not risk free. We saw \nwhat happened in 1973 during the Arab oil embargo. I think it is fair \nto say we have a bit of an uneasy relationship with our friends in the \ngulf, and September 11 clearly demonstrated that our enemies--in \nstaunch allies like Saudi Arabia--may outnumber our friends.\n  Isn't it interesting the Saudis have indicated they are going to make \nup the supply that was terminated by Saddam Hussein indicating he is \ngoing to cease production for 30 days? I wonder at what price. We \nalready have some form of economic sanction on every single member of \nOPEC.\n  Think about that. Here we are, relying on a cartel which is illegal \nin this country to provide us with our oil. Then we have some form of \neconomic sanction on every single member of OPEC, a reflection on the \nuneasy relationship we have with those countries.\n  That is risky, relying on countries such as these to provide for our \nnational security. We have long recognized the folly of importing oil \nfrom our enemies. There is lots of oil in Iran and Libya, but we have \nnot imported so much as a drop of oil from those countries in 20 years. \nDoes relying on Iraq make more sense than relying on Iran or Libya? I \nnotice many colleagues advocate production in less risky parts of the \nglobe, including in the United States. The trouble is, you have to \ndrill for oil and you have to go where the oil is. The fact is, the \nground under which most of the oil is buried is controlled by unstable, \nunfriendly, or at-risk governments.\n  Let me turn for a moment to some of the other areas of the world on \nwhich we depend. Take Colombia, for example, the oilfields being \ndeveloped in this pristine rainforest down there. We get more than \n350,000 barrels of oil from Colombia. The 480-mile-long Cano Limo \npipeline is at the heart of the Colombian oilfields and the trade. It \nis very frequently attacked by the FARC rebels. They are anti-\ncapitalist, anti-U.S., anti-Colombian Government rebels. The trouble \nis, half the country these rebels control has the Cano Limo pipeline \nrunning through it, a convenient target to cripple the economy, get \nAmerica's attention, and rally the troops to their cause.\n  The countless attacks have cost some 24 million barrels in lost crude \nproduction last year and untold environmental damage to the rainforest \necosystem.\n  Last year alone, the rebels bombed the Cano Limo pipeline 170 times, \nputting it out of commission for 266 days and costing the Colombian \nGovernment and the citizens of that country about $500 million in lost \nrevenues.\n  The Bush administration wants to spend $98 million to train a brigade \nof 2,000 Colombian soldiers to protect the pipeline and now another \nrebel faction called the American companies running the pipeline \n``military targets.''\n\n  I ask you, is Colombia a stable supply, a stable source of supply?\n  How about Venezuela? Workers are on strike there. The Government is \nin turmoil. Production is suspended. Yesterday, labor leaders and \nGovernment officials were set to return to the bargaining table. That \nhas broken down today. Instead we have seen riots, 12 to 20 people are \ndead. Hundreds are injured. We have seen President Chavez resign and \nthen we have seen him come back.\n  One has to question the absence of Chavez and what does it mean to \nstability? Does it leave a vacuum? Does it leave more uncertainty?\n  Between a Venezuelan labor crisis, Colombia's civil war, Iraq's \nembargo, 30 percent of our oil supply is threatened. What are we doing \nabout it? We are talking about CAFE standards. My colleagues suggest to \nyou if we would only adopt CAFE standards, we would be able to take \ncare of, and relieve our dependence on, imports.\n  There are two things about CAFE standards. One is the recognition \nthat we can save on oil. But the world moves on oil. The United States \nmoves on oil. Unfortunately, other alternative sources of energy do not \nmove America. They don't move our trains or our boats, our automobiles \nor trucks. We wish, perhaps, we had another alternative, but we do not. \nThe harsh reality is we are going to be depending on oil and oil \nimports. The question is, Is it in the national interest of this \ncountry to reduce that dependence? The answer is clearly yes.\n  Are my colleagues truly unfazed about the close connection between \noil money and national security? Are we willing to turn our heads while \nthe money we spend at the pump fuels the Mideast crisis? Are we willing \nto finance the schemes of Saddam Hussein? Are we willing to allow our \npolicy choices in Israel to be dictated by our thirst for imported oil? \nAre we willing to let oil be used as a weapon against us?\n  Whatever the outcome of the ANWR debate which we are going to start \ntomorrow, we should stop relying on Saddam Hussein. It is simply a \nmatter of principle. The United States is a principled nation. We \nshould not allow our national security to be compromised. I have heard \ntime and time again, on the other side, my friends dismissing ANWR as a \nsolution to the national security dilemma of overdependence on foreign \noil. But I have not heard of a good, sound alternative solution.\n  Our military cannot conduct a campaign of conservation. Our aircraft \ndo not fly on biomass. Our tanks do not run on solar. Wind power has \nnot been used by the Navy in 150 years.\n  I sympathize with the desires to eliminate the use of fossil fuels. I \nbelieve we will get there through continued research in new \ntechnologies. But, in the meantime, the United States and the world \nmoves on oil. As the developing nations develop their economies, they \nare going to require more oil. I certainly understand the urge to deny \nthe importance of oil in the national security equation, but all my \ncolleagues, I think it is fair to say, will eventually have to look \nthemselves in the mirror after this debate and ask whether we have \nsacrificed our national security in order to appeal to the fantasies of \nextreme but well-funded environmentalists.\n  Whether or not we do the right thing for this country and open up \nANWR to safe, effective exploration, we should not compromise our \nnational security by continuing to rely on our enemies. That is just \nwhat we are, evidently, doing at this time.\n  Finally, let me again point out something that we have been having a \nhard time communicating; that is, the reality associated with the ANWR \nissue. The fact is, this is a significant size--roughly 19 million \nacres, the size of South Carolina. We have already made specific land \ndesignations. Congress made these. We have roughly 9 million acres in a \nrefuge, 8.5 million acres in wilderness, and this is the Coastal Plain, \n1.5 million acres in green that potentially is at risk. But the House \nbill only authorized 2,000 acres, that little red spot there. So that \nis the footprint that would be authorized in the Senate bill.\n  We have the infrastructure in. We have an 800-mile pipeline that was \nbuilt in the early 1970s from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez.\n  Having participated in that discussion, it is rather interesting to \nreflect that 27 or 28 years later we are still arguing the same \nenvironmental premise on whether or not this can be done safely. The \nargument then was that we were going to build a fence across 800 miles \nof Alaska; that we were going to separate two parts of the State by \nbuilding a fence; and the animals were not going to cross it--the polar \nbears were not going to cross it, and the moose were not going to cross \nit. That proved to be a fallacious argument.\n  The other argument was you were going to put a hot pipeline in \npermafrost which would melt the permafrost, and the pipeline was going \nto break. All of those naysayer scenarios were false.\n  The same argument is being made today--that somehow we can't open \nthis area safely.\n  I will show you a couple of pictures of some of the animal activity \nup\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nthere. I think it warrants consideration. We have already seen the \ngrowth in the caribou herd relative to Prudhoe Bay. There were 3,000 to \n4,000 animals in 1974-1975. There are about 26,000 today.\n  The Porcupine herd traverses Canada. There is a large number taken \nfor subsistence in that particular area. It is a different herd. But we \nare not going to develop this area in the summertime. The development \nwill be in the winter.\n  Here is a little idea of the caribou. These are not stuffed. These \nare real. These are caribou traversing the Arctic oilfield of Prudhoe \nBay. They are not shot at; they are not run down. You can't take a gun \nin there. You can't hunt. They are very docile unless they are \nthreatened.\n  Here is a picture of what happens when the bears want to go for a \nwalk. They walk on the pipeline because it is a lot easier than walking \non the snow. I think many of my colleagues would recognize that these \nare bears which are smarter than the average bear. Let us just leave it \nat that.\n  As we get into this debate tomorrow, I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize again the magnitude of this area, the very small footprint, \nand recognize that this area is known to contain more oil than all of \nTexas. There is absolutely no question about that. The question is, \nWhat are the extremes? Again, it is as big as Prudhoe Bay. It will \nsupply this Nation 25 percent more of its total crude oil consumption, \nand the infrastructure is already built.\n  Let me conclude with one other point. As the occupant of the chair is \nwell aware, all of the oil from Alaska is consumed on the west coast of \nthe United States. There hasn't been a drop of oil exported outside of \nAlaska since June 2 years ago. That was a little which was in excess \nfor the west coast. This oil moves in U.S. tankers down the west coast. \nA significant portion goes into Puget Sound in the State of Washington \nwhere it is refined. Oregon does not have any refineries. A portion of \nthe Washington-refined oil goes into the State of Oregon. The rest of \nit goes down to San Francisco Bay or Los Angeles where the balance is \nrefined. A small portion goes to the refineries in Hawaii.\n  That is where Alaskan oil goes. When Alaskan oil begins to decline as \na consequence of the decline of the Prudhoe Bay field, where is the \nWest going to get its oil? Is it going to get it from Colombia or it is \ngoing to get it from Saudi Arabia or Iran or Iraq or wherever. It is \ngoing to come in in foreign ships because the Jones Act requires that \nthe carriage of goods between two American ports be in U.S.-flagged \nvessels.\n  We are looking at jobs here. We are looking at jobs in the Pacific \nNorthwest, in California. The significance of maintaining those jobs is \nvery real to the American merchant marine.\n\n  Primarily, 80 percent of the tonnage in the American merchant marine \ntoday is under the American flag--U.S. tankers. They are in need of \nreplacement. It is estimated that if we open up ANWR, there will be 19 \nnew tankers built in U.S. shipyards employing U.S. crews. If it isn't, \nyou are going to see the oil come into the west coast ports in foreign \nvessels from foreign ports. Obviously, that will affect our balance of \npayments and result in sending dollars overseas.\n  As we begin the debate, I hope my colleagues will recognize that \nAmerica's environmental community has been pushing very hard on this \nissue because it has been an issue that has allowed them to raise \ndollars and generate membership. And they really milk it for all its \nworth.\n  I hope Members will reflect on the debate itself, the merits of the \ndebate, and not be prepositioned by having given certain commitments to \none group or another.\n  This is a big jobs issue. About 250,000 U.S. jobs are associated with \nopening up the ANWR field, the tankers, and the operation. When we get \ninto the debate, hopefully we will have an opportunity to respond to \nthose who have expressed concerns about safety, those who have \nexpressed concerns about the adequacy of the reserves, and those who \nhave expressed concern over how long it would take to get on line.\n  With this pipeline here, and the proximity, it is estimated that we \ncould expedite the permits and have oil flowing within 3 years. Those \nare basically the facts from one who has spent virtually his entire \nlife in the State of Alaska.\n  I can assure you that the Native people of Kaktovik--300 residents--\nsupport the issue. As a matter of fact, they are in Washington right \nnow making calls on various Members.\n  I hope we will do what is right for America in the coming debate; \nthat is, authorize the opening of ANWR.\n  I yield the floor.

Madam President, on April 26, U.S. Army Sergeant First \nClass Donald S. ``Steve'' Workman will be awarded the Soldiers Medal \nfor his courageous actions at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The \nSoldiers Medal is awarded to members of the U.S. Army who distinguish \nthemselves by heroic acts that do not directly involve actual conflict \nwith the enemy.\n  When you hear Steve's story, I am confident that you will agree that \nhis selfless actions indeed merit this award.\n  As all of us vividly remember, a hijacked plane crashed into the \nPentagon on the morning of September 11, 2001. Instead of leaving the \nPentagon, Steve risked his life by reentering the building to help \nother survivors. He struggled through intense fires, sparking \nelectrical wires, and pools of jet fuel and eventually came upon Navy \nLieutenant Kevin Shaeffer, who had been blown to the floor--by a \ngigantic fireball--from his desk in the Navy Command Center.\n  After finding Kevin, Steve guided him through flames and dense smoke \nto one of the infirmaries inside the Pentagon. When they reached the \ninfirmary, Steve realized Kevin was going into shock so he immediately \nelevated Kevin's legs using a trash can, loosened his belt, and gave \nhim small drops of water. After helping a nurse administer an IV and \npainkiller, Steve grabbed a small tank of oxygen and led Kevin outside \nto wait for an ambulance.\n  Once ambulances began arriving, Steve helped place Kevin in one of \nthem and they rode together to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. En \nroute, the ambulance's oxygen tank ran empty so the small oxygen tank \nSteve took from the Pentagon infirmary was a godsend. Kevin recalls \nthat the two men talked during the trip and he remembers giving Steve \nhis wife's name, Bianca--also a Navy Lieutenant--and phone number.\n  When the ambulance arrived at Walter Reed, Steve turned Kevin over to \nthe medical personnel and helped the hospital staff contact Bianca. He \nthen returned to the Pentagon to help anyone else needing it.\n  Kevin later learned that he had suffered second and third-degree \nburns over 41 percent of his body. During his three month stay at \nWalter Reed, Kevin and Steve, and their families, stayed in close \ncontact with each other and have developed a strong relationship. Kevin \nand Bianca have stated that they consider Steve to be a member of their \nfamily.\n  SFC Steve Workman is a brave, courageous soldier whose actions helped \nsave the life of a fellow servicemen. He is a true hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2670-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2670-S2671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TAX DAY 2002--PROGRESS AND UNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, on this April 15, Congress and the \nPresident have solid achievements to be proud of. But there is also \nmuch work that remains to be done on a tax code that is still too \nburdensome and complex.\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\n  First the good news.\n  We continue to see the many benefits of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001. This year, hardworking Americans and \ntheir families have a little more freedom, and the Federal Government \nhas a little less control over their lives.\n  Most taxpayers saw the immediate results of this tax relief last \nsummer, when rebate checks arrived in mailboxes across the country. \nThese checks were the first installment in replacing the old 15-percent \ntax rate bracket with a new 10-percent bracket. Low-and-modest income \nfamilies were given the highest priority, both in timing and in \nrelation to their income tax burden.\n  But help for families didn't stop there. The 2001 law has increased \nand expanded the child tax credit, increased the adoption tax credit to \n$10,000 per child, and provided relief from the marriage penalty, \nincluding the expansion and simplification of the earned income credit \nfor working, low-income couples.\n  Education benefits for families include deductions for college \nexpenses, improvements to education savings accounts, student loan \ninterest deductions, and the continued allowance of employer-provided \neducational assistance. There are also tax benefits for governmental \nbonds for public school construction.\n  The phase-out of the death tax by 2010 is a major achievement in \nfairness for family-owned farms and small businesses.\n  Individuals and families will be able to prepare for a more secure \nfuture because of increases to contribution limits on pensions and \nindividual retirement accounts, fairer retirement provisions for women, \nand overall reductions in individual tax rates.\n  The first major tax relief legislation in over twenty years has \nhelped lighten the burden on taxpayers this year. President Bush and \nCongress came together last year for the good of the American taxpayer, \nin a bipartisan compromise that was only a good start.\n  There is much more we can and need to accomplish.\n  First, we need to make permanent the tax relief in last year's law. \nThe House is poised to pass a bill to do just that. I call upon my \nSenate colleagues to follow suit. Because of the technicalities of \nbudget law, last year's tax relief sunsets after 2010. That kind of \nsunset doesn't make sense for families, farms, and small businesses \nthat need certainty and consistency for long-term planning.\n  Second, Americans deserve more relief. Even after last year's tax \nrelief bill, this still remains the most heavily taxed generation in \nAmerican history.\n  A typical family pays well over a third of its income in taxes at all \nlevels. That is more than they spend on food, clothing, and housing \ncombined.\n  Every year, the Tax Foundation computes Tax Freedom Day, the day on \nwhich American stop working to pay taxes to government at all levels \nand start keeping what they earn. This year, Tax Freedom Day comes on \nApril 27, 2 days earlier than 2001 and 4 days earlier than 2000.\n  This is progress, but it still means Americans work 117 days a year \nfor the government, instead of for their families and their futures. \nLooked at another way, out of each 8-hour workday, Americans work more \nthan two and one-half hours for the tax man.\n  Third, Americans need and deserve a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax \nCode.\n  In 2002, Americans will spend an estimated 5.8 billion hours and $194 \nbillion to comply with the Internal Revenue Code, or about $700 for \neach man, woman, and child in America. More than half of taxpayers go \nto paid tax preparers, many out of the sheer fear of an intimidating \nTax Code, because millions of those taxpayers file only the simplest \nforms. Combined, the Federal Tax Code and its regulations number 7 \nmillion words in more than 700 separate sections.\n  This April 15, Americans are better off than last April 15, because \nthey are keeping more of their own, hard-earned income. But we can and \nmust do better.\n  When Americans are not strapped down by excessive taxes and red tape, \nthey work, save, spend, and invest according to their needs, and their \ndreams. This means more secure jobs, better wages, innovative products \nand services, and a stronger nation.\n  Helping Americans meet their needs and realize their drams, with tax \nrelief and reform, remains a major challenge before the Senate this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2671-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 28, \n1994 in Smithton, PA. A gay man, Paul Edward Steckman, was beaten to \ndeath. The attacker, a minor, said that he beat Mr. Steckman for making \nunwanted sexual advances.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2671-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE INAUGURATION OF SISTER ROSE MARIE KUJAWA AS THE \n                  6TH PRESIDENT OF MADONNA UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask that the Senate join me \ntoday in commemorating the inauguration of Sister Rose Marie Kujawa as \nthe 6th president of Madonna University. For over three decades, Sister \nRose Marie has dedicated her time to educating the mind and spirit of \nyouth in southeastern Michigan.\n  Sister Rose Marie, a 1966 graduate and mathematics major of Madonna \nCollege, returned to her alma mater in 1975 after a decade of teaching \nhigh school. During her first appointment in the mathematics \ndepartment, Sister Rose Marie organized and taught the first computer \ncourses at the college. Soon thereafter, she gained additional \nresponsibilities in the planning and development office.\n  Madonna College underwent dramatic change in the years following \nSister Rose Marie's promotion to the position of Academic vice \npresident in 1978. Numerous undergraduate programs were introduced in \nareas such as applied science, biochemistry, computer science, \ninternational studies, Japanese, and psychology. At the same time, a \nnumber of departments and programs sought and received professional \naccreditations. The college also established writing and computer \nrequirements for graduation.\n  The greatest change for the college, which came in 1991, was largely \ndue to the dedication of Sister Rose Marie. As chairperson of the \n``University Study'' committee, Sister Rose Marie compared the academic \nquality and support structures of Madonna with 13 other private \nuniversities and discovered that Madonna favorably compared with all of \nthem. The college then took her findings to the regional accrediting \nbody and the State of Michigan Department of Education. Both \norganizations concurred with her conclusions and soon thereafter \nMadonna College became Madonna University.\n  In addition to her work at the university, Sister Rose Marie \ncommitted a great deal of time to community service and sits on the \nboards of numerous community organization. She has also traveled to \nover 20 countries, where she has developed important overseas \nrelationships for the University.\n  The importance of dedication such as Sister Rose Marie's cannot be \noverstated. I know that my Senate colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating Sister Rose Marie and Madonna University on this \nsignificant occasion.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2672-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2672]]\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE KENTUCKY FIRE SPRINKLER CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION \n                               FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate and \nhonor the Kentucky Fire Sprinkler Contractors Association, KFSCA, \nFoundation of Frankfort, KY for winning an American Society of \nAssociation Executives', ASAE, 2002 Associations Advance America Award \nof Excellence. They were one of just 18 organizations nationwide to \nreceive this notable distinction.\n  The ASAE, based here in Washington, D.C., recognizes associations and \nindustry partners each year that advance American society with \ninnovative programs in areas like education, skills training, standard \nsetting, citizenship and community service. Oftentimes, these \nassociations perform invaluable services for their communities that \nwould typically be the responsibility of local, State, or Federal \nGovernment. As a member of the Kentucky State legislature, U.S. \nCongress, and now the U.S. Senate, I have come to realize how truly \nimportant these associations are to the everyday lives of the men and \nwomen residing in their communities.\n  The Kentucky Fire Sprinkler Contractors Association Foundation was \nselected to receive the AAA Award of Excellence out of 100 entries for \nits highly successful fundraising efforts for Burn Prevention. The \nKFSCA Foundation came into existence 7 years ago to provide a \ncharitable base for burn prevention and education activities. In these \n7 years, the foundation has donated more than $130,000 to a Pediatric \nBurn Center and to support a program to provide psychological \nintervention for juvenile fire starters. Also, the foundation operates \nand maintains a mobile burn education trailer that is used by fire \ndepartments across the commonwealth to educate school children and the \npublic about fire and fire prevention. By winning a AAA Award of \nExcellence, the KFSCA will be automatically eligible to receive ASAE's \nhighest honor, the Summit Award. In all, eight Summit Award winners \nwill be chosen this summer to be formally honored at ASAE's 2002 Annual \nMeeting in Denver August 17-20, and at the ASAE Summit Awards Dinner, \nbeing held in September at the National Building Museum in Washington, \nD.C.\n  I am honored to have such a reputable and committed foundation \nworking in the State I represent. I would like to thank all of those \ninvolved with the KFSCA for their hard work and urge them to continue \ntheir good deeds. They certainly are making a difference in people's \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2672-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RICHARD HAIRE'S CONTRIBUTION TO NEW MEXICO'S FUTURE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, after serving as an exemplary \nelementary school teacher in New Mexico for more than 32 years, Richard \nHaire is retiring this spring. At that time he will have enriched the \nlives of his fifth grade students at Corrales Elementary for 23 \nconsecutive years.\n  Mr. Haire has unfailingly given our children the gifts of knowledge, \ngoodwill, humor and a disciplined attention to detail. He has \nconsistently set the highest standards for performance in the classroom \nand offered enthusiastic, dedicated support to each child's endeavors.\n  From the start, Mr. Haire has had a very impressive career. Voted \n``most likely to succeed'' by his senior classmates, he graduated \nsecond in a class of 360 in 1965 from Commack High School in upstate \nNew York. Mr. Haire obtained a BA in psychology from the State \nUniversity of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo in 1969 and graduated cum \nlaude among the top students. He then went on to receive his MS in \nEducation from Syracuse University in 1970.\n  Mr. Haire dedicated much of his life to teaching. He taught at Adobe \nAcres Elementary School in Albuquerque from 1971-1978 and continued at \nJohn Baker Elementary School from 1978-1979. Mr. Haire joined the \nteaching staff at Corrales Elementary School in 1979. Scattered across \nthe country. Mr. Haire's students have made remarkable achievements in \nsuch fields as education, literary criticism and science.\n  Good teachers are essential to maintaining New Mexico's unique \ncultural heritage and fostering the state's economic growth. Mr. Haire \nhas made a very generous commitment to future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2672-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n       [Reprint of Record statement of Friday, April 12, 2002]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I submit this statement to explain \nmy absence on Wednesday, April 10 on the rollcall votes regarding the \namendments offered by the distinguished Senator from California. \nSenator Feinstein, and the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator \nCraig. Unfortunately, I was absent for medical reasons and was unable \nto vote.\n  I wanted to express my support for Senator Feinstein's amendment and \nhad I been here, my intention was to vote ``yes'' on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on her energy derivatives amendment. I understand that \nthis body specifically exempted over-the-counter trading in energy \nderivatives from anti-fraud, anti-manipulation and other oversight \nregulation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission back in 2000. \nHowever, I believe the Enron collapse, and the dramatic energy price \nspikes we saw last year in California and the Northwest, including in \nmy State of Montana, tell us that we should take a closer look at \nenergy markets and make sure we are catching market manipulators. I was \ndisappointed that cloture was not invoked on this amendment.\n  I also wanted to express my support for Senator Craig's amendment, \nand had I been here, my intention was to vote for the Craig amendment \nto strike title II of S. 517. With so much uncertainty in today's \nenergy markets. I was not convinced that the modified electricity \nrestructuring provisions in S. 517 did enough to protect the best \ninterests of consumers. This is a complicated area of Federal law, and \nI think the Senate needs more time to get it right. For that reason, I \nwould have supported Senator Craig's amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2672-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2672-5", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2672-6", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3762.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     Ronald Reagan Day; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 411\n\n       Whereas, Ronald Wilson Reagan, a man of humble background, \n     worked throughout his life serving freedom and advancing the \n     public good as an entertainer, union leader, corporate \n     spokesperson, Governor of California and President of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Ronald Reagan served with honor and distinction \n     for two terms as the 40th President of the United States and \n     earned the confidence of three-fifths of the electorate in \n     his reelection carrying 49 of the 50 states in the general \n     election, a record unsurpassed in the history of American \n     presidential elections; and\n       Whereas, At the time of Ronald Reagan's first inauguration \n     in 1981, our nation confronted sustained inflation and high \n     unemployment; and\n       Whereas, President Reagan's administration worked in a \n     bipartisan manner to enact his bold agenda of restoring \n     accountability and common sense to Government, leading to \n     unprecedented economic expansion and opportunity for millions \n     of Americans; and\n       Whereas, President Reagan's commitment to an active social \n     policy agenda for the nation's children reduced crime and \n     drug use in our neighborhoods; and\n       Whereas, President Reagan's commitment to our armed forces \n     restored national pride and respect for values which were \n     cherished and shared by the free world and readied America's \n     military defenses; and\n       Whereas, President Reagan's vision of ``peace through \n     strength'' led to the end of the Cold War and the ultimate \n     demise of the Soviet Union, guaranteeing basic human rights \n     for millions of people; and\n       Whereas, On February 6, 2002, President Reagan reaches 91 \n     years of age, and we honor our nation's oldest living former \n     president as a great American who restored pride and faith in \n     our country; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives designate \n     February 6, 2002, as ``Ronald Reagan Day'' in this \n     Commonwealth; and be if further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-223. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act, \n     commonly known as P.L. 94-142, was enacted on November 29, \n     1975; and\n       Whereas, in 1990 the Education for All Handicapped \n     Children's Act was renamed and reauthorized as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), P.L. 101-\n     476; and\n       Whereas, this federal law entitles disabled children to a \n     free appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, as a result of this law, millions of children with \n     disabilities attend public schools today, and steady progress \n     has been made in their education, enabling many of them to \n     complete high school and college; and\n       Whereas, special education has, however, historically been \n     underfunded by the federal government since the enactment of \n     the original mandates in 1975; and\n       Whereas, the law stipulates that the maximum federal grant \n     is 40 percent of the national costs of public elementary and \n     secondary education and Congress established its intention to \n     meet this goal by 1980; and\n       Whereas, in fact, 34 C.F.R. Sec. 300.701(b) provides that \n     the maximum amount of the grant that may be received by the \n     states is the number of children with disabilities aged 3 \n     through 21 in the state who are receiving special education \n     and related services, multiplied by 40 percent of ``the \n     average per-pupil expenditure in public elementary and \n     secondary schools in the United States''; and\n       Whereas, by 1982 federal funding to defray state and local \n     costs of implementing the law was approximately 40 percent of \n     the total national costs of special education programs and \n     services; and\n       Whereas, in 1997, however, IDEA was significantly revised \n     by Congress to add new federal mandates that substantially \n     increased the costs of special education in Virginia and \n     across the nation; and\n       Whereas, although the federal government has committed \n     itself to providing 40 percent of the average per pupil \n     expenditure for funding special education programs in public \n     elementary and secondary schools, the current funding \n     provided to Virginia for special education is only \n     approximately 12 percent of the actual costs to the \n     Commonwealth and its localities; and\n       Whereas, in 1995 the federal government passed the \n     ``Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,'' P.L. 104-4, \n     providing that ``the Federal Government should not shift \n     certain costs to the States, and the States should end the \n     practice of shifting costs to local governments, which forces \n     many local governments to increase property taxes''; and\n       Whereas, because special education programs and services \n     are very expensive, and federal funding has consistently been \n     inadequate, states and localities have been bearing great \n     fiscal burdens for these federally mandated programs; and\n       Whereas, the federal government should honor its commitment \n     to fund special education and its obligation to avoid \n     shifting the costs for federal mandates to state and local \n     governments; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate Concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to honor its \n     commitment to fully fund the federal share of the special \n     education costs required by the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, P.L. 105-17, as amended, at the 40 percent \n     level; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That Congress be encouraged to move the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to the mandatory-\n     spending category; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation in order that they may be apprised \n     of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-224. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of South Dakota relative to the Black Hills \n     National Forest; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 1018\n\n       Whereas, catastrophic wildfires not only cause \n     environmental damage to forests and other lands but place the \n     lives of firefighters at risk and pose threats to human \n     health, personal property, sustainable ecosystems, wildlife \n     habitat, air quality, and water quality; and\n       Whereas, the seriousness of the fire risk in the national \n     forests has been well documented by both the General \n     Accounting Office and the United States Forest Service; and\n       Whereas, research and experience have shown that forest \n     management, including thinning, forest restoration, grazing, \n     measures to control insects and disease, and small-scale \n     prescribed burning, can be an effective long-term strategy \n     for reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires and insect \n     epidemics, especially in ponderosa pine forests, such as the \n     Black Hills National Forest; and\n       Whereas, the mountain pine beetle epidemic now occurring in \n     the Black Hills National Forest has already increased the \n     risk of forest fires in the Black Hills, possibly endangering \n     the lives and property of the citizens of South Dakota; and\n       Whereas, the national forests are the property of all the \n     residents of the United States, but the residents who live \n     the closest to the national forests are the ones who will be \n     the most impacted by decisions about how to manage those \n     national forests; and\n       Whereas, since the inception of the National Forest System, \n     its supporters have recognized the importance of the support \n     of local residents; and\n       Whereas, local governments and residents of South Dakota \n     now find themselves extremely frustrated at the failure of \n     the Forest Service to deal proactively with the mountain pine \n     beetle epidemic in the Black Hills, and especially with the \n     Forest Service's inclination to base decisions more on \n     directives and policies from Washington, D.C., than on the \n     management needs of the Black Hills National Forest or the \n     concerns and issues of local communities and governments in \n     South Dakota; and\n       Whereas, a measure of this frustration has been the \n     overwhelming support for the concepts embodied in House Bill \n     1236, which was introduced during the 2002 Session of the \n     South Dakota Legislature: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-\n     seventh Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate \n     concurring therein, that, in the interest of protecting the \n     health and integrity of United States forests, wildlife \n     habitats, watersheds, air quality, human health and safety, \n     and private property, the United States should redefine its \n     working relationship with state and local governments, \n     communities, and residents of South Dakota to ensure that the \n     people who will be the most affected by United States Forest \n     Service decisions will receive the highest level of \n     consideration in those decisions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Forest Service should (1) \n     Fully implement the Western Governors Association \n     ``Collaborative 10-year Strategy for Reducing Wildland Fire \n     Risks to Communities and the Environment'' to reduce \n     overabundance of forest fuels that place these resources at \n     high risk of catastrophic wildfire; and (2) Utilize an \n     appropriate mix of fire-prevention activities and management \n     practices including forest restoration, thinning of at-risk \n     forest stands, grazing, selective tree removal and other \n     measures to control insects and pathogens, removal of \n     excessive ground fuels, and small-scale prescribed burns; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That South Dakota's Congressional Delegation is \n     requested to help enact legislation that will allow the \n     United States Forest Service to implement on-the-ground\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\n     steps to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in Beaver \n     Park and other high risk areas in the Black Hills National \n     Forest prior to the 2002 fire season; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Black Hills National Forest should be \n     strongly considered for designation as a ``Charter Forest,'' \n     as presented in the President's FY 2003 Budget Request to \n     Congress; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is hereby authorized \n     and directed to forward a copy of this Resolution to the \n     Honorable President of the United States, George W. Bush; the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, Ann Venneman; the United States \n     Forest Service Chief, Dale N. Bosworth; the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States Congress; and the Congressional Delegation \n     representing the State of South Dakota in the Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-225. An engrossed resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Wisconsin relative to Puerto Rico; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        Engrossed Resolution 46\n\n       Whereas, in 1898, the United States, aided by a significant \n     number of Puerto Rican citizens, defeated the Spanish in the \n     Spanish-American War; and\n       Whereas, the Treaty of Paris signed by the United States on \n     December 10, 1898, and ratified by the United States on \n     February 6, 1899, formally ended the Spanish-American War and \n     established Puerto Rico as a territory of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, persons born in Puerto Rico have been and are U.S. \n     citizens since 1917 but do not possess full citizenship \n     rights and the people of Puerto Rico do not enjoy \n     representative democracy as a state of the Union or as an \n     independent republic; and, although U.S. citizens, they are \n     not permitted to vote in U.S. presidential elections and have \n     no voting representation in the U.S. Congress; and\n       Whereas, despite the fact that over 200,000 Puerto Ricans \n     have fought in all wars participated in by the United States \n     since World War I, including our current war against \n     terrorism, and nearly 2,000 have sacrificed their lives for \n     democratic principles and self-determination, and 4 of them \n     have received the Congressional Medal of Honor, yet they are \n     not allowed to vote for their Commander-in-Chief; and\n       Whereas, Puerto Ricans pay all federal taxes except income \n     and estate taxes, but they receive lower levels of federal \n     benefits than residents of the States, and are excluded from \n     or have limited participation in certain federal programs; \n     and\n       Whereas, the current status is not helping the economy of \n     Puerto Rico and federal economic policy has fostered \n     dependence, caused massive capital flight, and a tremendous \n     brain drain; and the subsidizing of the present colonial \n     relationship costs U.S. taxpayers approximately $15 billion \n     per year; and\n       Whereas, a resolution of the status issue would bring \n     stability and economic development to the island that would \n     sharply reduce or eliminate this burden on our taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, ever since the transition to commonwealth status \n     in 1952, the majority of the people of Puerto Rico have \n     sought an end to their status as a ``territory''; and\n       Whereas, in over 100 years of U.S. sovereignty, the U.S. \n     government has never formally consulted the American citizens \n     of Puerto Rico on their political status preference, and in \n     1997 the legislature of Puerto Rico formally petitioned the \n     U.S. Congress to respond to the democratic aspirations of the \n     U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico by means of a federally \n     sanctioned plebiscite to be held no later than 1998, and \n     Congress has not yet responded to this petition; and\n       Whereas, Puerto Rico has held 2 nonbinding referendums \n     since 1993, and the most recent one indicated that only 0.06% \n     of the population are satisfied with the status quo of being \n     a territorial commonwealth, confirming that there is no \n     longer the consent of the governed for the existing \n     territorial status; and\n       Whereas, self-determination means presenting the U.S. \n     citizens of Puerto Rico with an informed choice among valid, \n     noncolonial status alternatives outlined in a clear, \n     unambiguous plebiscite consistent with the U.S. Constitution; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Wisconsin has a significant Puerto \n     Rican community and an ever-increasing Hispanic population \n     which has and continues to contribute to the state's economy \n     and well-being; and\n       Whereas, the experience of the people of Wisconsin in \n     resolving their own territorial status in 1848, after 65 \n     years as a territory, makes them sympathetic to the \n     aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico to resolve their own \n     political status; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the assembly, That the members of the Wisconsin \n     assembly request that the U.S. Congress and the President of \n     the United States enact legislation that would define the \n     political status options available to the U.S. citizens of \n     Puerto Rico and authorize a plebiscite to provide for Puerto \n     Ricans to make an informed decision regarding the island's \n     future political status; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Wisconsin assembly \n     request the Wisconsin congressional delegation to actively \n     promote and support timely action on this important national \n     issue; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the assembly chief clerk shall transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, the \n     Chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee, the Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives \n     Resources Committee, and each senator and representative from \n     Wisconsin in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-226. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the General Assembly of the State of Iowa relative to Upper \n     Mississippi and Illinois River Inland Waterways \n     Transportation System; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 104\n\n       Whereas, over 360 miles of the Upper Mississippi River and \n     11 navigation locks and dams are contained on the border of \n     or in the state of Iowa; and\n       Whereas, there are approximately 70 manufacturing \n     facilities, terminals, and docks on the waterways of Iowa, \n     providing thousands of jobs in this state; and\n       Whereas, the construction of the lock and dam system has \n     spurred economic growth and a higher standard of living in \n     the Mississippi and Illinois river basin, and today supplies \n     more than 300 million tons of the nation's cargo, supporting \n     more than 400,000 jobs, including 90,000 in manufacturing; \n     and\n       Whereas, more than 60 percent of American agricultural \n     exports including corn, wheat, and soybeans are shipped down \n     the Mississippi and Illinois rivers to foreign markets; and\n       Whereas, Iowa agricultural producers, industry, and \n     consumers rely on efficient transportation to remain \n     competitive in a global economy, with efficiencies in river \n     transport offsetting higher costs compared to those incurred \n     by foreign competitors; and\n       Whereas, the Upper Mississippi and Illinois lock and dam \n     system annually saves our nation more than $1.5 billion in \n     higher transportation costs; and\n       Whereas, approximately 17 million tons of commodities and \n     products including grain, coal, chemicals, and aggregates are \n     annually shipped to, from, and within Iowa by barge, \n     representing $2.7 billion in value; and\n       Whereas, shippers moving by barge in Iowa realize an annual \n     savings of approximately $170 million compared to other \n     transportation modes; and\n       Whereas, Iowa docks ship commodities and products by barge \n     to 14 states and receives commodities and products from 18 \n     states; and\n       Whereas, river transportation is the most environmentally \n     benign form of transporting commodities and products, \n     creating minimal levels of noise pollution, and emitting 35 \n     to 60 percent fewer pollutants than trucks or trains, \n     according to the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency; and\n       Whereas, decreasing river transport capacity would add \n     millions of trucks and railcars to our nation's \n     transportation infrastructure, dramatically increasing air \n     pollution, traffic congestion, and highway maintenance costs; \n     and\n       Whereas, lakes and wildlife refuges created by the lock and \n     dam system provide habitat and breeding grounds for migratory \n     waterfowl and fish; and\n       Whereas, the lakes and 500 miles of wildlife refuge along \n     the Upper Mississippi and Illinois river basin support a $1 \n     billion-a-year recreational industry, including hunting, \n     fishing, and tourism; and\n       Whereas, many of Iowa's locks and dams are more than 60 \n     years old and only 600 feet in length, making them unable to \n     accommodate modern barge tows of up to 1,200 feet long, \n     nearly tripling locking times and causing lengthy delays and \n     ultimately increasing shipping costs; and\n       Whereas, the expansion and modernization of locks has been \n     proven nationwide as the best method of optimizing \n     efficiency, reducing congestion, and providing for additional \n     safety of inland waterway administration; and\n       Whereas, failing to construct 1,200-foot locks will force \n     agricultural producers and industry to use more expensive \n     alternative modes of transportation, including road and rail \n     systems; and\n       Whereas, according to the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers, congestion along the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois rivers costs agricultural producers and consumers in \n     the basin $98 million per year in higher transportation \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, upgrading the system of locks and dams on the \n     Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers will provide 3,000 \n     construction and related jobs over a 15-year to 20-year \n     period; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the General Assembly recognizes the \n     importance of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers \n     Inland Transportation System to the economic prosperity and \n     ecological vitality of the state, the region, and the nation, \n     and urges the United States Congress to provide immediate \n     funding to modernize its lock and dam infrastructure. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate send copies of \n     this concurrent resolution to the President of the United \n     States; the Chief of Engineers and Commander of the United \n     States Corps of Engineers; the President of the United States \n     Senate; the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives; the Chair of the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation; the\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\n     Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition and Forestry; the Chair of the House of \n     Representatives Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure; the Chair of the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Agriculture; and Iowa's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-227.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2122. A bill to provide for an increase in funding for research on \nuterine fibroids through the National Institutes of Health, and to \nprovide for a program to provide information and education to the \npublic on such fibroids; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, today I am proud to introduce the \nUterine Fibroids Research and Education Act 2002. This bipartisan \nlegislation addresses a serious health problem that affects women \nduring their reproductive years. At least twenty to thirty percent of \nall women aged 35 and older have symptomatic fibroids that require \ntreatment. This number rises to approximately fifty percent for \nAfrican-American women.\n  I am pleased that two of my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator \nMikulski, are joining me in sponsoring this legislation. Both are \nstrong advocates for women's health.\n  Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that impact the reproductive \nhealth of women, particularly minority women. If they go undetected or \nuntreated, uterine fibroids can lead to childbirth complications or \ninfertility, among other things.\n  For those who do seek treatment, the option prescribed most often is \na hysterectomy. Uterine fibroids are the top reason for hysterectomies \ncurrently being performed in this country. A hysterectomy is a major \noperation--the average recovery time is six weeks. This is just the \nphysical impact, the emotional impact lasts much longer.\n  We need to invest additional resources in research, so that there are \nmore treatment options for women, including options less drastic than a \nhysterectomy. We also need to increase awareness of uterine fibroids, \nso that more women will recognize the symptoms and seek treatment.\n  To accomplish both of these goals we need a sustained Federal \ncommitment to better understanding uterine fibroids. That is why I am \nintroducing this legislation today.\n  My bill has two components. First, it authorizes $10 million for the \nNational Institutes of Health, (NIH), for each of our years to conduct \nresearch on uterine fibroids.\n  Second, the bill supports a public awareness campaign. It calls on \nthe Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to \ncarry out a program to provide information and education to the public \nregarding uterine fibroids. The content of the program shall include \ninformation on the incidence and prevalence of uterine fibroids and the \nelevated risk for minority women. The Secretary shall have the \nauthority to carry out the program either directly or through contract.\n  This legislation will make a meaningful difference in the lives of \nwomen and their families across this country. I encourage the entire \nSenate to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 2127. A bill for the relief of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor settlement of certain claims against the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, almost seven years ago, I stood before \nyou to submit a resolution ``to provide an opportunity for the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada to have the merits of their claims against \nthe United States determined by the United States Court of Federal \nClaims.''\n  That bill was submitted as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the \nPottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and \nprovide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable \nthe Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, \nif any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.\n  Earlier this year, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims \nreported back that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate \nand credible legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement stipulation, the \nUnited States has taken the position that it would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to settle the claims of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor the sum of $1,830,000. This settlement amount was reached by the \nparties after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. \nIndependently, the court concluded that the settlement amount is ``not \na gratuity'' and that the ``settlement was predicated on a credible \nlegal claim.'' Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States, \nCong. Ref. 94-1037X at 28 (Ct. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000) (Report of \nHearing Officer).\n  The bill I introduce today is to authorize the appropriation of those \nfunds that the United States has concluded would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will \nfinally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that has for \nfar too long been denied.\n  For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical \nbackground that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian \nPottawatomi.\n  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the \ndescendant groups, successors-in-interest, of the historical \nPottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the \n18th Century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the \nUnited States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is \nnow the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. \nFrom 1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional \nland of the Pottawatomi Nation through a series of treaties of cession, \nmany of these cessions were made under extreme duress and the threat of \nmilitary action. In exchange, the Pottawatomis were repeatedly made \npromises that the remainder of their lands would be secure and, in \naddition, that the United States would pay certain annuities to the \nPottawatomi.\n  In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal policy of \nremoval, an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional \nlands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that \neffort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomis to cede \nthe remainder of their traditional lands, some five millions acres in \nand\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\naround the city of Chicago and remove themselves west. For years, the \nPottawatomis steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of their tribal \nterritory. Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by settlers seeking \nmore land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi with orders to \nextract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty Commissioners \nspent two weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics, including \nthreats of war, in an attempt to get the Pottawatomis to agree to cede \ntheir territory. Finally, those Pottawatomis who were present relented \nand on September 26, 1993, they ceded their remaining tribal estate \nthrough what would be known as the Treaty of Chicago. Seventy-seven \nmembers of the Pottawatomi Nation signed the Treaty of Chicago. Members \nof the ``Wisconsin Band'' were not present and did not assent to the \ncession.\n  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the \nUnited States would give to the Pottawatomis five million acres of \ncomparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar \nwith the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. \nBut the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and \nunilaterally switched the land to five million acres in Iowa. The \nTreaty Commissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to \nthe Iowa land. All but seven of the original 77 signatories refused to \naccept the change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied \n``justice would be done. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago was \nratified as amended by the Senate in 1834. Subsequently, the \nPottawatomis sent a delegation to evaluate the land in Iowa. The \ndelegation reported back that the land was ``not fit for snakes to live \non.''\n\n  While some Pottawatomis removed westward, many of the Pottawatomis \nparticularly the Wisconsin Band, whose leaders never agreed to the \nTreaty, refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to \nforcefully remove Pottawatomis who remained in the east with \ndevastating consequences. As is true with many other American Indian \ntribes, the forced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of \nthe Pottawatomi were forcefully removed by mercenaries who were paid on \na per capita basis government contract. Over one-half of the Indians \nremoved by these means died en route. Those who reached Iowa were \nalmost immediately removed further to inhospitable parts of Kansas \nagainst their will and without their consent.\n  Knowing of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomis including most \nof those in the Wisconsin Band vigorously resisted forced removal. To \navoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin Band \nultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often \npursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries \nor both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments \ndisclose that many Pottawatomis were forced to leave their homes \nwithout their horses or any of their possessions other than the clothes \non their backs.\n  By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any \nPottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of \nthe Wisconsin Band, those still in their traditional territory and \nthose forced to flee to Canada, petitioned Congress for the payment of \ntheir treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all \nother cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864 (13 Stat. 172) the \nCongress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit the annuities \nby not removing and directed that the share of the Pottawatomi Indians \nwho had refused to relocate to the west should be retained for their \nuse in the United States Treasury. (H.R. Rep. No. 470, 64th Cong., p. \n5, as quoted on page 3 of memo dated October 7, 1949). Nevertheless, \nmuch of the money was never paid to the Wisconsin Band.\n  In 1903, the Wisconsin Band, most of whom now resided in three areas, \nthe States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario, \npetitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of \nannuities as required by the law and treaties. (Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th \nCong., 2d Sess.) By the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 380), the \nCongress directed the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims \nmade by the Wisconsin Band and estabish a role of the Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomis that still remained in the East. In addition, the Congress \nordered the Secretary to determine ``the [Wisconsin Bands] \nproportionate shares of the annuities, trust funds, and other moneys \npaid to or expended for the tribe to which they belong in which the \nclaimant Indians have not shared, [and] the amount of such monies \nretained in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the \nclamant Indians as directed the provision of the Act of June 25, \n1864.''\n  In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of Interior \ndirected Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster \ndocumented 2007 Wisconsin Pottawatomis: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan \nand 1550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of \nannuities for the Pottawatomis in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 \nand that the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada was $1,517,226. The Congress thereafter enacted a \nseries of appropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to \nsatisfy most of money owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nresiding in the United States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nwho resided in Canada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.\n  Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and \ncontinuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this \ncongressional reference, they had never been provided their day in \ncourt. In 1910, the United States and Great Britain entered into an \nagreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both \ncountries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective \njurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to \n1938, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their \nclaim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing \ninternational matters of the period, including the intervention of \nWorld War I, the Pottawatomis then came to the U.S. Congress for \nredress of their claim.\n\n  In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established \nthe Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their \nlong-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA) \ngranted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type \ninvolved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis from both sides \nof the border, brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission \nfor recovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 \n(Ind. Cl. Comm. Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims \nCommission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim \nruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of \nIndians living outside territorial limits of the United States. \nHannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. Cl. 823 (1950). The claim \nof the Wisconsin Band residing in the United States that was filed in \nthe Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the \nWisconsin Band by the U.S. Claims Court in 1983. Hannahville Indian \nCommunity v. United States, 4 Ct. Cl. 445 (1983). The Court of Claims \nconcluded that the Wisconsin Band was owed a member's proportionate \nshare of unpaid annuities from 1838 through 1907 due under various \ntreaties, including the Treaty of Chicago and entered judgment for the \nAmerican Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis for any monies not paid. Still the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada was excluded because of the jurisdictional \nlimits of the ICCA.\n  Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate and \nafter careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited \nday in court through the congressional reference process. The court has \nnot reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the \npayment that this bill would make constitutes a ``fair, just and \nequitable'' resolution to this claim.\n  The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 \nyears. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their \nclaim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our \ngovernment made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs \nof the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nwilling to admit when it has left unfulfilled an obligation and that \nthe United States is willing to do what we can to see that justice, so \nlong delayed, is not now denied.\n  Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National \nCongress of American Indians, the oldest, largest and most-\nrepresentative tribal organization here in the United States, the \nAssembly of First Nations, which includes all recognized tribal \nentities in Canada, and each and every of the Pottawatomi tribal groups \nthat remain in the United States today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 2128. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n600 West Capitol Avenue in Little Rock, Arkansas, as the ``Richard S. \nArnold United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environmental \nand Public Works.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, to name the \nFederal courthouse in Little Rock after the Honorable Richard S. \nArnold, a beloved Federal judge from our home state. Our legislation \nhas strong support from members of the Federal judiciary in Arkansas \nand I am honored to help lead this effort in the Senate. Like so many \nArkansans who have the good fortune to know Judge Arnold personally, I \nbelieve it is appropriate to recognize such a respected scholar and \nmember of the legal community in this manner.\n  Judge Richard Arnold has served his country and the judiciary with \nrare distinction first at the District Court level and more recently as \nChief Judge for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Arnold was \nappointed by President Carter in October 1978 to the District Bench for \nthe Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas and was elevated to the \nCourt of Appeals in 1980. Judge Arnold took senior status in April, \n2001 after he turned 65.\n  While serving as a member of the Federal judiciary, Judge Arnold has \nearned a national reputation as a brilliant, fair and effective judge. \nIn 1999, Judge Arnold was the winner of the highly prestigious Edward \nJ. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award. This honor is \npresented annually to a Federal judge who has achieved an exemplary \ncareer and has made significant contributions to the administration of \njustice, the advancement of the rule of law, and the improvement of \nsociety as a whole.\n  Judge Arnold has also received the prestigious Meador-Rosenberg Award \nfrom the American Bar Association for his work and dialogue with \nmembers of Congress about the problems facing the Federal courts during \nhis service as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Judicial \nConference of the United States. The award, which has only been \npresented three times since its inception in 1994, was presented \nthrough the ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judicial Improvements.\n  Judge Arnold received a Classical Diploma from Phillips Exeter \nAcademy in 1953. He graduated from Yale with a B.A., summa cum laude, \nin 1957. Afterwards, Judge Arnold attended the Harvard Law School where \nhe received the Sears Prize for achieving the best grades in the first-\nyear class and the Fay Diploma for being first academically in his \ngraduating class. Judge Arnold concluded his formal education upon \nreceiving his LL.B. from Harvard magna cum laude in 1960.\n  After law school, Judge Arnold served as a law clerk to Justice \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr. Arnold then practiced law in Washington, D.C., \nand Texarkana, Arkansas. Prior to his appointment to the bench, Judge \nArnold worked for the Honorable Dale Bumpers while Bumpers was Governor \nof Arkansas and a United States Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF RICHARD S. ARNOLD UNITED STATES \n                   COURTHOUSE.\n\n       The United States courthouse located at 600 West Capitol \n     Avenue in Little Rock, Arkansas, and any addition to the \n     courthouse that may hereafter be constructed, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Richard S. Arnold United States \n     Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the United States \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the Richard S. Arnold United States Courthouse.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, throughout a long career on the \nFederal bench, Judge Richard Sheppard Arnold has exhibited tremendous \nintegrity and commitment to public service. I am honored to join my \ncolleague from Arkansas in introducing legislation to designate the \nFederal Courthouse in Little Rock, Arkansas, as the Judge Richard S. \nArnold United States Courthouse.\n  Finishing toward the top of his class both at Yale College and at \nHarvard Law School, Judge Arnold began his legal career as a Law Clerk \nto Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. In October of 1978, President Carter appointed him to the \nDistrict Bench for the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas, and \nhe was soon elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit in 1980. There he served as Chief Judge from 1992 \nthrough 1998. Since April of 2001, Judge Arnold has served as Senior \nU.S. Circuit Judge for the Eight Circuit.\n  For the duration of his service on the bench, Judge Arnold has \nmaintained a reputation as a true gentleman who possesses a keen \nintellect. Perhaps the finest measure of a man, however, is found in \nhis friends. Judge Arnold has many. It was the entire bench of the \nEastern District of Arkansas that came up with the proposal to name the \ncourthouse in his honor, and nearly every day my mail includes a letter \nfrom a Judge in Arkansas championing this designation. Such unqualified \nsupport at the end of a long career is truly remarkable.\n  Judge Arnold has certainly earned the honor this legislation would \nbestow. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting the designation \nof the Little Rock, Arkansas, Federal Court House as the Judge Richard \nS. Arnold United States Courthouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2129.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust \nthe dollar amounts used to calculate the credit for the elderly and the \npermanently disabled for inflation since 1985; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce three pieces \nof legislation that combined are an important step in creating a fairer \nand simpler Internal Revenue Code. These bills simplify the tax filing \nprocess and/or reduce the tax burden for the self employed, home-based \nservice workers, the elderly and the disabled. These proposals are \nconsistent with recommendations contained in the 2001 Taxpayer \nAdvocate's Report and need our attention in Congress this year.\n  The first piece of legislation will address a problem that negatively \nimpacts many recipients and providers of state supported home-based \nservice programs. Under current law, depending on the manner in which \nStates manage their home-based service programs, these workers are \nsometimes treated for Federal income tax purposes as independent \ncontractors instead of employees. This improper classification results \nin these workers being responsible for paying all of the payroll taxes \nowed on payments received for their services instead of paying only \nhalf as would be required if they were properly treated as employees. \nIn other States, the home-based\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nservice worker is treated as an employee, but the recipients of the \nservice, generally the disabled and/or elderly, are treated as the \nemployer thereby making them responsible for remitting payroll taxes \nfor the worker. My first proposal would correct these inconsistent \ntreatments and, for tax purposes, deem all home-based service workers \nto be employees. At the same time, it would deem the State or State-\nfunded organization to be the employer. These changes will \nsignificantly reduce inadvertent tax filing errors and make certain \nthat the elderly and disabled are not responsible for payroll taxes for \ntheir State supported home-based care. It will also guarantee that \nhome-based care service workers will only pay their share of payroll \ntaxes and not be burdened with paying the employer's share as well.\n  The second piece of legislation that I am introducing would allow \nself-employed workers to treat their expenses related to the purchase \nof health insurance in the same fashion as those workers who receive \ntheir health insurance on a pre-tax basis through their employer. Under \ncurrent law, self-employed workers are required to remit payroll taxes \non the amounts they pay for their health insurance coverage. This \nlegislation would remove this inequity and allow the self-employed to \nreduce their net earnings by the cost of their health insurance for \npurposes of determining their payroll tax liability for the year. This \nproposal is another step in an effort to make sure that health \ninsurance is an affordable option for all self-employed workers and \ntheir families.\n  The final piece of legislation that I am introducing would increase \nthe number of taxpayers who would be eligible for the existing tax \ncredit for the elderly and disabled as well as raise the amount that \nsome would receive. This tax credit was created to guarantee that the \nelderly and disabled are able to support themselves when their Social \nSecurity or other non-taxable pensions are insufficient to cover their \nmodest expenses. Since 1983, however, the amounts used to calculate the \navailability and amount of this credit have not been increased. By not \nindexing this provision for inflation, the number of taxpayers claiming \nthis credit has dropped substantially. In 1998, the most recent year \navailable from the IRS, 180,473 taxpayers claimed the credit as \ncompared to 339,818 in 1990. This proposal would raise the limits of \nthis credit to the level it would currently be at if the provision had \nbeen indexed for inflation starting in 1983 as well index it going \nforward.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in advancing these pieces of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the three bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 35. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to protect the rights of crime \nvictims; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, National Crime Victims' Rights Week \nbegins on Sunday.\n  Next week, communities across the country will be holding \nobservances, candlelight vigils, rallies, and other events to honor and \nsupport crime victims and their rights.\n  Also, in just a few days--specifically, April 19--we will mark the \n7th anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building \nin Oklahoma City.\n  That attack resulted in the deaths of 168 people.\n  And it was just over seven months ago that, over a period of two \nhours and three minutes, we suffered the deadliest act of domestic \nterrorism in our history.\n  Over 3,000 people died in the attacks on that day--more than died at \nPearl Harbor.\n  Thus, it seems appropriate for all of us in this esteemed body to \nstop a minute and think about victims' rights.\n  Last year, the Senate debated a proposed constitutional amendment \ndrafted by Senator Kyl and me to protect the rights of victims of \nviolent crime.\n  The amendment had been reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \non a strong bipartisan vote of 12 to 5.\n  After 82 Senators voted to proceed to consideration of the amendment, \nthere was a vigorous debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Some Senators raised concerns about the amendment, saying that it was \ntoo long or that it read too much like a statute.\n  Ultimately, in the face of a threatened filibuster, Senator Kyl and I \ndecided to withdraw the amendment.\n  We then hunkered down with constitutional experts such as Professor \nLarry Tribe of Harvard Law School to\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\nsee if we could revise the amendment to meet Senators' concerns. We \nalso worked with constitutional experts at the Department of Justice \nand the White House.\n  And we have come up with a new and improved draft of the amendment.\n  This new amendment provides many of the same rights as the old \namendment.\n  Specifically, the amendment would give crime victims the rights to be \nnotified, present, and heard at critical stages throughout their case.\n  It would ensure that their views are considered and they are treated \nfairly.\n  It would ensure that their interest in a speedy resolution of the \ncase, safety, and claims for restitution are not ignored.\n  And it would do so in a way that would not abridge the rights of \ndefendants or offenders, or otherwise disrupt the delicate balance of \nour Constitution.\n  There are many reasons why we need a constitutional amendment.\n  First, a constitutional amendment will balance the scales of justice.\n  Currently, while criminal defendants have almost two dozen separate \nconstitutional rights--fifteen of them provided by amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution--there is not a single word in the Constitution about \ncrime victims.\n  These rights trump the statutory and state constitutional rights of \ncrime victims because the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the \nland.\n  To level the playing field, crime victims need rights in the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  In the event of a conflict between a victim's and a defendant's \nrights, the court will be able to balance those rights and determine \nwhich party has the most compelling argument.\n  Second, a constitutional amendment will fix the patchwork of victims' \nrights laws.\n  Eighteen states lack state constitutional victims' rights amendments. \nAnd the 32 existing state victims' rights amendments differ from each \nother.\n  Also, virtually every state has statutory protections for victims, \nbut these vary considerably across the country.\n  Only a federal constitutional amendment can ensure a uniform national \nfloor for victims' rights.\n  Third, a constitutional amendment will restore rights that existed \nwhen the Constitution was written.\n  It is a little know fact that at the time the Constitution was \ndrafted, it was standard practice for victims--not public prosecutors--\nto prosecute criminal cases.\n  Because victims were parties to most criminal cases, they enjoyed the \nbasic rights to notice, to be present, and be heard.\n  Hence, it is not surprising that the Constitution does not mention \nvictims.\n  Now, of course, it is extremely rare for a victim to undertake a \ncriminal prosecution.\n  Thus, victims have none of the basic procedural rights they used to \nenjoy.\n  Victims should receive some of the modest notice and participation \nrights they enjoyed at the time that the Constitution was drafted.\n  Fourth, a constitutional amendment is necessary because mere state \nlaw is insufficient.\n  State victims' rights laws lacking the force of federal \nconstitutional law are often given short shrift.\n  A Justice Department-sponsored study and other studies have found \nthat, even in states with strong legal protections for victims; rights, \nmany victims are denied those rights. The studies have also found that \nstatutes are insufficient to guarantee victims' rights.\n  Only a federal constitutional amendment can ensure that crime victims \nreceive the rights they are due.\n  Fifth, a constitutional amendment is necessary because federal \nstatutory law is insufficient.\n  The leading statutory alternative to the Victims' Rights Amendment \nwould only directly cover certain violent crimes prosecuted in Federal \ncourt. Thus, it would slight more than 99 percent of victims of violent \ncrime.\n  We should acknowledge that Federal statutes have been tried and found \nwanting. It is time for us to amend the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Oklahoma City bombing case offers another reason why we need a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  This case shows how even the strongest Federal statute is too weak to \nprotect victims in the face of a defendant's constitutional rights.\n  In that case, two Federal victims' statutes were not enough to give \nvictims of the bombing a clear right to watch the trial and still \ntestify at the sentencing--even though one of the statutes was passed \nwith the specific purpose of allowing the victims to do just that.\n  Let me quote from the first of these statutes: the Victims of Crime \nBill of Rights, passed in 1990. That Bill of rights provides in part \nthat:\n  A crime victim has the following rights: The right to be present at \nall public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court \ndetermines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if \nthe victim heard other testimony at trial.\n  That statute further states that Federal Government officers and \nemployees ``engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of \ncrime shall make their best efforts to see that victims of crime are \naccorded the[se] rights.''\n  The law also provides that ``[t]his section does not create a cause \nof action or defense in favor of any person arising out of the failure \nto accord to a victim the[se] rights.''\n  In spite of the law, the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case \nruled--without any request from Timothy McVeigh's attorneys--that no \nvictim who saw any portion of the case could testify about the \nbombing's impact at a possible sentencing hearing:\n  The Justice Department asked the judge to exempt victims who would \nnot be ``factual witnesses at trial'' but who might testify at a \nsentencing hearing about the impact of the bombing on their lives.\n  The judge denied the motion.\n  The victims were then given until the lunchbreak to decide whether to \nwatch the proceedings or remain eligible to testify at a sentencing \nhearing.\n  In the hour that they had, some of the victims opted to watch the \nproceedings; others decided to leave to remain eligible to testify at \nthe sentencing hearing.\n  Subsequently, the Justice Department asked the court to reconsider \nits order in light of the 1990 Victims' Bill of Rights. Bombing victims \nthen filed their own motion to raise their rights under the Victims' \nBill of Rights.\n  The court denied both motions. With regard to the victims' motion, \nthe judge held that the victims lacked standing.\n  The judge stated that the victims would not be able to separate the \n``experience of trial'' from the ``experience of loss from the conduct \nin question.'' The judge also alluded to concerns about the defendants' \nconstitutional rights, the common law, and rules of evidence.\n  The victims and DOJ separately appealed to the Court of Appeals for \nthe Tenth Circuit.\n  That court ruled that the victims lacked standing under Article III \nof the Constitution because they had no ``legally protected interest'' \nto be present at trial and thus had suffered no ``injury in fact'' from \ntheir exclusion.\n  The victims and DOJ then asked the entire Tenth Circuit to review \nthat decision.\n  Forty-nine members of Congress, all six attorneys general in the \nTenth Circuit, and many of the leading crime victims' organizations \nfiled briefs in support of the victims. All to no avail.\n  The Victims' Clarification Act of 1997 was then introduced in \nCongress.\n  That act provided that watching a trial does not constitute grounds \nfor denying victims the chance to provide an impact statement. This \nbill passed the House 414 to 13 and the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  Two days later, President Clinton signed it into law, explaining that \n``when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the \ncriminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.''\n  The victims then filed a motion asserting a right to attend the trial \nunder the new law.\n  However, the judge declined to apply the law as written.\n  He concluded that ``any motions raising constitutional questions \nabout this legislation would be premature and would present questions \nissues that are not now ripe for decision.''\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\n  Moreover, he held that it could address issues of possible \nprejudicial impact from attending the trial by interviewing the \nwitnesses after the trial.\n  The judge also refused to grant the victims a hearing on the \napplication of the new law, concluding that his ruling rendered their \nrequest ``moot.''\n  The victims then faced a painful decision: watch the trial or \npreserve their right to testify at the sentencing hearing.\n  Many victims gave up their right to watch the trial as a result.\n  A constitutional amendment would help ensure that victims of a \ndomestic terrorist attack such as the Oklahoma City bombing have \nstanding and that their arguments for a right to be present are not \ndismissed as ``unripe.''\n  A constitutional amendment would give victims of violent crime an \nunambiguous right to watch a trial and still testify at sentencing.\n  There is strong and wide support for a constitutional amendment.\n  I am pleased that President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have \nendorsed the amendment. I greatly appreciate their support.\n  And I am also pleased that both former President Clinton and former \nVice President Gore have all expressed support for a constitutional \namendment on victims' rights.\n  Moreover, in the last Congress, the Victims' Rights Amendment was \ncosponsored by a bipartisan group of 41 Senators.\n  I have spoken to many of my colleagues about the amendment we \nintroduce today and I am hopeful that it will receive even more support \nin this Congress. In addition:\n  Both the Democratic and Republican Party platforms call for a \nvictims' rights amendment.\n  Governors in 49 out of 50 states have called for an amendment.\n  Four former U.S. Attorneys General, including Attorney General Reno, \nsupport an amendment. Attorney General Ashcroft supports an amendment.\n  Forty state attorneys general support an amendment.\n  Major national victims' rights groups--including Parents of Murdered \nChildren, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, MADD, and the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance--support the amendment.\n  Many law enforcement groups, including the Nation Troopers' \nCoalition, the International Union of Police Associations AFL-CIO, and \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, support an amendment.\n  Constitutional scholars such as Harvard Law School Professor Larry \nTribe support an amendment.\n  The amendment has received strong support around the country. Thirty-\ntwo states have passed similar measures--by an average popular vote of \nalmost 80 percent.\n  I am delighted to join my good friend Senator Jon Kyl in sponsoring \nthe Victims' Rights Amendment, and I look forward to its adoption by \nthis Congress.\n  I think it is probably well known in this body that Senator Kyl and I \nhave authored what is called the victim's rights constitutional \namendment. One of the most perplexing things about the history of this \namendment has been that everybody outside of this Chamber supports it. \nGovernors support it. Attorneys general support it. Democratic \ncandidates support it. Republican candidates support it. But when it \ncame down to the fine discussion on this floor, we were told, well, it \nis too pedantic. Well, there are too many words--well, well.\n  Senator Kyl and I have hunkered down. We have gone back to our \nconstitutional experts on this side of the aisle: Professor Larry \nTribe, who has been a very active participant in drafting this, and \nSteve Twist representing the victims, and many victims' organizations, \nas well as Paul Cassell, show has worked with us on this amendment.\n  We have essentially redone the victims' rights constitutional \namendment, really based on comments made on the floor. It is now \nsuccinct. It has a much more poetic flow to it. We believe it is an \nimproved amendment. We are introducing it at this time because next \nweek communities around the country will be holding observances, \ncandlelight vigils, rallies, and other events to honor and support \ncrime victims and their rights.\n  In just a few days--specifically April 19--we will mark the seventh \nanniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in \nOklahoma City. That attack resulted in the deaths of some 168 people.\n  I would like to very quickly read from a study that was conducted by \nthe Department of Justice, the Office of Justice Programs, on this \nparticular subject because I think their findings are significant.\n  Let me read one of them. I quote:\n\n       Nevertheless, serious deficiencies remain in the nation's \n     victims' rights laws as well as their implementation.\n\n  The Presiding Officer will remember when we passed two statutes to \nclarify victims' rights as a product of the Oklahoma City bombing. The \njudge ignored them. Then we passed another one. It went to the \nappellate court, and the appellate court found that the victims were \nwithout standing in the Constitution. Of course, that is what we are \ntrying to remedy here. Thirty-two States have passed victims' rights \nState amendments. They are all different. Sometimes they are observed \nand sometimes they are not.\n  Their report goes on to say:\n\n       The rights of crime victims vary significantly among States \n     and at the Federal level. Frequently, victims' rights are \n     ignored. Even in States that have enacted constitutional \n     rights for victims, implementation is often arbitrary and \n     based on the individual practices and preferences of criminal \n     justice officials. Moreover, many States do not provide \n     comprehensive rights for victims of juvenile offenders.\n\n  Let me go on to the recommendation of the Department of Justice. I \nquote:\n\n       A Federal constitutional amendment for victims' rights is \n     needed for many different reasons, including: One, to \n     establish a consistent floor of rights for crime victims in \n     every State and at the Federal level; two, to ensure the \n     courts engage in a careful and conscientious balancing of the \n     rights of victims and defendants; three, to guarantee crime \n     victims the opportunity to participate in proceedings related \n     to crimes against them; and, four, to enhance the \n     participation of victims in the criminal justice process.\n       A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only \n     legal measure strong enough to rectify the current \n     inconsistencies in victims' rights laws that vary \n     significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the State \n     and Federal level.\n\n  I know Senator Kyl would like to address himself to this measure. His \nleadership has been unparalleled. It has been a great delight for me to \nwork with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank Senator Feinstein for her work on \nthis amendment for several years now. She was tremendously helpful in \nworking with the past administration. She and I have both worked with \nvarious victims groups. I think they rightly regard her as a champion \nof victims' rights in this country.\n  She mentioned that next week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. \nIt begins Sunday. It is fitting that we could introduce this \nlegislation today because tomorrow, at a ceremony at the Department of \nJustice, it is my understanding there will be a very important \nannouncement by the President and the Attorney General with respect to \nthis amendment.\n  Just to be very brief about our support for this amendment at this \ntime, I will simply address the differences between this year's \namendment and last year's amendment.\n  Even though last year's amendment to the Constitution had 40 \ncosponsors and was bipartisan, and was considered--incidently, I \nappreciate the efforts of the distinguished Presiding Officer as \nchairman of the committee, the Judiciary Committee. We had a strong \nbipartisan vote of 12 to 5 for this amendment out of the Judiciary \nCommittee last year. I appreciate the Presiding Officer's assistance in \nthat, notwithstanding some differences of opinion with respect to the \nspecifics of the amendment.\n  We withdrew the bill from consideration on the floor when we knew it \nwould be the subject of prolonged discussion--we shall put it that \nway--and agreed to consider the criticism of some of the opponents at \nthat time that the phrasing of the language was not elegant enough and \nperhaps too wordy.\n  Now, the constitutional amendment contains 12 key lines of text with \nrespect to the rights of victims. There are another 10 lines of text \nthat provide for exceptions or caveats to that grant of constitutional \nprotection. I\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\nthink the language much more closely approximates the other amendments \nto the U.S. Constitution.\n  I thank Professor Laurence Tribe for his consideration, expertise, \nand assistance in developing the language toward that end. I am hopeful \nmy colleagues will give a close look at this new protection. The rights \nprotected are essentially the same, but I think the way in which it is \ndone is more in line with other constitutional amendments. I am hopeful \nwe will have an opportunity to make a substantive case for this \namendment and to discuss in detail, with our colleagues, the reasons \nfor our desire that we get a vote on it this year.\n  I will just conclude by noting--especially because starting Sunday we \nwill be celebrating National Crime Victims' Rights Week--the number of \ngroups that are represented here in Washington to participate in \nvarious presentations and celebrations of National Crime Victims' \nRights Week and who will also be participating in the meeting tomorrow \nat the Department of Justice.\n  Supporters include the National Governors Association, which has \nvoted in favor of an amendment. Both the Republican and Democratic \nParty platforms of the last Presidential election and their nominees \nsupported such an amendment. It is supported by major national victims' \nrights groups, including Parents of Murdered Children, Mothers Against \nDrunk Driving, and the National Organization for Victim Assistance, in \naddition to the Stephanie Roper Foundation, the Arizona Voice for the \nCrime Victims, Crime Victims United, and Memory of Victims Everywhere.\n  And especially, in addition to Senator Feinstein and the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, who has been very helpful in helping us \nformulate the specific wording of the amendment, I thank the National \nOrganization for Victims Assistance, the National Constitutional \nAmendment Network, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Parents of Murdered \nChildren, Roberta Roper, and the Stephanie Roper Foundation, and Steve \nTwist, who has been enormously supportive in working the language and \ncoordinating the efforts with these various victims' rights groups. \nSteve is a lawyer in Phoenix, AZ, and has been indispensable in my \nefforts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Senator Feinstein has asked that I have \nprinted in the Record a letter dated April 15, 2002, from Laurence H. \nTribe to Senator Feinstein and myself. I will just read two excerpts \nfrom it, conclude my remarks, and submit it for the Record.\n  Professor Tribe says:\n\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kyl:\n       I think that you have done a splendid job at distilling the \n     prior versions of the Victims' Rights Amendment into a form \n     that would be worthy of a constitutional amendment--an \n     amendment to our most fundamental legal charter, which I \n     agree ought never be altered lightly. . . .\n       How best to protect that right without compromising either \n     the fundamental rights of the accused or the important \n     prerogatives of the prosecution is not always a simple \n     matter, but I think your final working draft of April 13, \n     2002, resolves that problem in a thoughtful and sensitive \n     way, improving in a number of respects on the earlier drafts \n     that I have seen. Among other things, the greater brevity and \n     clarity of this version makes it more fitting for inclusion \n     in our basic law. That you achieved such conciseness while \n     fully protecting defendants' rights and accommodating the \n     legitimate concerns that have been voiced about prosecutorial \n     power and presidential authority is no mean feat. I happily \n     congratulate you both on attaining it.\n\n  I would say, editorially, not without substantial help from Professor \nTribe himself.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                Harvard University\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                    Cambridge, MA, April 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kyl: I think that you have done \n     a splendid job at distilling the prior versions of the \n     Victims' Rights Amendment into a form that would be worthy of \n     a constitutional amendment--an amendment to our most \n     fundamental legal charter, which I agree ought never to be \n     altered lightly. I will not repeat here the many reasons I \n     have set forth in the past for believing that, despite the \n     skepticism I have detected in some quarters both on the left \n     and on the right, the time is past due for recognizing that \n     the victims of violent crime, as well as those closest to \n     victims who have succumbed to such violence, have a \n     fundamental right to be considered, and heard when \n     appropriate, in decisions and proceedings that profoundly \n     affect their lives.\n       How best to protect that right without compromising either \n     the fundamental rights of the accused or the important \n     prerogatives of the prosecution is not always a simple \n     matter, but I think your final working draft of April 13, \n     2002, resolves that problem in a thoughtful and sensitive \n     way, improving in a number of respects on the earlier drafts \n     that I have seen. Among other things, the greater brevity and \n     clarity of this version makes it more fitting for inclusion \n     in our basic law. That you achieved such conciseness while \n     fully protecting defendants' rights and accommodating the \n     legitimate concerns that have been voiced about prosecutorial \n     power and presidential authority is no mean feat. I happily \n     congratulate you both on attaining it.\n       A case argued two weeks ago in the Supreme Judicial Court \n     of Massachusetts, in which a woman was brutally raped a \n     decade and a half ago but in which the man who was convicted \n     and sentenced to a long prison term has yet to serve a single \n     day of that sentence, helps make the point that the legal \n     system does not do well by victims even in the many states \n     that, on paper, are committed to the protection of victims' \n     rights. Despite the Massachusetts Victims' Bill of Rights, \n     solemnly enacted by the legislature to include an explicit \n     right on the part of the victim to a ``prompt disposition'' \n     of the case in which he or she was victimized, the \n     Massachusetts Attorney General, to who has yet to take the \n     simple step of seeking the incarceration of the convicted \n     criminal pending his on-again, off-again motion for a new \n     trial--a motion that has not been ruled on during the 15 \n     years that this convicted rapist has been on the streets--has \n     taken the position that the victim of the rape does not even \n     have legal standing to appear in the courts of this state, \n     through counsel, to challenge the state's astonishing failure \n     to put her rapist in prison to begin serving the term to \n     which he was sentenced so long ago.\n       If this remarkable failure of justice represented a wild \n     aberration, perpetrated by a state that has not incorporated \n     the rights to victims into its laws, then it would prove \n     little, standing alone, about the need to write into the \n     United States Constitution a national commitment to the \n     rights of victims. Sadly, however, the failure of justice of \n     which I write here is far from aberrant. It represents but \n     the visible tip of an enormous iceberg of indifference toward \n     those whose rights ought finally to be given formal federal \n     recognition.\n       I am grateful to you for fighting this fight. I only hope \n     that many others can soon be stirred to join you in a cause \n     that deserves the most widespread bipartisan support.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Laurence H. Tribe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2682-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 240--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n        COUNSEL IN AARON RAISER V.

Madam President, a resident of Utah has commenced a civil \naction against the Senate, Senator Daschle, and Senator Lott in Federal \ncourt in Utah to challenge the Senate's procedures for handling \njudicial nominations. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the \npractice of nominations that have not been reported out of committee \nover the past 5 years not being voted on by the full Senate violates \nthe Senate's constitutional duty to advise and consent to nominations. \nThe plaintiff asks the court to order the Senate to change its rules \nfor considering judicial nominations.\n  The Senate's practices for handling controversial nominations present \na subject appropriate for robust debate both within the Senate and \namong the public at large. However, they do not present a justiciable \nissue for the courts in this case. This resolution would authorize the \nSenate Legal Counsel to represent the defendants in this action to \nprotect the Senate's prerogative to fashion its own rules for the \nexercise of its confirmation duties under the Constitution.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 241 submitted earlier today by \nSenators Rockefeller, Byrd, and Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 241) designating April 11, 2002, as \n     ``National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, it is my pleasure to join my \ncolleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Byrd to introduce a resolution \ndesignating April 11, 2002 as National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Day. I \nhave long been a supporter of alternative fuels and alternative fuel \nvehicles because they contribute to our nation's energy independence \nand provide needed environmental benefits.\n  The transportation sector accounts for more than 65 percent of the \npetroleum consumed in the United States. Reducing the amount of \npetroleum used by the transportation sector by encouraging greater use \nof alternative fuel vehicles and fuels will improve our energy security \nand bring the added benefit of reducing emissions from that sector of \nthe economy. As the price of gasoline continues to rise, these facts \nare perhaps more relevant than ever before.\n  Adoption of this Resolution will enhance a national event this \nThursday, April 11, 2002, organized by industry leaders, educational \ninstitutions, Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) coalitions, and others. \nThe event, called National AFV Day Oydssey, is a public awareness event \nbeing held in more than 50 locations in 31 states nationwide with more \nthan 72 organizations. Thousands of people will participate all over \nthe country. The purpose of the event is to build awareness and \nenthusiasm for AFV's as a viable option for consumer and fleet \ntransportation.\n  The debate over energy security and national security issues has been \nat the forefront of policy discussions in recent months. We must, as a \nnation, continue searching for alternatives to our dependence on \nforeign oil. Supporting these existing and new environmentally friendly \ntransportation choices will reduce our oil use and help prevent the \nenvironmental damage being done by conventional cars, trucks, and vans.\n  Alternative fuel vehicles offer the opportunity for continued \npersonal mobility while significantly reducing the harm done to the \nenvironment. Nearly 100 cities across the U.S. fail to meet federal air \nquality standards, and approximately 62 million people live in counties \nwhere monitored data show unhealthy air for one or more of the six \n``criteria'' pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, ozone, \nparticulate matter, and sulfur dioxide).\n  For many urban areas, alternative fuel vehicles can be a particularly \nimportant means to substantially reduce emissions of mobile source \npollutants, including volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen \nthat are the precursors of smog. When integrated into America's \ntransportation network in meaningful quantities, alternative fuels--\nsuch as electricity, ethanol, hydrogen, natural gas, methanol and \npropane--can contribute to mitigating the environmental problems caused \nby the transportation sector.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 241) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 241\n\n       Whereas the energy security of the United States needs to \n     be strengthened to prevent future terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the United States needs to reduce its dependence on \n     foreign oil;\n       Whereas the United States needs to improve its air quality \n     by reducing emissions from the millions of motor vehicles on \n     the Nation's roads;\n       Whereas the United States needs to foster national \n     expertise and technological advancement in cleaner \n     alternative fuel vehicles;\n       Whereas the people of the United States need more choices \n     in cleaner transportation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States need to know that \n     alternative fuel vehicles are a positive choice for \n     transportation; and\n       Whereas it is in the public interest of the United States \n     to foster the support for new and existing technologies that \n     offer more environmentally friendly transportation choices \n     for the people of the United States during peacetime or \n     wartime: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 11, 2002 as ``National Alternative \n     Fuel Vehicle Day'';\n       (2) proclaims ``National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Day'' as \n     a day to promote programs and activities that will lead to \n     the greater use of cleaner transportation in the United \n     States; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation, calling \n     upon interested organizations and the people of the United \n     States--\n       (A) to promote programs and activities that take full \n     advantage of the new and existing technologies in cleaner \n     alternative fuel vehicles; and\n       (B) to foster public interest in the use of cleaner \n     alternative fuel vehicles through the dissemination of \n     information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/15/senate-section/article/S2687-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2687-S2688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXTENDING BIRTHDAY GREETINGS AND BEST WISHES TO LIONEL HAMPTON\n\n  Mr. REID.
