Mr. President, at 10:30 we will vote on the nomination of \nReena Raggi to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit. \nFollowing that vote, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil noon. We are expecting to go out of session shortly thereafter.\n  This is in preparation for next week which will be a very busy week. \nEveryone should understand that. Next week could be a very big week. We \nare going to do everything we can to complete work on the homeland \nsecurity bill. I have tried previously, in the form of unanimous \nconsent, and have been unsuccessful, but we really need to move off the \nInterior appropriations bill. It is obvious, because of the forest feud \nthat is in that legislation, that that bill is not going to go forward. \nWe should not be wasting the morning standing around here doing \nnothing.\n  I hope the minority will allow us, by consent, to spend all day each \nday next week on the homeland security bill so we can finish that bill. \nThe two or three big amendments on that legislation have not yet been \noffered. We expect that to happen early next week. Later today, we will \nreoffer the unanimous consent request that we temporarily set aside the \nInterior bill and move on to the homeland security bill on a full-time \nbasis. That would be the thing to do.\n  I have said before--and I really believe this to be the case; I sadly \nsay this--that the minority is working toward our accomplishing \nnothing. They simply don't want us to complete the other appropriation \nbills. We have asked to be able to move off Interior and to go to \nanother appropriations bill. They won't let us do that. They said there \nwould be no more two-tracking of legislation, which is fine. But at\n\n[[Page S8958]]\n\nleast they should let us move off Interior so we can have full days on \nhomeland security.\n\n  The President says he wants this legislation. His wants cannot be \naccomplished unless we are able to legislate on a full-time basis on \nit. Once we get started on something, we are back on Interior doing \nnothing. It takes time to get revved up again on homeland security. I \nhope that can be accomplished today, that we can get off Interior.\n  It seems quite clear that the efforts to arrive at a compromise have \nfailed. People have tried hard, and certainly no one is to be faulted, \nbut sometimes we have issues that are irreconcilable. In the Senate, \nsimple majorities don't solve problems that are irreconcilable; it \ntakes 60 votes. The proposition that the majority has offered can't get \n60 votes. The proposition of the minority can't get 60 votes. It would \nbe in the best interest of the country that we move off that \nlegislation. Maybe later someone will come up with some kind of a \nbrainstorm to figure some way out of it, but at this stage we have not \nbeen able to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8958-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 10:29 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession and consider Executive Calendar No. 1006, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Reena Raggi, \nof New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will confirm the \nnomination of Judge Reena Raggi to the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. This is the 14th circuit court nominee to be \nconsidered by the Senate since the change in Senate majority and \nreorganization of the Judiciary Committee 14 months ago. That is an \naverage of one Court of Appeals judge a month since the Democratic \nmajority has been in place. This pace is almost double that maintained \nby the Republicans during their 6\\1/2\\ years of control of the Senate. \nThis is also the 78th judicial nominee we have confirmed in the past 14 \nmonths.\n  In contrast, our Republican predecessors voted on only 46 of \nPresident Clinton's more moderate Court of Appeals nominations in their \n76 months of control for an average of closer to one circuit court \nconfirmation every other month. In fact, during the entire 1996 session \nthe Senate Republicans stalled all Court of Appeals nominees and not a \nsingle one was confirmed. Court of Appeals vacancies went from 16, when \nthe Republicans took over in January 1995, to 33 by the time they \nfinally relinquished control last summer and allowed the Judiciary \nCommittee to reorganize. During the Republican stall on judicial \nconfirmations, vacancies more than doubled on the Courts of Appeals. \nHowever, since last summer, the Democratic majority has exceeded the \nrate of attrition and confirmed 14 circuit court judges, in addition to \n64 district court judges. Even with extraordinary attrition of 10 new \ncircuit vacancies during this period, we have lowered the number of \nCourt of Appeals vacancies from the 41 it would have been if Democrats \nwere blocking judges as Republicans falsely claim, to 27.\n  There are now fewer circuit court vacancies than when the 107th \nCongress began. Republicans confirmed no circuit court nominees or any \njudicial nominees during their 6 months of control last year. They \ncould have confirmed some of the nine circuit judges re-nominated by \nPresident Clinton, if they were truly concerned about the circuit court \nvacancy level. They could have done that to demonstrate some commitment \nto fairness and the bipartisanship they claim. But they did not. The \nPresident could have urged that those circuit court nominees be \nconfirmed to demonstrate true bipartisanship and to address the \ninjustices of the stalling tactics of the members of his party in the \nSenate. He did not. Instead, he withdrew all those circuit court \nnominees last spring then later renominated only one of them, \noccasioning more needless delay.\n  I would like to reflect on what could have been, but for the \npurposeful obstruction by Republican Senators of the confirmation of \nmore than a score of President Clinton's circuit court nominees. If \nRepublicans had not blocked the confirmation of almost two dozen, 22, \ncircuit court nominees, and many more district court nominees, \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee would have begun with 11 circuit \ncourt vacancies, instead of the 33 we inherited. With the 10 new \ncircuit court vacancies that arose over these past 14 months, there \nwould have been a total of 24 circuit court vacancies for this \nPresident to fill. Given the Democratic pace of considering circuit \ncourt nominees, even without any significant cooperation or \nconsultation from the White House, our circuit courts would today be \nleft with only 10 vacancies. That is what might have been, but for the \ndetermined, strategic blocking of so many circuit court nominees during \nthe 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate. Instead, after 14 \ncircuit confirmations, there remain 27 circuit court vacancies--still \nfewer than at the start of this Congress but far from where we could \nhave been.\n  The Judiciary Committee has already voted on 83 of this President's \njudicial nominees, including 17 nominees to the Courts of Appeal. Two \nadditional circuit court nominees have had hearings and another is \nscheduled for a hearing this coming week. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has already voted on more circuit and district court nominees \nthan in any of the previous 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. In \nfact, Democrats have given votes to more judicial nominees and, in \nparticular, to more nominees to the Courts of Appeals, than in 1996 and \n1997 combined, and than in the last 30 months of the Republican \nmajority control in 1999, 2000 and early 2001.\n  Judge Raggi was appointed to the Federal trial court in 1987 by \nPresident Ronald Reagan. She has a solid record of accomplishment in \nboth the private and public sectors. She received the strong support of \nher two Democratic Senators, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, \nand of the New York legal community. Even though Judge Raggi is a \nconservative Republican, we have every reason to believe that she will \nserve with distinction on the Second Circuit as a fair and impartial \njudge.\n  Her record is in sharp contrast to the record of the other circuit \ncourt nominee that the Judiciary Committee considered on the very same \nday: Justice Priscilla Owen, a nominee whose record was too extreme \neven for the very conservative Texas Supreme Court. Justice Owen's \nwritten opinions demonstrated her willingness to substitute her policy \npreferences for those of the Texas legislature and her determination to \ndistort precedent. Even her fellow judges criticized her approach.\n  The administration's claim that Democrat's have created a glass \nceiling for female judicial nominees is patently ridiculous. It is \nunfortunate that just 21 percent of President George W. Bush's judicial \nnominees are women, in contrast to 30 percent of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees. The percentage of women nominated by this President \nhas been cut by almost a third compared with the prior administration. \nIn fact, so far, President\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\nGeorge W. Bush is appointing almost the same proportion of women to the \nFederal bench as his father, despite the passage of more than a decade \nsince then in which the number of women practicing law and with \njudicial experience has increased exponentially.\n  With today's vote, the Democratic-led Senate has already confirmed 17 \nfemale judicial nominees of this President, including four to the \nCourts of Appeal Judge Edith Brown Clement to the Fifth Circuit, the \nfirst nominee to be confirmed to that court in more than 6 years; Judge \nJulia Smith Gibbons to the Sixth Circuit, the first nominee to be \nconfirmed to that court in more than 5 years; Judge Sharon Prost to the \nFederal Circuit; and now Judge Reena Raggi to the Second Circuit. In \nall, Democrats have held hearings for 19 of the women nominated to the \nFederal bench by this President, and 18 of them have been voted on by \nthe Judiciary Committee. A few of the remaining female nominees lack \nhome-State consent, and some were nominated only recently and so lack \ncompleted paperwork. This Democratic-led Senate has regularly scheduled \nhearings and votes, unlike during the prior 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican \ncontrol when so many women and minorities nominated to the Federal \nbench were never accorded hearings or votes.\n  Today's vote serves as another example of the Democrats ' proven \nrecord of action and fairness on this President's judicial nominees. \nJudge Raggi is a conservative Republican. I voted for her confirmation \nin committee and vote to confirm her today, based on her overall \nrecord, her testimony before the committee and the bipartisan support \nshe has received. Far from payback for Republican actions in the recent \npast, today's Democratic-led Senate's action is being taken \nnotwithstanding those wrongs and to help fill vacancies that Republican \nobstruction helped create.\n  Despite the right-wing and partisan din about blockades and \nobstructionism, Democrats are actually achieving almost twice as much \nas our Republican counterparts did to provide judicial resources to the \nFederal courts. We would be even farther along if so many circuit court \nnominees of the prior administration had not been purposely blocked and \ndefeated, and if we received more timely reviews from the ABA, and \nreceived the nominations of more moderate, mainstream judicial \nnominees.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \ntaken up the nomination of Judge Reena Raggi to the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. She is a truly exceptional nominee with wide and well \ndeserved bipartisan support.\n  We first became aware of Judge Raggi's outstanding credentials \nfifteen years ago, when the Senate confirmed to her nomination as a \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of New York. She received her \nBachelor of Arts degree from Wellesley College and went on to graduate \ncum laude from Harvard Law School. She clerked for Judge Thomas E. \nFairchild, then Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit, before working as an associate at the law firm of \nCahill, Gordon & Reindel.\n  She then entered public service in Brooklyn, New York as an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She quickly rose \nthrough the ranks of the U.S. Attorney's Office, first to become head \nof the Narcotics Unit, then Chief of Special Prosecutions, which is in \ncharge of prosecuting public corruption. In 1986, the Eastern District \nBoard of Judges appointed here interim United States Attorney pending \nthe Senate confirmation of a presidential nominee. A year later, Judge \nRaggi was nominated and confirmed as a district court judge.\n  That was 15 years ago. Today, I am proud to say that Judge Raggi has \ncontinued to serve as a jurist of the highest level of excellence. In \nfact, for the first 7 years of her tenure as a district judge, she was \nthe least reversed judge in the Second Circuit.\n  Judge Raggi has presided over some of the most famous and infamous \ncases to be tried in New York's Federal court. Recently, she was the \njudge in the civil rights prosecution of former New York City police \nofficer Charles Schwartz for the sexual battery of Abner Louima. We are \nall sadly familiar with the facts of Mr. Louima's case: While in police \ncustody, officers savagely beat him in the bathroom of a New York City \nprecinct house. This case was ramanded to Judge Raggi's court by the \nSecond Circuit for retrial following the death of the original trial \ncourt judge. The retrial resulted in a perjury conviction against Mr. \nSchwartz.\n  Judge Raggi also presided over the trial of Thomas ``Tommy Karate'' \nPitera, the first Federal death penalty case in New York in three \ndecades.\n  Beginning in 1993, Judge Raggi presided over a series of cases \nstemming from the alien smuggling scandal of the ``Golden Venture,'' a \nfreighter that ran aground in Rockaway, NY. Almost 300 illegal aliens \ntransported in deplorable conditions had to swim for shore, and 10 of \nthe passengers died escaping the ship. The judge in 1994 rejected plea \nbargains reached by the government with seven of the Golden Venture \ndefendants, finding that sentences of between 12 to 30 months in prison \ndid not ``adequately do justice'' because the terms did not reflect the \nseriousness of the crimes.\n  Judge Raggi also played a significant role in the war against \nterrorism. In 1998, she oversaw the trial of Palestinian terrorist Gazi \nAbu Mezer, who was convicted of plotting a subway bombing aimed at \nJews. The judge sentenced Mr. Mezer to life in prison.\n  All of this hard work and dedication to the law is reflected in Judge \nRaggi's ABA rating of unanimously ``Well Qualified.'' This rating, of \ncourse, is the highest that the ABA awards. Her excellence has been \nreflected by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' invitation to have \nher sit by designation on many of its panels.\n  Clearly, Judge Raggi represents the very best in our Nation's judges \nand will be an outstanding addition to the Second Circuit. I look \nforward to voting in favor of her nomination and hearing of her \naccomplishments in the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Reena Raggi, of New York, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit? The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli), and the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Wellstone) and are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of \ngreat concern to my constituents and, indeed, to our entire country--\nthe state of our Nation's economy. We know our economy was already in \nrecession on September 10 and it was devastated on September 11 by the \nhorrific attacks we suffered, and it is stalled now. Too many Americans \nare out of work. Too many have seen their pension and retirement \nsecurity disappear because of the illegal, unethical, and simply \ninexplicable behavior of corporate executives. Too many people who lost \ntheir jobs as a result of September 11 have not yet been able to find \nwork.\n  Let me just mention one of the hundreds of thousands--millions of \nsuch people: A New Yorker by the name of Felix Batista. Mr. Batista had \nworked for years, 25 years I believe, as a member of the wait staff at \nthe restaurant known as Windows On The World at the top of the World \nTrade Center. He has four children. He was on vacation on September 11 \nwhen 73 of his coworkers were murdered. He lost not only friends and \ncolleagues, he lost his job, and he has been unemployed since that \nterrible day. He is a man who had a wonderful employment record who now \nspends his days looking for work. He exhausted his unemployment \nbenefits almost 3 months ago. How is he going to support his four \nchildren? He is a victim of the terrorist attacks on New York and \nAmerica, and he is not alone.\n  Like so many other New Yorkers and Americans, despite their steadfast \nefforts to find work, and their overwhelming desire to get back to \nwork, they remain out of work, struggling to make ends meet. In New \nYork, there are 135,000 New Yorkers who have exhausted their benefits. \nAcross the country, the number of people who have been unemployed for 6 \nmonths or longer has almost doubled, from 800,000 to 1.5 million in the \nlast year, and that number is expected to increase to more than 2 \nmillion by December.\n  What have we, the elected representatives of all the people, \nincluding the people who are unemployed, the people such as Felix who \nhave lost their jobs--what have we done to respond? We have extended \nunemployment benefits once--but only once. Contrast that with the \nrecession of the early 1990s when Congress extended temporary benefits \nfive times. But this year, even in the wake of the combination of a \nslowdown in the economy and terrorism, we have only extended benefits \nonce. Once is not enough. Congress must act to extend unemployment \ninsurance and disaster unemployment assistance for an additional 13 \nweeks each.\n  With more people losing their benefits every day and being put into \nthe terrible position in which Mr. Batista finds himself, these \nextensions should be passed before Congress adjourns.\n  The Wall Street Journal says our economy is in the midst of a \n``jobless recovery.'' From what I hear, that phrase is only half true.\n  Across New York State, 553,000 New Yorkers are out of work, and the \nsame story is true of company layoffs and plant closings in Niagara \nFalls, Rochester, and so many parts of New York.\n  Unfortunately, this is a story that is compounded by the corporate \nirresponsibility and illegality. They have added even more uncertainty \nto our economic condition. We not only are seeing plants closing and \npeople losing their jobs because there is no business and there are no \norders, but we are also in Rochester seeing 500 people out of work \nafter Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy.\n  If there is any doubt that the economic situation is not producing \njobs for people, take a look at this chart. It shows the number of jobs \nthat are available compared with the number of people who are looking \nfor work. As you can clearly see, during most of 2002, jobseekers far \noutnumbered job availability. In fact, in June, there were almost three \njobseekers for every available job.\n  When President Bush took office in January 2001, there were \napproximately 1.5 jobseekers for every job. In just a short year and a \nhalf, we have gone from one job opening for every one and a half \nunemployed person to one job opening for nearly three unemployed \npersons.\n  But only looking at the statistics and the unemployment rate doesn't \npaint a complete picture. The constituents that I talk to in New York \ndescribe an endless, frustrating job search--that hopeless feeling that \ncomes when you go out every day and read the want ads and follow up \nevery single lead. These are people who are young and old and middle-\naged. They are male, they are female, they are skilled and unskilled; \nthey are white, they are black, and they are Latino. They are every \nkind of American. They want to work. But until this economy turns \naround, they need additional help.\n  The so-called jobless recovery has hit long-term unemployed workers \nparticularly hard. The number of people who cannot find jobs for 6 \nmonths or longer has grown by almost 90 percent in the past year. In \nfact, the share of the unemployed today who have been without work for \nmore than 26 weeks exceeds that of the recession of the early 1990s and \nthe early 1980s.\n  According to a recent study, ``an increase in the long term \nunemployment of workers with significant workforce experience'' is \nparticularly striking. But why should we be surprised? We have \ncompanies such as Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and Tyco that are \nlaying off, going into bankruptcy, and rendering unemployed highly \nskilled workers--people who got their education, went to college, and \nimproved their skills. They were part of the new economy, and, all of a \nsudden, they find themselves on the unemployment lines.\n  What this means for real Americans is that people who are trying \nhard, who have played by the rules, who have been responsible, and, \nthrough no fault of their own--a corporate executive who commits \nillegalities, or a terrorist who destroys a building--are now \nunemployed.\n  The number of workers who have exhausted their benefits has doubled \ncompared to 2 years ago. The number of workers who have exhausted their \nState benefits is 2.3 million, more than we had 10 years ago during the \nrecession of the early 1990s.\n\n  As you can see from this chart, the number of workers exhausting \ntheir unemployment benefits without a job has risen steadily since last \nspring. If you are wondering what this means for individual States, I \nhave information about every State in our country. This is not just a \nNew York problem. This is a national problem. We may have the highest \nnumber of people who have exhausted their benefits, but, of course, you \nwould expect that. We lost tens of thousands of jobs because of the \nattack and the collapse of the buildings. Because it was a crime scene, \nthey couldn't reopen and get back into business.\n  Our unemployment rate in New York City is 8 percent--higher than the \nnational average--unfortunately reflecting a condition that affects all \nAmericans.\n  Back in the recession of the early 1990s when the first President \nBush was in office, people who were unfortunate enough to lose their \njobs got a compassionate response from the White House. The first \nPresident Bush said: You\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\nknow, I am going to be there to help you. And, working with the \nCongress, that is exactly what happened. We extended unemployment \nbenefits five times.\n  Are the people today less deserving? Are the workers who lost their \njobs because of corporate illegality, economic slowdown, or terrorist \nattacks somehow not worthy of our help? I don't think so. I certainly \nhope not.\n  As you can see from this chart, which has a lot of writing on it, \nbasically the bottom line is that during the early stage of the \nrecession in the 1990s, 35 States received 26 weeks of benefits, and 16 \nreceived 33 weeks. And it is so clear that today during our recession \nwe only have 39 States getting 13 weeks of benefits and 12 receiving \n26.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This is not only a comparison--it should cause us to \nwonder what our national policy is--it is also a reflection of how we \nhave no economic policy in America right now. We don't have an emphasis \non creating jobs, prosperity, and economic opportunity.\n  Our leader, Senator Daschle, came to the floor earlier this week and, \nin a series of charts, made clear that we are not attending to \nAmerica's business. We all know we have foreign policy challenges. I, \nfor one, have supported our men and women in uniform and supported our \nneed for homeland security. I will continue to do so because our \nthreats are real, and we have to deal with them. But we are a great \nnation. We can do more than one thing at a time. We should be paying \nattention to our economy. We should be taking care of our unemployed \nworkers. It is the right thing to do. I hope we will do it because it \ntakes care of people.\n  Look at this next chart. Every dollar we spend on unemployment \ninsurance adds $2.50 to our gross domestic product. It is a good \ninvestment. Why? Because when the unemployed get those benefits--when \nMr. Batista and others like him finally get some help--what do they do? \nThey go out and spend it. They have no other means. They have to buy \nfood, they have to pay the rent, and they have to make a car payment. \nThe money goes right into the economy, and it provides stimulus.\n  In contrast, President Bush's solution is to stimulate the economy \nfor the wealthiest--keep giving them big tax cuts and hope that it \ntrickles down to people such as Mr. Batista. That didn't work in the \n1980s, it didn't work in the 1990s, and it will not work in the 21st \ncentury, either.\n  I believe the President is using the wrong approach. Our economy \nneeds to help people. It needs to stimulate jobs. And we owe it to the \nunemployed such as Mr. Batista to act now.\n  Finally, obviously, I believe our economic policy during the 1990s \nworked for all Americans--the rich, middle income, and poor. It \nprovided more than 22 million new jobs. We were on the right track in \nAmerica when it came to the economy. For reasons that escape me, we \nthrew all of that good work away, and now we are back into the \ndeficits. We are not taking care of the unemployed. We are not creating \njobs. And I don't think we have any plan to do so.\n  I earnestly request that our colleagues here take leadership and \nsupport our unemployed people. Do what was done in the 1990s, provide \nthese benefits, stimulate the economy, and let us get back on the right \ntrack for America's future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor an additional 15 minutes over and above the order that has been \nentered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8961-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8961-S8964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call attention to an article in the \nWashington Post of September 15, Sunday, the final edition. I shall \nread excerpts therefrom. The headline: ``In Iraqi War Scenario, Oil Is \nKey Issue; U.S. Drillers Eye Huge Petroleum Pool.'' The article is by \nDan Morgan and David B. Ottaway, Washington Post staff writers.\n  I will proceed now with reading the first three paragraphs:\n\n       A U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would \n     open a bonanza for American oil companies long banished from \n     Iraq, scuttling oil deals between Baghdad and Russia, France \n     and other countries, and reshuffling world petroleum markets, \n     according to industry officials and leaders of the Iraqi \n     opposition.\n       Although senior Bush administration officials say they have \n     not begun to focus on the issues involving oil and Iraq, \n     American and foreign oil companies have already begun \n     maneuvering for a stake in the country's huge proven reserves \n     of 112 billion barrels of crude oil, the largest in the world \n     outside Saudi Arabia.\n       The importance of Iraq's oil has made it potentially one of \n     the administration's biggest bargaining chips in negotiations \n     to win backing from the U.N. Security Council and Western \n     allies for President Bush's call for tough international \n     action against Hussein. All five permanent members of the \n     Security Council--the United States, Britain, France, Russian \n     and China--have international oil companies with major stakes \n     in a change of leadership in Baghdad.\n       ``It's pretty straightforward,'' said former CIA director \n     R. James Woolsey, who has been one of the leading advocates \n     of forcing Hussein from power. ``France and Russia have oil \n     companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if \n     they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent \n     government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new \n     government and American companies work closely with them.'' \n     But he added: ``If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it \n     will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the \n     new Iraqi government to work with them.''\n       Indeed, the mere prospect of a new Iraqi government has \n     fanned concerns by non-American oil companies that they will \n     be excluded by the United States, which almost certainly \n     would be the dominant foreign power in Iraq in the aftermath \n     of Hussein's fall.\n\n  Are you listening? Out there in America, are you listening?\n  Let me say that again, with reference to former CIA Director R. James \nWoolsey:\n\n       But he added: ``If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it \n     will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the \n     new Iraqi government to work with them.''\n       Indeed, the mere prospect of a new Iraqi government has \n     fanned concerns by non-American oil companies that they will \n     be excluded by the United States--\n\n  Hear that--\n\n     which almost certainly would be the dominant foreign power in \n     Iraq in the aftermath of Hussein's fall.\n\n  Are we paying attention?\n\n       Representatives of many foreign oil concerns have been \n     meeting with leaders of the Iraqi opposition to make their \n     case for a future stake and to sound them out about their \n     intentions.\n       Since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, companies from more \n     than a dozen nations, including France, Russia, China, India, \n     Italy, Vietnam and Algeria, have either reached or sought to \n     reach agreements in principle to develop Iraqi oil fields, \n     refurbish existing facilities or explore undeveloped tracts. \n     Most of the deals are on hold until the lifting of U.N. \n     sanctions.\n       But Iraqi opposition officials made clear in interviews \n     last week that they will not be bound by any of the deals.\n\n  It is a lengthy article, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, let me call attention to an editorial \nin today's Charleston, WV, Gazette, titled, ``Bush, Cheney won't \nstop.''\n  And I read therefrom:\n\n       Although Iraq agreed to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors, \n     President Bush and Vice President Cheney still are clamoring \n     for U.S. military action to topple dictator Saddam Hussein.\n       The White House continues its mantra--\n\n  Now listen. This is the Charleston, WV, Gazette.\n\n       The White House continues its mantra that war is necessary \n     because Saddam is ``evil'' and he's secretly making weapons \n     of mass destruction. But this justification may be a smoke \n     screen.\n\n  Are you listening? Are you listening, the people out there throughout \nthis great land? Are you listening?\n\n     . . . this justification may be a smoke screen. Some \n     observers say the administration's hidden motive is to gain \n     control of Iraq's oil.\n       In a front-page Sunday report subtitled ``U.S. Drillers Eye \n     Huge Petroleum Pool,'' The Washington Post said America's oil \n     industry--to which Bush and Cheney are closely tied--eagerly \n     wants a ``regime change'' in\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\n     Iraq so U.S. firms can begin drilling into Iraq's vast, 112-\n     billion-barrel reserve.\n\n  So the Charleston Gazette of today calls attention to the Washington \nPost article which I have already read and have included in the Record, \nthe Washington Post article of last Sunday.\n  Continuing with the Gazette editorial:\n\n       The White House supports the London-based Iraqi National \n     Congress, an umbrella organization of exiled Iraqi groups \n     seeking to remove Saddam. INC [Iraqi National Congress] \n     leader Ahmed Chalabi told the Post [the Washington Post] \n     that, when a new regime is installed in Baghdad, ``American \n     companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil.''\n       The Washington [Post] quoted former CIA Director James \n     Woolsey:--\n\n  And I have also referred to his remarks. But let me continue with the \nCharleston Gazette editorial:\n\n       Amazing!\n\n  In referring to what Mr. Woolsey was saying, the Gazette said:\n\n       Amazing. This implies that Bush's war urge isn't about \n     ``evil'' or weapons. It's about oil.\n\n  ``It's about oil.''\n\n       Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Cynthia Tucker said \n     the White House war demands are ``tainted with the sickening \n     smell of gasoline.''\n\n  Now, that was the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That is a Georgia \npaper that is known and read nationwide and internationally.\n  Let me read what that column said again:\n\n       Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Cynthia Tucker said \n     the White House war demands are ``tainted with the sickening \n     smell of gasoline.''\n\n  Further reading from the Charleston Gazette of today:\n\n       ``If the Bush administration invades Iraq,'' she wrote--\n\n  Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Cynthia Tucker--\n\n     ``future scholars will look back on this period and name the \n     period for what it was: the Petroleum Wars. . . . What but \n     oil could possibly explain the Bush administration's stubborn \n     insistence on attacking Saddam Hussein, who had no connection \n     to the atrocities of Sept. 11?''\n       Senator Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has taken the lead in \n     questioning President Bush's warplans.\n       We hope that he and colleagues in Congress try to learn \n     whether the White House war cry is designed to serve \n     America's oil industry.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Gazette editorial in \nits entirety be printed in the Record at the close of my remarks today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have an \nadditional 10 minutes, if needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the Nation is committed to war, \nbefore we send our sons and daughters to battle in faraway lands, there \nare critical questions that must be asked, and it is not unpatriotic to \nask questions.\n  To date, the answers from the administration have been less than \nsatisfying. After weeks of criticism from Congress and, indeed, from \nthe countries of the world, President Bush went to the United Nations \nto press his case that Iraq posed a serious threat to the peace and \nsecurity of the globe. But instead of offering compelling evidence that \nthe Iraqi regime had taken steps to advance its weapons program to the \npoint that it is necessary for the United States to deliver an \nunprovoked attack on a sovereign state--namely, Iraq--the President \noffered the U.N. more of a warning than an appeal for support.\n  Instead of using the forum of the U.N. General Assembly to offer \nevidence and proof of his claims, the President basically told the \nnations of the world that ``you are either with me or against me.''\n  ``Do not question this stand,'' the President said. If the U.N. is \nunwilling to act, then ``by heritage and by choice, the United States \nof America will make that stand.''\n  While Mr. Bush tried to play the role of an international prosecutor, \nhis case was at best circumstantial. He did a fine job in laying out \nthe facts with regard to the failure of the United Nations to uphold \nand take more compelling action in upholding its previous resolutions. \nHe made a fine statement in that regard. He made it clear that the \nUnited Nations had not enforced its resolutions. Sixteen resolutions \nhad been adopted by that agency.\n  But in the days that followed that address, the administration \nofficials have attempted to provide some answers to the looming \nquestion. However, this week, when asked by the House Armed Services \nCommittee members what was new, what was compelling to force the hand \nof this Nation against Saddam Hussein, Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld offered nothing new. He pointed to the terrorist acts of \nSeptember 11 as compelling reason, and he said:\n\n       The last thing we want is a smoking gun. A gun smokes after \n     it has been fired. The goal must be to stop Saddam Hussein \n     before he fires a weapon of mass destruction against our \n     people.\n\n  Well, he said the same thing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on yesterday. He said: We are being asked what is new.\n  He said: What is new? September 11.\n  Well, September 11 is not all that new, Mr. President, September 11 \nwas 365 plus 9 days, in other words, 374 days ago. That is not so new.\n  With reference to Mr. Rumsfeld's statement concerning a smoking gun, \nwhen he said, ``The last thing we want is a smoking gun. A gun smokes \nafter it has been fired''--my concern, Mr. President, is that the \nUnited States, in forcing war in Iraq, will end up shooting itself in \nthe foot. Unless proper care and deliberation precede any action, we \nmust not be hell-bent on an invasion until we have exhausted every \nother possible option to assess and eliminate Iraq's supposed weapons \nof destruction program.\n  The United States must not act alone. The United States must have the \nsupport of the world.\n  Yesterday, the administration sent to Congress a draft resolution to \nauthorize the use of American military might against Iraq. In that \nresolution, President Bush requests approval to ``use all means'' he \ndetermines to be appropriate. In other words, the President is saying: \nAuthorize me, the President, authorize the President to ``use all \nmeans'' he, the President, determines to be appropriate.\n  Congress must not hand this administration or any other \nadministration a blank check for military action, period. What Congress \nneeds is solid evidence. What we need are answers. Does Saddam Hussein \npose an imminent threat to the United States? Should the United States \nact alone as this administration has been threatening to do? Should \nCongress grant the President authority to launch a preemptive attack on \nIraq? What would be the repercussions in the Middle East? What would be \nthe repercussions around the globe?\n  How many civilians would die in Iraq? How many American men and women \nwould be involved? Will even greater numbers of National Guardsmen and \nReserves be called up to prepare for an invasion? And if they are, what \nwill happen to the war on terrorism here at home? Will troops be \nshifted from other missions to support a war against Iraq?\n  We have 8,500 men and women in Afghanistan. We have forces in the \nPhilippines, in Bosnia, in Kosovo and in many other places throughout \nthe world. What are we going to do, pull all of them out of those \nfaraway places and use them in an unprovoked attack on the sovereign \nstate of Iraq?\n  How do we afford this war? The gulf war cost $61 billion. The gulf \nwar of a decade ago cost $61 billion. Of that, other countries coughed \nup, in cash and in contributions in kind, $54 billion, leaving, I \nbelieve, roughly $7 billion, the cost to American taxpayers.\n  Now, what would it cost this time if other nations are not helping \nthe United States to bear the financial burden? Bruce Lindsey, the \nPresident's economic adviser, says it might cost $100 billion or $200 \nbillion. And then he said: $100 billion why, that is nothing. He is \nquoted in the press as saying: $100 billion? That is nothing. Yet, this \nadministration won't get its feet out of the concrete and head out of \nthe sand when it comes to raising the top line for Congress to be able \nto utilize in passing 13 appropriations bills and sending them to the \nPresident--not\n\n[[Page S8963]]\n\nwilling to agree to $9 billion more than the President's foot-in-\nconcrete figure of $759 billion.\n  Congress needs $768 billion. The House chairman, Mr. Young, and this \nchairman in the Senate, and Senator Ted Stevens, ranking member on the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, have agreed, and others agreed--and \nthis Senate has agreed--it should be $768 billion. There is a $9 \nbillion gap between what the President says and what the Congress needs \nto meet the needs of the people. I am talking about veterans' care, \neducation, homeland security, and so on, these are the needs.\n  Congress would require--and has already reported bills out of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee which assume the figure $768 billion. \nThe President and his OMB Director say, no, $759 billion; that is all. \nSo, here we are--stuck; 13 appropriations bills are stuck because of \nthe administration's immovability in dealing with the needs of the \nAmerican people here at home.\n  The Administration, says: No, we won't accept that. Hence, we have 13 \nappropriations bills stuck.\n  Lawrence Lindsey has reportedly said, with reference to a war against \nIraq: ``Oh, that might cost $100 billion or $200 billion. $100 billion? \nWell, that is nothing.'' That is the attitude of this administration. \nThat is the attitude of this administration.\n  Has the United States ruled out responding with nuclear weapons \nshould Saddam Hussein use chemical or biological weapons against our \nsoldiers? Does Saddam Hussein have the capability to unleash weapons of \nmass destruction within the United States? Does the United States have \nadequate military and intelligence resources to fight a war in \nAfghanistan and a war in Iraq while, at the same time, mobilizing \nresources to prevent or defend against attack within our own shores? \nWhat will happen to this war here at home?\n  What will happen to homeland security if the President unleashes an \nunprovoked attack on Iraq? Does anyone believe there would not be any \nrepercussions here at home? We have terrorists within our midst in this \ncountry. They are all about us. The FBI arrested six in New York just \nrecently. So the FBI is on the job. The FBI is working to defend this \ncountry. But what else might happen? Are we focused too greatly on \nfighting suspected terrorism overseas, while focusing too little on the \nthreat of terrorism here at home? What is going to happen to the needs \nof this country--the monetary needs and the needs with respect to \nsecurity of our nuclear plants? What is going to happen at our ports of \nentry and on our borders? What is going to happen within our midst if \nthe President launches an unprovoked attack on Iraq?\n  These are questions--and there are many more questions--that will be \nasked. If it is unpatriotic to ask questions, then I am unpatriotic. Is \nit unpatriotic to ask questions, when this President is seeking powers \nthat have never been given to any other President?\n  On September 19, yesterday, the President sent to Congress his \nsuggested text for a resolution to authorize war with Iraq. The \nproblems with this proposed resolution are numerous. When taken as a \nwhole, this resolution would constitute the broadest possible grant of \nwar powers to any President in the history of our Republic. The \nPresident has inherent powers under the Constitution to repel a sudden, \nunforeseen attack on this Nation--nobody argues with that--but he \ndoesn't have inherent power under that Constitution to launch an \nunprovoked offensive military attack on another nation or state.\n\n  The resolution is an affront to the powers given by the Constitution \nto Congress on matters of war. The first 2 pages of the draft \nresolution have 16 ``whereas'' clauses that would serve to explain the \nintent of Congress--if the resolution were adopted as it is written--in \npassing the resolution for the use of force.\n  These clauses, as conceived by the White House, include numerous \ndistortions of fact. For example, in the ninth ``whereas'' clause, it \nis asserted that the United States has the inherent right, as \nacknowledged in the U.N. Charter, to use force in order to defend \nitself, as if that is a justification for preemptive war. Let me read \nthe relevant section of the U.N. Charter:\n\n       Nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent \n     right of individual or collective self defense if an armed \n     attack occurs against a member of the United Nations until \n     the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain \n     international peace and security.\n\n  That does not seem to justify a preemptive attack. In the 16th \nclause, it is asserted that:\n\n       The President has the authority under the Constitution to \n     use force in order to defend the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n\n  At last, the administration has awakened to the fact that there is \nstill a Constitution. That is the first time that I have ever read \nanything or heard anything from the administration that would invoke \nthe Constitution in this matter. Let's see what they are saying.\n  In the 16th ``whereas'' clause it is asserted that:\n\n       The President has the authority under the Constitution to \n     use force in order to defend the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n\n  Well, that is the broadest reading of the Commander in Chief clause I \nthink I have ever seen. What about the power of the Congress under \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution to declare war? That is not \nmentioned at all in the resolution proposed by the White House.\n  Mr. President, the White House resolution would authorize the \nPresident to use all means that he determines--that he determines. What \na colossus this President is going to become if the Senate gives him \nthis kind of authority. The White House resolution would authorize the \nPresident to use all means that he determines appropriate.\n  What does that mean? What does ``appropriate'' mean here? It would \nauthorize the President to use all means that he--I repeat, that he--\ndetermines appropriate, including forces, to restore international \npeace and security in the region.\n  Mr. President, that is not an authorization for war with Iraq only. \nThat language would allow the President to march our troops into Iran, \nSyria, Lebanon, Yemen, the West Bank, and anywhere else that is part of \nthe Middle East or where the United States has any security interest in \nthe Middle East. I cannot believe the gall and the arrogance of the \nWhite House in requesting such a broad grant of war powers.\n  Mr. President, this is the worst kind of election year politics!\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Sept. 15, 2002]\n\n    In Iraqi War Scenario, Oil Is Key Issue; U.S. Drillers Eye Huge \n                             Petroleum Pool\n\n                  (By Dan Morgan and Davis B. Ottaway)\n\n       A U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could \n     open a bonanza for American oil companies long banished from \n     Iraq, scuttling oil deals between Baghdad and Russia, France \n     and other countries, and reshuffling world petroleum markets, \n     according to industry officials and leaders of the Iraqi \n     opposition.\n       Although senior Bush administration officials say they have \n     not begun to focus on the issues involving oil and Iraq, \n     American and foreign oil companies have already begun \n     maneuvering for a stake in the country's huge proven reserves \n     of 112 billion barrels of crude oil, the largest in the world \n     outside Saudi Arabia.\n       The importance of Iraq's oil had made it potentially one of \n     the administration's biggest bargaining chips in negotiations \n     to win backing from the U.N. Security Council and Western \n     allies for President Bush's call for tough international \n     action against Hussein. All five permanent members of the \n     Security Council--the United States, Britain, France, Russia \n     and China--have international oil companies with major stakes \n     in a change of leadership in Baghdad.\n       ``It's pretty straightforward,'' said former CIA director \n     R. James Woolsey, who has been one of the leading advocates \n     of forcing Hussein from power. ``France and Russia have oil \n     companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if \n     they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent \n     government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new \n     government and American companies work closely with them.'' \n     But he added: ``If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it \n     will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the \n     new Iraqi government to work with them.''\n       Indeed, the mere prospect of a new Iraqi government has \n     fanned concerns by non-American oil companies that they will \n     be excluded by the United States, which almost certainly \n     would be the dominant foreign power in Iraq in the aftermath \n     of Hussein's fall. Representatives of many foreign oil \n     concerns have been meeting with leaders of the Iraqi \n     opposition to make their case for a future stake and to sound \n     them out about their intentions\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\n       Since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, companies form more \n     than a dozen nations, including France, Russia, China, India, \n     Italy, Vietnam and Algeria, have either reached or sought to \n     reach agreements in principle to develop Iraqi oil fields, \n     refurbish existing facilities or explore undeveloped tracts. \n     Most of the deals are on hold until the lifting of U.N. \n     sanctions.\n       But Iraqi opposition officials made clear in interviews \n     last week that they will not be bound by any of the deals.\n       ``We will review all these agreements, definitely,'' said \n     Faisal Qaragholi, a petroleum engineer who directs the London \n     office of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella \n     organization of opposition groups that is backed by the \n     United States. ``Our oil policies should be decided by a \n     government in Iraq elected by the people.''\n       Ahmed Chalabi, the INC leader, went even further, saying he \n     favored the creation of a U.S.-led consortium to develop \n     Iraq's oil fields, which have deteriorated under more than a \n     decade of sanctions. ``American companies will have a big \n     shot at Iraqi oil,'' Chalabi said.\n       The INC, however, said it has not taken a formal position \n     on the structure of Iraq's oil industry in event of a change \n     of leadership.\n       While the Bush adminsitration's campaign against Hussein is \n     presenting vast possibilities for multinational oil giants, \n     it poses major risks and uncertainties for the global oil \n     market, according to industry analysts.\n       Access to Iraqi oil and profits will depend on the nature \n     and intentions of a new government. Whether Iraq remains a \n     member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, \n     for example, or seeks an independent role, free of the OPEC \n     cartel's quotas, will have an impact on oil prices and the \n     flow of investments to competitors such as Russia, Venezuela \n     and Angola.\n       While Russian oil companies such as Lukoil have a major \n     financial interest in developing Iraqi fields, the low prices \n     that could result from a flood of Iraqi oil into world \n     markets could set back Russian government efforts to attract \n     foreign investment in its untapped domestic fields. That is \n     because low world oil prices could make costly ventures to \n     unlock Siberia's oil treasures far less appealing.\n       Bush and Vice President Cheney have worked in the oil \n     business and have long-standing ties to the industry. But \n     despite the buzz about the future of Iraqi oil among oil \n     companies, the administration, preoccupied with military \n     planning and making the case about Hussein's potential \n     threat, has yet to take up the issue in a substantive way, \n     according to U.S. officials.\n       The Future of Iraq Group, a task force set up at the State \n     Department, does not have oil on its list of issues, a \n     department spokesman said last week. An official with the \n     National Security Council declined to say whether oil had \n     been discussed during consultations on Iraq that Bush has had \n     over the past several weeks with Russian President Vladimir \n     Putin and Western leaders.\n       On Friday, a State Department delegation concluded a three-\n     day visit to Moscow in connection with Iraq. In early \n     October, U.S. and Russian officials are to hold an energy \n     summit in Houston, at which more than 100 Russian and \n     American energy companies are expected.\n       Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) said Bush is keenly aware of \n     Russia's economic interests in Iraq, stemming from a $7 \n     billion to $8 billion debt that Iraq ran up with Moscow \n     before the Gulf War. Weldon, who has cultivated close ties to \n     Putin and Russian parliamentarians, said he believed the \n     Russian leader will support U.S. action in Iraq if he can get \n     private assurances from Bush that Russia ``will be made \n     whole'' financially.\n       Officials of the Iraqi National Congress said last week \n     that the INC's Washington director, Entifadh K. Qanbar, met \n     with Russian Embassy officials here last month and urged \n     Moscow to begin a dialogue with opponents of Hussein's \n     government.\n       But even with such groundwork, the chances of a tidy \n     transition in the oil sector appear highly problematic. Rival \n     ethnic groups in Iraq's north are already squabbling over the \n     the giant Kirkuk oil field, which Arabs, Kurds and minority \n     Turkmen tribesmen are eyeing in the event of Hussein's fall.\n       Although the volumes have dwindled in recent months, the \n     United States was importing nearly 1 million barrels of Iraqi \n     oil a day at the start of the year. Even so, American oil \n     companies have been banished from direct involvement in Iraq \n     since the late 1980s, when relations soured between \n     Washington and Baghdad.\n       Hussein in the 1990s turned to non-American companies to \n     repair fields damaged in the Gulf War and Iraq's earlier war \n     against Iran, and to tap undeveloped reserves, but U.S. \n     government studies say the results have been disappointing.\n       While Russia's Lukoil negotiated a $4 billion deal in 1997 \n     to develop the 15-billion-barrel West Qurna field in southern \n     Iraq, Lukoil had not commenced work because of U.N sanctions. \n     Iraq has threatened to void the agreement unless work began \n     immediately.\n       Last October, the Russian oil services company Slavneft \n     reportedly signed a $52 million service contract to drill at \n     the Tuba field, also in southern Iraq. A proposed $40 billion \n     Iraqi-Russian economic agreement also reportedly includes \n     opportunities for Russian companies to explore for oil in \n     Iraq's western desert.\n       The French company Total Fina Elf has negotiated for rights \n     to develop the huge Majnoon field, near the Iranian border, \n     which may contain up to 30 billion barrels of oil. But in \n     July 2001, Iraq announced it would no longer give French \n     firms priority in the award of such contracts because of its \n     decision to abide by the sanctions.\n       Officials of several major firms said they were taking care \n     to avoiding playing any role in the debate in Washington over \n     how to proceed on Iraq. ``There's no real upside for American \n     oil companies to take a very aggressive stance at this stage. \n     There'll be plenty of time in the future,'' said James \n     Lucier, an oil analyst with Prudential Securities.\n       But with the end of sanctions that likely would come with \n     Hussein's ouster, companies such as ExxonMobil and \n     ChevronTexaco would almost assuredly play a role, industry \n     officials said. ``There's not an oil company out there that \n     wouldn't be interested in Iraq,'' one analyst said.\n       Staff writer Ken Bredemeier contributed to this report.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n          [From the Charleston Gazette Online, Sept. 20, 2002]\n\n                   War Fever: Bush, Cheney Won't Stop\n\n       Although Iraq agreed to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors, \n     President Bush and Vice President Cheney still are clamoring \n     for U.S. military action to topple dictator Saddam Hussein.\n       The White House continues its mantra that war is necessary \n     because Saddam is ``evil'' and he's secretly making weapons \n     of mass destruction. But this justification may be a smoke \n     screen. Some observers say the administration's hidden motive \n     is to gain control of Iraq's oil.\n       In a front-page Sunday report subtitled ``U.S. Drillers Eye \n     Huge Petroleum Pool,'' The Washington Post said America's oil \n     industry--to which Bush and Cheney are closely tied--eagerly \n     wants a ``regime change'' in Iraq so U.S. firms can begin \n     drilling into Iraq's vast, 112-billion-barrel reserve.\n       The White House supports the London-based Iraqi National \n     Congress, an umbrella organization of exiled Iraqi groups \n     seeking to remove Saddam. INC leader Ahmed Chalabi told the \n     Post that, when a new regime is installed in Baghdad, \n     ``American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil.''\n       The Washington paper quoted former CIA Director James \n     Woolsey:\n       ``It's pretty straightforward. France and Russia have oil \n     companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if \n     they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent \n     government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new \n     government and American companies work closely with them.''\n       Amazing. This implies that Bush's war urge isn't about \n     ``evil'' or weapons. It's about oil.\n       Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Cynthia Tucker said \n     the White House war demands are ``tainted with the sickening \n     smell of gasoline.''\n       ``If the Bush administration invades Iraq,'' she wrote, \n     ``future scholars will look back on this period and name the \n     period for what it was: the Petroleum Wars. . . . What but \n     oil could possibly explain the Bush administration's stubborn \n     insistence on attacking Suddam Hussein, who had no connection \n     to the atrocities of Sept. 11?''\n       Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has taken the lead in \n     questioning President Bush's war plans.\n       We hope that he and colleagues in Congress try to learn \n     whether the White House war cry is designed to serve \n     America's oil industry.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

I thank the President pro tempore for the \nrecognition, and I thank the Senator from West Virginia, who just \ndelivered a very insightful statement of why the Constitution must be \nprotected and not shredded, why the Constitution must be adhered to in \na protection of the carefully constructed separation of powers which \ngives us the checks and balances that have allowed this Government to \nendure for well over two centuries, to be the strong Government it is \nbecause, as a great British statesman once said: Power corrupts, and \nabsolute power corrupts absolutely.\n  In the 1780s, when those political geniuses gathered to construct a \ndocument upon which this new Nation could be based and the delicate \nchecks and balances were entered, as well as the spirit of compromise \nin that Constitutional Convention, they set off one branch of \nGovernment from the other.\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\n  Thus, as we come to this very serious determination of what to do in \nIraq, we have to be mindful of the Constitution and its separation of \npowers. Clearly, the Constitution gives that awesome and very weighty \nresponsibility of declaring war to the legislative branch of \nGovernment. There was a reason for that: So that no Executive would go \noff on a whim or on ill advice and start war but, rather, that the \nrepresentatives of the people in this body and the body at the other \nend of the U.S. Capitol would be involved in that decisionmaking and, \nin fact, would make that decision and then reflect the will of the \npeople.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for a very cogent and timely \nstatement.\n  There is trouble in the Middle East and central Asia. I have been to \nAfghanistan twice since the first of the year. I have been to Pakistan \ntwice. I have been to India. I have been in the middle of that \nsituation, urging the leaders of India and Pakistan to reduce the \ntensions on the Kashmir border because the last thing the world needs \nis an exchange of nuclear weapons. Particularly, that would hurt us \nbecause both of those countries are helping us in our war against \nterrorism.\n\n  I have been to the Middle East, and that is a troubled part of the \nworld. As we approach this most momentous and solemn occasion about \nwhether or not, in effect, to declare war by giving the President of \nthe United States the authority for the expenditure of funds to conduct \nsuch a war, we must be mindful, and the questions must be answered:\n  What will a war in Iraq do to our war against terrorism? Will it be \nhurt? Will it be helped? Will our war against terrorism be set aside? \nWill our attempt to cut off the head of the snake that operates the al-\nQaida machine be deterred in any way?\n  What will happen to the flow of oil out of that region of the world \nto the industrialized world?\n  What is the number of troops that is going to be required?\n  How likely are the casualties, and how many American lives can we \nexpect to lose.\n  How many troops are we going to have to hold in reserve? Fighting \ndoor to door in downtown Baghdad is going to be a different kind of \nwar, and I do not think we can go into Iraq assuming that the \nopposition is suddenly going to melt away and that the army is going to \nstep forth and suddenly lay down its arms.\n  I personally believe that Saddam Hussein has chemical and biological \nweapons, and I personally think he is trying to develop nuclear \nweapons. If he, in fact, has chemical and biological weapons, will our \ntroops be prepared if those weapons of mass destruction are utilized \nagainst our troops or utilized against any of the neighbors in the \nregion?\n  Are we going to be able to approach a war in Iraq with our allies \nsolidly behind us? There is an election going on right now in Germany, \nand that certainly does not seem to be the political talk in Germany. \nGermany is one of our closest allies.\n  There is also an election going on right now in Turkey, our very \nsubstantial ally. That election is in November. With the talk of war, \nwith the imminent possibility of war, how much of a possibility is \nthere that the election would throw to a religious party the \nopportunity to govern Turkey instead of the secular government that has \ngiven such stability, particularly military stability, in that part of \nthe world?\n  Then the question arises, which I had the opportunity to ask the \nSecretary of Defense yesterday in the Armed Services Committee, what \nabout after there has been the regime change? Is it going to be a \nregime that would be friendly to the United States? Would Iraq be kept \nintact, or would it be ripped asunder?--I might say, to the chagrin of \nour ally Turkey. What is the plan for the United States to be involved \nfor the long term in Iraq, militarily and economically? We saw that in \nthe phenomenal military success we had in Afghanistan--mostly success; \nsome not so successful, such as Tora Bora. We saw that in the midst of \nall of that success, in a much different situation, the hard reality, \nafter the fact, that the United States is going to need to be a \nmilitary and economic presence in Afghanistan for a very long time.\n  Otherwise, if we leave, it will be like when we left in the late \n1980s. After the Soviets got whipped, they tucked their tail between \ntheir legs and left, and we, assisting the victors, also left; it \ncreated a vacuum, and that vacuum was filled by the terrorists.\n  So in any post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, it is going to take a lot of \neffort and time and resources by the United States, and I want to see \nthe administration spell that out clearly, as the Secretary of Defense \nstarted to do yesterday in response to my question. There is a lot of \ndetail to be filled in.\n  It brings us to another question. We have in front of the Senate this \nquestion of homeland defense, and there is not one of us in this \nChamber who does not want to have a reorganization of the Government so \none hand knows better what the other hand is doing, so one hand knows \nbetter how we can coordinate, and a reorganization of the Government \ncan achieve that. In the process, let's not overdo ourselves where we \ntake away worker protections, where we strip apart agencies such as the \nCoast Guard, which is a necessary part of the homeland defense. The \nCoast Guard has a lot of other duties to perform. Particularly, if one \ncomes from a State such as mine that has such tremendous coastline, the \nCoast Guard performs innumerable functions not only of search and \nrescue but of drug interdiction, and of course their duties have been \nheightened so much now on port security.\n  So, as we approach homeland defense, we have a great number of \ndecisions to make about which we had better be cautious. Otherwise, \ngoing back to my initial comments of commendation for the Senator from \nWest Virginia and his comments about Iraq and concern about the \nConstitution being shredded with regard to an invasion of Iraq, so, \ntoo, we have concerns about the Constitution not being obeyed by the \nCongress performing its appropriate legislative role as a check and a \nbalance, as an overseer, as an appropriator of the funds, for this new \nDepartment that is to be created.\n  I offer these comments today, and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his very insightful comments. It is always a pleasure to \nlisten and to learn from the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of \ndescribing some of my concerns with regard to the possible invasion of \nIraq and also the knitting together of the most massive reorganization \nof the Federal Government over the last half century and the creation \nof a new Department of Homeland Defense. This is a massive undertaking. \nIt involves some 170,000 people. It involves scores of agencies, with \nan annual $38 billion budget.\n\n  Implied in my remarks is the urging of caution as we approach the \ncreation of this agency. One of the items to be discussed in the Senate \nat a future time will be an amendment offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia to take a cautious and deliberative approach in knitting \ntogether this massive agency. The directorates would be set up under \nthe legislation right away, but their implementation would occur over \nthe course of 13 months. It would be done on a phased-in basis, in \nwhich the Congress would be consulted as it is phased in, where there \nwould be time to make sure in the example that I have given earlier \nabout the Coast Guard functions other than the homeland security \nfunction that, in fact, the Coast Guard would not be deterred from its \nmultiple service roles.\n  It is a wise approach the Senator from West Virginia has brought to \nthe table in slowing down the process. I hope our colleagues will see \nthe wisdom of protecting the separation of powers as provided in the \nConstitution, and the wisdom of us being sure that instead of their \nbeing such a mass of confusion in a reorganization all at once, that it \nwould be done in a deliberative and phased-in approach.\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have an additional \n5 minutes, and that the previous order be extended for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nperspicacious remarks. He has not been asleep. He has been ill with a \ntemporary ailment, but he is back on the mend. He is ready to go.\n  I also thank my friend for his expression of support for my \namendment. That amendment will be voted on next Tuesday. It will be \nvoted up or down. Senators will have an opportunity to go on record, if \nthey support that amendment, an opportunity to support the creation of \na Department of Homeland Defense. In voting for my amendment, they will \nhave an opportunity to say that we are not going to hand this whole \npackage of homeland security as it is envisioned in the House or Senate \nbill. I refer to the Senate bill as the Lieberman bill.\n  Once the Senate passes on the homeland security bill, then the Senate \nbill would go to the conference. The conference report eventually would \ncome back to both Houses, and the Senate will not have an opportunity \non the conference report to amend. All the Senate will be able to do is \nvote up or down on the conference report.\n  Under the House bill or under the Lieberman bill, the overall time \ncertainly under the Lieberman bill, the overall period for the \n``fleshing out'' of this Department of Homeland Security, this fleshing \nout by moving various and sundry agencies and offices into the several \ndirectorates that are established by the Lieberman bill, and the five \ndirectorates that are mentioned in my amendment thereto, that fleshing \nout would occur under the Lieberman bill over a period of 13 months.\n\n  But in passing the Lieberman bill, and it is light-years ahead of the \nHouse bill, it is a better bill than the House bill, but it can be \nimproved. That is what I am attempting to do with my amendment. Under \nthe Lieberman bill, over a period of 13 months, Congress will be \nputting itself on the sidelines.\n  The Senate will be saying: OK, Mr. President, it is all yours. You \nhave 13 months. Congress is going fishing. You have it. It is all \nyours.\n  Now, nothing would please this President more than to have such a \nblank check handed to him. The Lieberman bill, in that respect, is a \nTonkin Gulf resolution on homeland security. Congress will be removing \nitself to the sidelines for those 13 months, and the President and this \nadministration--think about that carefully--with its penchant for \nsecrecy, its penchant for operating out of the White House, having no \nlimitations, will have full authority to move agencies and 170,000 \nemployees into this new department, with Congress relegating itself to \nthe sidelines.\n  The hand of Congress ought to be there. Congress ought to conduct its \nconstitutional responsibility of oversight in seeing that these \nagencies are put into the various directorates in an orderly way \nthroughout the 13 months. The Lieberman committee and its counterpart \nin the House under my amendment would be front and center throughout \nthe 13 months. That committee would still be in the driver's seat, and \nevery 4 months there would be another shift of agencies and \ndirectorates, every 4 months, until it is completed, over a 13-month \nperiod.\n  All the while, Mr. Lieberman's committee would take the policies and \nthe recommendations of the Secretary of Homeland Security, look at \nthem, debate them in the committee, amend them, and report the \nlegislation to the Senate, and then the Senate would take the \nlegislation, report it from the Lieberman committee, and debate it, \namend it, send it to the President.\n  I have said we could have expedited procedure. I am not a Senator who \nlikes expedited procedure, but in this situation I would be willing to \nhave expedited procedures to see that the bill doesn't fall through the \ncracks in the committee, and that it is not filibustered or delayed in \nthe Senate.\n  That is my prescription, my amendment for order: a phased filling out \nof the department by agencies and offices, under continuing \ncongressional oversight, avoiding the chaos that will otherwise occur \njust by handing this whole thing over to the President and the \nadministration--hook, line, and sinker. Just mark my words. I am \nseeking to improve the Lieberman bill. I am not adversarial to the \nLieberman bill. But if we don't adopt my amendment, or something like \nit, there is going to be chaos, and instead of having a measure that \nwill promote the security of our homeland and its people, we will be \ntaking our eyes off the terrorists, off homeland security.\n\n  The federal agencies are out there, working now to provide homeland \nsecurity. The passage of the Lieberman bill is not necessary in order \nto get these people out there guarding the ports of entry--the rivers \nand seaports and airports and the southern and northern borders. They \nare already out there working now, every day. The FBI, just a few days \nago, in the State of New York, located a cell and arrested six persons. \nDid the FBI have to wait on this homeland security bill? There is no \ngreat outcry out there in the country; there is no great clamor for a \nhomeland security bill. When I go to West Virginia, people don't come \nup to me and say: Senator, let's get that homeland security bill \npassed. When are you going to pass that bill? There is no great clamor \nout there. As a matter of fact, it is hard to get anyone to listen to a \ndiscussion of the subject.\n  I have been on this Senate floor time and time again, asking to be \nheard. Listen. Hear me. Why, the Members of the Senate aren't that \ngreatly interested in this bill. Facing us in less than 2 months is a \nbig election. All of a sudden this administration, which as late as the \nmiddle of August has been saying that there were ``no plans on the \nPresident's desk'' to go to war with Iraq. I asked the Secretary of \nState that question in a committee hearing: oh, there is ``no plan. The \nPresident doesn't have any plan on his desk.'' I asked the Secretary of \nDefense. Oh, the President has no plans. The President himself has been \nquoted time and time again saying he has no plans; ``there is no plan \non my desk.''\n  All of a sudden, bam, the administration wants to go to war with \nIraq. It wasn't too long ago, I can remember the Secretary's public \nspokesman and Ari Fleischer and some others in the administration, \nsaying: ``Why have a Department of Homeland Defense? We don't need \none.'' That wasn't long ago. But all of a sudden, all of a sudden the \nPresident was dropping in the polls and the domestic situation was such \nthat the administration was appearing to be much like the Emperor who \nhad no clothes. All of a sudden, bam, all of this war talk--the war \nfervor, the drums of war, the bugles of war, the clouds of war--this \nwar hysteria has blown in like a hurricane. And what has that done to \nthe President's polls? Seventy percent.\n  Don't tell me that things suddenly went wrong. I sat in on some of \nthe secret briefings and nobody from the administration in those secret \nbriefings has been able to answer the question: Why now? Why all of a \nsudden, when the administration was saying back just in August the \nPresident has no plans? Let's not have all of this angst about war.\n  All of a sudden this country is going to war. And the President is \nsaying, I'll do this if the U.N. doesn't do it.\n  Now, all of a sudden, is the Administration talking about \nthe domestic situation in this country? Are they talking about the \nstock market? Are they talking about the weakness of the economy? Are \nthey talking about the jobs that are being lost? Are they talking about \nthe decrease in housing starts in this country? No. No.\n\n  The war clouds are there. All of a sudden this administration sends \nup a resolution to Congress that is a nonstarter, to give this \nPresident the authority that he is asking for. Not by this Constitution \nwill I give my vote on that resolution. That resolution is going to \ntake some work. But all of a sudden? Why is it? Is it politics?\n  The Constitution is apparently irrelevant to people in this \nadministration. What is wanted here by the administration is for \nCongress, in connection with war, to do the same as they want Congress \nto do in homeland security--hand over the whole authority and say: Take \nit, Mr. President. It's all yours for the next 13 months. Congress is \ngoing fishing. We are not going to be in the mix.\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\nCongress relegates itself to the sidelines.\n  How foolish can we be as Members of the Senate to tuck our tails \nbetween our legs and just quit and say: ``You can have it all, Mr. \nPresident. Do anything you want to do with homeland security.'' Well, \nnot by my vote.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his remarks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the recent colloquy and discussion \nthat the Senator from West Virginia, our current Chair, had with the \nSenator from Florida, many important issues were raised about homeland \nsecurity and how best to pursue the defense of our homeland.\n  I don't think anyone argues we now face three great challenges in our \nNation. First, we have a national security challenge. Our men and women \nin uniform are addressing that challenge even as we speak--all over the \nworld from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf to the border of North and \nSouth Korea, and many other places as well. All of us support our \nmilitary and have voted to provide the largest appropriations ever in \nour history to give our men and women who put themselves in harm's way \nall of the resources, technology and compensations that our great \nmilitary deserves.\n  We have a new challenge; that is, the challenge of homeland security. \nCertainly, many of us have not had to think of this issue as we are \nnow.\n  On September 11 of last year when we were so grievously attacked, it \nbecame clear that we had to begin to apply the techniques of security \nmuch closer to home that we have used to defend America's interests \nabroad for so many generations. We have to take a very hard look at our \nvulnerabilities, our infrastructure, our borders, and our public health \ncapacity to deal with biological or chemical warfare. And it requires \nevery one of us--not just those in elective office but every citizen--\nto become more vigilant and to understand that we are truly facing some \nserious threats.\n  At the same time, though, there is no reason for us not to debate the \nbest way to defend ourselves. In every generation of America, we have \nhad great debates about how to fight wars and how to structure our \nnational security. Now we are having a debate about how to deal with \nthe new demands of homeland security.\n\n  I applaud the Chair for his absolutely rock-solid commitment, his \ntotally uncynical and heartfelt commitment to make sure we do this \nright. It is a huge undertaking. Are we being asked to merge \ndepartments just so somebody can say we did something or are we going \nto do it right? It is the right of patriotism to ask hard questions. \nThat is who we are as Americans. We are not people who are blindly led. \nWe are not sheep who follow any leader's oratory. We are an \nindependent, free-spirited, liberty-loving people.\n  When we have debates, either on the floor of the Senate or in the \nmedia, about the right way to proceed, those of us who engage in that \ndebate do so out of a deep wellspring of love and devotion to our \ncountry. No one exemplifies that more than the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  In addition to our national security challenges and our homeland \nsecurity challenges, we have all of the challenges we had on September \n10 of last year. We have an economy that is stalled. We have a so-\ncalled ``jobless recovery.'' We can't seem to come together on \nimportant issues.\n  I am delighted to see my colleague from Arizona in the Chamber. \nSenator McCain has been a leader and advocate for prescription drugs \nand for patients getting the right to have the treatment their doctors \nprescribe--not an HMO or some bureaucrat somewhere.\n  There are many important issues we should be debating that also will \ndetermine the quality of our life and the opportunities for our \nchildren.\n  I hope, as people tune in to see what happens on the Senate floor--\nwhen they see the Senator from West Virginia or the Senator from \nArizona taking to the floor to talk about an issue--that they recognize \nthat we believe we are acting in the great tradition, not only of the \nAmerican Senate and Congress, but of America's citizenry, because there \nisn't any greater title than one can have than citizen of the United \nStates of America.\n  I, as one Senator, appreciate the Senator's vigilance, his constant \nreminder to the rest of us that we are here because of our Founders, \ntheir genius, and the Constitution which they bequeathed to us. The \ndebates we are holding on this important issue of national homeland \nsecurity and other pressing domestic issues are in the tradition of \nthose Founders.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, despite America's preponderant role in the \nworld, it is not often that foreign leaders tell us that their country \nwould not exist as an independent state were it not for U.S. support. \nYet leaders across the spectrum in the former Soviet republic of \nGeorgia, including President Eduard Shevardnadze and his political \nopponents, frankly and gratefully attribute their national survival to \nunstinting American support since their independence from Soviet rule \neleven years ago. In a troubling display of how history does not always \nmove in a positive direction, Georgia's independence is once again \nunder threat, with repercussions that should concern all who cherish \nfreedom.\n  In an opportunistic twist of President Bush's policy of pre-emption \nagainst clear and present dangers to America and the world, President \nPutin of Russia has appropriated American rhetoric in the war on \nterrorism to justify Russian subversion of the Georgian state. A free \nRussian hand in Georgia is apparently the price\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\nPresident Putin believes the United States is willing to pay for \nRussia's support for military action against Iraq. President Bush and \nthe Congress of the United States should disabuse our friends in Moscow \nof this illusion, immediately.\n  President Putin rode to power on promises to defeat Chechen \nseparatists in Russia's south. Reports indicate that members of Al \nQaeda and other terrorist groups operate in Chechnya. Russia has a \nright and an obligation to bring these legitimate terrorists to \njustice. But rather than targeting them and their Chechen comrades in \narms, Russian forces have conducted a military campaign of astonishing \nbrutality against Chechnya's civilian population as leaders in the West \nhave looked the other way.\n  At the same time, Presidents Bush and Putin have brought about a \nhistoric change in U.S.-Russia relations that is moving our two nations \nfrom rivalry to strategic partnership. We in the United States welcome \nthis development. But there can be no true partnership absent Russian \ncommitment to the fundamental values that guide American policy in \nthese areas.\n  I believe President Putin has indeed made a historic decision to \nalign his country with the West as Russia moves away from its imperial \npast and towards a democratic, prosperous future. Yet Russia's threat \nto Georgia, like Russia's brutality in Chechnya, calls to mind a \ndiscredited, imperial past whose resurgence threatens the \ntransformation in U.S.-Russian relations and, in particular, our joint \ncommitment to eradicating the networks of global terror that threaten \nboth our peoples.\n  Seized by the domestic political costs of a grinding war in Chechnya \nthat Russia cannot win militarily, and calculating that President \nBush's doctrine of pre-emption somehow applies to both a megalomaniacal \ntyrant like Saddam Hussein and a democratically oriented, pro-Western \nleader like Eduard Shevardnadze, President Putin has sent Russian jets \nto bomb targets in Georgia. Putin openly outlines his plans for a \nRussian invasion of Georgia to wipe out terrorism there. Motivated by a \ndeep dislike of President Shevardnadze, whom they blame for the Soviet \nUnion's disintegration and who has been targeted for assassination by \nfigures linked to Moscow, and tempted by visions of Russian control \nover Russia's oil-rich Near Abroad, some Russian leaders seem to \nbelieve the impunity Russia has enjoyed in Chechnya would carry over to \nRussian military operations against its sovereign neighbor. They are \nwrong.\n  Russia's civilian and military leadership must know that our growing, \nand welcome, strategic partnership in the war on terror does not \nsanction unilateral Russian military adventurism for purposes whose \nrelation to the war on terror is incidental. Moscow, and Washington, \nand Tbilisi are right to be alarmed by continuing reports that Chechen \nmilitants and members of al-Qaida have taken refuge in Georgia's \nlawless Pankisi Gorge. America's proper response was to deploy American \nSpecial Forces teams to Georgia to train and equip Georgian security \nforces to take control of the gorge and enforce Georgian control over \nits territory.\n  President Shevardnadze has announced a major Georgian military \noperation, with U.S. military advisors, to root out terrorists in \nPankisi. International monitors are already stationed along Georgia's \nborder with Chechnya, and President Shevardnadze has proposed expanding \nthis monitoring force to prevent militants from finding refuge in \nGeorgia in the future. Shevardnadze yesterday pledged to extradite 13 \nmen that Russia says are Chechen guerrillas captured by Georgian \nsecurity officials.\n  The United States and Russia, in the spirit of strategic partnership \nboth countries profess, have a willing partner in President \nShevardnadze to eliminate any terrorist presence in Georgia that Moscow \ncorrectly perceives to threaten its interests. But Russia has rejected \nGeorgia's candid, and unprecedented, proposals to cooperate in \neradicating terrorism. Instead, Russia seems to want to use the \nterrorist problem as a means of reasserting Russian control in Georgia, \nwhich already suffers the presence of three Russian military bases and \nseparatist conflicts supported by Moscow.\n  Some in Moscow do not understand that unilateral and preemptive \nRussian military operations in Georgia make the situation worse, not \nbetter. These operations threaten to turn Russia's desire to root out a \nsmall group of terrorists into an international crisis that threatens \nwhat President Putin cherishes--a robust partnership with the West that \nhe has defined as Russia's future.\n  It is unacceptable and immoral for any American leader to countenance \nRussia's increasingly open campaign for control of its neighbor to the \nsouth--which is why no American leader will do so. But pressure from \nMoscow works in insidious ways. One ``senior Administration official'' \nrecently told the New York Times, ``Looking now at the new strategic \ncircumstances, I think there may be some rethinking about how we handle \nthe Georgian situation. I think there's a recognition the Russian \ngovernment has a legitimate security concern.''\n  The United States properly shares Russia's concern about foreign \nterrorists seeking refuge in Georgia, and can surely find a way to \nadvance our mutual interest in helping Georgia end incursions by these \npeople. But giving Russia carte blanche to impose its own solution--as \nit has, brutally, in Chechnya--would be a repudiation of the values we \nare fighting the war on terror to defend and the celebration of freedom \nthat took place in Georgia and across the former Soviet Union when \nimperial rule crumbled.\n  Strengthening the Georgian Government's capacity to control parts of \nits own country and working with American and Georgian officials to \neliminate terrorists from Georgian territory, on terms acceptable to \nthe Georgian Government, is an interest Moscow shares with Washington \nand Tbilisi. It is one we can advance together, in the spirit of \npartnership that characterizes our cooperation in the war on \nterrorism--not in the spirit of rivalry and spheres of influence that \nrecall an unpleasant past.\n  Leaders in Moscow must know that no nation has a greater stake in \nwiping out al-Qaida's global terror network than the United States. We \nwould never countenance any Georgian actions to wink at terrorism \nwithin its borders; indeed, our deployment of American Special Forces \nto Georgia is a measure of the seriousness with which we take the \nthreat terrorists pose to Georgia and the region. In the same way, \nPresident Putin and those around him must know that we cannot \ncountenance unilateral Russian military action that puts Georgia's \nindependence at risk. I hope President Putin will make the choice that \nbefits his role as an enlightened leader of the Russian people, and \ndoes not cast his lot with the officers and civilians around him who \nbelieve Russian can assert imperial control over a sovereign neighbor \nwithout consequence. There will be consequences--and no friend of \nRussia or Georgia should suggest otherwise.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a Wall \nStreet Journal editorial of September 16, 2002, entitled ``Putin's Iraq \nPrice'' a September 19, 2002, editorial in the Washington Post, \nentitled ``A Parody Of Partnership'' and an editorial from the \nEconomist magazine of September 21, 2002, entitled ``Putin's folly'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 16, 2002]\n\n                           Putin's Iraq Price\n\n       One danger of President's Bush's otherwise successful \n     overture to the United Nations on Iraq is the price the U.S. \n     will have to pay to win Security Council approval. Russian \n     President Vladimir Putin has already submitted his bill, \n     requesting a global wink at military intervention in what \n     used to be Soviet Georgia.\n       Even as the U.N. was still digesting Mr. Bush's speech last \n     Friday, Mr. Putin appropriated the language of U.S. policy to \n     justify his Georgian meddling. He accuses his southern \n     neighbor of harboring Chechen rebels and others he calls \n     terrorists, and the bold Russian hopes Mr. Bush will give him \n     a pass in return for approving action against Iraq. This is \n     an offer we hope the U.S. refuses, not least so it can begin \n     better defining just what the new Bush ``pre-emption'' \n     doctrine means.\n       For starters Mr. Putin's analogy is preposterous. Georgian \n     President Eduard\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\n     Shevardnadze is not only not another Saddam Hussein, he is \n     one of the more enlightened leaders of the new countries that \n     were once part of the former Soviet Union. He hasn't tried to \n     acquire nuclear weapons or plotted to assassinate a U.S. \n     President, much less invaded a neighbor, gassed his own \n     people or ignored 16 U.N. resolutions.\n       On the contrary, Mr. Shevardnadze's main problem is that he \n     has charted a pro-Western foreign policy that irritates some \n     of his former Soviet colleagues in Moscow. He has already \n     survived several assassination attempts, with the chief \n     suspect in one case finding safe haven in Russia. He has \n     fought a separatist war against Abkhaz rebels trained and \n     funded by Russia. Russia still has three military bases in \n     Georgia and has defied orders from the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe to vacate its base in \n     Abkhazia and negotiate withdrawal from the others.\n       Mr. Shevardnadze is understandably keen not to give his big \n     neighbor any excuse to intervene militarily. In response to \n     Russia's latest saber-rattling, he has beefed up border \n     security and invited monitors into Georgia to testify to his \n     country's anti-terror efforts. U.S. special forces are \n     already helping train and equip the Georgian military to root \n     out rebels from Chechnya, a Russian republic on its northern \n     border.\n       All of which suggests the need for Mr. Bush to elaborate on \n     his pre-emption doctrine. We support this policy as necessary \n     in a world in which madmen who control countries can get \n     nuclear weapons; ``non intervention'' in the internal affairs \n     of such countries is no longer a safe strategy. But the \n     critics have a point that without some clarifying \n     distinctions, the doctrine of preventive action can be abused \n     by countries looking to settle old scores or grab new \n     territory. Drawing a line between peaceful Georgia and Iraq--\n     ruled by a lunatic dictator who traffics with terrorists and \n     seeks nuclear weapons--would be a useful first step.\n       On Friday U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton began to \n     take that step by saying the U.S. ``opposes any unilateral \n     military action by Russia'' inside Georgia. He added that ``I \n     don't see that there are really any quid pro quos to be had'' \n     over Iraq, ``whether with Russia or others.''\n       We hope that view holds inside the Bush Administration, \n     even as Russian pressure inevitably increases. Agreeing to \n     Mr. Putin's Georgian price would be damaging to U.S. \n     interests, and isn't necessary in any case. It would set a \n     precedent for Russian action in oil-rich Central Asia, \n     emboldening Russian nationalists to meddle next in Azerbaijan \n     and elsewhere. It would also be dishonorable, abandoning a \n     man in Mr. Shevardnadze who helped bring the Cold War to a \n     peaceful end as the Soviet foreign minister under Mikhail \n     Gorbachev.\n       It's doubtful that Mr. Putin will want to block U.S. action \n     against Iraq in any event. Siding with Saddam would only \n     undermine the worthy efforts he has made so far to build \n     confidence in Russia as a political and business partner of \n     the West. His over-stretched military is already bleeding in \n     Chechnya, and the last thing he needs is a ground war in \n     neighboring Georgia. Using Iraq as cover for more meddling in \n     impoverished Caucasus would only recall memories of Soviet \n     imperialism.\n       Mr. Bush began to turn would opinion on Iraq last week not \n     merely because he went to the U.N. but mainly because of the \n     rightness of his cause. The U.S. can carry the day in Iraq \n     without sacrificing its principles by catering to Mr. Putin's \n     nationalist opportunism.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2002]\n\n                        A Parody of Partnership\n\n       Vladimir Putin, the soul-baring friend of President Bush, \n     is offering another demonstration of why the administration's \n     flighty rhetoric about the ``transformation'' of U.S.-Russian \n     relations has been premature. Mr. Putin's government is doing \n     its best to hamstring Mr. Bush's campaign against Iraq; the \n     Russian ambassador at the United Nations rushed to embrace \n     Saddam Hussein's transparently tactical acceptance of weapons \n     inspectors and declared that no further action by the \n     Security Council was needed. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin himself is \n     peddling a grotesque parody of Mr. Bush's principled stand on \n     both Iraq and Afghanistan: Last week he informed the Security \n     Council, in terms that deliberately echoed Mr. Bush, that the \n     war on terrorism may require a unilateral Russian attack on \n     the small neighboring nation of Georgia, a former republic of \n     the Soviet Union that infuriates Moscow merely by existing as \n     an independent, democratic and pro-Western state. This \n     stunningly brazen attempt to cloak an old-fashioned threat of \n     military aggression in Mr. Bush's new doctrine of preemption \n     has been accompanied by an even more cynical suggestion of \n     quid pro quo: Allow Russian to crush Georgian sovereignty, \n     Mr. Putin hints, and he just might acquiesce in the \n     enforcement of the U.N.-ordered disarmament of Iraq. Bush \n     administration officials are saying they won't play Mr. \n     Putin's game; the White House needs to make that point \n     unambiguously this week to Mr. Putin's visiting defense and \n     foreign ministers.\n       The nominal basis for Mr. Putin's threat to Georgia, a \n     country the size of South Carolina with a mostly Christian \n     population of 5 million, is that it is tolerating the \n     presence of Muslim rebel fighters from the neighboring \n     Russian province of Chechnya. Mr. Putin insists that these \n     are terrorists, indistinguishable from al Qaeda, and that \n     Georgia is allowing them to operate training camps and pass \n     freely across the border. In fact the insurgents are almost \n     all ethnic Chechens fighting for self-rule who take refuge \n     during summer in the Pankisi Gorge, a wild, 11-mile-long \n     strip that has long been lawless. The Bush administration \n     contends that some al Qaeda operatives may be present in the \n     Pankisi, but evidence is scant. In any case, the Georgian \n     government clearly has no interest in backing al Qaeda \n     terrorists, or even the Chechens; it has readily accepted an \n     ongoing U.S. training programing for its army, and it \n     recently dispatched 1,000 troops to clear out the Pankisi. \n     President Eduard Shevardnadze has asked to meet with Mr. \n     Putin and invited international monitoring of the border \n     area; this week his administration agreed to extradite 13 \n     suspects Russia says are Chechen guerrillas.\n       These initiatives are not enough for Mr. Putin: His \n     generals say they are readying a cross-border invasion, \n     following up on airstrikes carried out last month. It's not \n     likely that Russian forces, which have failed to control \n     Chechen movements across their own border, could eliminate or \n     even locate any militants in the Pankisi. But that's not Mr. \n     Putin's real aim. His goals are to distract attention from a \n     recent series of military disasters in Chechnya--incidents \n     that have revived discussion in Russia about the futility of \n     Mr. Putin's campaign to suppress the rebellion by force--and \n     to use the leverage of Russia's U.N. Security Council vote on \n     Iraq to achieve suzerainty over Georgia, which Moscow has \n     been seeking since long before the war on terrorism. This is \n     not the behavior of a soul mate, or even a ``strategic \n     partner''; and a U.S.-Russian relationship afflicted by such \n     tactics has not been transformed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, Sept. 21, 2002]\n\n                             Putin's Folly\n\n       Those who write speeches for Russia's president, Vladimir \n     Putin, no doubt imagine they are good students of American \n     foreign policy. They seem determined to copy, or rather \n     caricature, every new American idea. They no doubt had a \n     hand, too, in drafting the stern letter that Mr. Putin sent \n     to the United Nations, laying out his case for intervention \n     in neighbouring Georgia unless its government clears its \n     territory of a group of Chechen terrorists who have holed up \n     there.\n       Like America in Iraq, his officials claim, Russia is \n     insisting on its right to take military action, alone if \n     necessary, against a nation which it deems to be in breach of \n     international law; like America in Afghanistan, Russia \n     justifies itself by recalling that failed states can be a \n     source of festering security threats. Like George Bush, Mr. \n     Putin is merely proposing to act pre-emptively, in extremis, \n     against a state that poses a deadly and increasing danger. \n     Indeed, regime change cannot be ruled out.\n       A mixture of all these arguments has been used by Mr. Putin \n     and his lieutenants to justify their recent and repeated \n     threats of military action against Georgia--some air raids \n     have already taken place, say the Georgians, and Russians \n     have been hinting darkly that a land attack may follow. The \n     Georgians stand accused of posing a threat to Russian \n     security because they cannot or will not take effective \n     action against the Chechen fighters, possibly allied with \n     Islamist extremists from elsewhere, who have set up camp in \n     the remote Pankisi gorge. If you cannot solve the problem--\n     and guarantee that no attacks on Russian territory will be \n     launched from Georgian territory--then we will, is the \n     Kremlin's message. The Russian media, meanwhile, have mounted \n     an escalating series of personal attacks on Georgia's \n     president, Edward Shevardnadze. The clear implication is that \n     nobody in Moscow would shed a tear if, in the turmoil caused \n     by a Russian attack, the leadership of Georgia were to change \n     hands.\n       If there is not grain of truth in Russia's arguments, it \n     lies in the fact that Georgia, while not a failed state, is \n     one that has had difficulty asserting its authority in its \n     border areas. Indeed in two of its regions--Abkhazia and \n     South Ossetia--the writ of the Tbilisi government does not \n     run at all. Even in other places, it struggles to collect \n     taxes and enforce the law. This is a dangerous state of \n     affairs; where the rule of law is absent, smugglers in drugs, \n     guns and even deadlier things fill the void.\n\n\n                        The mote in Russia's eye\n\n       But there is also a huge flaw in Russia's argument. If the \n     Georgian state functions less than perfectly--in Pankisi and \n     elsewhere--that is in large part because Russia itself has \n     consistently undermined it. The restive mini-states within \n     Georgia's legal boundaries (Abkhazia, South Ossetia and, to \n     some extent, Ajaria in the south-west) defy the government \n     with the help of powerful friends in Moscow.\n       By sending 150 or so military advisers to Georgia, America \n     is attempting to bolster the country's security forces. But \n     even that programme has been undermined by Georgian officers \n     with connections in Russia. If Russians are concerned about \n     the security of their southern frontier, they would do better \n     to reinforce Georgia's statehood rather than chip away at it. \n     Georgia is neither a rogue state, nor (as yet) a failed one. \n     Nor do Georgians need outsiders to orchestrate regime change \n     for them. Imitation is a form of flattery, but other should \n     not be duped into seeing parallels where none exist.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, I have had a discussion with Senator \nLott with regard to next week's schedule. I have indicated privately to \na number of Senators my concern for the legislative agenda we must \nconfront prior to the time we leave. That agenda includes a number of \nissues that have support on both sides of the aisle. It recognizes that \nwe have been on the homeland security bill now for 3 full weeks and the \nInterior appropriations bill for an equal amount of time. I am \nincreasingly concerned that the longer we stay on those bills, the less \nlikely it is that we will be able to adjourn on time.\n  Given that realization, my expectation is that we will require \ncolleagues to be here at least possibly as early as next weekend to \nconfront this agenda and to complete our work. I am not announcing \nnecessarily that next weekend will be a work period, but I am \nsuggesting to all colleagues that they not make any firm commitments \nnext weekend.\n  We have to finish the homeland security bill next week. We have to \ndeal with perhaps a continuing resolution, short-term, because of the \npending end of this fiscal year. We have a number of other matters that \nhave to be taken up prior to the completion of our work at the end of \nthis session.\n  As I look at that schedule, I conclude that there is virtually no way \nwe will be able to do this, and do it successfully, without longer \nhours and more days. The only days available to us, of course, are the \nMondays and Fridays that have oftentimes been travel days for our \nMembers but also Saturdays and Sundays.\n  It is my expectation that we will be using weekend days between now \nand the end of session, that we will require Senators to be here at \nleast on Saturday and possibly on Sunday in an effort to complete our \nwork. That may occur as early as next weekend.\n  This is not meant to be a threat or in any way a signal that we are \nnot prepared to take whatever action necessary to preclude that, but I \nalso want Senators to know that that is a very likely possibility.\n  I come to the floor with a recognition that we do need to make \nSenators aware of the importance of the schedule and the significant \namount of work that needs to be done before we leave.\n  I appreciate everyone's cooperation and will appreciate the \nopportunity to speak more specifically to the schedule early next week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

KELLY S. SEGARS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional \nachievements and public service of a truly extraordinary man, Dr. Kelly \nS. Segars, and to congratulate him on his selection as the 2002 \nMississippi Family Physician of the Year.\n  The son of the late ``Doc'' and Ora Segars of Red Bay, Alabama, Dr. \nSegars displayed a penchant for helping and healing the sick from a \nvery early age. He graduated with honors from high school, pharmacy \nschool, and medical school despite an interruption while serving one \ntour in the Army during the Korean War. His military decorations \ninclude the American Defense Medal, the United Nations Medal, and the \nArmy Commendation Medal.\n  Upon graduation from medical school in 1959, Dr. Segars entered the \npractice of Family Medicine in Iuka, Mississippi, not far from his \nbirthplace, where he continues to practice today. Dr. Segars delivered \nsome 500 babies before obtaining his board certification in geriatrics. \nHe has been seeing some of the same patients for over 40 years and \nconsiders his many patients simply his ``friends who have a medical \nproblem occasionally.'' Dr. Segars' son joined his practice about 15 \nyears ago, and the clinic, which is vital to the health of so many in \nthe rural community of Iuka, has grown to include 31 employees.\n  Despite his resounding success as Iuka's resident physician--as if \nthat accomplishment was not already enough for one man--Dr Segars' has \nconsistently worked for the betterment of his community in many other \nways. He established the First American National Bank just four years \nafter opening his medical practice. It was the first bank established \nin the Great State of Mississippi since the bank holiday in 1929 when \nall of the banks were closed. He also chaired his town's municipal \nlibrary committee where he initiated the project, obtained the funds, \nand oversaw construction of the library. His most recent civic project \nis the re-designation of highway US 72 to Interstate Highway 72, \nacknowledging the advantage of an Interstate Highway to draw bigger, \nmore lucrative industries to Tishomingo County. It takes a special \nindividual like Dr. Segars, with a clear vision of the future, to \nrecognize the need for a public institution or additional \ninfrastructure, and then to take it upon himself to see to it that the \nneed is fulfilled.\n  As a charter member of the Board of Directors of the Tishomingo \nCounty Development Foundation and Industrial Park, he was instrumental \nin the acquisition of the Lockheed-Aerojet office and the recent \nestablishment of the AlliantTech Systems facility. He was named as 1992 \nCitizen of the Year and the Aerospace Business Center was most \nappropriately named in his honor.\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\n  Dr. Segars has served as chair of the University of Mississippi \nGuardian Society, President of the Medical Alumni Association, and as a \nmember of the Dean's Advisory Committee, University of Mississippi \nSchool of Medicine. He also is a member of the Iuka Methodist Church, \nwhere he is the Health and Welfare Representative and sits on the \nAdministrative Board.\n  Dr. Segars' latest recognition as Mississippi Family Physician of the \nYear, by the Mississippi Academy of Family Physicians, could not have \nbeen awarded to a man more deserving of this very special recognition. \nChosen from among hundreds of family physicians throughout Mississippi, \nDr. Segars was nominated by a fellow physician and selected for the \nposition by a panel of his peers. The panel clearly recognized--as have \nmany others--that Dr. Segars' unique brand of personalized care and \ntrue concern for his patients has distinguished him as the best \nphysician that Mississippi, and our country, has to offer.\n  In addition to his many professional and civic accomplishments, Dr. \nSegars also is an extremely successful family man. He and his wife \nMartha are the proud parents of three children: K. Scott Segars, Jr. \nM.D., and wife Diane; Mark Segars, Tishomingo County Prosecuting \nAttorney; and Leigh Segars, an attorney in Florida. Dr. Segars and his \nwife also have three grandsons: Tyler, Jake, and Thompson.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today as I congratulate Dr. Kelly S. \nSegars as the Mississippi Family Practice Physician of the Year and \nwish him and his family all the best in his future as he continues as a \nleader in our community. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, I thank Dr. Segars for the many things he has done for the \ntown of Iuka, Tishomingo County, the State of Mississippi, and our \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8971-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MORE GUNS EQUALS MORE SUICIDES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a study by the Harvard School of Public \nHealth brings to light disturbing information about the presence of \nfirearms in a home. The study conducted by Drs. Matthew Miller, Deborah \nAzrael, and David Hemenway entitled ``Household Firearm Ownership and \nSuicide Rates in the United States'' concluded that in states where gun \nownership levels are higher, a disproportionately large number of \npeople commit suicide.\n  According to the study, of the more than 30,000 suicides in 1998, 57 \npercent involved the use of a firearm. In states with more guns, people \nwere more likely to commit suicide. The study found that in States with \na higher incidence of gun ownership people were 1.6 times more likely \nto commit suicide than people in states with a lower incidence of gun \nownership. Further, the Harvard study shows that people 15-24 years old \nfrom states with a high incidence of gun ownership are more than four \ntimes more likely to commit suicide than people the same age in states \nwith a low incidence of gun ownership. According to statistics cited by \nthe Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, in 1998, more than 1200 \nchildren aged 10-19 committed suicide with firearms. Nearly two-thirds \nof all completed teenage suicides involve a firearm.\n  One step that can be taken to reduce suicides among children is to \nprevent easy access to guns for children. I cosponsored Senator \nDurbin's Child Access Prevention Act because it would do just that. \nUnder this bill, adults who fail to lock up loaded firearms or an \nunloaded firearm with ammunition could be held liable if a weapon is \ntaken by a child and used to kill or injure him or herself or another \nperson. The bill would also increase the penalties for selling a gun to \na juvenile and create a gun safety education program that includes \nparent-teacher organizations, local law enforcement and community \norganizations. This bill is similar to legislation President Bush \nsigned into law as Governor of Texas. I support this bill and I believe \nit is a meaningful step in the right direction. It's clear that \nreducing child access to guns can save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8971-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8971-S8978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day.\n  I rise on this special day to remember and honor those brave \nAmericans who during past armed engagements in defense of this nation \nor our alliances were prisoners of war and those who are still listed \nmissing in action. As a nation, we set aside this day to further \nrecognize the sacrifices of the restless families of these fine \npatriots, assuring them that we have not forgotten.\n  In the past year, our dedicated Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines \nhave again taken up the mantle of freedom; this time to prosecute an \nelusive and dangerous enemy. They have ousted an oppressive regime in \nAfghanistan and continue to hunt those implicated in the war on \nterrorism. Like generations before them, these Americans have sworn an \noath to support and defend the Constitution. As a former Navy officer, \nI feel strongly that the United States government has a similarly \nstrong obligation to these men and women who serve in the Armed Forces. \nSpecifically, we must work to ensure the return of POWs and MIAs at the \nend of hostilities. We must not rest until all American POW/MIAs are \nreturned and accounted for, and the many questions that have \noverwhelmed their families are answered.\n  The vigorous pursuit of this commitment must continue through on-site \ninvestigations being undertaken in Indochina and through a fuller \nexamination of records in Russia, Iraq and Southeast Asia. For in our \nhistory, we recall somberly today that while thousands died, many \nothers endured years in starved, tortured, isolated misery before \nregaining their freedom. Their perseverance, integrity and heroism are \nshining examples of the core values on which this nation was founded \nand became great.\n  A year ago, Americans were sifting through smoldering rubble at the \nPentagon and at the site of the twin towers looking for their comrades \nin arms. Those actions have ceased, but around the world, others \ncontinue to sift through long-silent war zones to find and identify \nremains of the fallen and the missing.\n  The Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office \nhas had considerable successes in the past year, but we still have much \nto accomplish before our responsibility to all the POWs and MIAs is \nfulfilled. Just this year, we have identified the remains of 46 \nAmericans who served in the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, there are still \n1,907 unaccounted Americans who served in Vietnam. Also this year, 32 \nAmericans have been repatriated who served in the Korean War, while \nover 8,100 remain unaccounted for. And, through hard work and \ndetermination in the past year, the DPMO has recovered the remains of \neight Americans who served in the Second World War. 78,750 Americans \nwho served in World War II are as yet accounted.\n  It is important to remember that this is a cooperative effort and \nrequires commitments from all branches of our government as well as the \ncountries where the servicemen remain missing. Negotiations in the past \nsix years with North Korea have yielded many successes. One search \noperation continues even today in North Korea and a third and final \noperation for the year will begin on September 28, concluding October \n29.\n  According to the Department of Defense, America has had 23 operations \nsince 1996 to locate MIA's in North Korea. These missions are all \npossible because of cooperation and negotiation with North Korea. Let \nthis cooperation be an example to all of what can be accomplished when \nwe work together.\n  Today, I want to pay special tribute to the dedication and service of \nthe soldiers from my home State of Indiana who are or were POW/MIAs \nfrom the Vietnam War and the Korean War.\n  These great Americans and their families have the gratitude of this \nfree Nation. I urge the Senate, the administration, the Departments of \nDefense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security \nAgency to redouble their efforts to bring our soldiers home as quickly \nas possible. Let us all take heart from the POW/MIA flag, displayed in \nthe Capitol rotunda, which proclaims: ``You Are Not Forgotten.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of Indiana's missing and \nunaccounted from the Korea and Vietnam Wars be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T20SE02.007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8979-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I submit for the Congressional Record \nthe following statement on Iraq, which I released following the \nPresident's remarks to the United Nations one week ago today. I ask \nunanimous consent that my statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. VOINOVICH. President Bush's speech today before the \n     United Nations outlined well Saddam Hussein's sustained \n     history of defiance of UN resolutions and the will of the \n     international community. He left no doubt in any reasonable \n     person's mind that Iraq is a threat to the stability of the \n     Middle East, is a danger to his own people, and is \n     fundamentally hostile to the basic human rights of life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness upon which our nation is \n     founded. Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and his defiance \n     of the world community and his continued pursuit of weapons \n     of mass destruction show that he has no intention of changing \n     his ways.\n       The President's simple recitation of Iraq's defiance and \n     broken promises was convincing and persuasive. No \n     interpretation was required. The President said it best: ``By \n     breaking every pledge by his deceptions and his cruelties, \n     Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.''\n       The President's challenge, therefore, isn't making the case \n     against Iraq, but building the support for action to force \n     Iraqi compliance with UN resolutions calling for it to cease \n     its support of terrorist groups, cease the production of \n     weapons of mass destruction and allow international weapons \n     inspections. Generating this support among the American \n     people, Congress and our international partners is critical \n     if any effort to deal with the Iraqi threat is to be \n     successful.\n       As governor of Ohio and commander-in-chief of the Ohio \n     National Guard during the Persian Gulf War, I saw firsthand \n     how the unequivocal support that existed for our campaign to \n     evict Saddam Hussein from Kuwait made it so much easier for \n     our soldiers to leave home for an overseas mission. Ohioans \n     supported our military mission and they supported our troops. \n     There was no doubt about Saddam Hussein's guilt or his need \n     to be stopped. This type of support is important if we are to \n     ultimately succeed in stopping the Iraqi threat.\n       With his speech today, President Bush has started to build \n     this base of support. I applaud his decision to go before the \n     world community at the United Nations and to challenge the \n     body to stand behind its resolutions, live up to its charter \n     and be a force for peace and the preservation of human \n     rights. The President's meeting with British Prime Minister \n     Tony Blair last weekend and his recent series of \n     conversations with world leaders are the right beginning. It \n     must be built upon and strengthened. Our allies must be \n     consulted, probed for advice, and engaged in the process, not \n     just lectured, if we are to succeed. The President also must \n     reach out to our emerging allies in the Middle East who, \n     since 9-11, have begun to cooperate in the war on terrorism.\n       There is still much work to do as we consider options for \n     confronting the looming threat presented by Iraq's ongoing \n     programs to develop weapons of mass destruction. It is clear \n     that we cannot sit idly by and allow Saddam Hussein to move \n     forward in his work to acquire these deadly capabilities. As \n     we examine possible courses of action I'm confident the \n     President is going to take every necessary step to continue \n     to make his case to Congress and to the American people, and \n     to consult with our allies as well as the countries in the \n     region with whom we have emerging, important relationships. \n     We owe it to those at home and abroad that we seek to protect \n     from Saddam Hussein and his weapons to be diligent in the \n     building of consensus so that our efforts to handle the Iraqi \n     threat can be successful and conclusive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8979-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NORMA DICKSON\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity \nto congratulate Norma Eudora Cronk Dickson. On October 16th, 2002 she \nwill celebrate her 100th birthday. Norma is a resident of Chinook, MT.\n  Norma Dickson was born October 16, 1902. She was the eldest of four \nchildren born to John Colburn Cronk and Anna Rogers Cronk. John and \nAnna Cronk moved to Montana in 1898, and settled in the Milk River \nValley in Coburg, MT. Her parents were ranchers and prominent members \nof the community. Her father John was elected State representative in \nMontana in 1923. Her parents raised cattle and prize winning Percheron \nhorses. The livestock pavilion at the Blaine County Fairgrounds was \ndedicated to her father's memory.\n  Norma attended college and taught for a few years prior to her \nmarriage in 1928 to Dr. Joseph Robert Dickson, another Montana native \nwho practiced dentistry in Chinook, MT.\n  Norma and Dr. Dickson had four children, Joseph Robert Dickson Jr., \nMarilyn Dickson Gregg, James Cronk Dickson, and George William Hunt \nDickson. They also have thirteen grandchildren and ten great-\ngrandchildren.\n  In addition to Norma's dedication to her family, she has been very \nactive in her community of Chinook, MT. Her involvements include the \nEastern Star, Chinook Presbyterian Church, and High School Girl's \nState. She has also worked at the Chinook Senior Center as a volunteer \nfrom its inception until she was 97 years old. Finally, she was named \nSenior of the Year in Chinook. She is a treasure to her community, her \nState, and of course, to her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8979-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 11, \n2001 in Rifle, CO. Kyle Skyock, 16, was found unconscious on the side \nof a road after being beaten by four teenage boys who believed he was \ngay. Skyock's injuries included a fractured skull, burns, three broken \nribs, and a bruise described by doctors as being in the shape of a two-\nby-four. During the beating, the assailants made derogatory comments \nabout the victim's perceived sexual orientation.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8979-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8979-S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OREGON'S TECHNOLOGY LEADERS\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a little more than a year ago, the \nterrible events of September 11 forced the awakening and mobilization \nof a critical resource in this country. In response to that tremendous \ntragedy, America's technology innovators, skilled workers in all walks \nof life, have stepped forward to help America address the numerous \nthreats our enemies pose.\n  One of these threats is cybersecurity. As computer networks have \nbecome increasingly central to this Nation's infrastructure and \nbusinesses, that the importance of securing our information and \ninformation technologies has grown. Today I wish to draw the Senate's \nattention to emerging technologies for dealing with these new threats. \nI also want to discuss how this country can maximize a uniquely \nAmerican resource: that is, the skilled innovation of our tech sector.\n  Technology workers and managers from my home State of Oregon have \ninspired me with their technical skills and their passion to put their \ntalents to work serving America. The Portland area is home to one of \nthe Nation's largest concentration of cybersecurity vendors in the \ncountry. Portland now boasts a remarkable cluster of small and large \ncompanies actively working to make America's portion of cyberspace a \nsafer place.\n  Just a few examples: Tripwire is the world leader in data integrity \nassurance, providing software that establishes the foundation for IT \nsecurity and reliability. Tripwire is used to protect some of the \nworld's most sensitive data, and that includes some of the most \nimportant systems right here in Washington.\n  Digimarc provides digitally watermarked drivers licenses for 37 \nStates, and supplies official identification documents for governments \naround the world. Its technology enables authentication with a greater \nlevel of assurance than has historically been possible.\n  Swan Island Networks is building software platforms that enable \nsecure communications of sensitive information to trusted users across \norganizational boundaries. It is helping Federal\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\nand local agencies and first responders to communicate effectively to \naudiences inside and outside the firewall.\n  Intel Corporation, which has its largest base of employment in \nOregon, is leading the National Emergency Messaging Systems initiative \nfrom the Portland area. Intel is helping local, State and Federal \nofficials respond to emergencies.\n  WireX has won international recognition for its Immunix Network \nSecurity Solutions. The company was founded by a grant from DARPA in \n1998.\n  Galois Connections designs and develops high confidence software for \ncritical and demanding applications. Its clientele includes the \nNational Security Agency.\n  Kryptiq builds secure email systems that are built to preserve \nprivacy, as well as the integrity of documents.\n  Oregon is home to many, many more, including Flatrock, Infotects, \nNetwork Associates, Rulespace, TechTracker and True Disk. Some of these \ncompanies have persevered and become successful selling products and \nservices that government is using to defend its infrastructure. Many \nothers have developed products, launched companies, and knocked on \ndoors in Washington, trying to find an entry point. Their efforts must \nbe sustained and encouraged.\n  There are numerous ways to provide that encouragement, and not all of \nthem originate in Washington. It is vital to look at what is working on \nthe local level and nurture it there. It is time to lower the \nspeedbumps. Straighten the curves. Shorten the straightaways. Bring our \ntechnological talent quickly to the front lines of this new kind of \nwar.\n  In Oregon, a coalition of these cybersecurity companies has come \ntogether in the wake of 9/11. The Oregon Regional Alliance for \nInformation and Network Security, or Oregon RAINS, is banding together \nto offer products and services America needs now. These companies are \nworking together to find new ways of navigating the Federal bureaucracy \nto get their products on the ground.\n  In my view, the Federal Government should do all it can to be \nresponsive to organizations like Oregon RAINS. Currently, our sluggish \nbureaucracy often discriminates against small, young and distant \nvendors. America's enemies won't be defeated solely by the ideas of \nhuge corporations or entrenched government contractors. This country \nneeds the help of smaller, nimble players who are long on passion and \ntalent, but short on expertise about dealing with their Federal \nGovernment.\n  It is essential to eliminate the roadblocks American innovators face. \nA 20-person company in Beaverton, OR shouldn't have to devote precious \nresources to hiring lobbyists, making multiple trips to see different \npeople in different agencies, and pursuing expensive and, frankly, \nfrequently obsolete certifications.\n  Earlier this year I was proud to author the Science and Technology \nEmergency Mobilization Act, along with my colleague Senator Allen, and \nto see it passed by this Senate. That legislation mandated the creation \nof a clearinghouse, or single entry point, for technology innovators \noffering new products for the war on terrorism. I am gratified to see \nthat concept echoed in the Homeland Security legislation sponsored by \nSenator Lieberman.\n  My legislation, as well as Senator Lieberman's homeland security \nbill, also directs the executive branch to establish a national test \nbed to evaluate new technologies.\n  In my view, this national test bed could eventually serve as a model \nfor regional test beds. If that little company in Beaverton, OR, could \nrun pilot programs in its backyard, the company could more easily \nanswer questions, deal with challenges and monitor results.\n  Regional efforts to test new technologies would also increase our \nlikelihood of finding unexpected solutions in unexpected places. Some \ntechnology or technique that we couldn't have foreseen might pop up and \nhelp us win this war. The beauty of American innovation is that it \ncould just as easily come from a suburban basement, a sparsely \nfurnished loft, or a coalition of small companies as it could from the \nbusiness-as-usual landscape.\n  There are other ways the Federal Government can be a better partner \nto small technology innovators like those in my home State. \nAccelerating research and public-private technology partnerships \nthrough Federal grants. Deepening our cyber-security bench by funding \nIT education and channeling bright students into those areas. Raising \nawareness in the general public so that everyone sees the importance of \nsecuring this country's infrastructure.\n  I can assure you that in my home state alone there are a plethora of \nskilled software engineers and managers who are eager to see their \ntechnologies deployed to serve America. The Federal Government needs to \npartner with them and help them help their neighbors. American lives \nare at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8980-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8980-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8980-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:39 pm., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to authorize a project for environmental restoration \nat Smith Island, Maryland; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this measure would authorize the Smith \nIsland, Maryland ecosystem restoration project. Joining me in \nsponsoring this measure is my colleague Senator Mikulski.\n  Smith Island, is one of the last remaining inhabited islands in the \nChesapeake Bay and an area of unique cultural, historical and \nenvironmental significance. Because of its location and elevation, it \nis highly susceptible to the damaging forces of nature. In the past 150 \nyears, more than 3,000 acres of the island have eroded into the \nChesapeake Bay. As a consequence, the communities of Ewell, Tylerton \nand Rhodes Point are seriously threatened, the Federal navigation \nchannels shoal within months after dredging, and habitat and other \nnatural resources are being lost at an alarming rate. Since 1993 alone, \nthe Smith Island vicinity has lost over 2400 acres of Submerged Aquatic \nVegetation, SAV ecologically valuable wetlands have also been lost. \nThis habitat is critical to the health of the Bay and the area's \nfishing and crabbing industry.\n  Over the years, Senator Mikulski and I have worked very closely with \nthe citizens of Smith Island, the Somerset County Commissioners, the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other State and Federal resource \nagencies to address the serious erosion problem and other needs on the \nisland. Among other projects, we secured funding to help protect the \neroding shoreline of Tylerton, to dredge the channels and repair of the \nstone jetties leading into Ewell, which has also helped with the \nerosion problem in that community, to construct a new sewage treatment \nfacility, and to expedite completion of the Corps of Engineers' \nfeasibility study for Smith Island.\n  That latter study was completed in May of 2001 and the Chief of \nEngineers report on this project was transmitted to the Congress in \nOctober, 2001. The reports recommend construction of off-shore \nsegmented breakwaters and back-filling to create additional wetlands \nalong the coastline of Martin National Wildlife Refuge to stop or \nreverse the tremendous loss of SAV around parts of Smith Island. The \nrecommended plan is expected to protect approximately 720 acres and \nrestore about 1,400 acres of wetland and SUV habitat. The legislation, \nwhich we are introducing today, would authorize construction of this \nproject at a total cost of approximately $7.5 million. It is our hope \nthat this measure will be included as part of a broader package of \nwater resource projects being developed by the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/20/senate-section/article/S8982-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 329--AUTHORIZING THE SERGEANT AT ARMS AND DOORKEEPER \n  OF THE SENATE TO ASCERTAIN AND SETTLE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ANTHRAX \n                     EXPOSURE IN THE SENATE COMPLEX\n\n  Mr. DODD submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 330\n\n       Whereas it is the family, striving for a future of \n     opportunity and hope, that reflects our Nation's belief in \n     community, stability, and love;\n       Whereas the family remains an institution of promise, \n     reliance, and encouragement;\n       Whereas we look to the family as an unwavering symbol of \n     constancy that will help us discover a future of prosperity, \n     promise, and potential;\n       Whereas within our Nation's libraries and archives lie the \n     treasured records that detail the history of our Nation, our \n     States, our communities, and our citizens;\n       Whereas individuals from across our Nation and across the \n     world have embarked on a genealogical journey by discovering \n     who their ancestors were and how various forces shaped their \n     past;\n       Whereas an ever-growing number in our Nation and in other \n     nations are collecting, preserving, and sharing genealogies, \n     personal documents, and memorabilia that detail the life and \n     times of families around the world;\n       Whereas 54,000,000 individuals belong to a family where \n     someone in the family has used the Internet to research their \n     family history;\n       Whereas individuals from across our Nation and across the \n     world continue to research their family heritage and its \n     impact upon the history of our Nation and the world;\n       Whereas approximately 60 percent of Americans have \n     expressed an interest in tracing their family history;\n       Whereas the study of family history gives individuals a \n     sense of their heritage and a sense of responsibility in \n     carrying out a legacy that their ancestors began;\n       Whereas as individuals learn about their ancestors who \n     worked so hard and sacrificed so much, their commitment to \n     honor their ancestors' memory by doing good is increased;\n       Whereas interest in our personal family history transcends \n     all cultural and religious affiliations;\n       Whereas to encourage family history research, education, \n     and the sharing of knowledge is to renew the commitment to \n     the concept of home and family; and\n       Whereas the involvement of National, State, and local \n     officials in promoting genealogy and in facilitating access \n     to family history records in archives and libraries are \n     important factors in the successful perception of nationwide \n     camaraderie, support, and participation: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of October 2002, as ``Family \n     History Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 144--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   THE PRESIDENT SHOULD POSTHUMOUSLY AWARD THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF \n                      FREEDOM TO HARRY W. COLMERY\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n       Whereas the life of Harry W. Colmery of Topeka, Kansas, was \n     marked by service to his country and its citizens;\n       Whereas Harry Colmery earned a degree in law in 1916 from \n     the University of Pittsburgh and, through his practice of \n     law, contributed to the Nation, notably by successfully \n     arguing two significant cases before the United States \n     Supreme Court, one criminal, the other an environmental legal \n     dispute;\n       Whereas during World War I, Harry Colmery joined the Army \n     Air Service, serving as a first lieutenant at a time when \n     military aviation was in its infancy;\n       Whereas after World War I, Harry Colmery actively \n     contributed to the growth of the newly formed American Legion \n     and went on to hold several offices in the Legion and was \n     elected National Commander in 1936;\n       Whereas in 1943, the United States faced the return from \n     World War II of what was to become an active duty force of \n     15,000,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines;\n       Whereas Harry Colmery, recognizing the potential effect of \n     the return of such a large number of veterans to civilian \n     life, set out to craft legislation seeking to ensure that \n     these Americans who had fought for the democratic ideals of \n     the Nation and to preserve freedom would be able to fully \n     participate in all of the opportunities the Nation provided;\n       Whereas in December 1943, Harry Colmery crafted the initial \n     draft of the legislation that became the Servicemen's \n     Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill of \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights is credited by veterans' \n     service organizations, economists, and historians as the \n     engine that transformed postwar America into a more \n     egalitarian, prosperous, and enlightened Nation poised to \n     lead the world in the 21st century;\n       Whereas since its enactment, the GI Bill of Rights has \n     provided education or training for approximately 7,800,000 \n     men and women, including 2,200,000 in college, 3,400,000 in \n     other schools, 1,400,000 in vocational education, and 690,000 \n     in farm training;\n       Whereas as a result of the benefits available to veterans \n     through the initial GI Bill, the Nation gained over 800,000 \n     professionals as the GI Bill transformed these veterans into \n     450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, \n     67,000 doctors, and 22,000 dentists;\n       Whereas 2,100,000 World War II veterans purchased homes \n     through the GI Bill;\n       Whereas President Truman established the Presidential Medal \n     of Freedom in 1945 to recognize notable service during war \n     and in 1963 President Kennedy reinstated the medal to honor \n     the achievement of civilians during peacetime;\n       Whereas pursuant to Executive Order 11085, the Medal of \n     Freedom may be awarded to any person who has made an \n     especially meritorious contribution to ``(1) the security or \n     national interests of the United States, or (2) world peace, \n     or (3) cultural or other significant public or private \n     endeavors''; and\n       Whereas Harry Colmery, noted for his service in the \n     military, in the legal sector, and on behalf of the Nation's \n     veterans, clearly meets the criteria established for the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should posthumously award the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom to Harry W.

Mr. President, yesterday, at a hearing of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I asked a question of the Secretary of Defense. I \nreferred to a Newsweek article that will appear in the September 23, \n2002, edition. That article reads as follows. It is not overly lengthy. \nI shall read it. Beginning on page 35 of Newsweek, here is what the \narticle says:\n\n       America helped make a monster. What to do with him--and \n     what happens after he is gone--has haunted us for a quarter \n     century.\n\n  The article is written by Christopher Dickey and Evan Thomas. It \nreads as follows:\n\n       The last time Donald Rumsfeld saw Saddam Hussein, he gave \n     him a cordial handshake. The date was almost 20 years ago, \n     Dec. 20, 1983; an official Iraqi television crew recorded the \n     historic moment.\n       The once and future Defense secretary, at the time a \n     private citizen, had been sent by President Ronald Reagan to \n     Baghdad as a special envoy. Saddam Hussein, armed with a \n     pistol on his hip, seemed ``vigorous and confident,'' \n     according to a now declassified State Department cable \n     obtained by Newsweek. Rumsfeld ``conveyed the President's \n     greetings and expressed his pleasure at being in Baghdad,'' \n     wrote the notetaker. Then the two men got down to business, \n     talking about the need to improve relations between their two \n     countries.\n       Like most foreign-policy insiders, Rumsfeld was aware that \n     Saddam was a murderous thug who supported terrorists and was \n     trying to build a nuclear weapon. (The Israelis had already \n     bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak.) But at the time, \n     America's big worry was Iran, not Iraq. The Reagan \n     administration feared that the Iranian revolutionaries who \n     had overthrown the shah (and taken hostage American diplomats \n     for 444 days in 1979-81) would overrun the Middle East and \n     its vital oilfields. On the--theory that the enemy of my \n     enemy is my friend, the Reaganites were seeking to support \n     Iraq in a long and bloody war against Iran. The meeting \n     between Rumsfeld and Saddam was consequential: for the next \n     five years, until Iran finally capitulated, the United States \n     backed Saddam's armies with military intelligence, economic \n     aid and covert supplies of munitions.\n       Rumsfeld is not the first American diplomat to wish for the \n     demise of a former ally. After all, before the cold war, the \n     Soviet Union was America's partner against Hitler in World \n     War II. In the real world, as the saying goes, nations have \n     no permanent friends, just permanent interests. Nonetheless, \n     Rumsfeld's long-ago interlude with Saddam is a reminder that \n     today's friend can be tomorrow's mortal threat. As President \n     George W. Bush and his war cabinet ponder Saddam's \n     successor's regime, they would do well to contemplate how and \n     why the last three presidents allowed the Butcher of Baghdad \n     to stay in power so long.\n       The history of America's relations with Saddam is one of \n     the sorrier tales in American foreign policy. Time and again, \n     America turned a blind eye to Saddam's predations, saw him as \n     the lesser evil or flinched at the chance to unseat him. No \n     single policymaker or administration deserves blame for \n     creating, or at least tolerating, a monster; many of their \n     decisions seemed reasonable at the time. Even so, there are \n     moments in this clumsy dance with the Devil that make one \n     cringe. It is hard to believe that, during most of the 1980s, \n     America knowingly permitted the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission \n     to import bacterial cultures that might be used to build \n     biological weapons.\n\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       It is hard to believe that, during most of the 1980s, \n     America knowingly permitted the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission \n     to import bacterial cultures that might be used to build \n     biological weapons. But it happened.\n       America's past stumbles, while embarrassing, are not an \n     argument for inaction in the future. Saddam probably is the \n     ``grave and gathering danger'' described by President Bush in \n     his speech to the United Nations last week. It may also be \n     true that ``whoever replaces Saddam is not going to be \n     worse,'' as a senior administration official put it to \n     Newsweek. But the story of how America helped create a \n     Frankenstein monster it now wishes to strangle is sobering. \n     It illustrates the power of wishful thinking, as well as the \n     iron law of unintended consequences.\n       America did not put Saddam in power. He emerged after two \n     decades of turmoil in the '60s and '70s, as various strongmen \n     tried to gain control of a nation that had been concocted by \n     British imperialists in the 1920s out of three distinct and \n     rival factions, the Sunnis, Shiites and the Kurds. But during \n     the cold war, America competed with the Soviets for Saddam's \n     attention and welcomed his war with the religious fanatics of \n     Iran. Having cozied up to Saddam, Washington found it hard to \n     break away--even after going to war with him in 1991. Through \n     years of both tacit and overt support, the West helped create \n     the Saddam of today, giving him time to build deadly arsenals \n     and dominate his people. Successive administrations always \n     worried that if Saddam fell, chaos would follow, rippling \n     through the region and possibly igniting another Middle East \n     war. At times it seemed that Washington was transfixed by \n     Saddam.\n       The Bush administration wants to finally break the spell. \n     If the administration's true believers are right, Baghdad, \n     after Saddam falls will look something like Paris after the \n     Germans fled in August 1944. American troops will be cheered \n     as liberators, and democracy will spread forth and push \n     Middle Eastern despotism back into the shadows. Yet if the \n     gloomy predictions of the administration's many critics come \n     true, the Arab street, inflamed by Yankee imperialism, will \n     rise up and replace the shaky but friendly autocrats in the \n     region with Islamic fanatics.\n       While the Middle East is unlikely to become a democratic \n     nirvana, the worst-case scenarios, always a staple of the \n     press, are probably also wrong or exaggerated. Assuming that \n     a cornered and doomed Saddam does not kill thousands of \n     Americans in some kind of horrific Gotterdammerung--a scary \n     possibility, one that deeply worries administration \n     officials--the greatest risk of his fall is that one \n     strongman may simply be replaced by another. Saddam's \n     successor may not be a paranoid sadist. But there is no \n     assurance that he will be America's friend or forswear the \n     development of weapons of mass destruction.\n       American officials have known that Saddam was a \n     psychopath--\n\n  Get that.\n\n       American officials have known that Saddam was a psychopath \n     ever since he became the country's de facto ruler in the \n     early 1970s. One of Saddam's early acts after he took the \n     title of president in 1979 was to videotape a session of his \n     party's congress, during which he personally ordered several \n     members executed on the spot.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       American officials have known that Saddam was a psychopath \n     ever since he became the country's de facto ruler in the \n     early 1970s. One of Saddam's early acts after he took the \n     title of president in 1979 was to videotape--\n\n  Videotape--\n\n     a session of his party's congress, during which he personally \n     ordered several members executed on the spot.\n       The message, carefully conveyed to the Arab press, was not \n     that these men were executed for plotting against Saddam, but \n     rather for thinking about plotting against him. From the \n     beginning, U.S. officials worried about Saddam's taste for \n     nasty weaponry; indeed, at their meeting in 1983, Rumsfeld \n     warned that Saddam's use of chemical weapons might \n     ``inhibit'' American assistance. But top officials in the \n     Reagan administration saw Saddam as a useful surrogate. By \n     going to war with Iran, he could bleed the radical mullahs \n     who had seized control of Iran from the pro-American shah. \n     Some Reagan officials even saw Saddam as another Anwar Sadat, \n     capable of making Iraq into a modern secular state, just as \n     Sadat had tried to lift up Egypt before his assassination in \n     1981.\n       But Saddam had to be rescued first. The war against Iran \n     was going badly by 1982. Iran's ``human wave attacks'' \n     threatened to overrun Saddam's armies. Washington decided to \n     give Iraq a helping hand.\n       After Rumsfeld's visit to Baghdad in 1983, U.S. \n     intelligence began supplying the Iraqi dictator with \n     satellite photos showing Iranian deployments. Official \n     documents suggest that America may also have secretly \n     arranged for tanks and other military hardware to be shipped \n     to Iraq in a swap deal--American tanks to Egypt, Egyptian \n     tanks to Iraq. Over the protest of some Pentagon skeptics, \n     the Reagan administration began allowing the Iraqis to buy a \n     wide variety of ``dual use'' equipment and materials from \n     American suppliers. According to confidential Commerce \n     Department export-control documents obtained by NEWSWEEK, the \n     shopping list included a computerized database for Saddam's \n     Interior Ministry (presumably to help keep track of political \n     opponents); helicopters to transport Iraqi officials; \n     television cameras for ``video surveillance applications''; \n     chemical-analysis equipment for the Iraq Atomic Energy \n     Commission (IAEC), and, most unsettling, numerous shipments \n     of ``bacteria/fungi/protozoa'' to the IAEC. According to \n     former officials, the bacterial cultures could be used to \n     make biological weapons, including anthrax. The State \n     Department also approved the shipment of 1.5 million atropine \n     injectors, for use against the effects of chemical weapons, \n     but the Pentagon blocked the sale. The helicopters, some \n     American officials later surmised, were used to spray poison \n     gas on the Kurds.\n       The United States almost certainly knew from its own \n     satellite imagery that Saddam was using chemical weapons \n     against Iranian troops. When Saddam bombed Kurdish rebels and \n     civilians with a lethal cocktail of mustard gas, sarin, tabun \n     and VX in 1988, the\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\n     Reagan administration first blamed Iran, before \n     acknowledging, under pressure from congressional Democrats, \n     that the culprits were Saddam's own forces. There was only \n     token official protest at the time. Saddam's men were \n     unfazed. An Iraqi audiotape, later captured by the Kurds, \n     records Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (known as Ali \n     Chemical) talking to his fellow officers about gassing the \n     Kurds. ``Who is going to say anything?'' he asks. ``The \n     international community? F----k them!''\n       The United States was much more concerned with protecting \n     Iraqi oil from attacks by Iran as it was shipped through the \n     Persian Gulf. In 1987, an Iraqi Exocet missile hit an \n     American destroyer, the USS Stark, in the Persian Gulf, \n     killing 37 crewmen. Incredibly, the United States excused \n     Iraq for making an unintentional mistake and instead used the \n     incident to accuse Iran of escalating the war in the gulf. \n     The American tilt to Iraq became more pronounced. U.S. \n     commandos began blowing up Iranian oil platforms and \n     attacking Iranian patrol boats. In 1988, an American warship \n     in the gulf accidentally shot down an Iranian Airbus, killing \n     290 civilians. Within a few weeks, Iran, exhausted and \n     fearing American intervention, gave up its war with Iraq.\n       Saddam was feeling cocky. With the support of the West, he \n     had defeated the Islamic revolutionaries in Iran. America \n     favored him as a regional pillar; European and American \n     corporations were vying for contracts with Iraq. He was \n     visited by congressional delegations led by Sens. Bob Dole of \n     Kansas and Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who were eager to promote \n     American farm and business interests. But Saddam's \n     megalomania was on the rise, and he overplayed his hand. In \n     1990, a U.S. Customs sting operation snared several Iraqi \n     agents who were trying to buy electronic equipment used to \n     make triggers for nuclear bombs. Not long after, Saddam \n     gained the world's attention by threatening ``to burn Israel \n     to the ground.'' At the Pentagon, analysts began to warn that \n     Saddam was a growing menace, especially after he tried to buy \n     some American-made high-tech furnaces useful for making \n     nuclear-bomb parts. Yet other officials in Congress and in \n     the Bush administration continued to see him as a useful, if \n     distasteful, regional strongman. The State Department was \n     equivocating with Saddam right up to the moment he invaded \n     Kuwait in August 1990.\n\n  Mr. President, I referred to this Newsweek article yesterday at a \nhearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Specifically, during \nthe hearing, I asked Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       Mr. Secretary, to your knowledge, did the United States \n     help Iraq to acquire the building blocks of biological \n     weapons during the Iran-Iraq war? Are we in fact now facing \n     the possibility of reaping what we have sewn?\n\n  The Secretary quickly and flatly denied any knowledge but said he \nwould review Pentagon records.\n  I suggest that the administration speed up that review. My concerns \nand the concerns of others have grown.\n  A letter from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, which I \nshall submit for the Record, shows very clearly that the United States \nis, in fact, preparing to reap what it has sewn. A letter written in \n1995 by former CDC Director David Satcher to former Senator Donald W. \nRiegle, Jr., points out that the U.S. Government provided nearly two \ndozen viral and bacterial samples to Iraqi scientists in 1985--samples \nthat included the plague, botulism, and anthrax, among other deadly \ndiseases.\n  According to the letter from Dr. Satcher to former Senator Donald \nRiegle, many of the materials were hand carried by an Iraqi scientist \nto Iraq after he had spent 3 months training in the CDC laboratory.\n  The Armed Services Committee is requesting information from the \nDepartments of Commerce, State, and Defense on the history of the \nUnited States, providing the building blocks for weapons of mass \ndestruction to Iraq. I recommend that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services also be included in that request.\n  The American people do not need obfuscation and denial. The American \npeople need the truth. The American people need to know whether the \nUnited States is in large part responsible for the very Iraqi weapons \nof mass destruction which the administration now seeks to destroy.\n  We may very well have created the monster that we seek to eliminate. \nThe Senate deserves to know the whole story. The American people \ndeserve answers to the whole story.\n  Also yesterday, in the same 6 minutes that I was given in which to \nask questions--which was extended by virtue of the kindness of the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Max Cleland, and other members \nof the committee, so it was perhaps 9 or 10 minutes--there was another \ninteresting question that I asked. Let me read a portion of that \ntranscript from the Armed Services Committee:\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these hearings. Mr. \n     Secretary, to your knowledge, did the United States help Iraq \n     to acquire the building blocks of biological weapons during \n     the Iran-Iraq War? Are we, in fact, now facing the \n     possibility of reaping what we have sown?\n       Rumsfeld: Certainly not to my knowledge. I have no \n     knowledge of United States companies or government being \n     involved in assisting Iraq develop chemical, biological or \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  There is another excerpt from that question and answer period in \nwhich Secretary Rumsfeld and I engaged:\n\n       Byrd: Now, the Washington Post reported this morning \n     [yesterday] that the United States is stepping away from \n     efforts to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention. Are \n     we not sending exactly the wrong signal to the world, at \n     exactly the wrong time?\n       Doesn't this damage our credibility in the international \n     community at the very time that we are seeking their support \n     to neutralize the threat of Iraq's biological weapons \n     program? If we supplied, as the Newsweek article said, if we \n     supplied the building blocks for germ and chemical warfare to \n     this madman in the first place, this psychopath, how do we \n     look to the world to be backing away from this effort to \n     control it at this point?\n\n  That question speaks for itself. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing material be printed in the Record at the close of my remarks: \nThe partial transcript from the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing \non September 19; the article from the Washington Post of yesterday, \ntitled ``U.S. Drops Bid to Strengthen Germ Warfare Accord''; the \nNewsweek article, which I have alluded to already; a letter dated \nJanuary 6, 1994, requesting information from the Centers for Disease \nControl and a response to the Honorable Donald W. Riegle, Jr., U.S. \nSenator, dated June 21, 1995, from David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., \nDirector; a U.S. Senate Hearing Report 103-900, dealing with U.S. \nexports of biological materials to Iraq to the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs which has oversight responsibility \nfor the Export Administration Act, and keeping in mind that the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce approves licenses by that Department for \nexports; including also the U.S. Senate hearing report in that matter. \nIncluded in the approved sales are such items as Bacillus Anthracis, \nanthrax, Clostridium Botulinum, Histoplasma Capsulatum, which causes a \ndisease superficially resembling tuberculosis that may cause pneumonia; \nBrucella Melitensis, a bacteria which can cause chronic fatigue, and so \non; Clostridium Perfringens, which causes gas gangrene. I believe that \ncompletes the list.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nByrd-Rumsfeld Transcript--Partial Transcript From Senate Armed Services \n                     Committee, September 19, 2002\n\n       Levin.

I have no \n     knowledge of United States companies or government being \n     involved in assisting Iraq develop chemical, biological or \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Byrd. Mr. Secretary, let me read to you from the September \n     23, 2002, Newsweek story. I read this, I read excerpts, \n     because my time is limited.\n       ``Some Reagan officials even saw Saddam as another Anwar \n     Sadat, capable of making Iraq into a modern secular state, \n     just as Sadat had tried to lift up Egypt before his \n     assassination in 1981.

F-blank them!' exclamation \n     point, close quote.''\n       Now can this possibly be true? We already knew that Saddam \n     was dangerous man at the time. I realize that you were not in \n     public office at the time, but you were dispatched to Iraq by \n     President Reagan to talk about the need to improve relations \n     between Iraq and the U.S.\n       Let me ask you again: To your knowledge did the United \n     States help Iraq to acquire the building blocks of biological \n     weapons during the Iran-Iraq war?

I'll have a question on that \n     later.\n       Let me ask you again: Did the United States help Iraq to \n     acquire the building blocks of biological weapons during the \n     Iran-Iraq War? Are we, in fact, now facing the possibility of \n     reaping what we have sown?\n       Rumsfeld. I have not read the article. As you suggest, I \n     was, for a period in late '83 and early '84, asked by \n     President Reagan to serve as Middle East envoy after the \n     Marines--241 Marines were killed in Beirut.\n       As part of my responsibilities I did visit Baghdad. I did \n     meet with Mr. Tariq Aziz. And I did meet with Saddam Hussein \n     and spent some time visiting with them about the war they \n     were engaged in with Iran.\n       At the time our concern, of course, was Syria and Syria's \n     role in Lebanon and Lebanon's role in the Middle East and the \n     terrorist acts that were taking place.\n       As a private citizen I was assisting only for a period \n     of months. I have never heard anything like what you've \n     read, I have no knowledge of it whatsoever, and I doubt \n     it.\n       Byrd. You doubt what?\n       Rumsfeld. The questions you posed as to whether the United \n     States of America assisted Iraq with the elements that you \n     listed in your reading of Newsweek and that we could \n     conceivably now be reaping what we've sown.\n       I think--I doubt both.\n       Byrd. Are you surprised that this is what I've said? Are \n     you surprised at this story in Newsweek?\n       Rumsfeld. I guess I'm at an age and circumstance in life \n     where I'm no longer surprised about what I hear in the \n     newspapers.\n       Byrd. That's not the question, I'm of that age, too. \n     Somewhat older than you, but how about that story I've read?\n       Rumsfeld. I see stories all the time that are flat wrong. I \n     just don't know. All I can say . . .\n       Byrd. How about this story? This story? How about this \n     story, specifically?\n       Rumsfeld. As I say, I have not read it, I listened \n     carefully to what you said and I doubt it.\n       Byrd. All right.\n       Now the Washington Post reported this morning that the \n     United States is stepping away from efforts to strengthen the \n     Biological Weapons Convention. Are we not sending exactly the \n     wrong signal to the world, at exactly the wrong time?\n       Byrd. Doesn't this damage our credibility in the \n     international community at the very time that we are seeking \n     their support to neutralize the threat of Iraq's biological \n     weapons program? If we supplied, as the Newsweek article \n     said, if we supplied the building blocks for germ and \n     chemical warfare to this madman in the first place, this \n     psychopath, how do we look to the world to be backing away \n     from this effort to control it at this point?\n       Rumsfeld. Senator, I think it would be a shame to leave \n     this committee and the people listening with the impression \n     that the United States assisted Iraq with chemical or \n     biological weapons in the 1980s. I just do not believe that's \n     the case.\n       Byrd. Well, are you saying that the Newsweek article is \n     inaccurate?\n       Rumsfeld. I'm saying precisely what I said, that I didn't \n     read the Newsweek article, but that I doubt it's accurate.\n       Byrd. I'll be glad to send you up a copy.\n       Rumsfeld. But that I was not in government at that time, \n     except as a special envoy for a period of months. So one \n     ought not to rely on me as the best source as to what \n     happened in that mid-'80s period that you were describing.\n       I will say one other thing. On two occasions I believe when \n     you read that article, you mentioned the IAEC, which as I \n     recall is the International Atomic Energy Commission, and \n     mentioned that if some of the things that you were talking \n     about were provided to them, which I found quite confusing to \n     be honest.\n       With respect to the Biological Weapons Convention, I was \n     not aware that the United States government had taken a \n     position with respect to it. It's not surprising because it's \n     a matter for the Department of State, not the Department of \n     Defense.\n       If in fact they have indicated, as The Washington Post \n     reports, that they are not going to move forward with a--I \n     believe it's an enforcement regime, it's not my place to \n     discuss the administration's position when I don't know what \n     it is.\n       But I can tell you, from a personal standpoint, my \n     recollection is that the biological convention never, never \n     was anticipated that there would even be thought of to have \n     an enforcement regime. And that an enforcement regime on \n     something like that, where there are a lot of countries \n     involved who are on the terrorist list who were participants \n     in that convention, that the United States has, over a period \n     of administrations, believed that it would not be a good \n     idea, because the United States would be a net loser from an \n     enforcement regime.\n       But that is not the administration's position. I just don't \n     know what the administration's position is.\n       Levin. We're going to have to leave it there, because \n     you're way over.\n       Byrd. This is a very important question.\n       Levin. It is indeed, and you're over time, I agree with you \n     on the importance, but you're way over time, sir.\n       Byrd. I know I'm over time, but are we going to leave this \n     in question out there dangling?\n       Levin. One last question.\n       Byrd. I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional \n     five minutes.\n       Levin. No, I'm afraid you can't do that. If you could just \n     do one last--well, wait a minute, ask unanimous consent, I \n     can't stop you from doing that.\n       (Unknown). I object.\n       (Laughter)\n       Byrd. Mr. Chairman?\n       Levin. Just one last question. Would that be all right so \n     you could wind that up?\n       Senator Byrd, if you could just take one additional \n     question.\n       Byrd. I've never--I've been in this Congress 50 years. I've \n     never objected to another senator having a few additional \n     minutes.\n       Now Mr. Chairman, I think that the secretary should have a \n     copy of this report, this story that--from Newsweek that I've \n     been querying him about. I think he has a right to look at \n     that.\n       Levin. Could somebody take that out to the secretary?\n       Byrd. Now, while that's being given to the secretary, Mr. \n     Secretary, I think we're put into an extremely bad position \n     before the world today if we're going to walk away from an \n     international effort to strengthen the Biological Weapons \n     Convention against germ warfare, advising its allies that the \n     U.S. wants to delay further discussions until 2006. \n     Especially in the light of the Newsweek story; I think we \n     bear some responsibility.\n       Inhofe. Mr. Chairman I ask for a point of order.\n       Levin. Can we just have this be the last question, if you \n     would just go along with us please, Senator Inhofe?\n       Inhofe. I'll only say though, in all respect to the Senator \n     from West Virginia, we have a number of senators here. We \n     have a limited time of six minutes each, and we're entitled \n     to have our six minutes. That should be a short questions if \n     it's the last question.\n       Levin. If we could just make that the last question and \n     answer, I would appreciate it. The chair would appreciate the \n     cooperation of all senators.\n       Secretary Rumsfeld, could you answer that question please?\n       Rumsfeld. I'll do my best.\n       Senator, I just in glancing at this, and I hesitate to do \n     this because I have not read it carefully.\n       But it says here that, ``According to confidential Commerce \n     Department export control documents obtained by Newsweek, the \n     shopping list included.'' It did not say that there were \n     deliveries of these things. It said that Iran--Iraq asked for \n     these things. It talks about a shopping list.\n       Second, in listing these things, it says that they wanted \n     television cameras for video surveillance applications, \n     chemical analysis equipment for the Iraq Atomic Energy \n     Commission, the IAEC--and that may very well be the Iraqi \n     Atomic Energy Commission, which would be--mean that my \n     earlier comment would not be correct, because I thought it \n     was the International Atomic Energy Commission. But this \n     seems to indicate it's the Iraq Commerce Commission.\n       Byrd. Mr. Chairman, may I say to my friend from Oklahoma, \n     I'm amazed that he himself wouldn't yield me time for this \n     important question. I would do the same for him.\n       Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask . . .\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\n       (Cleland). I yield my five minutes, Senator.\n       Byrd. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n       Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the secretary--and I \n     don't just like to ask him--I asked him to review Pentagon \n     records to see if the Newsweek article is true or not. Will \n     the secretary do that?\n       Rumsfeld. It appears that they're Department of Commerce \n     records, as opposed to Pentagon. But I can certainly ask that \n     the Department of Commerce and, to the extent that it's \n     relevant, the Department of State, look into it and see if we \n     can't determine the accuracy or inaccuracy of some aspects of \n     this. Yes, sir.\n       Levin. And we go one step further than that. I think the \n     request is that the Defense Department search its records. \n     Will you do that?\n       Rumsfeld. We'll be happy to search ours, but this refers to \n     the Commerce Department.\n       Levin. We will ask the State Department and the Commerce \n     Department to do the same thing.\n       Rumsfeld. We'd be happy to.\n       Levin. And we will also ask the Intelligence Committee to \n     stage a briefing for all of us on that issue, so that Senator \n     Byrd's question. . .\n       Byrd. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n       Levin. Thank you very much, Senator.\n       Byrd. I thank the secretary.\n       Rumsfeld. Thank you.\n       Levin. Senator Byrd, we will ask Senator Graham and Senator \n     Shelby to hold a briefing on that subject, because it is a \n     very important subject.\n       Byrd. I thank the chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2002]\n\n            U.S. Drops Bid To Strengthen Germ Warfare Accord\n\n                           (By Peter Slevin)\n\n       The Bush administration has abandoned an international \n     effort to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention \n     against germ warfare, advising its allies that the United \n     States wants to delay further discussions until 2006. A \n     review conference on new verification measures for the treaty \n     has been scheduled for November.\n       Less than a year after a State Department envoy abruptly \n     pulled out of biowarfare negotiations in Geneva, promising \n     that the United States would return with new proposals, the \n     administration has concluded that treaty revisions favored by \n     the European Union and scores of other countries will not \n     work and should not be salvaged, administration officials \n     said yesterday.\n       The decision, which has been conveyed to allies in recent \n     weeks, has been greeted with warnings that the move will \n     weaken attempts to curb germ warfare programs at a time when \n     biological weapons are a focus of concern because of the war \n     on terrorism and the administration's threats to launch a \n     military campaign against Iraq. It also comes as the \n     administration, which has angered allies by rejecting a \n     series of multilateral agreements, is appealing to the \n     international community to work with it in forging a new U.N. \n     Security Council resolution on Iraq's programs to develop \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which has been \n     ratified by the United States and 143 other countries, bans \n     the development, stockpiling and production of germ warfare \n     agents, but has no enforcement mechanism. Negotiations on \n     legally binding measures to enforce compliance have been \n     underway in Geneva for seven years.\n       The administration stunned its allies last December by \n     proposing to end the negotiators' mandate, saying that while \n     the treaty needed strengthening, the enforcement protocol \n     under discussion would not deter enemy nations from acquiring \n     or developing biological weapons if they were determined to \n     do so. Negotiators suspended the discussions, saying they \n     would meet again in November when U.S. officials said they \n     would return with creative solutions to address the impasse.\n       Instead, U.S. envoys are now telling allies that the \n     administration's position is so different from the views of \n     the leading supporters of the enforcement protocol that a \n     meeting would dissolve into public squabbling and should be \n     avoided, administration officials said. Better, they said, to \n     halt discussions altogether.\n       ``It's based on an incorrect approach. Our concern is that \n     it would be fundamentally ineffective,'' a State Department \n     official said. Another administration official said the \n     ``best and least contentious'' approach would be to hold a \n     very brief meeting in November--or even no meeting at all--\n     and talk again when the next review is scheduled four years \n     from now.\n       Amy Smithson, a biological and chemical weapons specialist, \n     said the administration is making a mistake by halting \n     collaborative work to strengthen the convention. ``It sounds \n     to me as though they've thrown the baby out with the bath \n     water,'' said Smithson, an analyst at the Henry L. Stimson \n     Center. ``The contradiction between the rhetoric and what the \n     administration is actually doing--the gulf is huge. Not a day \n     goes by when they don't mention the Iraq threat.''\n       The Stimson Center is releasing a report today that \n     criticizes the U.S. approach to the convention. Drawn from a \n     review by 10 pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology \n     experts, the document argues that bioweapons inspections can \n     be effective with the right amount of time and the right \n     science and urges the administration to develop stronger \n     measures.\n       ``To argue that this wouldn't be a useful remedy would just \n     be a mistake. I think it's because they're looking through \n     the wrong end of the telescope,'' said Matthew Meselson, a \n     Harvard biologist who helped draft a treaty to criminalize \n     biological weapons violations. ``We're denying ourselves \n     useful tools.''\n       The administration has focused publicly on a half-dozen \n     countries identified by the State Department as pursuing germ \n     warfare programs. Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton said \n     the existence of Iraq's bioweapons project is ``beyond \n     dispute.'' The U.S. government also believes Iran, North \n     Korea, Sudan, Libya and Syria are developing such weapons, he \n     said.\n       Meselson concurred with the administration's position that \n     a limited enforcement provision for the bioweapons treaty \n     could not provide confidence that countries are staying \n     clean. But he said that a pact establishing standards and \n     verification measures would deter some countries while also \n     helping to build norms of international behavior.\n       Bolton, on the other hand, told delegates to last year's \n     review conference that ``the time for `better-than-nothing' \n     protocols is over. We will continue to reject flawed texts \n     like the BWC draft protocol, recommended to us simply because \n     they are the product of lengthy negotiations or arbitrary \n     deadlines, if such texts are not in the best interests of the \n     United States.''\n       With only hours to go at the meeting, Bolton stopped U.S. \n     participation in the final negotiations. He said of the \n     resulting one-year delay, ``This gives us time to think \n     creatively on alternatives.''\n       In Bolton's view, each country should develop criminal laws \n     against germ warfare activities, develop export controls for \n     dangerous pathogens, establish codes of conduct for \n     scientists and install strict biosafety procedures. The \n     administration has proposed that governments resolve disputes \n     over biowarfare violations among themselves, perhaps through \n     voluntary inspections or by referral to the United Nations \n     secretary general.\n       Such an approach is ``at best ineffectual,'' said the \n     specialists gathered by the Stimson Center. At worst, they \n     concluded, the approach could damage U.S. interests because \n     it would not be structured to deliver ``meaningful \n     monitoring.''\n       ``If a challenge inspection system is not geared to pursue \n     violators aggressively, then it does not serve U.S. security \n     interests,'' the 65-page report states. The participants \n     strongly favored establishing mandatory standards backed by \n     penalties and ``robust'' inspections, which goes \n     significantly further than the proposed protocol backed by \n     the EU and other nations.\n       The State Department Web site has not yet been changed to \n     reflect the change in policy. It says, ``The United States is \n     committed to strengthening the BWC as part of a comprehensive \n     and multidisciplinary strategy for combating the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     international terrorism. . . . We would like to share these \n     ideas with our international partners.''\n                                  ____\n\n\nPartial Transcript From Senate Armed Services Committee, September 19, \n                                  2002\n\n       Levin. Senator Byrd?\n       Byrd. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these hearings.\n       Mr. Secretary, to your knowledge, did the United States \n     help Iraq to acquire the building blocks of biological \n     weapons during the Iran-Iraq War? Are we, in fact, now facing \n     the possibility of reaping what we have sown?\n       Rumsfeld. Certainly not to my knowledge. I have no \n     knowledge of United States companies or government being \n     involved in assisting Iraq develop chemical, biological or \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Byrd. Mr. Secretary, let me read to you from the September \n     23, 2002, Newsweek story. I read this, I read excerpts, \n     because my time is limited.\n       ``Some Reagan officials even saw Saddam as another Anwar \n     Sadat, capable of making Iraq into a modern secular state, \n     just as Sadat had tried to lift up Egypt before his \n     assassination in 1981. But Saddam had to be rescued first. \n     The war against Iran was going badly by 1982.''\n       ``Iran's human-wave attacks threatened to overrun Saddam's \n     armies. Washington decided to give Iraq a helping hand. After \n     Rumsfeld's visit to Baghdad in 1983, U.S. intelligence began \n     supplying the Iraqi dictator with satellite photos showing \n     Iranian deployments.\n       ``Official documents suggest that America may also have \n     secretly arranged for tanks and other military hardware to be \n     shipped to Iraq in a swap deal: American tanks to Egypt, \n     Egyptian tanks to Iraq.\n       ``Over the protest of some Pentagon skeptics, the Reagan \n     administration began allowing the Iraqis to buy a wide \n     variety of, quote, `dual-use,' close quote, equipment and \n     materials from American suppliers.\n       ``According to confidential Commerce Department export \n     control documents obtained by Newsweek, the shopping list \n     include a computerized database for Saddam's Interior \n     Ministry, presumably to help keep track of political \n     opponents, helicopters to help transport Iraqi officials, \n     television cameras for video surveillance applications, \n     chemical analysis equipment for the Iraq Atomic Energy \n     Commission, IAEC, and, most unsettling, numerous shipments of \n     the bacteria, fungi, protozoa to the IAEC.\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\n       ``According to former officials the bacterial cultures \n     could be used to make biological weapons, including anthrax. \n     The State Department also approved the shipment of 1.5 \n     million atropine injectors for use against the effects of \n     chemical weapons but the Pentagon blocked the sale.\n       ``The helicopters, some American officials later surmised, \n     were used to spray poison gas on the Kurds. The United States \n     almost certainly knew from its own satellite imagery that \n     Saddam was using chemical weapons against Iranian troops.\n       ``When Saddam bombed Kurdish rebels and civilians with a \n     lethal cocktail of mustard gas, sarin, tabun and VX in 1988, \n     the Reagan administration first blamed Iran before \n     acknowledging, under pressure from congressional Democrats, \n     that the culprit were Saddam's own forces. There was only \n     token official protest at the time. Saddam's men were \n     unfazed.\n       ``An Iraqi audiotape later captured by the Kurds records \n     Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as Ali Chemical, \n     talking to his fellow officers about gassing the Kurds. \n     Quote, `Who is going to say anything?' close quote, he asks, \n     `the international community? F-blank them!' exclamation \n     point, close quote.''\n       Now can this possibly be true? We already knew that Saddam \n     was dangerous man at the time. I realize that you were not in \n     public office at the time, but you were dispatched to Iraq by \n     President Reagan to talk about the need to improve relations \n     between Iraq and the U.S.\n       Let me ask you again: To your knowledge did the United \n     States help Iraq to acquire the building blocks of biological \n     weapons during the Iran-Iraq war? Are we, in fact, now facing \n     the possibility of reaping what we have sown?\n       The Washington Post reported this morning that the United \n     is stepping away from efforts to strengthen the Biological \n     Weapons Convention. I'll have a question on that later.\n       Let me ask you again: Did the United States help Iraq to \n     acquire the building blocks of biological weapons during the \n     Iran-Iraq War? Are we, in fact, now facing the possibility of \n     reaping what we have sown?\n       Rumsfeld. I have not read the article. As you suggest, I \n     was, for a period in late `83 and early `84, asked by \n     President Reagan to serve as Middle East envoy after the \n     Marines--241 Marines were killed in Beirut.\n       As part of my responsibilities I did visit Baghdad. I did \n     meet with Mr. Tariq Aziz. And I did meet with Saddam Hussein \n     and spent some time visiting with them about the war they \n     were engaged in with Iran.\n       At the time our concern, of course, was Syria and Syria's \n     role in Lebanon and Lebanon's role in the Middle East and the \n     terrorist acts that were taking place.\n       As a private citizen I was assisting only for a period \n     of months. I have never heard anything like what you've \n     read, I have no knowledge of it whatsoever, and I doubt \n     it.\n       Byrd. You doubt what?\n       Rumsfeld. The questions you posed as to whether the United \n     States of America assisted Iraq with the elements that you \n     listed in your reading of Newsweek and that we could \n     conceivably now be reaping what we've sown.\n       I think--I doubt both.\n       Byrd. Are you surprised that this is what I've said? Are \n     you surprised at this story in Newsweek?\n       Rumsfeld. I guess I'm at an age and circumstance in life \n     where I'm no longer surprised about what I hear in the \n     newspapers.\n       Byrd. That's not the question. I'm of that age, too. \n     Somewhat older than you, but how about that story I've read?\n       Rumsfeld. I see stories all the time that are flat wrong. I \n     just don't know. All I can say . . .\n       Byrd. How about this story? This story? How about this \n     story, specifically?\n       Rumsfeld. As I say, I have not read it, I listened \n     carefully to what you said and I doubt it.\n       Byrd. All right.\n       Now the Washington Post reported this morning that the \n     United States is stepping away from efforts to strengthen the \n     Biological Weapons Convention. Are we not sending exactly the \n     wrong signal to the world, at exactly the wrong time?\n       Byrd. Doesn't this damage our credibility in the \n     international community at the very time that we are seeking \n     their support to neutralize the threat of Iraq's biological \n     weapons program? If we supplied, as the Newsweek article \n     said, if we supplied the building blocks for germ and \n     chemical warfare to this madman in the first place, this \n     psychopath, how do we look to the world to be backing away \n     from this effort to control it at this point?\n       Rumsfeld. Senator, I think it would be a shame to leave \n     this committee and the people listening with the impression \n     that the United States assisted Iraq with chemical or \n     biological weapons in the 1980s. I just do not believe that's \n     the case.\n       Byrd. Well, are you saying that the Newsweek article is \n     inaccurate?\n       Rumsfeld. I'm saying precisely what I said, that I didn't \n     read the Newsweek article, but that I doubt its accurate.\n       Byrd. I'll be glad to send you up a copy.\n       Rumsfeld. But that I was not in government at that time, \n     except as a special envoy for a period of months. So one \n     ought not to rely on me as the best source as to what \n     happened in that mid-'80s period that you were describing.\n       I will say one other thing. On two occasions I believe when \n     you read that article, you mentioned the IAEC, which as I \n     recall is the International Atomic Energy Commission, and \n     mentioned that if some of the things that you were talking \n     about were provided to them, which I found quite confusing to \n     be honest.\n       With respect to the Biological Weapons Convention, I was \n     not aware that the United States government had taken a \n     position with respect to it. It's not surprising because it's \n     a matter for the Department of State, not the Department of \n     Defense.\n       If in fact they have indicated, as The Washington Post \n     reports, that they are not going to move forward with a--I \n     believe it's an enforcement regime, it's not my place to \n     discuss the administration's position when I don't know what \n     it is.\n       But I can tell you, from a personal standpoint, my \n     recollection is that the biological convention never, never \n     was anticipated that there would even be thought of to have \n     an enforcement regime. And that an enforcement regime on \n     something like that, where there are a lot of countries \n     involved who are on the terrorist list who were participants \n     in that convention, that the United States has, over a period \n     of administrations, believed that it would not be a good \n     idea, because the United States would be a net loser from an \n     enforcement regime.\n       But that is not the administration's position. I just don't \n     know what the administration's position is.\n       Levin. We're going to have to leave it there, because \n     you're way over.\n       Byrd. This is a very important question.\n       Levin. It is indeed, and you're over time. I agree with you \n     on the importance, but you're way over time, sir.\n       Byrd. I know I'm over time, but are we going to leave this \n     in question out there dangling?\n       Levin. One last question.\n       Byrd. I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional \n     five minutes.\n       Levin. No, I'm afraid you can't do that. If you could just \n     do one last--well, wait a minute, ask unanimous consent, I \n     can't stop you from doing that.\n       (Unknown). I object.\n       (Laughter)\n       Byrd. Mr. Chairman?\n       Levin. Just one last question. Would that be all right so \n     you could wind it up?\n       Senator Byrd, if you could just take one additional \n     question.\n       Byrd. I've never--I've been in this Congress 50 years. I've \n     never objected to another senator having a few additional \n     minutes.\n       Now Mr. Chairman, I think that the secretary should have a \n     copy of this report, this story that--from Newsweek that I've \n     been querying him about. I think he has a right to look at \n     that.\n       Levin. Could somebody take that out to the secretary?\n       Byrd. Now, while that's being given to the secretary, Mr. \n     Secretary, I think we're put into an extremely bad position \n     before the world today if we're going to walk away from an \n     international effort to strengthen the Biological Weapons \n     Convention against germ warfare, advising its allies that the \n     U.S. wants to delay further discussions until 2006., \n     Especially in the light of the Newsweek story; I think we \n     bear some responsibility.\n       Inhofe. Mr. Chairman I ask for a point of order.\n       Levin. Can we just have this be the last question, if you \n     would just go along with us please, Senator Inhofe?\n       Inhofe. I'll only say though, in all respect to the senator \n     from West Virginia, we have a number of senators here. We \n     have a limited time of six minutes each, and we're entitled \n     to have our six minutes. That should be a short question if \n     it's the last question.\n       Levin. If we could just make that the last question and \n     answer, I would appreciate it. The chair would appreciate the \n     cooperation of all senators.\n       Rumsfeld. I'll do my best.\n       Senator, I just in glancing at this, and I hesitate to do \n     this because I have not read it carefully.\n       But it says here that, ``According to confidential Commerce \n     Department export control documents obtained by Newsweek, the \n     shopping list included.'' It did not say that there were \n     deliveries of these things. It said that Iran--Iraq asked for \n     these things. It talks about a shopping list.\n       Second, in listing these things, it says that they wanted \n     television cameras for video surveillance applications, \n     chemical analysis equipment for the Iraq Atomic Energy \n     Commission, the IAEC--and that may very well be the Iraqi \n     Atomic Energy Commission, which would be--mean that my \n     earlier comment would not be correct, because I thought it \n     was the International Atomic Energy Commission. But this \n     seems to indicate it's the Iraq Commerce Commission.\n       Byrd. Mr. Chairman, may I say to my friend from Oklahoma, \n     I'm amazed that he himself wouldn't yield me time for this \n     important question. I would do the same for him.\n       Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask . . .\n       (Cleland). I yield my five minutes, Senator.\n       Byrd. I thank the distinguished senator.\n       Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the secretary--and I \n     don't just like to ask him--I ask him to review Pentagon \n     records to see if the Newsweek article is true or not. Will \n     the secretary do that?\n       Rumsfeld. It appears that they're Department of Commerce \n     records, as opposed to Pentagon. But I can certainly ask that \n     the\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\n     Department of Commerce and, to the extent that it's relevant, \n     the Department of State, look into it and see if we can't \n     determine the accuracy or inaccuracy of some aspects of this. \n     Yes, sir.\n       Levin.

The date was almost 20 years ago, \n     Dec. 20, 1983; an official Iraqi television crew recorded the \n     historic moment.\n       The once and future Defense secretary, at the time a \n     private citizen, had been sent by President Ronald Reagan to \n     Baghdad as a special envoy. Saddam Hussein, armed with a \n     pistol on his hip, seemed ``vigorous and confident,'' \n     according to a new declassified State Department cable \n     obtained by Newsweek. Rumsfeld ``conveyed the President's \n     greetings and expressed his pleasure at being in Baghdad,'' \n     wrote the notetaker. Then the two men got down to business, \n     talking about the need to improve relations between their two \n     countries.\n       Like most foreign-policy insiders, Rumsfeld was aware that \n     Saddam was a murderous thug who supported terrorists and was \n     trying to build a nuclear weapon. (The Israelis had already \n     bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak.) But at the time, \n     America's big worry was Iran, not Iraq. The Reagan \n     administration feared that the Iranian revolutionaries who \n     had overthrown the shah (and taken hostage American diplomats \n     for 444 days in 1979-81) would overrun the Middle East and \n     its vital oilfields. On the theory that the enemy of my enemy \n     is my friend, the Reaganites were seeking to support Iraq in \n     a long and bloody war against Iran. The meeting between \n     Rumsfeld and Saddam was consequential: for the next five \n     years, until Iran finally capitulated, the United States \n     backed Saddam's armies with military intelligence, economic \n     aid and covert supplies of munitions.\n\n\n                             former allies\n\n       Rumsfeld is not the first American diplomat to wish for the \n     demise of a former ally. After all, before the cold war, the \n     Soviet Union was America's partner against Hitler in World \n     War II. In the real world, as the saying goes, nations have \n     no permanent friends, just permanent interests. Nonetheless, \n     Rumsfeld's long-ago interlude with Saddam is a reminder that \n     today's friend can be tomorrow's mortal threat. As President \n     George W. Bush and his war cabinet ponder Saddam's \n     successor's regime, they would do well to contemplate how and \n     why the last three presidents allowed the Butcher of Baghdad \n     to stay in power so long.\n       The history of America's relations with Saddam is one of \n     the sorrier tales in American foreign policy. Time and again, \n     America turned a blind eye to Saddam's predations, saw him as \n     the lesser evil or flinched at the chance to unseat him. No \n     single policymaker or administration deserves blame for \n     creating, or at least tolerating, a monster; many of their \n     decisions seemed reasonable at the time. Even so, there are \n     moments in this clumsy dance with the Devil that make one \n     cringe. It is hard to believe that, during most of the 1980s, \n     America knowingly permitted the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission \n     to import bacterial cultures that might be used to build \n     biological weapons. But it happened.\n       America's past stumbles, while embarrassing, are not an \n     argument for inaction in the future. Saddam probably is the \n     ``grave and gathering danger'' described by President Bush in \n     his speech to the United Nations last week. It may also be \n     true that ``whoever replaces Saddam is not going to be \n     worse,'' as a senior administration official put it to \n     Newsweek. But the story of how America helped create a \n     Frankenstein monster it now wishes to strangle is sobering. \n     It illustrates the power of wishful thinking, as well as the \n     iron law of unintended consequences.\n\n\n                          transfixed by saddam\n\n       America did not put Saddam in power. He emerged after two \n     decades of turmoil in the '60s and '70s, as various strongmen \n     tried to gain control of a nation that had been concocted by \n     British imperialists in the 1920s out of three distinct and \n     rival factions, the Sunnis, Shiites and the Kurds. But during \n     the cold war, America competed with the Soviets for Saddam's \n     attention and welcomed his war with the religious fanatics of \n     Iran. Having cozied up to Saddam, Washington. . . .\n       While the Middle East is unlikely to become a democratic \n     nirvana, the worst-case scenarios, always a staple of the \n     press, are probably also wrong or exaggerated. Assuming that \n     a cornered and doomed Saddam does not kill thousands of \n     Americans in some kind of horrific Gotterdammerung--a scary \n     possibility, one that deeply worries administration \n     officials--the greatest risk of his fall is that one \n     strongman may simply be replaced by another. Saddam's \n     successor may not be a paranoid sadist. But there is no \n     assurance that he will be America's friend or forswear the \n     development of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n                       a taste for nasty weapons\n\n       American officials have known that Saddam was a psychopath \n     ever since he became the country's de facto ruler in the \n     early 1970s. One of Saddam's early acts after he took the \n     title of president in 1979 was to videotape a session of his \n     party's congress, during which he personally ordered several \n     members executed on the spot. The message, carefully conveyed \n     to the Arab press, was not that these men were executed for \n     plotting against Saddam, but rather for thinking about \n     plotting against him. From the beginning, U.S. officials \n     worried about Saddam's taste for nasty weaponry; indeed, at \n     their meeting in 1983, Rumsfeld warned that Saddam's use of \n     chemical weapons might ``inhibit'' American assistance. But \n     top officials in the Reagan administration saw Saddam as a \n     useful surrogate. By going to war with Iran, he could bleed \n     the radical mullahs who had seized control of Iran from the \n     pro-American shah. Some Reagan officials even saw Saddam as \n     another Anwar Sadat, capable of making Iran into a modern \n     secular state, just as Sadat had tried to lift up Egypt \n     before his assassination in 1981.\n       But Saddam had to be rescued first. The war against Iran \n     was going badly by 1982. Iran's ``human wave attacks'' \n     threatened to overrun Saddam's armies. Washington decided to \n     give Iraq a helping hand. After Rumsfeld's visit to Baghdad \n     in 1983, U.S. intelligence began supplying the Iraqi dictator \n     with satellite photos showing Iranian deployments. Official \n     documents suggest that America may also have secretly \n     arranged for tanks and other military hardware to be shipped \n     to Iraq in a swap deal--American tanks to Egypt, Egyptian \n     tanks to Iraq. Over the protest of some Pentagon skeptics, \n     the Reagan administration began allowing the Iraqis to buy a \n     wide variety of ``dual use'' equipment and materials from \n     American suppliers. According to confidential Commerce \n     Department export-control documents obtained by Newsweek, the \n     shopping list included a computerized database for Saddam's \n     Interior Ministry (presumably to help keep track of political \n     opponents); helicopters to transport Iraqi officials; \n     television cameras for ``video surveillance applications''; \n     chemical-analysis equipment for the Iraq Atomic Energy \n     Commission (IAEC), and, most unsettling, numerous shipments \n     of ``bacteria/fungi/protozoa'' to the IAEC. According to \n     former officials, the bacteria cultures could be used to make \n     biological weapons, including anthrax. The State Department \n     also approved the shipment of 1.5 million atropine injectors, \n     for use against the effects of chemical weapons, but the \n     Pentagon blocked the sale. The helicopters, some American \n     officials later surmised, were used to spray poison gas on \n     the Kurds.\n\n\n                   ``who is going to say anything?''\n\n       The United States almost certainly knew from its own \n     satellite imagery that Saddam was using chemical weapons \n     against Iranian troops. When Saddam bombed Kurdish rebels and \n     civilians with a lethal cocktail of mustard gas, sarin, tabun \n     and VX in 1988, the Reagan administration first blamed Iran, \n     before acknowledging, under pressure from congressional \n     Democrats, that the culprits were Saddam's own forces. There \n     was only token official protest at the time. Saddam's men \n     were unfazed. An Iraqi audiotape, later captured by the \n     Kurds, records Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (known as \n     Ali Chemical) talking to his fellow officers about gassing \n     the Kurds. ``Who is going to say anything?'' he asks. ``The \n     international community? F--k them!''\n       The United States was much more concerned with protecting \n     Iraqi oil from attacks by Iran as it was shipped through the \n     Persian Gulf. In 1987, an Iraqi Exocet missile hit an \n     American destroyer, the USS Stark, in the Persian Gulf, \n     killing 37 crewmen. Incredibly, the United States excused \n     Iraq for making an unintentional mistake and instead used the \n     incident to accuse Iran of escalating the war in the gulf. \n     The American tilt to Iraq became more pronounced. U.S. \n     commandos began blowing up Iranian oil platforms and \n     attacking Iranian patrol boats. In 1988, an American warship \n     in the gulf accidentally shot down an Iranian Airbus, killing \n     290 civilians. Within a few weeks, Iran, exhausted and \n     fearing American intervention, gave up its war with Iraq.\n       Saddam was feeling cocky. With the support of the West, he \n     had defeated the Islamic revolutionaries in Iran. America \n     favored him as a regional pillar; European and American \n     corporations were vying for contracts with Iraq. He was \n     visited by congressional delegations led by Sens. Bob Dole of \n     Kansas and Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who were eager to promote \n     American farm and business interests. But Saddam's \n     megalomania was on the rise, and he overplayed his hand. In \n     1990, a U.S. Customs sting operation snared several Iraqi \n     agents who were trying to buy\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\n     electronic equipment used to make triggers for nuclear bombs. \n     Not long after, Saddam gained the world's attention by \n     threatening ``to burn Israel to the ground.'' At the \n     Pentagon, analysts began to warn that Saddam was a growing \n     menace, especially after he tried to buy some American-made \n     high-tech furnaces useful for making nuclear-bomb parts. Yet \n     other officials in Congress and in the Bush administration \n     continued to see him as a useful, if distasteful, regional \n     strongman. The State Department was equivocating with Saddam \n     right up to the moment he invaded Kuwait in August 1990.\n\n\n                     ambivalent about saddam's fate\n\n       Some American diplomats suggest that Saddam might have \n     gotten away with invading Kuwait if he had not been quite so \n     greedy. ``If he had pulled back to the Mutla Ridge \n     [overlooking Kuwait City], he'd still be there today,'' one \n     ex-ambassador told Newsweek. And even though President George \n     H.W. Bush compared Saddam to Hitler and sent a half-million-\n     man Army to drive him from Kuwait, Washington remained \n     ambivalent about Saddam's fate. It was widely assumed by \n     policymakers that Saddam would collapse after his defeat in \n     Desert Storm, done in by him humiliated officer corps or \n     overthrown by the revolt of a restive minority population. \n     But Washington did not want to push very hard to topple \n     Saddam. The gulf war, Bush I administration officials pointed \n     out, had been fought to liberate Kuwait, not oust Saddam. ``I \n     am certain that had we taken all of Iraq, we would have been \n     like the dinosaur in the tar pit--we would still be there,'' \n     wrote the American commander in Desert Storm, Gen. Norman \n     Schwarzkopf, in his memoirs. America's allies in the region, \n     most prominently Saudi Arabia, feared that a post-Saddam Iraq \n     would splinter and destabilize the region. The Shiites in the \n     south might bond with their fellow religionists in Iran, \n     strengthening the Shiite mullahs, and threatening the Saudi \n     border. In the north, the Kurds were agitating to break off \n     parts of Iraq and Turkey to create a Kurdistan. So Saddam was \n     allowed to keep his tanks and helicopters--which he used to \n     crush both Shiite and Kurdish rebellions.\n       The Bush administration played down Saddam's darkness after \n     the gulf war. Pentagon bureaucrats compiled dossiers to \n     support a war-crimes prosecution of Saddam, especially for \n     his sordid treatment of POWs. They documented police stations \n     and ``sports facilities'' where Saddam's henchmen used acid \n     baths and electric drills on their victims. One document \n     suggested that torture should be ``artistic.'' But top \n     Defense Department officials stamped the report secret. One \n     Bush administration official subsequently told The Washington \n     Post, ``Some people were concerned that if we released it \n     during the [1992 presidential] campaign, people would say, \n     `Why don't you bring this guy to justice?' '' (Defense \n     Department aides say politics played no part in the report.)\n       The Clinton administration was no more aggressive toward \n     Saddam. In 1993, Saddam apparently hired some Kuwaiti liquor \n     smugglers to try to assassinate former president Bush as he \n     took a victory lap through the region. According to one \n     former U.S. ambassador, the new administration was less than \n     eager to see an open-and-shut case against Saddam, for fear \n     that it would demand aggressive retaliation. When American \n     intelligence continued to point to Saddam's role, the \n     Clintonites lobbed a few cruise missiles into Baghdad. The \n     attack reportedly killed one of Saddam's mistresses, but left \n     the dictator defiant.\n\n\n                       clinton-era covert actions\n\n       The American intelligence community, under orders from \n     President Bill Clinton, did mount covert actions aimed at \n     toppling Saddam in the 1990s, but by most accounts they were \n     badly organized and halfhearted. In the north, CIA operatives \n     supported a Kurdish rebellion against Saddam in 1995. \n     According to the CIA's man on the scene, former case officer \n     Robert Baer, Clinton administration officials back in \n     Washington ``pulled the plug'' on the operation just as it \n     was gathering momentum. The reasons have long remained murky, \n     but according to Baer, Washington was never sure that \n     Saddam's successor would be an improvement, or that Iraq \n     wouldn't simply collapse into chaos. ``The question we could \n     never answer,'' Baer told Newsweek, ``was, `After Saddam \n     goes, then what?' '' A coup attempt by Iraqi Army officers \n     fizzled the next year. Saddam brutally rolled up the \n     plotters. The CIA operatives pulled out, rescuing everyone \n     they could, and sending them to Guam.\n       Meanwhile, Saddam was playing cat-and-mouse with weapons of \n     mass destruction. As part of the settlement imposed by \n     America and its allies at the end of the gulf war, Saddam was \n     supposed to get rid of his existing stockpiles of chem-bio \n     weapons, and to allow in inspectors to make sure none were \n     being hidden or secretly manufactured. The U.N. inspectors \n     did shut down his efforts to build a nuclear weapon. But \n     Saddam continued to secretly work on his germ- and chemical-\n     warfare program. When the inspectors first suspected what \n     Saddam was trying to hide in 1995, Saddam's son-in-law, \n     Hussein Kamel, suddenly fled Iraq to Jordan. Kamel had \n     overseen Saddam's chem-bio program, and his defection forced \n     the revelation of some of the secret locations of Saddam's \n     deadly labs. That evidence is the heart of the ``white \n     paper'' used last week by President Bush to support his \n     argument that Iraq has been defying U.N. resolutions for the \n     past decade. (Kamel had the bad judgment to return to Iraq, \n     where he was promptly executed, along with various family \n     members.)\n       By now aware of the scale of Saddam's efforts to deceive, \n     the U.N. arms inspectors were unable to certify that Saddam \n     was no longer making weapons of mass destruction. Without \n     this guarantee, the United Nations was unwilling to lift the \n     economic sanctions imposed after the gulf war. Saddam \n     continued to play ``cheat and retreat'' with--the inspectors, \n     forcing a showdown in December 1998. The United Nations \n     pulled out its inspectors, and the United States and Britain \n     launched Operation Desert Fox, four days of bombing that was \n     supposed to teach Saddam a lesson and force his compliance.\n       Saddam thumbed his nose. The United States and its allies, \n     in effect, shrugged and walked away. While the U.N. sanctions \n     regime gradually eroded, allowing Saddam to trade easily \n     on the black market, he was free to brew all the chem-bio \n     weapons he wanted. Making a nuclear weapon is harder, and \n     intelligence officials still believe he is a few years \n     away from even regaining the capacity to manufacture \n     enriched uranium to build his own bomb. If he can steal or \n     buy ready-made fissile material, say from the Russian \n     mafia, he could probably make a nuclear weapon in a matter \n     of months, though it would be so large that delivery would \n     pose a challenge.\n\n\n                              lashing out?\n\n       As the Bush administration prepares to oust Saddam, one way \n     or another, senior administration officials are very worried \n     that Saddam will try to use his WMD arsenal Intelligence \n     experts have warned that Saddam may be ``flushing'' his \n     small, easy-to-conceal biological agents, trying to get them \n     out of the country before an American invasion. A vial of \n     bugs or toxins that could kill thousands could fit in a \n     suitcase--or a diplomatic pouch. There are any number of grim \n     end-game scenarios. Saddam could try blackmail, threatening \n     to unleash smallpox or some other grotesque virus in an \n     American city if U.S. forces invaded. Or, like a cornered \n     dog, he could lash out in a final spasm of violence, raining \n     chemical weapons down on U.S. troops, handing out his \n     bioweapons to terrorists. ``That's the single biggest worry \n     in all this,'' says a senior administration official. ``We \n     are spending a lot of time on this,'' said another top \n     official.\n       Some administration critics have said, in effect, let \n     sleeping dogs lie. Don't provoke Saddam by threatening his \n     life; there is no evidence that he has the capability to \n     deliver weapons of mass destruction. Countered White House \n     national-security adviser Condoleezza Rice, ``Do we wait \n     until he's better at it?'' Several administration officials \n     indicated that an intense effort is underway, covert as well \n     as overt, to warn Saddam's lieutenants to save themselves by \n     breaking from the dictator before it's too late. ``Don't be \n     the fool who follows the last order'' is the way one senior \n     administration official puts it.\n       The risk is that some will choose to go down with Saddam, \n     knowing that they stand to be hanged by an angry mob after \n     the dictator falls. It is unclear what kind of justice would \n     follow his fall, aside from summary hangings from the nearest \n     lamppost.\n\n\n                            post-saddam iraq\n\n       The Bush administration is determined not to ``overthrow \n     one strongman only to install another,'' a senior \n     administration official told Newsweek. This official said \n     that the president has made clear that he wants to press for \n     democratic institutions, government accountability and the \n     rule of law in post-Saddam Iraq. But no one really knows how \n     that can be achieved. Bush's advisers are counting on the \n     Iraqis themselves to resist a return to despotism. ``People \n     subject to horrible tryanny have strong antibodies to anyone \n     who wants to put them back under tyranny,'' says a senior \n     administration official. But as another official \n     acknowledged, ``a substantial American commitment'' to Iraq \n     is inevitable.\n       At what cost? And who pays? Will other nations chip in \n     money and men? It is not clear how many occupation troops \n     will be required to maintain order, or for how long. Much \n     depends on the manner of Saddam's exit: whether the Iraqis \n     drive him out themselves, or rely heavily on U.S. power. \n     Administration officials shy away from timeables and \n     specifies but say they have to be prepared for all \n     contingencies. ``As General Eisenhower said, `Every plan gets \n     thrown out on the first day of battle. Plans are useless. \n     Planning is everything','' said Vice President Cheney's chief \n     of staff, I, Lewis (Scooter) Libby.\n       It is far from clear that America will be able to control \n     the next leader of Iraq, even if he is not as diabolical as \n     Saddam. Any leader of Iraq will look around him and see that \n     Israel and Pakistan have nuclear weapons and that Iran may \n     soon. Just as England and France opted to build their own \n     bombs in the cold war, and not depend on the U.S. nuclear \n     umbrella, the next president of Iraq may want to have his own \n     bomb. ``He may want to, but he can't be allowed to,'' says a \n     Bush official. But what is to guarantee that a newly rich \n     Iraqi strongman won't buy one with his nation's vast oil \n     wealth? In some ways, Iraq is to the Middle East as Germany \n     was to Europe in the 20th century, too large, too \n     militaristic and too competent to coexit peacebly with \n     neighbors. It took two world wars and millions of lives to \n     solve ``the German problem.'' Getting rid of Saddam may be \n     essential to creating a stable, democratic\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\n     Iraq.

Donald W. Riegle, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Riegle: In 1993, at your request, the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) forwarded to your \n     office a listing of all biological materials, including \n     viruses, retroviruses, bacteria, and fungi, which CDC \n     provided to the government of Iraq from October 1, 1984, \n     through October 13, 1993. Recently, in the course of \n     reviewing our shipping records for a Freedom of Information \n     Act (FOIA) request from a private citizen, we identified an \n     additional shipment, on May 21, 1985, that was not included \n     on the list that was provided to your office. Following this \n     discovery, we conducted a thorough review of all of our \n     shipping records and are confident that we have now included \n     a listing of all shipments. A corrected list is enclosed \n     (Note: the new information is italicized).\n       These additional materials were hand-carried by Dr. \n     Mohammad Mahoud to Iraq after he had spent three months \n     training in a CDC laboratory. Most of the materials were non-\n     infectious diagnostic reagents for detecting evidence of \n     infections to mosquito-borne viruses. Only two of the \n     materials are on the Commodity Control List, i.e., Yersinin \n     Pestis (the agent of plague) and dengue virus.

Pursuant to \nthe Act, Committee staff contacted the U.S. Department of Commerce and \nrequested information on the export of biological materials during the \nyears prior to the Gulf War. After receiving this information, we \ncontacted a principal supplier of these materials to determine what, if \nany, materials were exported to Iraq which might have contributed to an \noffensive or defensive biological warfare program. Records available \nfrom the supplier for the period from 1985 until the present show that \nduring this time, pathogenic (meaning ``disease producing''), toxigenic \n(meaning ``poisonous''), and other biological research materials were \nexported to Iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce. Records prior to 1985 were not available, \naccording to the supplier. These exported biological materials were not \nattenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction. According to \nthe Department of Defense's own Report to Congress on the Conduct of \nthe Persian Gulf War, released in April 1992:\n  ``By the time of the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq had developed \nbiological weapons. It's advanced and aggressive biological warfare \nprogram was the most advanced in the Arab world. The program probably \nbegan late in the 1970's and concentrated on the development of two \nagents, botulinum toxin and anthrax bacteria. . . . Large scale \nproduction of these agents began in 1989 at four facilities near \nBaghdad. Delivery means for biological agents ranged from simple aerial \nbombs and artillery rockets to surface-to-surface missiles.''\n  Included in the approved sales are the following biological materials \n(which have been considered by various nations for use in war), with \ntheir associated disease symptoms:\n  Bacillus Anthracis: anthrax is a disease-producing bacteria \nidentified by the Department of Defense in the The Conduct of the \nPersian Gulf War: Final Report to Congress, as being a major component \nin the Iraqi biological warfare program.\n  Anthrax is an often-fatal infectious disease due to ingestion of \nspores. It begins abruptly with high fever, difficulty in breathing, \nand chest pain. The disease eventually results in septicemia (blood \npoisoning), and the mortality is high. Once septicemia is advanced, \nantibiotic therapy may prove useless, probably because the exotoxins \nremain, despite the death of the bacteria.\n  Clostridium Botulinum: a baterial source of botulinum toxin, which \ncauses vomiting, constipation, thirst, general weakness, headache, \nfever, dizziness, double vision, dilation of the pupils and paralysis \nof the muscles involving swallowing. It is often fatal.\n  Histoplasma Capsulatum: causes a disease superficially resembling \ntuberculosis that may cause pneumonia, enlargement of the liver and \nspleen, anemia, an influenza-like illness and an acute inflammatory \nskin disease marked by tender red modules, usually on the shins. \nReactivated infection usually involves the lungs, the brain, spinal \nmembranes, heart, peritoneum, and the adrenals.\n  Brucella Melitensis: a bacterial which can cause chronic fatigue, \nloss of appetite, profuse sweating when at rest, pain in joints and \nmuscles, insomnia, nausea, and damage to major organs.\n  Clostridium Perfringens: a highly toxic bacteria which causes gas \ngangrene. The bacteria produce toxins that move along muscle bundles in \nthe body killing cells and producing necrotic tissue that is then \nfavorable for further growth of the bacteria itself. Eventually, these \ntoxins and bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause systemic illness.\n  In addition, several shipments of Escherichia Coli (E.Coli) and \ngenetic materials, as well as human and bacterial DNA, were shipped \ndirectly to the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission.\n  The following is a detailed listing of biological materials, provided \nby the American Type Culture Collection, which were exported to \nagencies of the government of Iraq pursuant to the issuance of an \nexport licensed by the U.S. Commerce Department:\n  Date: February 8, 1985\n  Sent to: Iraq Atomic Energy Agency\n  Materials Shipped: Ustilago nuda (Jensen) Rostrup.\n  Date: February 22, 1985\n  Sent to: Ministry of Higher Education\n  Materials Shipped: Histoplasma capsulanum var. farciminosum (ATCC \n32136).

This suggests that the Iraqi \n     government may have been experimenting with the materials \n     cited above (E. coli and rDNA) in an effort to create \n     genetically altered microorganisms (novel biological warfare \n     agents). Committee staff plans to interview the BW3 team \n     leader, Col. David Franz of the United States Army Medical \n     Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in the \n     near future. This phase of the investigation continues.\n\n\n                       Biological Warfare Defense\n\n       The following section, describing the types, dissemination, \n     and defensive measures against biological agents, is quoted \n     verbatim from a United States Marine Corps Institute \n     document, Nuclear and Chemical Operations, MCI 7711B, used in \n     the Command and Staff College's nonresident program. It is \n     clear from this document that the Department of Defense \n     recognizes both the threat and U.S. vulnerability to \n     biological weapons. This document also outlines the \n     Department's understanding of what actions should be taken in \n     the event that a biological weapon has been or is suspected \n     to have been employed.\n       ``Biological agents cannot be detected by the human senses. \n     A person could become a casualty before he is aware he has \n     been exposed to a biological agent. An aerosol or mist of \n     biological agent is borne in the air. These agents can \n     silently and effectively attack man, animals, plants, and in \n     some cases, materiel. Agents can be tailored for a specific \n     type of target.\n       Methods of using antipersonnel agents undoubtedly vary so \n     that no uniform pattern of employment or operation is \n     evident. It is likely that agents will be used in \n     combinations so that the disease symptoms will confuse \n     diagnosis and interfere with proper treatment. It is also \n     probable that biological agents would be used in heavy \n     concentrations to insure a high percentage of infection in \n     the target area. The use of such concentrations could result \n     in the breakdown of individual immunity because the large \n     number of micro-organisms entering the body could \n     overwhelm the natural body defenses.\n     Types of biological agents\n       Different antipersonnel agents require varying periods of \n     time before they take effect, and the periods of time for \n     which they will incapacitate a person also vary. Most of the \n     diseases having antipersonnel employment potential are found \n     among group of diseases that are naturally transmitted \n     between animals and man. Mankind is highly vulnerable to them \n     since he has little contact with animals in today's urban \n     society. The micro-organisms of possible use in warfare are \n     found in four naturally occurring groups--the fungi, \n     bacteria, ricketisiae, and viruses.\n       a. Fungi. Fungi occur in many forms and are found almost \n     everywhere. They range in size from a single cell, such as \n     yeast, to multicellular forms, such as mushrooms and \n     puffballs. Their greatest employment potential is against \n     plants, although some forms cause disease in man. A fungus \n     causes the disease coccidioidomycosis in man. Other common \n     infections caused by Fungi include ringworm and ``athletes \n     foot.''\n       b. Bacteria. Bacteria comprise a large and varied group of \n     organisms. They occur in varying shapes, such as rods, \n     spheres, and spirals, but they are all one-celled plants. \n     Some bacteria can assume a resistant structure called a \n     spore, which enables them to resist adverse environmental \n     conditions. Others may produce poisonous substances called \n     toxins. Examples of human disease caused by bacteria are \n     anthrax, brucellosis, tularemia, staphylococcus, and \n     streptococcus.\n       c. Rickettsiae. Rickettsiae organisms have the physical \n     appearances of bacteria and the growth characteristics of \n     viruses. Members of this group must have living tissue for \n     growth and reproduction, whereas most fungi and bacteria can \n     be grown on artificial material. Another characteristic of \n     rickettsiae is that most diseases caused by this group are \n     transmitted by the bite of an insect, such as the mosquito, \n     mite, or tick. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Q fever, and \n     typhus are diseases of mankind caused by rickettsiae.\n       d. Virus. The smallest living things known to mankind are \n     virsuses. Viruses are so small that an electron microscope is \n     required to see them. Viruses cannot be grown in the absence \n     of living tissue. Diseases which are caused by viruses cannot \n     normally be treated with antibiotics. Viruses cause yellow \n     fever, rabies, and poliomyelitis.\n     Dissemination of biological agents\n       a. Aerosol. Biological agents may be disseminated on, or \n     over, the target by many means, such as aircraft, missiles, \n     and explosive munitions. These devices produce a biological \n     aerosol, and, if antipersonnel biological agents are ever \n     used, they will probably be disseminated in the form of \n     biological mists or aerosols. This method of dissemination \n     would be extremely effective because the micro-organisms \n     would be drawn into the lungs as a person breathes, and there \n     they would be rapidly absorbed into the blood stream. The \n     hours from dusk until dawn appear to be the best time for \n     dissemination of biological agents. The weather conditions \n     are most favorable for these agents at night, since sunlight \n     will destroy many of them. In field trials, using harmless \n     biological aerosols, area coverages of thousands of square \n     miles have been accomplished. The aerosol particles were \n     carried for long distances by air currents. (emphasis added)\n       b. Living Hosts. Personnel may be infected by disease \n     carrying vectors, such as insects, rats, or other animals. \n     Mosquitos may\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\n     spread malaria, yellow fever, or encephalitis; rats spread \n     plague (any mammal may carry rabies). Militarily, specific \n     vectors may be selected, infected as required, and then \n     released in the target area to seek out their human victims \n     and pass on the disease. Since infection is transmitted \n     through a bite in the skin, protective masks offer no \n     protection. A vectorborne agent may remain in the target area \n     for as long as there are live hosts; thus, a major \n     disadvantage results. The vectorborne agent can become a \n     permanent hazard in the area as the host infects others of \n     his species.\n       c. Food and Water Contamination. Biological agents could \n     also be delivered to target personnel by placing the agent in \n     food and water supplies (sabotage). This type of attack would \n     probably be directed against small targets, such as \n     industrial complexes, headquarters, or specific individuals. \n     The methods of delivering the attack are many and varied.\n     Defensive Measures\n       The United States carries out research aimed at improved \n     means of detection of biological agents and treatment and \n     immunization of personnel. Both of these are essential to \n     biological defense.\n       a. Before an Attack. The inability of the individual to \n     detect a biological attack is perhaps the greatest problem. \n     Contributing factors are the delay experienced before the \n     onset of symptoms and the time required to identify specific \n     agents. Without an adequate means of detection, complete \n     defensive measures may not be taken since an attack must \n     first be detected before you can defend against it. Diseases \n     caused by biological agents do not appear until a few days to \n     weeks after contact with the agent. Personnel are protected \n     against biological agents in aerosol form by the protective \n     mask. Ordinary clothing protects the skin from contamination \n     by biological agents. Other means of protection include \n     immunizations; quarantining contaminated areas; cleanliness \n     of the body, clothing, and living quarters; stringent rodent \n     and pest control; proper care of cuts and wounds; and \n     education of troops to eat and drink only from approved \n     sources.\n       b. After an Attack: After a biological agent attack has \n     occurred, it will be necessary to identify the agent used in \n     the attack so that proper medical treatment may be given to \n     exposed personnel. To perform this identification, it is \n     necessary to collect samples or objects from the contaminated \n     area and send them to a laboratory or suitable facility for \n     processing. Samples may be taken from the air, from \n     contaminated surfaces, or from contaminated water. After the \n     sample is taken, laboratory time will be required to identify \n     the suspected biological agent. The length of time for \n     identification is being significantly shortened through the \n     use of new medical and laboratory techniques. Proper \n     defensive actions taken during a biological attack depend \n     upon the rapid detection of the attack. Biological defense is \n     continuous. You must always be prepared for the employment of \n     these weapons. (emphasis added)\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the \n     leadership of the Russian Federation has publicly committed \n     itself to building--\n       [(A) a society with democratic political institutions and \n     practices, the observance of universally recognized standards \n     of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and\n       [(B) a market economy based on internationally accepted \n     principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of \n     law.\n       [(2) In order to facilitate this transition, the \n     international community has provided multilateral and \n     bilateral technical assistance, and the United States' \n     contribution to these efforts has played an important role in \n     developing new institutions built on democratic and liberal \n     economic foundations and the rule of law.\n       [(3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic \n     reform programs and public diplomacy programs, including \n     training, small grants, and technical assistance to \n     independent television, radio, and print media across the \n     Russian Federation, have strengthened nongovernment-owned \n     media, provided access to and training in the use of the \n     Internet, brought nearly 40,000 Russian citizens to the \n     United States, and have led to the establishment of over \n     65,000 nongovernmental organizations, thousands of vibrant \n     independent media outlets, and numerous political parties.\n       [(B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free \n     and fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999 and \n     Presidential elections in 1996 and 2000.\n       [(4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to \n     replace its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with \n     a market economy and helped create institutions and \n     infrastructure for a market economy by encouraging the \n     transparent privatization of state-owned enterprises. \n     Approximately two-thirds of the Russian Federation's gross \n     domestic product is now generated by the private sector.\n       [(5)(A) The United States fostered grassroots \n     entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United \n     States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized \n     businesses and by providing training, consulting services, \n     and small loans to more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.\n       [(B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in \n     the Russian Federation, producing 12 to 15 percent of the \n     gross domestic product of the Russian Federation.\n       [(C) United States-funded programs help to fight corruption \n     and financial crime, such as money laundering, by helping \n     to--\n       [(i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;\n       [(ii) develop an independent judiciary;\n       [(iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil \n     code, and bankruptcy law;\n       [(iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the \n     Russian Federation's equivalent of the United States \n     Securities and Exchange Commission;\n       [(v) support Russian law schools;\n       [(vi) create legal aid clinics; and\n       [(vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental \n     organizations.\n       [(6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces \n     and the civil society to organize and defend democratic gains \n     without international support is uncertain, and because the \n     gradual integration of the Russian Federation into the global \n     order of free-market, democratic nations will further enhance \n     Russian cooperation with the United States on a wide-range of \n     political, economic, and security issues, the success of \n     democracy in Russia is in the national security interest of \n     the United States, and the United States Government should \n     develop a far-reaching and flexible strategy aimed at \n     strengthening Russian society's support for democracy and a \n     market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian democratic \n     institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, and \n     supporting Russia's independent media.\n       [(7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the \n     Russian Federation has stood with the United States and the \n     civilized world in the struggle against terrorism and has \n     cooperated in the war in Afghanistan by sharing intelligence \n     and through other means.\n       [(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       [(1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic \n     government and of a free and independent media and to sustain \n     the development of an independent civil society in the \n     Russian Federation based on religious and ethnic tolerance, \n     internationally recognized human rights, and an \n     internationally recognized rule of law; and\n       [(2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on \n     using local expertise and giving local organizations a \n     greater role in designing and implementing such programs, \n     while maintaining appropriate oversight and monitoring.\n\n     [SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       [(a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Government should--\n       [(1) recognize that a democratic and economically stable \n     Russian Federation is inherently less confrontational and \n     destabilizing in its foreign policy and therefore that the \n     promotion of democracy in Russia is in the national security \n     interests of the United States; and\n       [(2) continue and increase assistance to the democratic \n     forces in the Russian Federation, including the independent \n     media, regional administrations, democratic political \n     parties, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       [(b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       [(1) to facilitate Russia's integration into the Western \n     community of nations, including supporting the establishment \n     of a stable democracy and a market economy, and also \n     including Russia's membership in the appropriate \n     international institutions;\n       [(2) to engage the Government of Russian Federation and \n     Russian society in order to\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\n     strengthen democratic reform and institutions, and to promote \n     good governance principles based on the internationally \n     recognized norms of transparency in business practices, the \n     rule of law, religious freedom, and human rights;\n       [(3) to advance a dialog between United States Government \n     officials and private sector individuals and representatives \n     of the Government of the Russian Federation regarding Russian \n     integration into the Western community of nations;\n       [(4) to encourage United States Government officials and \n     private sector individuals to meet regularly with democratic \n     activists, human rights activists, representatives of the \n     independent media, representatives of nongovernmental \n     organizations, civic organizers, and reform-minded \n     politicians from Moscow and the various regions of the \n     Russian Federation;\n       [(5) to incorporate democratic reforms, the promotion of an \n     independent media, and economic reforms in the broad United \n     States agenda with the Government of the Russian Federation;\n       [(6) to encourage the Government of the Russian Federation \n     to address cross-border issues, including the environment, \n     crime, trafficking, and corruption in a cooperative and \n     transparent manner consistent with internationally recognized \n     and accepted principles of the rule of law;\n       [(7) to consult with the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Russian Parliament on the adoption of \n     economic and social reforms necessary to sustain Russian \n     economic growth and to ensure Russia's transition to a fully \n     functioning market economy;\n       [(8) to persuade the Government of the Russian Federation \n     to honor its commitments made to the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the November \n     1999 Istanbul Conference and to conduct a genuine good \n     neighbor policy toward the other independent states of the \n     former Soviet Union in the spirit of internationally accepted \n     principles of regional cooperation; and\n       [(9) to encourage the G-7 partners and international \n     financial institutions, including the World Bank, the \n     International Monetary Fund, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development, to develop financial \n     safeguards and transparency practices in lending to the \n     Russian Federation.\n\n     [SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Russian Democracy Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the \n     leadership of the Russian Federation has publicly committed \n     itself to building--\n       (A) a society with democratic political institutions and \n     practices, the observance of universally recognized standards \n     of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and\n       (B) a market economy based on internationally accepted \n     principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) In order to facilitate this transition, the \n     international community has provided multilateral and \n     bilateral technical assistance, and the United States' \n     contribution to these efforts has played an important role in \n     developing new institutions built on democratic and liberal \n     economic foundations and the rule of law.\n       (3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic \n     reform programs and public diplomacy programs, including \n     training, and small grants have provided access to and \n     training in the use of the Internet, brought nearly 40,000 \n     Russian citizens to the United States, and have led to the \n     establishment of more than 65,000 nongovernmental \n     organizations, thousands of independent local media outlets, \n     despite governmental opposition, and numerous political \n     parties.\n       (B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free and \n     fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999.\n       (4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to \n     replace its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with \n     a market economy and helped create institutions and \n     infrastructure for a market economy. Approximately two-thirds \n     of the Russian Federation's gross domestic product is now \n     generated by the private sector, and the United States \n     recognized Russia as a market economy on June 7, 2002.\n       (5)(A) The United States has fostered grassroots \n     entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United \n     States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized \n     businesses and by providing training, consulting services, \n     and small loans to more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.\n       (B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in the \n     Russian Federation, producing 12 to 15 percent, depending on \n     the estimate, of the gross domestic product of the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (C) United States-funded programs have contributed to \n     fighting corruption and financial crime, such as money \n     laundering, by helping to--\n       (i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;\n       (ii) develop an independent judiciary;\n       (iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil \n     code, and bankruptcy law;\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\n       (iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the \n     Russian Federation's equivalent of the United States \n     Securities and Exchange Commission;\n       (v) support Russian law schools;\n       (vi) create legal aid clinics; and\n       (vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental \n     organizations.\n       (6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces and \n     the civil society to organize and defend democratic gains \n     without international support is uncertain, and because the \n     gradual integration of the Russian Federation into the global \n     order of free-market, democratic nations would enhance \n     Russian cooperation with the United States on a wide range of \n     political, economic, and security issues, the success of \n     democracy in Russia is in the national security interest of \n     the United States, and the United States Government should \n     develop a far-reaching and flexible strategy aimed at \n     strengthening Russian society's support for democracy and a \n     market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian democratic \n     institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, and \n     supporting Russia's independent media.\n       (7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the \n     Russian Federation has stood with the United States and the \n     rest of the civilized world in the struggle against terrorism \n     and has cooperated in the war in Afghanistan by sharing \n     intelligence and through other means.\n       (8) United States-Russia relations have improved, leading \n     to a successful summit between President Bush and President \n     Putin in May 2002, resulting in a ``Foundation for \n     Cooperation''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic \n     government and of free and independent media, and to sustain \n     the development of an independent civil society in the \n     Russian Federation based on religious and ethnic tolerance, \n     internationally recognized human rights, and an \n     internationally recognized rule of law; and\n       (2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on \n     using local expertise and to give local organizations a \n     greater role in designing and implementing such programs, \n     while maintaining appropriate oversight and monitoring.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Government should--\n       (1) recognize that a democratic and economically stable \n     Russian Federation is inherently less confrontational and \n     destabilizing in its foreign policy and therefore that the \n     promotion of democracy in Russia is in the national security \n     interests of the United States; and\n       (2) continue and increase assistance to the democratic \n     forces in the Russian Federation, including the independent \n     media, regional administrations, democratic political \n     parties, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to facilitate Russia's integration into the Western \n     community of nations, including supporting the establishment \n     of a stable democracy and a market economy within the \n     framework of the rule of law and respect for individual \n     rights, including Russia's membership in the appropriate \n     international institutions;\n       (2) to engage the Government of the Russian Federation and \n     Russian society in order to strengthen democratic reform and \n     institutions, and to promote transparency and good governance \n     in all aspects of society, including fair and honest business \n     practices, accessible and open legal systems, freedom of \n     religion, and respect for human rights;\n       (3) to advance a dialogue among United States Government \n     officials, private sector individuals, and representatives of \n     the Government of the Russian Federation regarding Russia's \n     integration into the Western community of nations;\n       (4) to encourage United States Government officials and \n     private sector individuals to meet regularly with democratic \n     activists, human rights activists, representatives of the \n     independent media, representatives of nongovernmental \n     organizations, civic organizers, church officials, and \n     reform-minded politicians from Moscow and all other regions \n     of the Russian Federation;\n       (5) to incorporate democratic reforms, the promotion of \n     independent media, and economic reforms in a broader United \n     States dialogue with the Government of the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (6) to encourage the Government of the Russian Federation \n     to address, in a cooperative and transparent manner \n     consistent with internationally recognized and accepted \n     principles, cross-border issues, including the \n     nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     environmental degradation, crime, trafficking, and \n     corruption;\n       (7) to consult with the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Russian Parliament on the adoption of \n     economic and social reforms necessary to sustain Russian \n     economic growth and to ensure Russia's transition to a fully \n     functioning market economy and membership in the World Trade \n     Organization;\n       (8) to persuade the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     honor its commitments made to the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the November 1999 \n     Istanbul Conference, and to conduct a genuine good neighbor \n     policy toward the other independent states of the former \n     Soviet Union in the spirit of internationally accepted \n     principles of regional cooperation; and\n       (9) to encourage the G-8 partners and international \n     financial institutions, including the World Bank, the \n     International Monetary Fund, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development, to develop financial \n     safeguards and transparency practices in lending to the \n     Russian Federation.\n\n     SEC. 4.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the \n     leadership of the Russian Federation has publicly committed \n     itself to building--\n       (A) a society with democratic political institutions and \n     practices, the observance of universally recognized standards \n     of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and\n       (B) a market economy based on internationally accepted \n     principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (2) In order to facilitate this transition, the \n     international community has provided multilateral and \n     bilateral technical assistance, and the United States' \n     contribution to these efforts has played an important role in \n     developing new institutions built on democratic and liberal \n     economic foundations and the rule of law.\n       (3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic \n     reform programs and public diplomacy programs, including \n     training, and small grants have provided access to and \n     training in the use of the Internet, brought nearly 40,000 \n     Russian citizens to the United States, and have led to the \n     establishment of more than 65,000 nongovernmental \n     organizations, thousands of independent local media outlets, \n     despite governmental opposition, and numerous political \n     parties.\n       (B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free and \n     fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999.\n       (4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to \n     replace its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with \n     a market economy and helped create institutions and \n     infrastructure for a market economy. Approximately two-thirds \n     of the Russian Federation's gross domestic product is now \n     generated by the private sector, and the United States \n     recognized Russia as a market economy on June 7, 2002.\n       (5)(A) The United States has fostered grassroots \n     entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United \n     States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized \n     businesses and by providing training, consulting services, \n     and small loans to more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.\n       (B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in the \n     Russian Federation, producing 12 to 15 percent, depending on \n     the estimate, of the gross domestic product of the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (C) United States-funded programs have contributed to \n     fighting corruption and financial crime, such as money \n     laundering, by helping to--\n       (i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;\n       (ii) develop an independent judiciary;\n       (iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil \n     code, and bankruptcy law;\n       (iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the \n     Russian Federation's equivalent of the United States \n     Securities and Exchange Commission;\n       (v) support Russian law schools;\n       (vi) create legal aid clinics; and\n       (vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental \n     organizations.\n       (6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces and \n     the civil society to organize and defend democratic gains \n     without international support is uncertain, and because the \n     gradual integration of the Russian Federation into the global \n     order of free-market, democratic nations would enhance \n     Russian cooperation with the United States on a wide range of \n     political, economic, and security issues, the success of \n     democracy in Russia is in the national security interest of \n     the United States, and the United States Government should \n     develop a far-reaching and flexible strategy aimed at \n     strengthening Russian society's support for democracy and a \n     market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian democratic \n     institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, and \n     supporting Russia's independent media.\n       (7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the \n     Russian Federation has stood with the United States and the \n     rest of the civilized world in the struggle against terrorism \n     and has cooperated in the war in Afghanistan by sharing \n     intelligence and through other means.\n       (8) United States-Russia relations have improved, leading \n     to a successful summit between President Bush and President \n     Putin in May 2002, resulting in a ``Foundation for \n     Cooperation''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic \n     government and of free and independent media, and to sustain \n     the development of an independent civil society in the \n     Russian Federation based on religious and ethnic tolerance, \n     internationally recognized human rights, and an \n     internationally recognized rule of law; and\n       (2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on \n     using local expertise and to give local organizations a \n     greater role in designing and implementing such programs, \n     while maintaining appropriate oversight and monitoring.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Government should--\n       (1) recognize that a democratic and economically stable \n     Russian Federation is inherently less confrontational and \n     destabilizing in its foreign policy and therefore that the \n     promotion of democracy in Russia is in the national security \n     interests of the United States; and\n       (2) continue and increase assistance to the democratic \n     forces in the Russian Federation, including the independent \n     media, regional administrations, democratic political \n     parties, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to facilitate Russia's integration into the Western \n     community of nations, including supporting the establishment \n     of a stable democracy and a market economy within the \n     framework of the rule of law and respect for individual \n     rights, including Russia's membership in the appropriate \n     international institutions;\n       (2) to engage the Government of the Russian Federation and \n     Russian society in order to strengthen democratic reform and \n     institutions, and to promote transparency and good governance \n     in all aspects of society, including fair and honest business \n     practices, accessible and open legal systems, freedom of \n     religion, and respect for human rights;\n       (3) to advance a dialogue among United States Government \n     officials, private sector individuals, and representatives of \n     the Government of the Russian Federation regarding Russia's \n     integration into the Western community of nations;\n       (4) to encourage United States Government officials and \n     private sector individuals to meet regularly with democratic \n     activists, human rights activists, representatives of the \n     independent media, representatives of nongovernmental \n     organizations, civic organizers, church officials, and \n     reform-minded politicians from Moscow and all other regions \n     of the Russian Federation;\n       (5) to incorporate democratic reforms, the promotion of \n     independent media, and economic reforms in a broader United \n     States dialogue with the Government of the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (6) to encourage the Government of the Russian Federation \n     to address, in a cooperative and transparent manner \n     consistent with internationally recognized and accepted \n     principles, cross-border issues, including the \n     nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     environmental degradation, crime, trafficking, and \n     corruption;\n       (7) to consult with the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Russian Parliament on the adoption of \n     economic and social reforms necessary to sustain Russian \n     economic growth and to ensure Russia's transition to a fully \n     functioning market economy and membership in the World Trade \n     Organization;\n       (8) to persuade the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     honor its commitments made to the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the November 1999 \n     Istanbul Conference, and to conduct a genuine good neighbor \n     policy toward the other independent states of the former \n     Soviet Union in the spirit of internationally accepted \n     principles of regional cooperation; and\n       (9) to encourage the G-8 partners and international \n     financial institutions, including the World Bank, the \n     International Monetary Fund, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development, to develop financial \n     safeguards and transparency practices in lending to the \n     Russian Federation.\n\n     SEC. 4.
