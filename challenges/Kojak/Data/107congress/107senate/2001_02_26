Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Allen, is recognized to read Washington's Farewell \nAddress.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, it is my honor to read George \nWashington's Farewell Address. As a preface to reading this address, I \nwould like to make a few remarks so that everyone gets the context of \nthe Farewell Address of George Washington.\n  In September of 1796, worn out by the burdens of the Presidency and \nattacks of political foes, George Washington announced his decision not \nto seek a third term. A student of history will see that Alexander \nHamilton and James Madison left their fingerprints in helping President \nWashington compose this Farewell Address which is his political \ntestament to the Nation.\n  The Farewell Address, which was designed to inspire and guide future \ngenerations, set forth Washington's defense of his administration's \nrecord and embodied a classic statement of Federalist doctrine.\n  Washington's principal concern was for the safety of the 8-year-old \nConstitution, and he believed the stability of the Republic was \nthreatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political \nfactionalism, and interference by foreign powers in the Nation's \ndomestic affairs.\n  George Washington did not publicly deliver his Farewell Address. It \nfirst appeared on September 19, 1796, in the Philadelphia Daily \nAmerican Advertiser and then in papers throughout our country.\n  On to the address entitled ``Washington's Farewell Address.''\n  Mr. ALLEN, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\nof duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever partiality may be \nretained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our \ncountry you will not disapprove my determination to retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty.\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\nIn this sense it is, that your Union ought to be considered as a main \nprop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to \nyou the preservation of the other.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nown country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity gilding with \nthe appearances of virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable \ndeference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the \nbase or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nVirginia on the reading of George Washington's Address. I listened \ncarefully. I think we all share the thought and vision expressed in \nthat address when it was first made. Each year it has been repeated, \nand being part of that tradition adds to the stature of our new Senator \nfrom the State of Virginia. I am pleased to have listened attentively \nto his reading.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nof the distinguished junior Senator from the State of Alaska concerning \nthe meaning of the address and its eternal and continuing truths. We \nwould all do well to listen annually to the reading of this address. I \nthank the distinguished junior Senator from Virginia for his eloquence \nand for his reading of the message this morning.\n  I am only sorry more Senators have not attended this important \noccasion. That is nothing new. I have, I think, attended the reading of \nthe Farewell Address of our first and foremost and greatest President, \nGeorge Washington, for many years. I try always to attend if I am in \nthe city, and it goes without saying that I am generally here at this \ntime.\n  I always get something new out of listening to this address. I only \nhope in the future our colleagues and our joint leadership will attempt \nto attend and encourage the attendance of all Senators to the reading \nof this address.\n  I close by thanking my colleague, Mr. Allen, again. I thank the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me also comment on the statement of \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, who clearly leads the way of all \nSenators as the historian of this body.\n  Reminding us that each time he has learned something new and takes a \nnew appreciation of that with him is something we can all reflect on in \nour own lives so we, through our own contribution, can make things just \na little bit better for someone somewhere--even our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I am going to be introducing today \nlegislation which has been forthcoming for some time. The legislation \nis the specific energy bill that has been worked on by a number of my \ncolleagues and professional staff on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. As a consequence, what we have here is a comprehensive bill \nthat will be introduced twice because one version will go to the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and that will be titles 1-8; and \nanother version with the entire text, titles 1-9, will be referred to \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is sponsored by myself and Senator \nBreaux. It is bipartisan legislation. Included as original cosponsors \nare Senator Lott, Senator Voinovich, Senator Domenici, Senator Craig, \nSenator Campbell, Senator Thomas, Senator Shelby, Senator Burns, and \nSenator Hagel.\n  The purpose of the bill specifically is to protect the energy \nsecurity of the United States and to decrease America's dependence on \nforeign oil sources to 50 percent by the year 2001 by enhancing the use \nof renewable energy resources, conserving energy resources, improving \nenergy efficiency, increasing domestic energy supplies, improving \nenvironmental air quality by the reduction of emissions from air \npollutants and greenhouse gases, and decreasing the effects of \nincreases in energy prices on the American consumers as well.\n  I would like to talk at some length this afternoon on what comprises \nthis particular legislation. I am going to be referring specifically to \nthe items in the comprehensive energy bill which is the National Energy \nSecurity Act of 2001.\n  I think it is fair to say we all have taken energy for granted for \nfar too long. Yet now, with a weakening economy, increasing energy \ncosts, and regional shortages, we are much more aware of the reality \nthat we have really not had a real energy policy for most of the last \ndecade--something we just took for granted--and suddenly we are seeing \nthe spirals, we are seeing the shortages, and we are becoming \nconcerned.\n  I think it is also fair in most cases to understand that energy is \none of those nebulous things that is really so important that it is \noften overlooked. It grows our food, heats and cools our homes, and \npowers our electronic world. It is really what keeps us alive.\n  We have fought over energy. We just came back from the Persian Gulf \nwar. Wars have been fought over energy. Billions of dollars are spent \njust to ensure that we have access to energy in various forms.\n  Our continued economic prosperity depends on a clean, secure, and \naffordable energy supply. It is for this reason that I rise today to \nintroduce the National Energy Security Act of 2001.\n  What we put before the Senate today is a balanced portfolio of energy \noptions, and to begin debate on these important issues.\n  Let me advise the President that by no means is this intended to be \nthe package necessarily of comprehensive energy legislation that will \nultimately come out of the committees of jurisdiction--the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and the Finance Committee--and onto the \nfloor.\n  The purpose of the legislation is so that we can begin the debate on \nthe important issues to determine just what kind of energy policy we \nshould have in this country.\n  I should also mention that this particular legislation as proposed \ndoes not have the input of the new administration. They have only been \nin office for about 5 weeks. It is my understanding that an energy task \nforce has been put together, by the order of the President, with the \nresponsibility given to Vice President Cheney. They anticipate having \nan energy policy developed within 45 or 60 days. Undoubtedly, the input \nfrom the administration is going to be a necessary additive to the \nultimate debate, and legislation will be forthcoming.\n  During the last decade, the United States has lost control of its \nenergy future. At no time in our history have we relied upon others for \nmore of our energy supplies while producing a smaller percentage of the \nenergy we consume.\n  Ten years ago, the U.S. imported less than half of the oil it \nconsumed; today, that has increased to nearly 60 percent. Meanwhile, \nother types of energy have been made more difficult to produce, more \ndifficult to deliver, and more difficult to use.\n  The rapid growth of the Internet and the ``dot-com'' economy during \nthe 1990s led to significant increase in demand for energy. Yet, \ndespite this increase in demand, domestic production of all forms of \nenergy has remained flat over the last four years.\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\n  The impacts on the American consumer have been clear: higher energy \nprices, less economic growth, and less prosperity for all.\n  We can take a lesson from history. The lack of a coherent energy \npolicy has led to the greatest energy price volatility since the energy \ncrises of the 1970's.\n  For much of the past two years, global supply of crude oil has been \nnearly equal to global demand. As a result, crude oil prices have \nincreased from $8.50 two years ago to near $30 today. We have seen the \ndomestic development of oil in the United States drop proportionately. \nIt is rather interesting to note, however, the development of the OPEC \ncartel and the discipline that has been evidenced by that group in the \nlast several months as they have dropped the supply from time to time \nto ensure that the price remains between that ceiling and floor of $22 \nto $28, and by controlling production they can keep that price range.\n\n  Last summer, consumers faced gasoline price spikes in the Midwest as \nrefineries were unable to keep up with demand. Gas prices over $2 per \ngallon were the norm.\n  As refineries were operating at capacity to produce gasoline, they \nwere unable to produce the heating oil we needed for the winter. We \nfaced a heating oil shortage, particularly in the Northeast.\n  Many consumers turned to natural gas to meet their winter heating \nneeds, but expansion in gas-fired power plants has strained supply. \nWe've seen natural gas prices increase from $1.80 per 1,000 cubic feet \ntwo years ago to over $10.00 in recent weeks.\n  And most recently, we've seen the consequences of inadequate \nelectricity supply in California--no new power plants in 10 years--\nblackouts, elevators stuck, traffic lights off; and schools, fertilizer \nplants, plastic and computer chip makers were all affected.\n  Fertilizer plants refuse to make urea. They are now selling it. Urea \nis a by-product of gas. We are seeing aluminum companies, rather than \nproduce aluminum, sell their electricity.\n  All of these energy ``crises'' have a common cause: Supply of energy \nsimply isn't keeping pace with demand in spite of our efforts at \nconservation.\n  With the economy on its longest joyride in history, policy makers \nchose not to check the fuel gauge. Our tank now almost empty, and our \neconomic engine is sputtering. It is time to make tough choices. Add \nfuel to the tank.\n  The time has come for a sound national energy policy--one that uses \nthe fuels of today to yield the technologies of tomorrow.\n  Our national energy plan--the National Energy Security Act of 2001--\nhas at its core three fundamental goals:\n  Increased supply of conventional fuels--oil, coal, gas, nuclear.\n  We do it more efficiently and with the latest technology that \nprovides cleaner utilization of these sources of energy.\n  Second, improve energy efficiency and conservation. We have the \ntechnology for clean coal. We have the utilization of nuclear. We just \nneed to address what to do with the waste.\n  Third, expand the use of alternative fuels and renewable energy. We \nhave this capability. Unfortunately, renewables and alternatives take a \nvery small percentage of our energy mix--less than 4 percent. We have \nspent some $6 billion in research. We are going to have to spend \nmore. But we simply cannot rely on alternatives and renewables. We have \nto go back to the basic sources of our energy--our oil, our coal, our \ngas, and our nuclear.\n\n  What does this legislation do? Some have called this an ANWR bill, \nbut it is far more than that. I will talk about that a little later. \nBut I hope my colleagues will look closely at this legislation and see \nthat it is an attempt to have a balanced approach to meet our energy \nneeds.\n  These new programs and incentives will help us to find, develop, \ndeliver, and conserve all our domestic energy resources. In doing so, \nwe will reduce our reliance on foreign oil to less than 50 percent by \nthe year 2010 to protect our energy security. That is a goal of this \nlegislation. It will not eliminate our dependence, but it will simply \nreduce it.\n  How do we do that? We do that by an expansion of our conventional \nsources of energy--our coal, our oil, our natural gas, and our nuclear, \nand using our technology to achieve it. Our objective is to provide the \nenergy our economy requires for continued growth.\n  Again, we can improve the environmental quality of these fuels by \ninvesting in advanced research and development programs and providing \ntax incentives for developing new, cleaner, more efficient \ntechnologies. We encourage new investment in energy infrastructure, \ntransmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and drilling equipment. By \ndoing so, we get the best technology out of the market. We have that \ntechnological capability, and we take steps to ensure the reliability \nof the Nation's electric power supply so critical for today's new \neconomy.\n  We also provide new programs and incentives to expand the supply of \nrenewable energy at home and alternative fuels in our automobiles.\n  A robust domestic energy industry--both fossil and renewables--helps \nto keep energy prices stable and affordable. I think you would agree, \nMr. President, that is good business. And it is good for the consumer. \nBut it is more than just supply.\n  Our legislation is not only about supply, as some would have you \nthink. We also focus on using energy more efficiently.\n  Our legislation expands funding for the weatherization and LIHEAP \nenergy assistance programs. It provides assistance to lower monthly \nenergy bills and protects consumers and low-income families. We \nencourage State and regional energy conservation programs to minimize \nthe effects of regional shortages in energy supply like the kinds we \nhave recently seen in California.\n  This legislation includes several new incentives for energy-efficient \nhomes, appliances, and vehicles to conserve energy resources and \nimprove efficiency.\n  Finally, we provide new incentives for emerging distributed energy \ntechnologies that can provide reliable energy for business needs and \ncombined heat and power technology to use waste energy more efficiently \nas space heating.\n  This new national energy strategy makes good economic sense. It \nprotects consumers and low-income families against higher monthly \nenergy bills. It reduces the likelihood of price spikes that can wipe \nout a company's profits or a family's savings overnight. It keeps the \nheat and lights on for the Nation's factories, homes, and businesses, \nand maintains economic growth.\n  It is also good from the standpoint of the environment. It makes good \nenvironmental sense, with cleaner, more efficient use of energy using \nnew technologies and fewer air pollutants and greenhouse gases.\n  The ``wild ride'' in energy markets over the past 2 years has made \nour energy challenge very clear: We need to establish a sound national \nenergy policy to ensure clean, secure, and affordable energy supplies. \nThis policy must use all our fuels--fossil and renewables--to meet \nthose needs, as well as conservation and alternatives.\n  The legislation we have introduced today is the first attempt to \narticulate the elements of a sound national energy strategy. Other \nelements we must also address separately are access issues, regulatory \nreform, nuclear waste, and climate change. But we must start now. I \nlook forward to working with the President and my Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues to enact this legislation into law.\n  This morning we opened this effort with a press conference. It was \nrather interesting to note some of the questions that were posed \nrelative to the legislation Senator Breaux and I, along with Senator \nLott and others, have introduced.\n  There was the question of, how much is this bill going to cost? \nUnfortunately, the Joint Tax Committee has not given us a figure. We \nexpect that within 10 days. But it is a lot cheaper than not doing \nanything, if you will. And that is where we have been for far too long.\n  Another question was about, how important is the ANWR, the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge? Developing a national energy strategy is \nreally a team effort. ANWR is one of the best players on that team \nbecause it is the one area where the geologists have said there is \nlikely to be a major oilfield of\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\ngigantic proportions, somewhere in the area of 10 billion barrels and \nperhaps as much as 16 billion barrels. What does that mean? Well, 16 \nbillion barrels would be what we would import from Saudi Arabia for a \n30-year period of time. We do not believe we can afford to leave that \nsource on the sidelines. We believe we have the technology to do it \nsafely. Some have asked, how will this bill provide relief in \nCalifornia? There is certainly no immediate solutions to the California \nsituation. California, unfortunately, became dependent on outside \nsources. I think there is a bit of a parallel there. I understand \nCalifornia is currently importing about 25 percent of its energy from \noutside the State. As a consequence, California has become vulnerable \nbecause they have not developed their own sources of energy. They \nprefer to buy it from other States that have surpluses.\n  Without going into the inefficiencies of deregulation--which was \nreally not a true deregulation when you maintain a cap on retail \nprices--it is fair to say there is a situation where, in the sense of \nour increased dependence on imported oil, we are too dependent on \noutside sources. As a consequence of that, I think we are certainly \nvulnerable to price hikes for oil as well.\n  So I think that as we look at the California situation, we should \nrecognize the exposure we have here in the United States on our \nincreased dependence on oil, which is about 56 percent.\n  The question came up: What comments have we gotten from the \nadministration? President Bush recognizes the need for a national \nstrategy. Vice President Cheney has been leading a task force to \ndevelop their own initiatives. It is my understanding that effort is \ngoing to be completed in about 45 days. So we look forward to \nincorporating their comments into our ongoing work at the appropriate \ntime.\n  We have had meetings with our colleagues over in the House, \nCongressman Tauzin and Congressman Barton. And we have had a very \npositive response relative to the manner in which we hope to bring this \nlegislation through the House and Senate.\n\n  Now, when will we have a vote on this? Obviously, it is going to the \ncommittees of jurisdiction for hearings--the Energy Committee and the \nFinance Committee. But what we wanted to do is get the debate started \non the entire bill so we can move through the committee process and, \nhopefully, to the floor at a later date.\n  Some have said this bill calls for more nuclear power, and will this \nrequire an accelerated program for nuclear waste storage? We need to \nuse all our domestic resources. Inasmuch as nuclear contributes about \n20 percent of the total electric energy in this country, it is \nimportant that we continue our efforts to try to resolve what to do \nwith the nuclear waste.\n  As you know, Mr. President, we were one vote short in the last \nCongress of overriding a Presidential veto. The difficulty with the \nnuclear waste issue is no one wants the waste. As a consequence, as we \npursue our efforts in Nevada to develop the Yucca Mountain site, there \nis a noted lack of support from the Nevadans.\n  That is understandable, yet that waste has to go somewhere. As we \nlook at some of the technology that has developed over the years, we \nfind the French have addressed, through the vitrification process, the \nrecovery of plutonium, putting it back in reactors, burning it, and \nbasically getting rid of that proliferation. We don't seem to be able \nto do that in this country. Maybe we should give more thought to it.\n  There has been a question brought up about providing some short-term \nchanges such as increasing CAFE standards in the legislation. We think \nwe have addressed this because we have, as far as CAFE standards, put \nthe burden on the Federal Government to have its vehicles pick up about \n3 additional miles to the gallon, and that is a good place to start \nbefore we dictate to the American public any mandates with regard to \nthis. It is fair to say that if it works for the Government, then the \nGovernment ought to lead the way.\n  There are some other points I will bring to the attention of the \nSenate at this time relative to the state we are in. This came about as \na release last week from the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, a well-renowned defense and foreign policy think tank here in \nWashington. It includes scholars, both moderates and conservatives, \nfrom both parties, and their conclusion in a three-volume, 3-year \neffort entitled ``Geopolitics of Energy into the 21st Century.''\n  The new study predicts that the U.S. and other industrial nations \nwill become increasingly dependent on oil from the Middle East in the \nnext 20 years and will need the region's most unstable countries--Iran, \nIraq, and Libya--to raise their output. I wonder, at what price to the \nU.S.\n  Furthermore, I refer to a Wall Street Journal article on February 15 \nand an AP article of February 14 on the same subject, indicating that \nglobal demand will grow sharply over the next two decades. The oil will \ncome from areas with increased risk of supply interruptions. Further, \nit states, by 2020, half of all petroleum used by the world will be met \nfrom countries that impose a high risk of internal stability. World \nenergy demand will increase by 50 percent, and at some point developing \ncountries, led by China, will begin to consume more energy than the \ndeveloped countries.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield, I \ncame to the floor to commend and congratulate the distinguished \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for his work on \nthis very important legislation. It is overdue. It is very broad, \ncomprehensive legislation that is designed to address this problem. I \nthink he should be recognized for the effort he has put into it.\n  This is a bill that has been developed in a bipartisan way with all \ndifferent views and regions of the country reflected in various \ncomponents of the bill. I acknowledge that.\n  I ask the Senator, when does he expect there will be some input from \nthe administration, and how does he plan to proceed in terms of \ncommittee hearings and when he might actually get legislation ready for \nthe Senate to consider?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate that inquiry. As I believe the leader \nrecalls, the President has appointed Vice President Cheney to form a \ntask force developing an energy policy for the administration. That \ntask force has been at work for some time. My understanding is they \nshould have this ready in about 45 days.\n  I am most appreciative of the Senator's cosponsorship, along with \nthat of Senator Breaux. This is a bipartisan package. It will go to the \ntwo committees of jurisdiction--the one I chair, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and the other is the Finance Committee. We will \nbegin hearings as soon as I have had an opportunity to sit down with \nSenator Bingaman and find some mutually compatible dates. We intend to \nmove on this and get the debate started because, as the Senator knows, \nit is a very comprehensive piece of legislation. There is going to be a \nlot of input into it. There are certain things we have to get done, and \nwe need an estimate from Joint Tax.\n  This legislation is meant to stimulate new technology, to provide \nincentives for the small independents, the stripper wells, so we can \nkeep those people going when the prices decline. It is not addressed to \nthe large oil companies that can fend very well for themselves.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his response. I asked so I could \nhave some plan as to when we might bring it to the Senate. I hope that \ncertainly in June or July of this year we would be able to get to it.\n  Let me ask the Senator another question. I don't want to take up all \nof his time. I would like to have some brief time to make some remarks \nof my own. I believe we are importing now 56 percent of the oil needs \nof this country.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. The largest increase is now coming \nfrom Iraq, from Saddam Hussein. Remember, we fought a war over there in \n1991.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is right. When I go around the country, I find there \nare a number of States with additional oil that could be used if we \ncould get it out of the ground. It is not being used. There are a lot \nof areas of the country, such as my own, where we have a substantial \nsupply of natural gas but there has not been an incentive or incentives \nfor us to convert to natural gas, which is clean burning and has been a \ncheaper source of energy, even though, because of all the demand, it \nhas been going up.\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n  I found, when I was in Kentucky last week, there is substantial \nprogress being made in clean coal technology that we could make better \nuse of coal. In my own State, we have a nuclear plant but no place to \nput the nuclear waste. When I go out west, I see other sources being \nused. Wind is one example. The list is endless of the potential we have \nin this country. Yet we are not using it.\n  I wonder if the American people think we have a shortage of energy \nsupply. I ask the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, do we have a shortage? If we don't, why are we \nimporting 56 percent of our energy needs from the OPEC countries of the \nworld? I think this is totally indefensible.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think our national energy security interest is at \nrisk. We fought a war over there to keep Saddam Hussein from invading \nKuwait or going into Saudi Arabia. At what point do we compromise our \nnational security? I think if we see fit to fight a war over it, it is \npretty important. As the Department of Energy predicts, in the year \n2006 or 2007, we will be in the high 60s, 60-some-odd-percent dependent \non imports.\n  We have tremendous reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. We have reserves \nin the overthrust belt in my State of Alaska and tremendous resources \nof natural gas in Mississippi and Alabama, Texas, Louisiana. We have \nthese resources. We have the technology to develop them safely. We have \nhad a difficult time, perhaps, convincing the environmental community \nthat we can make a smaller footprint. We can do a better job. And we \nhave the American ingenuity and commitment to do it, if given the \nopportunity.\n  Many of these areas have been closed for exploration and development.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I go around the country and around my own \nState, more and more people are bringing this subject up to me. People \nare complaining about gasoline prices. They are complaining about their \nelectricity bills or their natural gas bills. Out in the real world \npeople seem to be concerned about it and mad about it, but when I come \nback here, I don't get the sense of urgency. In fact, there are a lot \nof people who seem to think all we need to do with our energy problem \nis provide more incentives to weatherize our houses, which is fine, and \nprovide more money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nmoney that we give to low-income individuals to meet their heating and \nair-conditioning costs.\n  Now, I emphasize that while those are both fine in this bill, they \nare not an energy policy. The answer to the energy shortage is not for \nthe Federal Government to pay the additional cost of not having an \nadequate supply.\n  So I commend the Senator for including those provisions in his bill. \nIt is comprehensive. He has more incentives for exploration and \nconservation, for alternative sources, and for low-income needs. I look \nforward to us actually getting to the floor and having a full debate \nand amendments.\n  If we complete this year not having passed a major national energy \npolicy bill, it is going to be a big mistake, a tragedy. I think it is \nthe biggest threat to our future economic prosperity. If we don't do \nthis now, we could be in danger because there won't be the power to run \nSilicon Valley or new automobile manufacturing plants or anything else. \nThere will be shortages, and that will be a mistake for our future \neconomy.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I wanted to engage in a little bit \nof a discussion about when we are going to take this up.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \nmajority leader. I thank him for his commitment and enthusiasm to make \nsure this legislation is of the importance that it obviously is as we \nlook at the situation in California. We just recognize, for example, we \nhave huge resources of coal in this country--huge resources. We have \nthe technology to clean that coal and reduce emissions. We haven't \nbuilt a new coal-fired plant since the mid-1990s. Why? We could not get \na permit, for all practical purposes. All the emphasis has been on \nnatural gas.\n  If you are going to generate electricity, you get natural gas. It is \nbecoming short in the sense that our reserves that are attainable are \nbeing pulled down very rapidly. So we are going to have to find, if you \nwill, new reserves. We have the Gulf of Mexico, with the technology, \ndrilling in 3,000 to 6,000 feet of water. While there is a risk \nassociated with that, they have new technology virtually reducing that \nrisk to a large degree, so it is manageable. I think we have to \nconvince our environmental friends we do have the technology to make \nthe footprint smaller, to do a better job, and to get on with the \nreality that we can't conserve our way out of this energy crisis. We \nhave to simply produce more energy and sustain ourselves with new \ntechnologies, renewables, alternatives, and we have to conserve.\n  Nevertheless, when you talk about solar panels, in Alaska, sometimes \nit gets dark in the winter for a long time. The wind doesn't always \nblow like it does in Washington, DC, or sometimes in this Chamber. \nNevertheless, when you and I leave here, we have to have jet fuel in \nthat airplane, not hot air. I think it affords us the responsibility \nthat we have to come up with some meaningful legislation.\n  If the majority leader would care to speak at this time, I am happy \nto yield the floor on this matter. I would appreciate being recognized \nupon the conclusion of his remarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today's fuel prices are a daily reminder \nthat America is now at the mercy of foreign oil producing nations. \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil directly threatens our national \nsecurity and our freedom. However, before you blame your neighbor's \nSUV, your local fuel distributors, the oil companies, the automakers, \nor any of the other usual scapegoats, consider this fact--America is \none of the leading energy producing countries in the world. This \ncountry has the technology, alternative resources and enough oil and \nnatural gas to be much more self-sufficient. America does not have to \nrevert back to the practices of the 1970s.\n  This country is faced with a very serious problem. Our nation's's \nfarmers are being hit hard--due to the cost of home heating bills, farm \nfuel costs, gasoline, and the impact of the crisis on the fertilizer \nindustry. For obvious reasons, the transportation industry is also \nseeing a significant hit in air cargo and passenger transportation, \nintercity bus, trucking, and rail transportation. This in turn affects \nthe tourism industry. Rising oil prices impact more than just energy \ncosts. They are absorbed into a wide variety of goods causing a general \nincrease in consumer prices. This cost increase threatens the engine of \nthe nation's economy, our nation's small businesses.\n  All of this is simply because of the lack of an energy policy. As a \nresult, U.S. crude oil production is down significantly, as consumption \ncontinues to rise. America now imports over 56 percent of the oil it \nconsumes--compared to 36 percent at the time of the 1973 Arab oil \nembargo. At this rate the Department of Energy predicts America will be \nat least 65 percent dependent on foreign oil by 2020.\n  The National Energy Security Act of 2001, which we are introducing \ntoday, seeks an overall goal: To enhance national security by reducing \ndependence on foreign energy sources while protecting consumers by \nproviding stable supplies at affordable prices. It provides incentives \nfor the use of natural gas--a fuel which can burn cleanly in internal \ncombustion engines, and which is abundant within our own borders--\nespecially in the Gulf of Mexico. It also calls on America to utilize \nother domestic resources through incentives which encourage the use of \nmarginal oil wells, and the billions of barrels of oil we have in \nAlaska. Likewise, this measure does not ignore the use of renewable \nenergy resources such as solar power, hydro-power, or wind power. \nHowever, Congress must acknowledge that America cannot realistically \nrun only on renewable energy resources. Coal, oil, and natural gas \nremain our most abundant and affordable fuels, and they can be used in \nenvironmentally sound ways.\n  Some 55% of the electricity generated in the United States comes from \ncoal-fired steam generating plants. Coal can make a significant \ncontribution to U.S. energy security, if the environmental challenges \nof coal-fired plants can be met. This legislation will\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\nprovide credits for emissions reductions and efficiency improvements. \nIt will also provide a tax credit on investments in qualifying system \nof continuous emission control installed on existing coal-based units.\n  Congress must provide incentives for independent producers to keep \ntheir wells pumping, as well. Tax credits for marginal wells will \nrestore our link to existing oil resources, including many in my home \nstate of Mississippi. These wells are responsible for 50% of U.S. \nproduction.\n  We also need to increase the availability of domestic natural gas, \nwhich is the clean alternative for coal in electric power plants. \nFederal land out West may contain as much as 137 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. Similarly there is Federal land in Alaska which is \nestimated to contain 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oil None of \nthese facts should be surprising.\n  There has to be a solution to this problem. Some would say that all \nwe need to do is improve energy efficiency and reduce energy \nconsumption. While there is a place for energy efficiency incentives in \ndeveloping a natural energy policy, we must not starve our economy of \nthe energy it needs to maintain and improve our standard of living. In \nthe long run, a national energy policy that looks at all realistic \nsources of energy must be developed.\n  This is not the 1970s, America has better technology, more efficient \nand cleaner automobiles as well as more energy options. The question \nis: How long will we forgo these options and be held hostage to nations \nabroad or extremists at home? Millions of Americans are enduring \nmandated power outages because of lack of power infrastructure or are \nstuck with bigger heating bills due to increased demand and limited \nproduction of energy. America must tap the vast resources we have. If \nnot, those bills are just going to get bigger, and those outages will \noccur more frequently. America can solve its energy problems but \nCongress must act in the interests of the entire nation, rather than a \nselect few. America badly needs a comprehensive, but realistic, \nnational energy policy, and we need it now.\n  Mr. President, again, as we have been discussing, today's fuel prices \nare a daily reminder that America is now at the mercy of foreign oil-\nproducing nations. America's dependence on foreign oil directly \nthreatens our national security and our freedom. We need to think about \nthat and recognize it.\n  The situation we have seen in California is not going to be unique, \nand it is not just going to apply to the Midwest or the Northeast. This \nis going to be a national problem. It is going to affect our economy \nand our future security.\n  When we have the possibility that Iraq can cut off part of our oil \nsupply, and maybe involve other Arab OPEC countries, that is extremely \ndangerous. Yes, we have SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but only \nenough for a few days--perhaps a few weeks--at which point we would be \non our economic knees and in danger from a security standpoint.\n  A lot of people want to blame something else: Oh, it is your \nneighbor's SUV; it is your local fuel distributors who are gouging you; \nor the oil companies are doing it because they want to make more money; \nor the automobile manufacturers can produce automobiles more fuel \nefficient. Perhaps they can, and I hope they will continue to make our \nautomobiles better and more fuel efficient all the time, and they have \nbeen doing that.\n  There are any number of scapegoats. Before we do that, we should stop \nand realize America has plenty of energy sources. It is just that we \nare not using them or getting them out of the ground, and we are not \ntaking advantage of the alternative fuels the way we should. We have \nthe technology. That is why I specifically mention this clean coal \ntechnology. I am sure the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \ncould tell you about it. There is a plant over here in Maryland that is \nusing, I guess, a forward-leaning experimental basis--clean coal \ntechnology. We should explore that to the greatest extent possible. \nThat is a resource of which we have a large supply. It is all across \nthe board. Yet there are many in this country who say let's just revert \nback to the 1970s; let's just go with conservation; let's not worry \nabout supply. I think that is a problem.\n  Our Nation's farmers are being hit hard. They are paying higher \nprices for farm fuel costs, heating bills, gasoline. That is affecting \nthe fertilizer industry. For obvious reasons, the transportation \nindustry is seeing a significant hit in air cargo and passenger \ntransportation, intercity buses, trucking, and rail transportation. It \nhas affected the entire economy already. Indications are--and perhaps \nthe Senator from Alaska has already noted this--that the current oil \nprice situation has already spiked up the CPI by four-tenths of a \npoint. That is huge. But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to \nfigure out how that would be happening because of the rising oil prices \nand the impact they have on energy costs across the board.\n  It is affecting consumer prices, and small businesses are also being \nhit. All this is simply because of the lack of a national energy \npolicy. We thought we confronted this problem back in the 1970s when we \nhad the long lines at gasoline stations. Remember, I think they had \nmarathon sessions here in the Senate. We took action and we thought \nthat would not happen again. We didn't do enough. America now imports \nabout 56 percent of the oil we consume compared to 36 percent at the \ntime of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. At this rate, the Department of \nEnergy predicts America will be at least 65-percent dependent on \nforeign oil by 2020. That is extremely dangerous.\n\n  The National Energy Security Act of 2001, which we are introducing \ntoday, seeks an overall goal: To enhance national security by reducing \ndependence on foreign energy sources while protecting consumers by \nproviding stable supplies at affordable prices. It provides incentives \nfor the use of natural gas--a fuel that certainly burns cleaner than \nsome of the types that we have now--where we have an abundance of it \nwithin our own borders, especially in my own area of the Gulf of \nMexico. It calls on America to utilize other domestic resources through \nincentives which encourage the use of marginal oil wells.\n  We have billions of barrels of oil that are available in these \nmarginal wells and certainly up in the Alaska area. There are those who \nsay: No, we can't open up ANWR or some areas on the west coast, areas \non the east coast.\n  We could have everything environmentally pure, but we may not be able \nto have the energy supplies we need to run this country or to heat our \nhomes or fuel our farmers or our economy generally.\n  We should also look at alternative sources such as solar power and \nhydropower, which is something we rely on in this country. We see a \nproblem up in the Northeast, and because it has been a light year for \nrain and snow in the Northwest and in States such as Idaho, Oregon, and \nWashington, they have a potential problem there.\n  Some 55 percent of the electricity generated in the United States \ncomes from these coal-fired, steam-generating plants, as I have \nindicated. Coal is something we have an abundance of, and with some \nmore tax incentives, we can continue to make progress in coming up with \nnew systems that will provide tremendous rewards for us.\n  I understand the natural gas area we have in the West is as much as \n137 trillion cubic feet. It is estimated that we have 16 billion \nbarrels of domestic crude oil in Alaska. None of these facts really \nshould be surprising. We have known it, but we have not been serious \nabout taking advantage of what we have there. We can do all this while \nprotecting the environment.\n  I realize this is something you can't apply to every situation, but \nin the Gulf of Mexico, an area I am familiar with regarding oil and gas \nexploration--I live right on the gulf. I look out on the Gulf of \nMexico. It is a wonderful sight and one of the most peaceful things I \ndo. I sit on my front porch in a rocking chair and look at those gulf \nwaters to my left toward the Alabama State line.\n  Not long ago, there was a natural gas well pumping away and doing \nfine. A couple of times they had to flare it, and at night it was a \nbeautiful sight. They have done what they wanted to do with that well \nand have moved on.\n\n  As Senator Murkowski has said, more and more of these oil and gas \nrigs are moving to deeper and deeper water. They drill now in such a \nway that they\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nknow what they are going to hit. They know where it is, and they can do \nit in 2,000, 3,000 feet of water. It is amazing technology.\n  Have we ever had an incident in my home area? No, never have we had \nan incident with an oilspill at a rig or with natural gas. The most \ndangerous thing we have is a Chevron refinery. Big ships come in and \nhave to offload on to smaller ships. They bring those smaller ships \ninto the harbor and port and offload them at the refinery. They, too, \nhave been successful in not having incidents that have caused \nenvironmental problems, but there is more of a risk bringing in foreign \noil from big boats to smaller boats to the dock than there is to drill \nfor oil and gas.\n  Also, the best fishing in the gulf is around the rigs. Ask the people \nwho live there. They will tell you it has been a tremendous boon to \nfishing. You catch the biggest fish right around the oil rigs off the \ncoast of Louisiana and off the coast of Mississippi. This is a personal \nexample.\n  We can have oil and gas exploration, protect the fish and wildlife, \nand do it in an environmentally safe way. I hope we will develop this \noverall policy. We can pick it apart. Some people are going to say: Oh, \nno, we can't open up ANWR. It is always interesting to me that the \npeople who say we cannot do it are the people who do not live there. \nThe people who live there think we can do it and do it in an \nenvironmentally sound way.\n  There will be those who object to that and maybe try to defeat it. \nOthers will say we shouldn't give incentives to get these margin wells \nin operation. Others will say the Federal Government should not be \ninvolved in paying people's utility bills.\n  If we pick it apart piece by piece, we will wind up with nothing or a \nskeleton, and we will not have a national energy policy. If we do that, \nI predict, today on this floor, within the next 5 years we are going to \nhave a disastrous energy supply situation in this country. We have an \nopportunity to do something about it this year in a bipartisan way that \nwill be good for every region of the country and every group that might \nhave an interest in energy policy.\n  I implore my colleagues in the Senate, and I call on this new \nadministration: Let's step up to this. Let's not shrink from our own \nproblems, desires, concerns, or knowledge. One thing that has always \nbothered me is if you know anything about a subject, if you know \nanything about energy, in this city you are disqualified; you have to \nbe ignorant to decide what you need to do about the future energy needs \nof this country. That is a big mistake.\n  We have an opportunity with regard to our children's economic future. \nFrom a security and freedom standpoint, we must do this bill. I look \nforward to bringing it to the floor of the Senate for consideration by \nall Senators.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, energy touches every facet of our lives. \nEnergy is serious business. America must have a national energy policy \nthat ensures we have a reliable, stable, and affordable source of \nenergy. This cannot be neglected. To do so leaves our Nation vulnerable \non all fronts.\n  Energy policy ties together America's economy, our standard of \nliving, our national security, and our geopolitical strategic interests \naround the world, and, of course, this Nation's future.\n  We have entered a period where low energy supply has met high energy \ndemand. Oil prices have tripled over the last 2 years, hitting a high \nlast fall of nearly $40 a barrel--the highest price since the buildup \nto the Persian Gulf war in November 1990.\n  Last Friday, the price of a barrel of oil was $29. This winter, \nCalifornia has endured severe disruptions in the supply of energy as a \nresult of many factors, mostly a wrong-headed deregulation effort that \nleft the market incapable of adapting to the imbalances between high \ndemand and low supply.\n  We are also seeing the impact of a combination of record high natural \ngas prices and a harsh winter. Consumers all across the country are \nbeing hit with double and sometimes triple the energy bills they had \nlast winter. It is very difficult for many families to absorb this \nshock to their budgets, and they cannot go without heat. We have \nincreased the Federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, to assist families in the short term. But the real \nanswer is a long-term change in policy.\n  High energy costs ripple through the economy. Price spikes send a \nshock through the economy, increasing prices for everything that uses \nenergy, and that is everything. They drive up inflation.\n  An analysis last year by the Heritage Foundation found that high oil \nprices would cost the average American family of four more than $1,300, \ndecrease consumer spending by nearly $80 million, and cost our economy \nalmost 500,000 jobs over the next 2 years.\n  In the United States, a slowdown in economic growth due to higher \nenergy prices will have a negative impact on our Federal budget. The \nassumptions for projected Federal budget surpluses over the next 10 \nyears do not take into account what would happen if high energy prices, \nenergy shortages, or energy rationing stalled our economy. Where then \nwould be our proposals to finance new prescription drug plans for \nMedicare recipients, provide more funding for education, grapple with \nthe restructuring of our entitlement programs, and much needed funds to \nimprove our Nation's military? The money needed to fund these areas of \nour Federal budget and pay down our national debt would have gone up in \nsmoke--literally gone up in smoke.\n  Energy policy has broad national security implications for the United \nStates because we are so reliant on foreign sources for our supply of \ncrude oil.\n  During 1973, at the peak of the energy crisis, we relied on foreign \nsources of oil for 35 percent of our domestic supply. Since that time, \nwe have become more, not less, dependent on foreign oil. Today we \nimport about 57 percent of the oil used in the United States. Petroleum \naccounts for one-third of the U.S. total trade deficit. Who are we \nkidding?\n  Our reliance on foreign oil leaves the United States vulnerable to \nthe whims of foreign oil cartels. Should something happen to threaten \nthis supply, we cannot turn on the spigots in the United States \novernight; we are literally blackmailed; we are literally captive to \noutside energy sources.\n  A tight oil market gives additional leverage to individual oil-\nexporting nations and tyrants. Half the world's spare production \ncapacity right now is in Saudi Arabia. Iraq, whom we bomb by night and \nwho imports oil by day, is now one of the fastest growing sources of \nU.S. oil imports.\n  Our allies would be more vulnerable to threats from oil-producing \nnations because they are even more dependent on foreign oil. America \nand its allies must never allow themselves to become political hostages \nof energy supplier nations. This could lead to international blackmail \nand dangerous, unpredictable world instability.\n  We drifted through the last 8 years without an energy policy, content \nto sit back and enjoy a good economy and take credit for that economy, \nbut unwilling to prepare our Nation for the difficult challenges ahead \nand make the hard choices necessary for energy independence.\n  When this crisis arose last year, the Clinton administration had no \nsolution or strategy for how to deal with the problem. The policies of \nthe last administration served to discourage and at some points \nactually completely shut off domestic oil and natural gas production. \nOver the last 8 years, we have seen millions of acres of possible \nexploration areas for oil and natural gas completely taken off the \ntable. While oil consumption in the United States has risen by 14 \npercent since 1992, U.S. crude oil production has declined by 17 \npercent. Over the last 4 years, 58,000 wells were shut down.\n  What do we do about this? What can we do to address this problem? We \nmust pursue a comprehensive energy policy that decreases our reliance \non foreign oil by increasing the safe and environmentally sound \nproduction of our domestic oil and gas resources and by developing a \nmore diversified supply of energy sources.\n  We cannot wait for the next crisis to decide what we will do. Natural \ngas demand is estimated to grow by 30 percent over the next decade. \nShutting off\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\nthe lights and increasing efficiency won't begin to make up for the \nincreased demand. We need a greater supply of energy.\n  We must develop a national energy policy that meets the present and \nfuture needs of our country. I am pleased today to join Chairman \nMurkowski and my colleagues in introducing the National Energy Security \nAct. We must increase our production of energy.\n  This legislation will help ensure an affordable, reliable, and \ndiversified domestic supply of energy. We must also focus on becoming \nmore efficient in our use of energy. Conservation is important. This \nbill will help make energy prices less volatile and alleviate the \nimpacts that the wild price swings have on the national economy. It \nwill reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  The United States must seek to further diversify its energy resources \nportfolio. We must all learn the lessons of history and recognize that \nwe should not be focusing our energy needs in one area but must have a \ndiversity of sources of energy to meet those needs. The bill we are \nintroducing today promotes alternative fuels for vehicles, it \nencourages the production of traditional sources of energy, and \nadvances cleaner technologies for the future. It encourages the \ndevelopment of biofuels, geothermal, hydropower, clean coal, and other \nenergy options. For the United States to protect itself from the whims \nof international oil cartels and tyrants, we must harness and develop \nas many of our renewable energy resources as possible. This bill also \nincreases funding for LIHEAP by $1 billion to ensure that low-income \nfamilies will not have to choose between heating their homes and \nfeeding their families.\n  And, yes, part of the solution includes opening the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to exploration. Drilling in ANWR has been used to \nportray the Bush administration, and those who support opening ANWR to \ndrilling, as anti-environment. What strikes me odd about that line of \nargument is that it is faulty. It is faulty for many reasons. One of \nthe most important among them is that most countries from which we \nimport our oil now have very little regard for the environment. You \nlook at some of these foreign oilfields around the world and you see \ntotal destruction of the environment, no regulation, no laws, no \nrespect for the wildlife and the land on which they drill.\n  A study done by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission found \nthat U.S. producers spend almost $3 billion annually, or roughly $2 a \nbarrel, to comply with environmental regulation in the United States. I \ndoubt that one-tenth of this is spent on environmental regulations in \nall the other oil- and gas-producing countries combined. Who is taking \ncare of the environment and who is not taking care of the environment?\n  So if environmentalists are truly concerned about the worldwide \nenvironment, it would seem to me they would want every possible drop of \nthat oil and natural gas to be found in the United States to be pumped \nand drilled under safe environmental regulations imposed by State and \nlocal governments, the EPA, the Federal Government, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service.\n  We are all concerned about the environment. We have led our Nation \nfar too long without a comprehensive energy strategy. The President and \nCongress must immediately address America's need for a strong, defined \nnational energy policy. It underpins our national independence. Energy \nindependence underpins our national security, it underpins our economy, \nour standard of living, our trade, our role in the world, and the \nfuture for our children. Our Nation's future is directly connected to \nenergy capacity. If we fail this great challenge, we will leave the \nworld more dangerous than we found it. That is not our heritage. This \nwill require bold, forceful, and intelligent leadership. We can do \nthis. We will do this. This is America's heritage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for \nhis candid statement, particularly when he focused on the lack of \nsensitivity in the oilfields of much of the world. Yet we depend on the \noil coming from there. We don't seem to have any regard for how it is \nproduced or the sense at this time of the environment. We take it for \ngranted and somehow just ignore that we have the responsibility because \nwe are addicted to foreign oil and yet we accept no responsibility for \nthe environment. I commend him for that observation. I thought it was \nvery pertinent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the \nparticipants in the press conference on the National Energy Security \nAct of 2001, including the Campaign to Keep America Warm, Interstate \nOil and Gas Compact, National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners, Small Business Survival Committee, National Association \nof Manufacturers, Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, National \nAssociation of Neighborhoods, Fertilizer Institute, Edison Electric \nInstitute, Printing Association, United States Combined Heating, \nAmerican Gas, Washington Gas, Nuclear Institute, American Forestry \nSociety, American Forests, American Institution of Architects, National \nAssociation of Home Builders, Air Transport Associates, Society of \nIndependent Gasoline Manufacturers, National Association of Realtors, \nthe Coalition for Affordable Renewable Energy, National Pumping and \nHeating, American Highway Users, National Restaurant Association, U.S. \nOil and Gas Association, National Association of Convenience Stores, \nthe National Refiners Association, the Independent Driver's \nAssociation, all who were in attendance and represented at the press \nconference where we discussed the introduction of this legislation this \nmorning, be printed in the Record following my remarks relative to the \nintroduction of this legislation. I also ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of support from the Teamsters be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Much has been mentioned of one facet of this \nlegislation. I refer to the ANWR area. I also want to add that while we \nhave not sought cosponsors, there have been many who have come to the \nfloor today or have contacted me. As a consequence, I think it is \nimportant to add my senior colleague, Senator Stevens, even though I \nhave not been able to contact him, so I condition that. But I don't \nwant him to think we haven't thought of him. I add his name.\n  I will identify on the first map, to get a feeling for ANWR and what \nit is all about, I will demonstrate what part of Alaska comprises ANWR. \nIt is 2\\1/2\\ times the size of Texas. Nevertheless, it is a big, big \npiece of real estate. This area on top is called ANWR. It in itself is \nabout the size of South Carolina. It is 19 million acres. Notable on \nthis map are the colored areas which are Federal lands.\n  The reason it is appropriate to reflect a little bit, I hear the \nquotation, why can't we have some area of wilderness that is as it \nalways was, with no footprint of any kind? And the justification of \nANWR, indeed, is it fits that description.\n  That is hardly accurate. If we look at another map shown in the scope \nof reality, we see the small portion of Alaska that is known as ANWR is \n19 million acres, and we have set aside 8 million acres in wilderness \nand 9\\1/2\\ million acres in refuge, leaving 1\\1/2\\ million as a coastal \npoint, which is the only area disturbed if drilling is authorized by \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  These land designations were made in about 1980. They are permanent. \nThe wilderness will remain the wilderness, 8 million acres, the 9.5 \nmillion acres will remain in the refuge, leaving the small area open \nfor exploration.\n  The difference is the geologists say this is the most likely area \nwhere a major oil discovery might be made in North America, and they \nindicate 10 to 16 billion barrels, equal to what we import from Saudi \nArabia.\n  The other fallacy not noted is there is a footprint there already.\n  There is a village. There are about 227 Eskimo people who live there. \nThis is their airstrip, hangars, schools. This is a picture of the \nchildren going to school, happy, Eskimo children. It is a pretty bleak \noutlook because it is winter there about 10 months out of the year.\n  I want to show this major map again. When we talk about this area the \nsize\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nof the State of South Carolina, 19 million acres, and take it down to \n1.5 million acres here--here is Kaktovik. The picture just appeared. To \nsuggest there is nothing there is misleading. This is the radar site. \nThis is the village. The airstrip is over here. The footprint is really \nthere. That is what is in this area of ANWR. The rest of it, as I \nindicated, is a refuge or wilderness. I might add, we have about 118 \nrefuge or wilderness areas where we are producing oil or gas. To \nsuggest this is unique begs the issue. It is unique, but you have to \nkeep it in perspective.\n  For those who say, why don't we have some area of wilderness that has \nnot had any footprint, let me show a couple. In our State of Alaska, we \nhave 59 million acres of wilderness. This is the Gates of the Arctic \nhere, which is a little over 8 million acres. That is it. You can \nwander through it. It is designated ``wilderness.'' You can view it for \nits beauty or its harshness.\n  We have another area here in the Wrangell-St. Elias area. We have \nsome almost 11 million acres of wilderness in this area. To suggest \nthis is the last wilderness is hardly respecting reality. I want the \nrecord to note that because many of my colleagues are under the opinion \nthis is the only area left.\n  Let me conclude with a couple of other items that I think are \nrelevant to this particular issue. To give some idea, Wrangell-St. \nElias is much bigger in wilderness than is ANWR. The Gates of the \nArctic, as I indicated, are about 8 million acres.\n  To give some idea of the extent of the efforts to accommodate the \nwildlife, this is an article entitled ``Bruins Brewing? Polar bears \napparently booming on stretch along Beaufort Sea.''\n  It further states:\n\n       Beaufort Sea area's polar [bear] population could be in \n     excess of 2,500.\n\n  Some will suggest the polar bear den in ANWR. The polar bear don't \nden in ANWR, they den on the ice. There are a few that do winter there, \nbut the most significant thing about what we do with the polar bear is \nwe don't allow hunting of the polar bear. If you are a Caucasian, you \ncannot take a polar bear. You can in Russia or Canada, but you cannot \ntake it in the United States because it is a marine mammal and is \nprotected. The Native people take a few for subsistence. To suggest \nsomehow we are going to decimate the polar bear is again mythical, a \nstory, not made up of any scientific fact.\n  The idea of spills in the area--let me show the Prudhoe Bay area, \nbecause it represents the old technology. The oilfield is here with the \ncaribou. There is the pipeline. There are the caribou. You have seen it \nbefore, Mr. President. Those are not stuffed animals. They are browsing \naround because there is nothing that will harm them.\n  If you spill a pint of oil from your transmission, it has to be \nreported. If you spill water, it has to be reported. We have very \nstringent environmental laws and regulations to ensure we reduce to a \nminimum the exposure.\n  I also want to show another picture of the wintertime and what some \nof the animals are acclimated to. Because it is easier to walk there, \nthey walk on the pipeline. They are walking on the pipeline because it \nis easier to do that than it is to walk on the snow. These are actual \nphotographs. It is not anything that was put together.\n\n  Let me also show pictures of what it looks like building the area in \nthe wintertime where we have the rough and rugged tundra. In the \nwinter, it is very bleak. There are about 10 months of winter a year. \nHere is the technology used to develop the oilfields. We use winter \nroads made of ice.\n  Again, it is new technology. Here is the same picture in the summer. \nIt is about a 2-month summer. You can see the footprint is very \nmanageable.\n  My point going into this detail is that those who criticize give very \nlittle credit to the advanced technology that we have, the ability to \nfind oil and make a very small footprint.\n  The justification for going into ANWR is that geologists tell us that \nis where a major find is more likely to be made than any other area. \nThey suggest somewhere in the area of 16 billion barrels.\n  As we look at what I think are some of our inconsistencies, let me \nremind you that we are now importing 750,000 barrels from Iraq. We \nfought a war over there in 1991. We lost 147 lives. The significance of \ndepending on that source, I think, suggests we are compromising our \nnational security. I say that realistically because the other day we \nnoted we took a very aggressive posture, bombing some of the radar \nsites in Iraq up near Musel to take them out because we thought they \nwere hindering our efforts to enforce a no-fly zone. What they did not \ntell you was there have been about 20,000 sorties since 1991-1992, at \ngreat cost to our Government, enforcing the no-fly zone.\n  Just what are we doing? If I can simplify our policy, we are \nimporting 750,000 barrels of oil from Saddam Hussein. We give him \npayment for that oil. We take the oil, put it in our planes, and go \nbomb him. Maybe I am missing something. What does he do with our money? \nHe takes our money and, in effect, takes care of his Republican Guard, \nwhich keeps him alive. He also develops a missile capability and a \ndelivery capability and biological capability. At what is it aimed? At \nour greatest ally, Israel. Maybe I am being overly simplistic, but if \nyou think about it, that is about what happens.\n  At what point do we sacrifice our national energy security interests? \nWhat we have done in this legislation which we have introduced today--I \nsee Senator Craig on the floor--we are attempting to reduce our \ndependence to 50 percent or less, instead of increasing it. As the \nDepartment of Energy says, by the year 2005 or 2006, we will be close \nto 60 percent. At what point do we compromise totally? At what point \nare we becoming so dependent on the Mideast nations that we no longer \nhave any leverage left? They can control the supply. They can control \nthe price.\n  We are not going to eliminate our dependence, but we can reduce it. I \nsee the U.S. Coast Guard reducing its mission capability for rescue and \nfishery patrol because of the increasing costs of fuel, which limits \ntheir mission capability. I ask unanimous consent this document be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Coast Guard Cuts Back on Patrols To Save Money\n\n       Kodiak (AP).--In an effort to save money, the Coast Guard \n     has shaved five days off the cutter Storis next patrol of \n     fishing grounds.\n       The Storis was due to leave Friday to patrol Alaska's \n     domestic fishing grounds, including the Aleutians and the \n     Bering Sea, and make routine boardings of U.S. fishing \n     vessels. But the 230-foot cutter will not get under way until \n     Wednesday morning, said Cmdr. Ray Massey.\n       ``Our Pacific Area Command decided to go ahead and keep \n     them at the dock as a cost-saving measure,'' Massey said. \n     ``We're concerned that they get under way. They've missed \n     several days of domestic boardings.''\n       The Coast Guard has taken similar measures in the past, \n     Massey said. This time the Alaska command is trying to close \n     a 10 percent cut in the operational budget.\n       ``This budget struggle is based on the high cost of fuel \n     and the mandated increases in salaries,'' Massey said.\n       The Department of Defense raised military wages 3.7 percent \n     Jan. 1, but did not adjust the Coast Guard budget.\n       Cutters spend 45 days at sea when they are on standard \n     patrol duty. It costs roughly $3,500 an hour when cutters are \n     under way, Massey said. Multiplied by 24 hours, a few days \n     tied to the dock results in savings of about $84,000 a day.\n       ``We need a supplemental budget increase,'' Massey said.\n       The delay does not affect Coast Guard search-and-rescue \n     operations, with helicopters and the 378-foot cutter Mellon \n     on the grounds in the Bering Sea, he said.\n       The delay also did not disappoint most of the crew on-board \n     the Storis, according to seaman Frances Jiannalone.\n       ``It was like a total surprise. We were just about to get \n     under way, I'm talking 10 minutes, and I answered a call. \n     They asked if we were about to get under way. I said yes, and \n     they said, `Well, that's all about to change,' '' Jiannalone \n     said.\n       He said the captain announced the delay 10 minutes later.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. When that happens, it affects all of our capability as \nwell.\n  When we look at the dreaded situation in this country relative to \nwhat has happened in California, we realize that some of our aluminum \ncompanies are not making aluminum because they have long-term contracts \nfor energy and they are selling the energy. Urea fertilizer factories \nare no longer selling urea because they can sell the gas for a higher \nprice than if they sold the product. These are inconsistencies that \naffect the very backbone of our Nation.\n  As we begin the debate on the energy bill, I encourage my colleagues \nwho have heard from the environmental\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\ncommunity that somehow this can't be done safely to recognize the \nresponsibility on the national security interests of this Nation and to \nrecognize the technological advances that we have made. For heaven's \nsake, come up and see for yourself. We have extended an invitation to \nMembers of this body to come up to ANWR on the 30th or the 31st of \nMarch and the 1st of April. We extended that to spouses as well. Get an \nappreciation. Keep your mind open until you see it. Many of the \nMembers, of course, tell me: Frank, we understand you did open it. We \nreally know that. But you know how it is with the environmental \ncommunity if you argue against them.\n  What responsibility does the environmental community have relative to \ntheir responsibility to come up with some alternatives and recognize \nthat we have an energy crisis? They simply say we can conserve our way \nout. You simply can't do it. We can do a better job of it. But we are \nan electronic society. We send e-mail and use our computers. The \nreality is we have to do better. We have to use alternatives. But you \ncan't conserve your way out of this.\n  The reason I am going into this at some length is ANWR becomes \nsomewhat of a lightning rod because it is a cause, if you will, for the \nenvironmental community. They need a cause. They need a cause that is \nfar away where the American people can't really see it for themselves \nand that the press really can't afford to go see. As a consequence, it \ngenerates great membership, great dollars, and the fear that somehow we \ncan't do this. Yet in Prudhoe Bay, we have had 30 years of experience \nand 30 years of technology. The footprint now is estimated--as you move \nfrom this technology 30 years ago over to this area on the map of \nANWR--out of this million and a half acres up here in the Coastal \nPlain, which is the only thing we are talking about --we are not \ntalking about this because this is a refuge--we are talking a footprint \nof roughly 2,000 acres. That would be the footprint if the oil is there \nin the volume.\n  I encourage my colleagues to keep the discussion and the debate \nwithin the parameters of facts as opposed to emotions. To suggest that \nsomehow we do not have the technology to take care of the Porcupine \ncaribou herd is ridiculous. We only allow drilling in the wintertime as \na consequence of the caribou calving. We have improved the central \nArctic herd.\n  People ask, Is this energy bill going to be compromised by ANWR? Is \nthat the backbreaker? I hope my friends in this body and in the \nenvironmental community recognize that we have a responsibility to \naddress an energy crisis, and by passing this legislation including \nANWR, we are going to be able to reduce our dependence on imported oil \nto less than 50 percent within a reasonable period of time.\n  Some people say it is going to take you 10 years, if the oil is \nthere. That is absolutely ridiculous. We have a pipeline 45 miles from \nPrudhoe Bay. It only needs another 25 miles, and we could have this \narea open in less than 3 years to have oil flowing, if indeed the oil \nis there.\n  Some people say, Senator, it is only a 6-month supply. That is a \nbogus argument. That assumes there is not going to be any other oil \nproduced in this country for 6 months; all of it will stop.\n  You can turn that thing around, and say, well, if we don't develop \nit, then the United States is shortchanging itself with a 6-month \nsupply for all the trains, airplanes, and all the boats. It is a \nridiculous argument, if the oil is there.\n\n  Remember Prudhoe Bay. This area has been producing 20 percent of the \ntotal crude oil produced in the United States for the last 27 years. At \none time it was 25 percent. That is the factual record.\n  Please keep this in mind. If you want wilderness, we have 59 million \nacres of wilderness in our State, and more than all the States put \ntogether. We are proud of it. But to suggest that somehow you are going \nto jeopardize this 19 million acres by initiating some drilling in 1\\1/\n2\\ million acres just doesn't fly with reality.\n  We must have an opportunity to debate some of these environmental \ngroups that put fear in some of my Native people. These people who live \nin this area, whether they be the Eskimos on the North Slope or the \nGwich'in people, are proud people and look for a better way of life and \nopportunities.\n  In Barrow, I always recall one friend of mine who said: Senator, I \nused to come to school to keep warm.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: The first thing I did when I got up and left our sod home \nwas to go out and pick up driftwood. There were no trees. That would be \ndriftwood floating down the McKenzie River and lying around on the \nbeach. He said: I came to the Bureau of Indian Affairs school to keep \nwarm.\n  Then we look at Barrow today. They have the most beautiful school in \nthe United States. They have an indoor recess area because they have \nthe taxing ability to improve their lives, to give them an alternative \nlifestyle where every child has an opportunity for a full paid college \neducation, if they wish it. There is no where else in the country with \nthat.\n  Then we have the Gwich'in people in Old Crow and other areas in \nAlaska down near the Fort Yukon Arctic village. I have been in the area \nand have met the people. But there is the group that the Gwich'in \nSteering Committee has put the fear into that somehow these people will \nlose the Porcupine caribou herd if, indeed, there is development in \nthis Coastal Plain.\n  This is kind of interesting. This is the U.S. This is Alaska. This is \nCanada. This is the migration route of the caribou. They have a wide \nrange. They come up here and calf sometimes in the Coastal Plain, and \nsometimes not. But, in any event, they cross a highway, the Dempster \nHighway. All these little marks are wells that were drilled in their \npath. They did not find any oil so they made a park out of it. That is \nfine. But somehow we have seen the environmental groups--the Sierra \nClub, Friends of the Earth, the Wilderness Society--fund this effort to \nbasically suggest to the Gwich'in people that their lifestyle and their \ntraditions will be lost, and their dependence on the Porcupine caribou \nherd will be lost if indeed, this development takes place.\n  There is another group of Gwich'ins who are looking forward to having \njob opportunities and so forth. Time and time again, they have been \ninvited up to Barrow to meet with the Eskimos to see what the ability \nto tax oil and oil facilities has meant to their lifestyle. Each time \nthe journey is cut short by the pressure of the Gwich'in Steering \nCommittee. You have to be careful who you are talking to when you talk \nof the Gwich'ins because there are two different people. One of the \ngroups--the Gwich'in Steering Committee--is funded by a significant \nportion of America's environmental community. And one more time: For \nwhat reason? Because they need a cause. Their cause generates \nmembership, dollars, and is so far away that it can't be evaluated on \nits own merits.\n  That basically concludes my remarks on this particular aspect of the \nenergy bill, which I think deserves some special attention since it has \nbeen identified time and time again.\n  I encourage my colleagues to give me a call if they have any further \nquestions. I hope they will accept the invitation of Senator Stevens \nand I to come up and visit the area. If not, we would be happy to meet \ntheir staffs.\n  I remind them that all of us have an obligation to meet our \nlegitimate environmental concerns. We also have an obligation to \naddress the national security interests of our Nation as far as our \ngrowing dependence on imported oil is concerned. This is an opportunity \nto relieve that in a very positive and meaningful manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  National Energy Security Act of 2001--Press Conference Participants\n\n       Campaign to Keep America Warm: Jim Benfield.\n       IOGCC: Christine Hansen, Executive Director.\n       NARUC President and PA PUC Commissioner: Nora Mead \n     Brownell.\n       KY Public Service Commissioner and Chair NARUC Gas \n     Committee: Edward J Holmes.--``As Chairman of Naruc's \n     Committee on Gas, my committee members and state public \n     utility commissioners across the U.S. work with energy \n     matters on a daily basis.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Murkowski as an original cosponsor of the National \nSecurity Act of 2001. This bill represents a significant effort to \ndefine our national energy policy and it will be considered shortly.\n  For years many Senate Republicans called on the previous \nadministration to define our national energy policy. It is apparent \nthat they never answered our calls. We all know that this bill must now \nbe discussed and specific concerns need to be addressed. But, this is \nan important step to lay the foundation for our future energy plans.\n  We are a Nation that uses coal, oil, hydro power, natural gas and \nnuclear power. This cannot be disputed. But, the previous \nadministration would not accept this reality. And, unfortunately, they \ntried to stand in the way of domestic oil production by locking up \npublic lands. Now we are in a very good position with the current \nadministration to build a secure energy policy which is long lasting, \nenvironmentally friendly and will decrease our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  I am hopeful that this is just the starting point. Some organizations \nwill have concerns with this bill, and I have some as well. For \ninstance, Rural Electric Associations, commonly referred to as Co-ops, \nhave concerns that I would like to see addressed, especially since such \na big portion of my home state of Colorado is covered by Co-ops. I am \nconfident, however that we can all come together, resolve our \ndifferences and construct a national energy policy that will ensure our \nfuture needs.\n  The National Security Act of 2001 is an important step forward to \ndefine our national energy policy, provide relief from our energy \nproblems and promote domestic production so that our Nation can become \nmore self sufficient for our energy needs. I urge my colleagues to come \ntogether to build our energy future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Idaho \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Before I speak to the two pieces of legislation that Senator Frank \nMurkowski has introduced today, let me thank the chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee for the leadership that he is \ndemonstrating with the introduction of S. 388 and S. 389.\n  This country cries out for a clear, well developed policy for both \nthe production and the transmission and/or shipment of energy that we \nclearly have found ourselves now lacking and in need of.\n  Every American is finally beginning to feel the pinch of energy; in \nthis case, the lack thereof--whether it is at the gas pump, or whether \nit is in the power bill they receive monthly, or their space heating \nbill, or the cost of the goods that have a major component of energy in \nthem.\n  The Senator has just concluded speaking about the potential of \nproducing upwards of 16-plus billion barrels of oil domestically in our \ncountry in addition to what we already have. I will say--and I am sure \nI will say it more than once over the course of the next several months \nof debate--the ANWR issue is not an environmental issue. It never has \nbeen, and it never will be. It is a political issue.\n  The technology of today will protect that environment. When the oil \nis extracted and the wellheads are gone, it will hardly be noticeable \nthat man, in the form of his modern technology, was there. This is a \npolitical issue by interest groups who need a cause. The Senator from \nAlaska has spelled that out well in the last few moments.\n  But I rise today in support of national energy and a National Energy \nPolicy Act of the kind that the Senator has introduced today and of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. Clearly, this is the year when I hope Americans \nwill insist and that we will respond with the development of a \ncomprehensive energy policy.\n  We began to look at this anew in 1999. Back then, OPEC cut crude oil \nproduction to force up oil prices. We then had the luxury of very \ninexpensive crude oil. It worked. As you know, we saw our Secretary of \nEnergy rushing off to the Middle East to beg them to turn their valves \nback on. While they did a little bit, they were destined to move crude \noil from $12 a barrel to, at one point, a high of $32 a barrel last \nspring.\n\n  Our motorists--all of us--were worried about the increasing cost of \ngasoline, and truckers were concerned about rising fuel oil costs. \nAlso, residential consumers in the Northeast watched as their home \nheating oil bills skyrocketed last year and remained extremely high \nthrough this winter.\n  In the past dozen months, the situation has worsened. Gasoline, fuel \noil, and home heating oil have remained at a high premium. Natural gas \nprices have tripled to $6 per million Btu's from under $2 only a year \nago. That is a tremendous increase in price. Natural gas production has \nremained static, even though the number of drilling rigs looking for \ngas has now tripled in the last year, as finally these unbelievable but \nvery market-driven prices have resulted.\n  Further, natural gas in storage is just about a billion cubic feet--\nabout half of what is usually in storage for this time of year. In \nother words, in that arena we are only half prepared. We simply cannot \nbuild the balance of the storage.\n  Further, natural gas is clearly costing the residential consumer an \nastronomical price--but beyond where the gas line goes, where you have \nto use bottled gas out in rural America for cooking, heat, and some \nspace heat, there, once again, it has tripled; and even for the poorest \nof Americans, it is a cost they are finding very difficult to bear. \nWholesale electric prices too have risen significantly.\n  Of course, we have all watched and been a part of--at least by action \nor by debate--the episode in California and the experimental, but very \nflawed, electricity deregulation effort that has produced an \nunbelievable high of nearly $300 for a megawatt hour in the spot \nmarket--$300 for a megawatt hour in the spot market--compared with just \na few dollars at some points in an Idaho market a few years ago. That \nis a tremendous drive-up in cost. That is about 30 cents per kilowatt \nhour, or five times what the investor-owned utilities in California are \nallowed to charge their consumers.\n  To bring it into perspective, my consumers in Idaho, right now, are \npaying about 3.6 cents per kilowatt hour against a California market \nthat has peaked at 30 cents per kilowatt. Some folks would say Idahoans \nare not paying enough. Let me tell you, Californians are not paying \nwhat the market would teach them to pay if their policies were \ndifferent. Then they would dramatically change the politics of their \nState because, once again, ANWR is a political issue and the energy \ncrisis in California is a political issue--and a political crisis.\n  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company are \nstruggling with a $10 billion unpaid bill for power. They were simply \nnot able to go out and collect the money because California law would \nnot let them collect the money for the very energy they bought to \nsupply Californians. Californians have already consumed the \nelectricity, but they have not paid the full price for it.\n  California, due to a shortage in the State of power-generating \nfacilities, has been forced to import electricity from as far away as \nTexas. And up in my State of Idaho, we now produce power for \nCalifornia. Power supplies in the Northwest--my region of the country--\nhave grown increasingly scarce. Competition for supplies and the fear \nthat California utilities will be unable to pay their bills have forced \nup retail prices in Oregon, Washington, and my State of Idaho.\n  When the previous administration arrived in 1993, it announced its \nintent to drastically alter the way the Nation used energy, especially \nfossil fuels--gas and oil and coal. President Clinton argued that a \nbroad-based Btu tax would force us away from coal and oil and natural \ngas to renewable energy forms, such as solar, wind, and biomass. That \nobjective has remained a hallmark of that administration's energy \npolicy.\n\n  Oh, yes, some of us have argued that the Clinton administration had \nno policy. Well, they came to town with one. And that one was rapidly \nrejected by\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\nthe American consumer when the President said that the taxes he wanted \nto raise--nearly $72 billion out of the consuming public over a 5-year \nperiod--would help the market and help the environment. What it \nultimately did--because it was rejected--was it caused even greater \ndependence on foreign oil and, of course, had phenomenal impacts, as we \nnow see, on the consuming public. In fact, it would have unfairly \npunished energy-intensive States and industries.\n  Estimates by the American Petroleum Institute and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, at that time, predicted that the Btu tax, \nwhich was the hallmark of the Clinton policy, would reduce the gross \ndomestic product of this country by $38 billion and that it would \ndestroy nearly 700,000 jobs.\n  Just in the last 2 quarters, this runup in energy price--which would \nhave been equivalent to raising that kind of a tax, only it is now \ngreater--has cost the gross domestic product almost a half a percentage \npoint. Studies now show at least four-tenths of a percent loss, or \nnearly half a percentage point, and several hundreds of thousands of \njobs. So those estimates way back in 1994 were not very far off.\n  The administration claimed that the tax was needed to balance the \nbudget and fund large new spending programs to offset the negative \nimpacts of the tax. They also claimed that crude oil imports would \ndecline by 400,000 barrels a day.\n  At the same time, DOE's own projections predicted the tax would shave \noil import growth by less than one-tenth a percent after nearly 10 \nyears under that program. DOE predicted by the year 2000 Americans \nstill would depend on foreign oil for three-fifths of their total crude \noil requirements.\n  DOE was not far off. With or without the tax, obviously with growth \nin the American economy and the tremendous wealth and advantages to the \nAmerican consumer that the economy of the last decade has produced, we \nhave grown dramatically more dependent upon foreign oil because we \nfailed to produce our own. The American Petroleum Institute testified \nat that time that even if imports were to fall by the full 400,000 \nbarrels a day claimed by the administration, the cost of a $34 billion \nin lost GDP is excessive relative to the alternatives of improving \nenergy security. The story went on and on, and no energy policy got \ndeveloped. In fact, quite the opposite occurred. A more restrictive \napproach to the production of domestic energy began to fill in behind \nthe inability of our past President to force a huge tax increase on the \nAmerican consumer.\n  In the end, Congress refused to accept the Clinton administration's \nefforts to tax our relatively inexpensive energy sources to finance \ntheir grandiose tax-and-spend social agenda that Congress rejected. \nCongress did agree to raise taxes on transportation fuels. We did that \nby 4.3 cents per gallon, a move I opposed and believed was wrong at the \ntime. It is wrong now.\n  The past administration's obsession to reduce fossil fuel use as much \nas possible has put us in the position we find ourselves today. \nPresident Clinton said, on March 7, 2000, at the White House:\n\n       . . . Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop \n     to $12 or $10 a barrel because that . . . takes our minds off \n     our business, which should be alternative fuels, energy \n     conservation, reducing the impact of all this on global \n     warming.\n\n  Here are the facts: Since 1993, domestic oil production has dropped \nby 17 percent. Domestic crude oil consumption, though, has gone up by \n14 percent. Dependence on foreign sources of crude oil has risen to 56 \npercent in total crude oil requirements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent to continue for no more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator, did he ask for 1 \nminute or 10 minutes?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I asked for 10.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will certainly not object, although that \nwill wipe out my opportunity to speak, as I understand it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reclaiming my time, let me ask for no more than 3 minutes. \nWould that accommodate the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. KYL. I am sure it would. I know there are other Senators who are \nto follow beginning at a particular time. That would be very helpful. I \ncertainly don't want to interrupt the Senator from Idaho because I know \nhe has very important comments to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. As I said, I am pleased to rise today to support \nintroduction of the National Energy Security Act of 2001. At the \nrequest of the Majority Leader during the last Congress, Senator \nMurkowski and other Senators began the process of developing a solution \nto the energy ``fix'' in which we found ourselves in beginning in late \n1999.\n  Back then, OPEC cut crude oil production to force up world oil \nprices. It worked--oil prices rose quickly from about $12 per barrel \nand hit a high of about $32 per barrel last spring.\n  Our motorists were worried about the increasing cost of gasoline and \ntruckers were concerned about rising fuel oil prices. Also, residential \ncustomers in the Northeast watched as their home heating oil bills \nskyrocketed.\n  In the past dozen months the situation has worsened. Gasoline, fuel \noil, and home heating oil prices remain high. Natural gas prices have \ntripled to about $6.00 per million Btu's (British Thermal Units). \nNatural gas production has remained static even though the number of \ndrilling rigs looking for gas has tripled over the last year. Further, \nnatural gas in storage is just above 1 billion cubic feet, about half \nof what is usually in storage this time of year. Residential gas \ncustomers in some parts of the Nation have seen their winter heating \nbills triple.\n  Wholesale electricity prices have risen significantly. In California, \nwhich is experimenting with a flawed electricity deregulation effort, \nelectricity prices have been as high as $300 per megawatt hour (MwH) on \nthe spot market.\n  That's about 30 cents per kilowatt hour or about 5 times what \ninvestor owned utilities in California are allowed to charge their \ncustomers.\n  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company are \nstaggering under more than $10 billion in unpaid bills for power.\n  California, due to a shortage of in-state power generating facilities \nhas been forced to import power from as far away as Texas and the \nPacific Northwest. Power supplies in the Northwest are scarce and \ncompetition for supplies and fear that the California Utilities will be \nunable to pay their bills has forced up retail electricity prices in \nOregon, Washington and my home state of Idaho.\n  When the previous administration arrived in 1993 it announced its \nintent to drastically alter the way the Nation used energy, especially \nfossil fuels.\n  President Clinton argued that a broad based Btu tax would force us \naway from coal, oil and natural gas to renewable energy from solar, \nwind and biomass--that objective has remained a hallmark of that \nadministration's ``energy policy.''\n  The President promised the tax would raise nearly $72 billion over \nfive years (1994-1998) and marketed it as fair, helpful to the \nenvironment, that it would force down our dependence on foreign oil, \nand would have trivial impacts on consumers.\n  In fact, it would have unfairly punished energy intensive states and \nindustries. Estimates by the American Petroleum Institute and National \nAssociation of Manufacturers at the time predicted the tax would hurt \nexports, reduce GDP by $38 billion, and destroy as many as 700,000 \nAmerican jobs.\n  The administration claimed the tax was needed to balance the budget \nand fund large new spending programs to offset the negative impacts of \nthe tax.\n  They also claimed that crude oil imports would decline by 400,000 \nbarrels per day.\n  At the same time, DOE's own projections predicted the tax would shave \noil import growth by less than one-tenth after 10 years. DOE predicted \nthat by the year 2000, Americans still would depend on foreign oil for \nthree-fifths of their total crude oil requirements.\n  API testified: ``. . . even if imports were to fall by the full \n400,000 barrels a day claimed by the administration, the cost of $34 \nbillion in lost GDP is excessive relative to other alternatives for\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nimproving energy security. Using the administration's optimistic \npredictions, the cost of the Btu tax works out to about $230 per \nbarrel.''\n  In the end, Congress refused to accept the Clinton administration's \nefforts to tax our relatively inexpensive energy sources to finance \ntheir grandiose tax and spend social agenda. Congress did agree to \nraise taxes on transportation fuels by 4.3 cents per gallon, a move \nRepublicans tried to reverse during the 106th Congress.\n\n  The past administration's obsession to reduce fossil fuel use as much \nas possible has put us in the position we find ourselves today. \nPresident Clinton said on March 7, 2000 at the White House:\n\n       Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop to $12 \n     or $10 a barrel again because that . . . takes our mind off \n     our business, which should be alternative fuels, energy \n     conservation, reducing the impact of all this on global \n     warming.\n\n  Since they came to office in 1993: Domestic oil production is down 17 \npercent; domestic crude oil consumption is up 14 percent; and \ndependence on foreign sources of crude oil has risen to 56 percent of \ntotal crude requirements.\n  By comparison, in 1973, during the Arab oil embargo, our dependence \non foreign crude was 36 percent of our total crude oil requirements.\n  The past administration's failure to encourage domestic oil \nproduction and production of coal and natural gas has lead us to this \npoint. That administration refused to acknowledge that vast reserves of \noil and gas offshore, in Alaska and in the Rocky Mountain overthrust \narea should play a role in reducing our dependence on imported oil.\n  The Clinton administration in 2000 announced a ban on future \nexploration on most of the federal outer continental shelf until 2012.\n  In 1996 the Administration resorted used the Antiquities Act to \ncreate the Grant Staircase/Escalante Monument thereby dening access to \nabout 23 billion tons of mineable coal reserves in Utah.\n  The U.S. Forest Service has issued road construction policies that \nare designed to restrict the energy industry's ability to explore for \noil and gas on Forest Service lands.\n  Former President Clinton vetoed legislation in 1995 that would have \nopened the Coastal Plain of the remote Alaska National Wildlife Reserve \ndenying the nation access to an estimated 16 billion barrels of \ndomestic crude oil--which could amount to production of 1.5 million \nbarrels per day over the next 20 years--about 10 percent of daily U.S. \nconsumption.\n  The Clinton administration ignored a report prepared by the National \nPetroleum Council, requested by the Energy Secretary, explaining how \nthe nation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas \nresources from about 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 \ntrillion cubic feet per year over the next 10 to 12 years.\n  The past administration showed little interest in solving our \ndomestic energy problems even as foreign oil producers have forced \ncrude oil prices to over $30 per barrel and gasoline prices to almost \n$2.00 per gallon--double prices of only little more than a year ago.\n  Mr. President, the past administration has acted in other ways \ndesigned to force us away from the use of readily available, relatively \ninexpensive fossil fuels, nuclear energy and hydropower. It chose \nespecially to vilify and deny the use of our most abundant national \nenergy resource--coal.\n  The U.S. has the world's largest demonstrated coal reserve base and \naccounts for more than 90 percent of our total fossil energy reserves.\n  At present rates of recovery and use, U.S. reserves will last more \nthan 270 years.\n  Coal is used to generate over 56 percent of our electricity supply--\nand about 88 percent of the Midwest's electricity needs.\n  Electricity from hydro represents about 10 to 12 percent of our \nelectricity needs.\n  Nuclear powerplants meet about 20 percent of our total electricity \ndemand. Yet the past administration had a dim view of these sources and \ntook steps to reduce their use.\n\n  For example, former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt talked openly \nabout ``tearing down dams'' in the West to restore habitat for fish, \nignoring the power and transportation benefits they provide. And, the \npast administration imposed new, often impossible criteria that must be \nmet before federal licenses can be reissued. Many existing hydro \nprojects will seek relicensing over the next several decades.\n  The past administration also vetoed legislation designed to create a \npermanent nuclear waste storage facility and which fulfills a \nlongstanding promise by the federal government to create such a \nfacility. Without a federal storage facility, U.S. nuclear generating \nstations, which are running out of on-site storage capacity may be \nforced to begin shutting down some operations.\n  There are too many more examples of the past administration's failure \nto produce a coherent, balanced national energy plan. The result of \nthis failure is tight energy supplies and high prices.\n  Solving these problems requires tough choices and I suggest that we \nbegin now by pursuing a number of short and long term objectives. I \nthink the bill we are introducing today addresses these challenges.\n  Mr. President, I want to touch briefly on two aspects that are of \ngreat concern to me and my fellow Idahoans. Chairman Murkowski has \nalready gone through it in some detail.\n  The bill contains provisions of great importance to the future of \nnuclear energy, which currently accounts for about twenty percent of \nU.S. electricity demand. Nuclear energy is a clean, safe, reliable \ntechnology which provides baseload power at low cost. The increase in \nnatural gas prices has shown us the danger of relying on natural gas \nfor all of our new electricity generation.\n  Other countries have adopted the advanced nuclear technologies \ndeveloped in this country and are putting them to use. In fact there is \nmuch excitement in the energy industry over plans to build a new type \nof nuclear plant--called ``pebble bed reactor''--in South Africa. I \nbelieve at some point in the future we will once again appreciate the \nvalue of non-emitting energy such as nuclear, and choose to construct \nadditional nuclear generating facilities in the U.S. For this reason, I \nam working with my colleague, Senator Domenici, to develop other \nproposals regarding the nuclear energy option and we hope to have \nadditional legislation soon for the Senate to consider.\n  The legislation also provides important tax incentives to encourage \nthe use of geothermal energy. I have personal experience with what a \nwonderful role geothermal can play in our energy mix because the Idaho \nStatehouse in Boise and other buildings in the downtown area are heated \nwith geothermal energy.\n  In the right applications, geothermal is a clean, efficient energy \nsource available for our use and because there are no ongoing fuel \ncosts and relatively inexpensive maintenance costs, after the initial \ncapital investment, it is a very low cost energy option.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to address the matter of power from \nhydroelectric facilities, upon which the Pacific Northwest is highly \ndependent. The relicensing process for hydroelectric facilities is \nbecoming increasingly costly and time-consuming. It now takes more than \nfive years to relicense a facility--up from only 9 months in 1980 \naccording to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  Hydropower currently accounts for about 12 percent of the electricity \ngenerated in the United States and it produces that power without air \npollution or the greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Under current law, several federal agencies are required to set \nconditions for licenses without regard to the effects those conditions \nhave on project economics, energy benefits, impacts on greenhouse gas \nemissions and values protected by other statutes and regulations. Far \ntoo often the relicensing process is plagued with agency disagreements \nand inconsistent demands.\n  A very large number of public and privately owned hydro facilities \nwill be up for relicensing over the next ten years. Some may be \nabandoned if the relicensing process becomes prohibitively expensive \nand time-consuming. The legislation being introduced today will help \nstreamline the process and make the involved agencies more fully \naccountable for their decisions.\n  The legislation does not change or modify any existing environmental\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\nlaws, nor does it remove regulatory authority from various agencies. It \ndoes not call for the repeal of mandatory conditions on a FERC issued \nlicense.\n  It is clear to me and many of my colleagues that hydropower is at \nrisk and one of our most important tasks here in the Senate is to \ndevelop policies that lead to an energy strategy that will ensure an \nadequate supply of reasonably priced, reliable energy to all Americans \nin an environmentally responsible manner. The relicensing of non-\nfederal hydropower can and should continue to be an important strategy.\n  In addition, we should work with our Western Hemisphere neighbors to \nhelp them increase their crude oil and natural gas production.\n  We should provide relief to consumers by eliminating the 4.3 cents a \ngallon tax on motor gasoline enacted in 1993.\n  We need to step away from punitive, command and control environmental \nregulations and move toward performance based regulatory concepts that \noffer the regulated community opportunities to find flexible approaches \nto reducing emissions of legally regulated contaminants.\n  We must carefully assess the capabilities of our energy production \nand delivery systems to find opportunities to improve system \nproductivity, efficiency and reliability.\n  We must ensure that sufficient funds are available to help those with \nlower incomes to weatherize their homes and pay their energy bills.\n  While renewable energy sources provide only about 3 percent of total \nU.S. demand for energy, we should continue to provide incentives for \nour citizens to use wind, solar, and other renewables.\n  We should encourage motor vehicle manufacturers to ensure that \nconsumers have access to safe and highly efficient cars and trucks.\n  We must realize that we are part of the problem. Our unwillingness to \ndevelop our own abundant oil, gas and coal resources dooms us to \ngreater dependence on foreign sources, especially for crude oil. We \nmust make the conscious choice to carefully find and develop our \nresources while protecting our environment.\n  I conclude by drawing attention to a portion of this bill that is \nincreasingly valuable; that is the area of new technology. Some who \nwill argue against this bill would suggest that it is merely a reason \nto fall back to our habits of old. That is not true. We want to and \nwill continue to fund the new technology, much of it started in the \ndecade of the 1990s. It is clearly important. We are not always going \nto have hydrocarbons around, and we should not be that dependent upon \nthem. But in the short term, in the next several decades, as we are \nusing our resources and fueling our economy, we need to look at nuclear \ntechnology and new clean coal technology so we can use the abundance of \nthese resources and in an environmentally sound way.\n  In my State of Idaho, we are dependent on hydropower. There are many, \nincluding the past administration and many of their devotees, who would \nsuggest the dams on those rivers that produce that clean source of \nenergy, nonpolluting, nongreenhouse gas-emitting, that those dams ought \nto be breached. They insist that if the dams are not removed then they \nought to be regulated in a much more stringent way. In fact, the \nlicensing process the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has as a \npart of its responsibility to renew these hydro facilities is one that \nI am working on. And within this legislation is a reform of the \nlicensing process, not to change it and take stakeholders or interested \nparties away from it, but to ask them to perform their responsibilities \nin a timely fashion and in a responsible fashion.\n  Why should it take 10 years to relicense a hydro facility and cost \nmillions upon millions of dollars that ultimately the consumer has to \npay? If it needs retrofitting, if it needs improvement of technology \nfor environmental reasons, those are conclusions that can be drawn in a \nreasonably quick way, and managed responsibly, so that we can balance \nout our energy needs.\n  The legislation the Senate now has before us will be coupled with the \nwork the Bush administration is doing now through their Cabinet level \nworking group. This administration wants an energy policy, too, and it \nis their goal to produce one for the American people.\n  Our economy depends on an abundant supply of environmentally sound, \nrelatively low-cost energy. It is the wealth of our country. It is what \ndrives this marvelous economic engine of ours. And it does something \nvery simple--it puts money in the pocketbook of the worker. It turns \nthe lights on in his or her home. It helps educate our children. It \ndoes all of the wonderful things we in America have grown to expect.\n  Why should we suggest that we ought to have anything less if we can \ndo it with the environment in mind and at a relatively low cost. That \ncan be accomplished in a policy in which the Federal Government \npromotes the concept of energy production instead of setting up one \ntrip wire after another to disallow it from happening.\n  I look forward to the coming debate. I think it is critical that all \nof us get ourselves involved and educated in the issues at hand.\n  These two pieces of legislation go a long way toward allowing that to \nhappen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I look forward to joining him in tackling this \nvery difficult problem of making some sense out of our national energy \npolicy.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the subject of \nenergy, the energy prospects we face as a nation, and the need to \ndevelop new energy policies here in this Congress. The United States is \ncurrently experiencing unusually high and volatile energy prices. We \nhave seen that in my State of New Mexico, and I assume we have seen \nthat in the State of Florida, where the Presiding Officer lives.\n  During most of the 1990s, in spite of robust economic growth and \nincreased demand for energy, increased productivity, and reduction in \nenergy use per dollar of gross domestic product, along with the \nintroduction of market competition, all of those factors acted to hold \ndown prices, but now we have finally exhausted the buffer of excess \ncapacity that kept the system functioning with low prices and \nrelatively minor bumps along the way. So that excess capacity is gone, \nand there are a number of factors and circumstances that have \ncontributed to the current situation we face--the situation of \ninadequate supply, too much demand.\n  Remedies are not as apparent as some would argue. The Republican \nenergy package, which was introduced today by my colleague, Senator \nMurkowski, contains a number of provisions that I and many Democrats, I \nam sure, would be glad to support. In fact, many of those proposals are \nsimilar to, if not the same as, provisions originally introduced by \nDemocrats in the last Congress. Much of what has been introduced today \ninvolves proposals to change the tax laws; and in some cases those \nproposals are meritorious; in other cases, they are not an adequate \nsubstitute for changes in actual energy policy.\n  Just last week, President Bush made a very strong statement about tax \npolicy and his determination not to modify his income tax proposals \nwith other unrelated tax measures. This bill that was introduced today, \nwith over 180 pages of tax proposals, seems to reflect some disconnect \nbetween the administration's views on the subject of tax provisions \ndirected or targeted at this particular industry and the views of some \nof my colleagues on the Republican side in the Senate.\n  I had hoped, and still hope, we can proceed on a bipartisan and \ncollaborative basis to develop solutions to these critical problems. I \nstrongly believe that a package with equal emphasis on both supply and \ndemand measures, developed with bipartisan support, is the only way we \ncan pass responsible energy legislation in this Congress. I hope we can \nproceed with the input of this new administration and with the input \nfrom the States and various stakeholders to develop such consensus \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  It is important to step back and look at the current context. The \nrestructured electricity and natural gas markets of today pose very \ndifferent public policy challenges from the old regulatory models. \nEver-increasing consumer demand for transportation fuels, compounded by \nthe recession in Asia and subsequent determination by OPEC to actively \nintervene in the market, has increased the volatility and high prices \nof oil and natural gas.\n  As the economic growth of recent years has used up the excess \ncapacity in the fuels, power, and natural gas sectors, the frictions \nand imperfections in those markets have become very apparent.\n  The old model of split responsibility between States and the Federal \nGovernment is no longer adequate. We need new mechanisms and policies \nto address regional needs and circumstances. We need a new model for \nensuring short-term and long-term energy demand and supply needs and \nmanaging weather-related and supply emergencies.\n  There are several regional energy boards and various planning \ncommissions that could be reviewed as models for new legislation in \nthis area. In consultation with the States, we need to determine how to \nensure regional entities have adequate authority to do what is needed \nin those regions. We should evaluate whether an additional grant of \nauthority from the Federal Government or a specific authorization of \nresponsibility should be written into Federal statute.\n  I will speak for a moment about infrastructure needs. Electric \ntransmission lines, natural gas and oil pipelines, powerplants, and \nrefineries have all become increasingly difficult to site. The No. 1 \nproblem is not environmental permitting, as some persistently argue in \npublic debate today. As our society has become increasingly urbanized \nand congested, local communities have become increasingly active in \nopposing the siting of new infrastructure, and tax incentives do not \naddress this major hurdle.\n  Certainly the environmental rules governing the permitting process \ncould be streamlined to expedite processing and facilitate investments \nin new technologies not in the marketplace when the existing rules were \nwritten. We should consider the possibility of siting new \ninfrastructure on existing rights-of-way or at Federal facilities or on \nbrownfields.\n  We also need to evaluate whether incentives or different policies at \nthe State or Federal level are necessary to ensure adequate investment \nin new capacity. Overemphasis on short-term and spot contracts \ncompounded by ongoing uncertainty with respect to the future regulatory \nenvironment have had a stifling effect upon investment. We need to \ndevelop a consensus on policies that provide greater certainty and a \nmechanism to address the public's growing resistance to siting new \nfacilities.\n  On the subject of supply diversity and efficiency, the counter to \nmajor new infrastructure projects is to emphasize increasing energy \nefficiency and development of smaller distributed generation. We need \nto enact national standards and policies for interconnection of \ndistributed generation technologies to ensure diversity of fuels and \ntechnologies for the future. Commercial investment in new technologies \nand nonconventional fuels will require some degree of additional \nincentives. I introduced legislation in the last Congress to address \nthese issues, and I am pleased to see similar provisions included in \nthis Republican legislation today.\n  Increasing the efficient use of energy is the single most effective \nand least-cost policy for both the short term and the long term. \nInvestments in more energy-efficient lighting, more energy-efficient \nappliances, and more energy-efficient buildings generate benefits in \nterms of energy savings, emission reductions, and human health \nimprovements. Improvements to installation practices for heating and \ncooling systems, including duct work, could take considerable \npressure off the power grid and off natural gas supplies in the coming \nmonths. Expediting the replacement of older appliances with newer high-\nefficiency models would not only reduce energy consumption, it would \ncreate new manufacturing jobs.\n\n  Projections of capacity constraints and high electricity prices in \nthe New York urban area could be mitigated with a concerted effort to \nupgrade lighting, heating, and cooling systems in commercial buildings \neven before this summer is upon us. These improvements would \nimmediately reduce pressure on the grid and save businesses money in \nthe process.\n  The National Conference of Mayors, at its recent meeting here in \nWashington, called for an increase of 10 percent in the efficient use \nof energy.\n  Over the past decade or so, sales of sport utility vehicles and light \ntrucks grew to become fully half the passenger vehicles sold in this \ncountry. Meanwhile, a moratorium on even studying increasing fuel \nefficiency was imposed by the Republican-controlled Congress in the \nlast 2 years. I do not think we can even talk about a comprehensive \nenergy policy without concrete policies to reduce oil demand. We cannot \njust produce our way to independence from foreign oil supplies.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to this chart. The chart is entitled: \n``Petroleum Use Increases Mainly in the Transportation Sector.''\n  This is for the period 1970 to the year 2020, and it shows a history \nand then a projection for consumption in the transportation sector, \nconsumption in the industrial sector, consumption in the residential-\ncommercial sector, and finally consumption in the electricity \ngeneration activity.\n  The obvious conclusion one draws from this chart is that the growth \nconsumption is in the transportation sector. That is the top line. That \nis because of the inefficiency of the vehicles we are driving more and \nmore each year in this country. There can be no serious discussion \nabout reducing our dependence on foreign oil without a discussion of \nwhat can be done to reverse these trends. I hope that is part of the \ndebate we have over the next few months in this Chamber about our \nenergy policy.\n  On the subject of supply, I do agree with my Republican colleagues on \nthe need to increase the supply of petroleum products. The U.S. has \ndomestic natural gas and oil resources that can be developed in an \nefficient and environmentally sensitive manner. In fact, under the \nprevious administration, oil and natural gas production on Federal \nlands and in the Outer Continental Shelf increased substantially. Let \nme repeat that, Mr. President, because most people are not aware of \nthat. In the previous administration, oil and natural gas production on \nFederal lands and on the Outer Continental Shelf increased \nsubstantially. Production on State and private lands did not keep pace \nwith production on Federal lands.\n  Policies should first emphasize maximizing the recovery of resources \ncurrently open to development. The North Slope of Alaska in the \nvicinity of Prudhoe Bay is estimated to contain at least 32 and maybe \nas much as 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that is ready for \ndevelopment. Until now, producing and transporting the gas from the \nNorth Slope has not been economical. Producers are currently conducting \na feasibility study for a pipeline to bring the gas to market in Canada \nand also in the lower 48. The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that \nwith additional exploration in the area, the potential resources could \nbe double the current estimate which I have given of 32 to 38 trillion \ncubic feet.\n  Such a project will involve a number of Federal and State agencies, \nNative groups, the Government of Canada, and many private stakeholders \nin ensuring the efficient processing of all permitting and \ncertifications necessary to be a top priority of this Congress. I have \ncommitted to Senator Murkowski to work with him to facilitate any \nlegislative actions that are appropriate to accomplish this.\n  Another producing area with great potential is the deep water Gulf of \nMexico. The gulf has had an explosion of development in recent years, \nin part due to royalty incentives to offset the higher costs of \ndeveloping a frontier area.\n  The Minerals Management Service is scheduled to hold a lease sale \nlater this year for an area in the eastern planning area of the gulf. \nThis chart shows what I am talking about. The green area is the sale \n1881. The lease sale would cover a narrow strip of Federal waters \ndirectly south of the Alabama coastline which expands into a broader \narea 100 miles out in the gulf.\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\n  The MMS, the Minerals Management Service, estimates 240 million \nbarrels of oil and 1.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas will be \ndeveloped from this area. Those figures could go as high as 370 million \nbarrels of oil and 3.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Unfortunately, the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the President's \nbrother, has written to the Department of the Interior urging \ncancellation of this lease sale and any future lease sales in this \nentire eastern planning region. I certainly understand that Floridians \nmay have concerns about the development close to their beaches, but \nmost of this area is more than 100 miles from the State and in Federal \nwaters.\n  When the Minerals Management Service prepared the leasing plan for \nthis 5-year-period, they had extensive public meetings and \nconsultations with States. The State of Florida supported proceeding \nwith this sale. This is not a wildlife refuge. It is a huge expanse of \nFederal water where industry has developed oil and gas for years and \nhas developed it in a safe and environmentally sound manner. This is a \nsale which we should go forward with in order to meet the needs the \ncountry will have for additional supply in the future.\n  A serious, long-term commitment to research and development of the \nnext generation of powerplants is essential. Such a program should \ninclude all feasible fuels and technologies, with an emphasis on a \nfleet of technologies to ensure fuel diversity while meeting energy \nsupply and emission reduction targets. Development and deployment of \nmore efficient generating and end-use technologies are critical.\n  Commitment to a coordinated research, development, and deployment \nprogram to ensure the safe and reliable operation of pipelines and \ntransmission lines is also essential to restore public confidence in \nthe safety of these systems. The Pipeline Safety Act, S. 235, which \npassed the Senate by a vote of 98-0 earlier this month, contains the \nframework for such a program for natural gas and oil pipelines. A \nparallel program exists within the Department of Energy for the \nelectric transmission system, and I hope we will see a serious \ncommitment to these programs in the budget that the President sends to \nCongress in the next week or so.\n  The oil and gas industry has made great strides in increasing \nproductivity and bringing down exploration and production costs. \nDevelopment of 3D and 4D seismic analysis techniques, horizontal \ndrilling, and deep water production systems are some examples that have \nenabled the industry to continue producing more oil and gas from the \nmature fields on shore and to set world records in deep water \ndevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico. A robust R program to maximize \nrecovery, to address problems of operations in ultra deep waters, and \nto evaluate the potential of methane hydrates will be critical to \nfuture development of affordable natural gas supplies.\n  I am concerned that the President maintain a serious commitment to \nfunding critical energy research and development. We have shortchanged \nourselves in the past by cutting investment in R to meet other budget \nobjectives. We should not make that same mistake again this year.\n  On tax policy, the Finance Committee will soon begin hearings on the \nPresident's budget and tax proposals. These hearings will give the \nSenate an opportunity to evaluate a range of tax incentives to enhance \ninvestment and distribute a generation from combined heat and power \nsystems and fuel cells to renewable technologies and energy-efficient \nproperty used in business. Many of these proposals are included in the \nbill that was introduced today by Senator Murkowski. They have been \nincluded in legislation I have introduced and cosponsored in the past.\n\n  We need to carefully analyze the need for policy measures versus \nchanges in tax policies as we go through this debate over the next few \nmonths. The omnibus Republican energy bill is very generous in its \nmodification of the Tax Code as a solution to many shortfalls, \nperceived and otherwise, in our energy policy. For example, at a time \nwhen oil and gas prices are at such high levels, with the major oil \ncompanies reporting record earnings, I believe it is valid to say that \nthe industry does not need additional tax incentives in order to go \nforward and explore and produce petroleum products. What we do need are \nwell-thought-out, countercyclical measures that give producers \nincentives to maintain investment in domestic exploration and drilling \nduring a time of extremely low prices as we had a year or two ago.\n  Top priority should be given to policies that correct market failures \nand meet major policy goals of increasing efficiency and diversifying \ntechnologies.\n  We need to develop long-term policies, and I have been speaking about \nsome of those long-term policies. In the interim, individuals and \nfamilies and small businesses are suffering today from energy bills \nthat they cannot pay. President Bush, during his campaign, made clear \nhis support for ensuring adequate funds for the LIHEAP program--that is \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program--and for the low-income \nefficiency programs.\n  In addition to the stress on families and individuals, higher energy \nprices are having an impact on our economy as well. Every dollar spent \non these programs will be immediately and completely reinjected into \nthe economy, unlike tax cuts that will not have an impact for months \ninto the future. I urge the President to send those in Congress a \nrequest for a supplemental appropriation with his budget for next year, \na supplemental appropriation so we can adequately fund the LIHEAP \nprogram and adequately fund the weatherization programs that are so \nimportant for many in our country.\n  Our majority leader, earlier this afternoon, indicated we would not \nbe addressing energy policy on the Senate floor until sometime this \nsummer, June or July I believe was his estimate. That may be an \nappropriate time to address long-term energy policy because it will \ntake several months to develop a good piece of legislation which we can \nsupport on a bipartisan basis. But that is too long to wait for \nattention to these immediate needs, the need to adequately fund the \nLIHEAP program and the weatherization programs.\n  We are not at a crossroads where one path or the other needs to be \ntaken in our national energy policy. The supply side only path that \nsome have advocated would be both futile and destructive. The path of \nmaximum efficiency--renewable and emission-free energy--is a very long \nroad with many milestones along the way. It would be foolhardy to put \nall of our confidence in that path, as well.\n  We need a commitment to parallel paths, with a focus on maintaining \nthe core values of equity and affordability and environmental \nintegrity. I believe we can do that if we get on with the consideration \nof the legislation I introduced the week before we had our recess to \naddress our immediate needs for adequate funding of the programs that \nassist families to deal with the high cost of energy they are facing \nthis winter. And then we need this bipartisan effort to develop some \nlong-term policies.\n\n  I am confident with good will on both sides of the political aisle we \ncan come up with a bipartisan piece of legislation that will move our \ncountry forward and help us deal with these very real problems. I \ncommend all of my colleagues for their interest in these energy issues. \nI hope we can work together constructively to address them in the \nmonths ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have been talking about energy today. I \nrise now to talk about this Nation's struggle to deal with a \nthreatening energy situation that is affecting our economy.\n  I don't think there is any other issue that will come before Congress \nthat will have more to do with our daily lives than this one.\n  For those of you who do not believe we are in a situation that makes \nus all very uncomfortable, I ask you to rethink that. The prevailing \nmind-set must change in order to solve this problem that has reached a \ncrisis proportion.\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\n  Don't let anybody tell you differently. We are in the midst of one of \nthe worst energy shortages this Nation has ever experienced. The oil \nshortage will pale to the one of the 1970s because it entails all forms \nof energy. I remember the long gas lines and forced reductions in \nheating energy that we faced in the 1970s. I also remember the \nfinancial pain that it placed on all Americans--especially Montanans. \nWe come from a large State. We are very mobile. In fact, if you look at \nthe size of Montana from the northwest corner to the southeast corner, \nit is farther than the distance from Chicago to Washington, DC.\n  All of us were hurt during those days. Families of farmers and \nranchers, over-the-road truck drivers, manufacturing companies, \nloggers, and the mining industry were jolted by that energy shortage--\njolted to the point where some did not recover at all.\n  When coupled with high interest rates at that time and runaway \ninflation, it was truly a double whammy. I do not want to see that \nhappen again. But little did I know, although I should have, that our \nmemories are very short on our understanding of energy and the role it \nplays in our everyday lives. We took it for granted too long, even \nthough the signs of the impending dangers were there. It is still \ntalked about in the Halls here, but the message fell on ears that did \nnot want to listen.\n\n  In Montana, we have already seen the impact. Columbia Falls Aluminum \nCompany, one of the largest users of electrical power, closed its doors \nfor a year. Montana Resources in Butte, MT, closed its doors, and we \ndon't know when that will ever be open. Many others will have to do the \nsame if price signals on the cost of commodities or the cost of power \ndoes not change. I am told that farmers placing orders for their spring \nfertilizer needs are stunned when they hear the price. Any increase in \nthe cost of production would be devastating to grain growers in \nMontana.\n  As you know, natural gas is used in the production of nitrogen for \nurea and fertilizer that is used across the country.\n  Facing this problem is something within itself. We are in the midst \nof a crisis. We must use caution. We cannot succumb to the knee-jerk \nreactions that are of a temporary nature. Usually, that leads to a \nlong-term nightmare.\n  While I know the challenge that faces us, I plan to approach it with \na great deal of caution.\n  First off, there are some folks who are promulgating the idea that we \nimpose Federal price caps on electricity. That will not work in the \nNorthwestern United States at this time. Price caps discourage \ninvestment, generation and transmission at a time when we need all \nthree.\n  The National Energy Security Act of 2001 introduced by Senator \nMurkowski today is a piece of legislation that is pretty well thought \nout and is supposed to stabilize energy prices as we see them today.\n  That is why I am adding my name as a cosponsor to that bill. But as \nwith any bill, there are portions I would like to work on with Senator \nMurkowski, the administration, and the Energy Committee when we begin \nthe debate. But I am generally comfortable that the legislation is a \npositive move in the right direction for our country and American \nconsumers.\n\n  The bill aims to protect the energy security of the United States and \ndecrease America's dependency on foreign oil sources to less than 50 \npercent by the year 2010 by enhancing the use of renewable energy \nsources, conserving energy resources, improving energy efficiencies, \nand increasing domestic energy supplies. As written, it will improve \nenvironmental quality by reducing emissions of air pollutants, \ngreenhouse gases, and it will, in effect, stunt the increased costs of \nenergy to the American consumer.\n  But let's take a closer and intensive look at what I perceive are the \nreasons we are in this energy situation today. Electricity prices are \nskyrocketing. We are seeing high gasoline prices, oil prices, natural \ngas prices, and heating oil prices as well. In fact, the price per \nbarrel of oil has gone from $15.99 in 1992 to well over $30 this year. \nNatural gas prices have gone from $1.74 per thousand cubic feet at the \nwellhead to nearly $5 per thousand cubic feet today. Electricity prices \nin the Northwest have gone from roughly $20 per megawatt hour in 1992 \nto nearly $250 per megawatt hour right now. I don't have a high enough \nmath degree to figure how much of an increase that really is. Gasoline \nprices were around 93 cents per gallon in 1992 and now sit at nearly a \n$1.40 or $1.50 per gallon today. And these prices are before taxes are \nadded. So prices have gone up across the board for all forms of energy.\n  The policies of the past 8 years, or as some would say the lack of a \nclear national energy policy, has contributed to this predicament we \nfind ourselves in today.\n  In the Northwest, we have seen a 24 percent increase in electricity \nconsumption since 1992, while generation has only increased 4 percent. \nIf you add the California situation into the mix, the discrepancy grows \neven larger. Further, the Electric Power Research Institute recently \nfound that there is going to be a 20 to 25 percent growth in \nelectricity demand in the next 10 years, but, again, only a 4 percent \nincrease in generation and also the transmission lines to carry that \nelectricity, that power. The stats speak for themselves. If we do not \nsee more generation and the ability to transmit it--if those do not \ncome on-line--high energy prices are here to stay. We must lose the \nmentality that electricity comes from a switch like the mentality that \nmilk comes from a jug.\n  Commonsense tells us that our regulation policies should allow the \nsupply to meet the demand.\n  We can and must identify and reform or, in some cases, remove some of \nthe regulatory burdens. We now have a mandate to assess and improve \nagency performance, which could lead to more timely processing of \npermits and applications to produce power.\n  Public lands in the West, what role do they play? Or should they play \na role? They do have a role to play. They may hold the key to the \ndependency of foreign sources of oil and natural gas. We can and must \nimprove the usage and management of our public lands, which means \nbetter coordination with local citizens affected by agency action. And \nthere needs to be consistency within the agencies so that investors \nhave some kind of idea about when they may see a return on their \ninvestment.\n\n  We have seen that oil and gas exploration increased with the previous \nadministration. That is true. It is a true statement. It is also true \nthat more lands were withdrawn from exploration than in any other \nadministration. Exploration might have increased but, I would ask, did \nproduction?\n  Finally, we must reduce the time and cost for approving exploration \nand management of development projects. Our Federal agencies need to \nhelp ease the pain of regulatory burdens that have been placed on \nAmerica's energy consumers.\n  Next, we need to be able to access those vast resources on our public \nlands. The Federal Government currently manages--now listen to this \nfigure--650 million acres of land. More than 90 percent of this land is \nwest of the Mississippi River. In fact, 52 percent of the land in the \nWest is managed by Federal and State Governments. In Montana, nearly 50 \npercent of our land is owned by the Federal Government. Folks, 95 \npercent of the undiscovered oil and 40 percent of the undiscovered gas \nis estimated to be located under these public lands. It is obvious to \nme that herein lies a part of our solution to energy dependence on \nforeign sources. We have the ways and means to manage our natural \nresources on public lands so that the environment is treated like we \nwould treat our own homes.\n  I am confident that the new administration, working with Energy \nCommittee Chairman Frank Murkowski and the rest of the Congress, will \ndevelop a comprehensive plan that will take the step to solve the \nproblems that we are facing. As I stated before, we must looks at our \nregulations and regulatory burdens. We must be able to site generation \nfacilities in a timely manner. We, as policymakers and acting in the \nbest interests of all Americans, should be able to site transmission \nlines in a timely manner.\n  Finally, we must remove the barriers that stifle incentives for \ninvestment in our power markets, while at the same\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\ntime providing incentives to do the same. We have worked ourselves out \nof crisis situations in the past. American ingenuity and imagination \nwill again, in a free market, take its role and provide us again with \naffordable energy, but it must be allowed to do so. It must be allowed \nin our shared American values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1565-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1565-S1566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DALE EARNHARDT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about Dale Earnhardt. \nDuring this past week, millions of racing fans all around the country \nhave been mourning the death of this stock car great. He was killed on \nthe last turn of the last lap of the prestigious Daytona 500 just a \nweek ago Sunday.\n  I rise today not only to eulogize Dale Earnhardt but to try to \nexplain to those who are not racing fans why his life and death means \nso much to those of us who are. I believe there are some lessons of \nlife here that have relevance to all of us and, indeed, to the health \nof our country.\n  Why is Dale Earnhardt's death an occasion for such reflection? The \nfirst reason has to do with the man himself. I did not know him well. \nHis closest friends talked not just about Dale Earnhardt the race car \ndriver but about Dale Earnhardt the man, a family man, a man who was \nintensely loyal to his friends, a man who went out of his way to do \nthoughtful favors, who took great care of his employees, and who helped \nyounger drivers.\n  Ironically, he died at almost the precise moment that Michael Waltrip \ntook the checkered flag at the Daytona 500 race. It was Waltrip's first \nvictory ever in a very long racing career, well over 400 starts. Dale \nEarnhardt believed in Michael Waltrip. He believed he could win if he \nhad the right equipment. So he hired him; he provided him a car that \ncould win, and Michael Waltrip did the rest.\n  In private, Earnhardt always seemed to me to be quiet; in fact, even \nshy. But on the track he was anything but shy. He was known as ``the \nIntimidator.'' That is precisely because of the way he raced. He was \ntough. It seemed he would always find a way to win, even if his car was \nnot as good that day as some of the others.\n  Sometimes, especially earlier in his career, he was perhaps too \naggressive. But he didn't see racing as a sport for the weak. Indeed, I \ndon't think there is anything wrong with having a very strong desire to \nbe the very best you can be. That seemed to be Dale Earnhardt's \nmotivation in life. As racing fans, as sports fans of any kind, we all \nhave our favorites, but no real NASCAR fan would deny that he was the \ngreatest driver of his time.\n  It takes away nothing from the other great drivers to acknowledge \nthat Dale Earnhardt was the best. He had enormous natural talent and \ncourage. It takes courage to drive a car right on the edge, at 200 \nmiles per hour. He had experience, racing smarts, and he had an \nintangible will--the will to win. He won seven NASCAR championships, \ntied only by Richard Petty. He had a lot of other racing victories as \nwell. One of the racing series is called IROC, International Race of \nChampions, where everybody is given an identical car and it is up to \nthe drivers to show who is the best using identically prepared cars. \nEarnhardt frequently won because of his skill.\n  It may simply be a sport, but we can all appreciate excellence. \nWhether in art, music, business, or sport, it is a joy to watch the \nvery best perform. That is one of the reasons Dale Earnhardt will be so \nsorely missed. His peers will miss him as well as his fans.\n  Why was he so tough? It had to do with respect. One of the highest \naccomplishments for a race car driver was to have the respect of Dale \nEarnhardt. In NASCAR racing, you knew you had made it when Dale \nEarnhardt said so.\n  Some wonder how well NASCAR will fare with the death of its greatest \ndriver. But Dale Earnhardt would scoff at that thought. It was always \nhis dream to drive a NASCAR. NASCAR was a great sports organization \nbefore he got there, and it will continue to grow. It is the Nation's \nfastest-growing sport. Just as Richard Petty's 200 wins and 7 \nchampionships earned him the moniker ``The King,'' NASCAR will add Dale \nEarnhardt to its great history and tradition, and it will continue.\n  Back to the original question: Why do so many millions of Americans \nmourn his death? I think it has to do with the very nature of NASCAR \nitself. It is a family affair, and all NASCAR fans consider themselves \npart of that family. You start with NASCAR itself, the National \nAssociation of Stock Car Racing, which was started by Bill France, from \nDaytona Beach, FL. His family took it over. His son Bill France, Jr., \nhas been the head of NASCAR during its great growth period.\n  I pray for Bill France, Jr.'s health. He has, in effect, turned most \nof the business over to other members of his family now and also to the \nCEO of NASCAR, Mike Helton. The crews, the owners, the sponsors, the \ndrivers, the owners of the tracks, and the media that cover the sport \nare all a very close-knit unit. They race hard against each other, but \nthey will always come to each other's aid in times of difficulty.\n  Not only is there a strong sense of values within the people who \nparticipate in the sport, but also strong values within the family, \nstarting with a firm belief in God. When the race is over, ordinarily \nwhen the driver maneuvers himself out of the car and claims victory, \nfirst of all he will thank God for a safe race and for the talent, he \nwill thank his crew for preparing the car, and he will thank a lot of \nother people for enabling him to win. At the races, each Sunday morning \nbefore the race starts there is a chapel service and a prayer before \nthe race.\n  A lot of these things don't characterize typical sports events. These \nare good people. They are not prima donnas like some other sports \nfigures. They provide interviews and give autographs and do \nappearances. They appeal to young people. They are really normal people \ndoing very extraordinary things. Fans can relate to them. They look at \nthem not as role models but as people who, in a sense, are like them. \nMany came up the hard way, as Earnhardt did. He didn't even graduate \nfrom high school. His father was a great driver in his own right. Now \nDale Earnhardt's son, Dale Jr., will have to do the same.\n  In the end, Dale Earnhardt is mourned because his life is an example \nof the American dream. He came from very humble beginnings--in his \ncase, from the small town of Kannapolis, NC --worked hard, and ended up \na success. Dale Earnhardt is mourned because he embodied the qualities \nnot only personifying NASCAR but, in a sense, life in general, and \nhumility, loyalty, caring, hard work, pride in one's work, and the \ncompetitive spirit. Most of all, he was a lover of family and friends.\n  Today, I join the millions of Americans who are praying for Dale's \nwife Theresa, his children, and all of the good people who are fans of \nNASCAR.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to note with sadness the \ntragic death of Dale Earnhardt.\n  For the past week, the Nation has mourned the loss of a racing \nlegend.\n  But in my home State of North Carolina, his death has a special \nsignificance because we have lost a cherished native son.\n  Dale Earnhardt was a hero to countless NASCAR fans in North Carolina \nand across our country.\n  His success on the track helped elevate stock-car racing from a \nregional pastime to a national sport.\n  Racing brought Dale fame and wealth, but he never forgot his roots in \nKannapolis, North Carolina or the hometown fans who backed him from the \nbeginning.\n  He never let them down. They always knew they could count on Dale to \ngive it his all every time.\n  Dale Earnhardt was a champion from the start, winning NASCAR rookie-\nof-the-year honors back in 1975.\n  In 26 years of racing, Dale won 7 Winston Cup Series titles, 76 races \nin all, including the 1998 Daytona 500, and became the leading all-time \nmoney winner in racing history.\n  His fans and his fellow racers called him ``The Intimidator''--not \njust because he won so many races--but because he was a fierce \ncompetitor.\n  Dale Earnhardt was more than a great race car driver. He was also a \ngreat American success story, rising from poverty and a ninth-grade \neducation to become a racing legend and extraordinarily successful \nbusinessman.\n  He was also a great husband to his wife Teresa, and a great father to \nhis\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nchildren, Taylor, Dale Jr., Kelley, and Kerry. Our hearts go out to \nthem.\n  North Carolina has lost one of her favorite sons, and NASCAR has lost \nperhaps its greatest champion. Our prayers go out to his family, \nfriends, and fans.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I was so glad to hear my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina talking about Dale Earnhardt. Dale was a \nremarkable citizen and individual. I knew him well. In fact, when the \nnews came that he had died in the accident, I immediately arranged for \na flag to be flown at half-mast over the Capitol to be sent to his \nwidow for use at the funeral.\n  Dale had a good sense of humor, and he was not unaware of the risk \ninvolved in the business in which he chose to participate. I remember \nwhen he came to a dinner in Charlotte when I was running for \nreelection, and he and others had arranged for me to get a ``Winston \nCup'' jacket, I think they called it. It was a thing that only race car \ndrivers can wear with impunity. But I wear it every once in a while \nbecause I am so grateful for this industry--and that is what it is in \nNorth Carolina, a big business.\n  Dale Earnhardt was--how do you put it--an authentic American. There \nwas no pretense about him. He was a hero to millions of stock car \nracing fans who followed his remarkable career as a seven-time Winston \nCup champion when that fatal crash occurred on the last lap of the \nDaytona 500 on February 18.\n  North Carolina has lost a son and America has lost an incredible \nhero. Dale Earnhardt touched people whether or not they were fans of \nthe motor sports. Growing up in North Carolina and working at what he \nloved, he was indeed remarkable. The passion he had for life did not \nend when he left the track. He carried it over to his family. He lived \nlife to its fullest and loved every second of it.\n  Race fans throughout the world felt as if they had lost a member of \ntheir family--and they had. Known as ``The Intimidator'' for his \naggressive driving style, Dale Earnhardt was a legend not only for his \nracing career, but for his having guided thousands of young people into \nuseful, meaningful adulthoods. Dale Earnhardt is an inspiration to \nmillions for allowing them to realize that a dream can be achieved.\n  The United States Senate family extends their deepest sympathy to \nMrs. Earnhardt, their two sons and two daughters, and their other loved \nones.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I am \nrecognizing today the loss of one of the greatest NASCAR drivers ever \nto get behind the wheel, Dale Earnhardt, who tragically died at this \nyear's Daytona 500. The Nation not only lost an icon of the racing \nworld, but also a great man.\n  Dale Earnhardt's career achievements are vast, better than most teams \nof drivers. In his 26 years of racing, Dale won 76 races and secured \nseven Winston Cup Championships. But, the biggest accomplishment Dale \nearned is the respect and admiration of his fellow drivers and his fans \nthrough his hard work and dedication to the sport he loved. Everyone \ninvolved in racing will never forget what Dale has done for the sport \nand how his accomplishments have forever turned racing into a way of \nlife.\n  He had an aggressive driving style that was rivaled by none, and \nrevered by all. Dale Earnhardt set the standard by which every driver \nwas measured. On the race track it was all business. Off the track he \nwas a man with a huge heart and a tender way who always had time for \nfans and other racers. You can never replace a driver like Dale \nEarnhardt, but his legend will live on.\n  As a motorsports enthusiast myself and co-chair of the Congressional \nMotorsports Caucus, it is with regret for me to make this Senate floor \nstatement. Today I invite my Senate colleagues to join me in sending my \nsincere condolences to the Earnhardt family and everyone that has been \ntouched by the man known as the Intimidator on the race track. The \nnumber 3 car will be missed on the track. But, racing will go on, Dale \nwould have wanted it that way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1566-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nBOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA V. GARRETT SUPREME COURT \n                                  CASE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, during the Congressional recess last \nweek, the Supreme Court issued an extremely important decision \nregarding the Americans with Disabilities Act and the principles of \nfederalism. The decision, Board of Trustees of the University of \nAlabama v. Garrett, is one in a series of cases that is helping \nreassert the role of the States in our Federal system of Government.\n  The eleventh amendment to the Constitution prohibits States from \nbeing sued in Federal court by private citizens for money damages, \nunless the State consents. In the Garrett case, the Supreme Court said \nthat based on this provision it is unconstitutional for the Congress to \nhold the States liable for private lawsuits under the ADA. The Congress \ndid not or could not create a record of a pattern of discrimination by \nthe States sufficient to meet the heavy burden required by the \nConstitution.\n  While the case referred to Title I of the ADA, which concerns \nemployment discrimination, the reasoning of the Court should apply \nequally to all of the ADA and well beyond the ADA.\n  I would like to note just one example. In 1998, the Supreme Court \nheld that the language of the ADA was clear enough to cover state and \nlocal prisons. I immediately introduced legislation to exclude State \nand local prisons from the ADA because I do not believe that the \nCongress considered the ADA applying to these institutions when it \npassed the legislation. After all, the housing of prisoners is a core \nState function, with about 94 percent of prisoners being maintained in \nState and local facilities.\n  I have reintroduced the legislation, S. 34, in this Congress. \nHowever, this Supreme Court decision should be very beneficial in \nlimiting the application of the ADA in the prison context on the State \nlevel even without the Congress amending the ADA. This is just an \nexample of how this case will help keep the Federal Government out of \nareas that traditionally have been reserved to the States.\n  Far too often, the Congress ignores the principles of federalism and \nacts as though the States are subdivisions of the Federal Government. \nDecisions such as Garrett remind the Congress that this is simply not \nthe case. The Constitution created a Federal Government of limited, \nenumerated powers, and those powers that the Constitution does not \nprovide for the Federal Government are reserved to the States and to \nthe people.\n  The Congress must do more to recognize the separation of powers \nbetween the Federal Government and the States. I am pleased that the \nSupreme Court is showing a renewed respect for the principles of \nfederalism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1566-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1566-S1570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           rule 6--witnesses\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the Committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the Chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     Committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure to file such a \n     statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the Chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     Committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the Chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The Chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     Committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           rule 7--subpoenas\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     Committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any Member of the Committee, the Committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     Committee. When the Committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the Chairman or any other \n     member designated by the Committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled Committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the Chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the Committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            rule 8--reports\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the Chief Clerk of the \n     Committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the Committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the Committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the Committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the Committee.\n\n\n                            rule 9--treaties\n\n       (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent. \n     Because the House of Representatives has no role in the \n     approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only \n     congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the Committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the Committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          rule 10--nominations\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 calendar \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the Committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the Committee decrees \n     otherwise.\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) in appropriate cases, the \n     nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a \n     confidential statement with the Committee; (3) the Committee \n     has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests \n     which could conflict with the interests of the government in \n     the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) \n     for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-\n     large, or minister, the Committee has received a complete \n     list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of \n     his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during \n     the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding \n     years; and (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, \n     a report on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            rule 11--travel\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the Committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without the express \n     authorization of the Committee. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded of Senate Rule XXXV.4 requiring a determination by \n     the Senate Ethics Committee in the case of foreign-sponsored \n     travel.\n       Any proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the full Committee.\n       When the Chairman and the Ranking Member approve the \n     foreign travel of a member of the staff of the committee not \n     accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the \n     Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such \n     travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the Committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Member of the Committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of the Committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of Rule 11 as regards staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each Member of the Committee\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n     may designate one personal staff member as the ``Personal \n     Representative of the Member.''\n\n\n                          rule 12--transcripts\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee \n     shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the Ranking Member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (3) Classified or restricted transcripts shall be kept in \n     locked combination safes in the Committee offices except when \n     in active use by authorized persons for a period not to \n     exceed 2 weeks. Extensions of this period may be granted as \n     necessary by the Chief Clerk. They must never be left \n     unattended and shall be returned to the Chief Clerk promptly \n     when no longer needed.\n       (4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below, transcripts \n     classified secret or higher may not leave the Committee \n     offices except for the purpose of declassification.\n       (5) Classified transcripts other than those classified \n     secret or higher may leave the Committee offices in the \n     possession of authorized persons with the approval of the \n     Chairman. Delivery and return shall be made only by \n     authorized persons. Such transcripts may not leave \n     Washington, DC, unless adequate assurances for their security \n     are made to the Chairman.\n       (6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (7) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     Chairman with the concurrence of the Ranking Member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (i) Members and staff of the Committee in the Committee \n     rooms;\n       (ii) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     Committee, and of the Majority and Minority Leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the Committee's Capitol \n     office;\n       (iii) Senators not members of the Committee, by permission \n     of the Chairman in the Committee rooms; and\n       (iv) Members of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the Committee's Capitol office, or, with the \n     permission of the Chairman, in the offices of the officials \n     who took part in the meeting, but in either case, only for a \n     specified and limited period of time, and only after reliable \n     assurances against further reproduction or dissemination have \n     been given.\n\n       (8) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the Committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the Chairman and \n     notice to the other members of the Committee. Each transcript \n     of a closed session of the Committee shall include on its \n     cover a description of the restrictions imposed upon access, \n     as well as any applicable restrictions upon photocopying, \n     note-taking or other dissemination.\n       (9) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a Committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the Committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman, the Ranking Member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the Staff Director or Minority Staff \n     Director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All restricted transcripts and classified Committee \n     reports shall be declassified on a date twelve years after \n     their origination unless the Committee by majority vote \n     decides against such declassification, and provided that the \n     executive departments involved and all former Committee \n     members who participated directly in the sessions or reports \n     concerned have been consulted in advance and given a \n     reasonable opportunity to raise objections to such \n     declassification.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than twelve years \n     after their origination if:\n       (i) the Chairman originates such action or receives a \n     written request for such action, and notifies the other \n     members of the Committee;\n       (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Member, and each member or \n     former member who participated directly in such meeting or \n     report give their approval, except that the Committee by \n     majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to \n     early declassification; and\n       (iii) the executive departments and all former Committee \n     members are consulted in advance and have a reasonable \n     opportunity to object to early declassification.\n\n\n                      rule 13--classified material\n\n       (a) All classified material received or originated by the \n     Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in \n     the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material \n     classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen \n     Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.\n       (b) Each such piece of classified material received or \n     originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and \n     where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by \n     means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman. \n     If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee \n     offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be \n     accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show \n     onward receipt.\n       (c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall \n     be by Committee members or authorized staff only. All \n     classified material sent to members' offices, and that \n     distributed within the working offices of the Committee, \n     shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief \n     Clerk. No classified material is to be removed from the \n     offices of the members or of the Committee without permission \n     of the Chairman. Such classified material will be afforded \n     safe handling and safe storage at all times.\n       (d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed \n     and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office \n     for use by the members and authorized staff in that office \n     only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be \n     authorized by the Chairman or Staff Director.\n       (e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of these regulations.\n\n\n                             rule 14--staff\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the Chairman of the Committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the Staff Director; provided, however, \n     that such part of the staff as is designated Minority Staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the Ranking Member \n     and under the immediate direction of the Minority Staff \n     Director.\n       (2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     Committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     Committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the Committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the Committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for Committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the Committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     Committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when Committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the Committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected Members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the Committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (i) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (ii) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the Staff \n     Director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     Minority Staff Director. In the case of the Staff Director \n     and the Minority Staff Director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking Member, as \n     appropriate. In any event, such public statements should \n     avoid the expression of personal views and should not contain \n     predictions of future, or interpretations of past, Committee \n     action; and\n       (iii) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the Committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the Committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     Staff Director or Minority Staff Director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 rule 15--status and amendment of rules\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These Rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, Rules of the \n     Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be \n     superseded by Committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1570-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1570-S1578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in accordance with rule XXVI(2) of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, I ask that the Rules of Procedure of the \nSelect Committee on Ethics, which were adopted February 23, 1978, and \nrevised November 1999, be printed in the Congressional Record for the \n107th Congress.\n\n  Select Committee on Ethics Jurisdiction and Authority, S. Res. 338, \n                      88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964)\n\n       Resolved, That (a) is hereby established a permanent select \n     committee of the Senate to be known as the Select Committee \n     on Ethics (referred to hereinafter as the ``Select \n     Committee'') consisting of six Members of the Senate, of whom \n     three shall be selected from Members of the majority party \n     and three shall be selected from Members of the minority \n     party.

and\n       (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding \n     undertakin by the Select Committee after a finding, on the \n     basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred--\n       (c)(1) No--\n       (A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member or officer \n     of the Senate may be conducted;\n       (B) report, resolution, or recommendation relating to such \n     a adjudicatory review of conduct may be made;

Debate on the \n     appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those \n     opposing the appeal.\n       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ \n     hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact \n     and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the \n     disposition of complaints.\n       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. \n     The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct \n     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was \n     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the \n     merits by the predecessor Select Committee.\n       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rule setting \n     forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary \n     inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.\n       (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit \n     to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative \n     measures which it may consider to be necessary for the \n     effective discharge of its duties.\n       Sec. 3.

(See Rule 5 on Procedures for Conducting Hearings.)\n       (i) Secrecy of Executive Testimony and Action and of \n     Complaint Proceedings:\n       (1) All testimony and action taken in executive session \n     shall be kept secret and shall not be released outside the \n     Committee to any individual or group, whether governmental or \n     private, without the approval of a majority of the Committee.\n       (2) All testimony and action relating to a complaint or \n     allegation shall be kept secret and shall not be released by \n     the Committee to any individual or group, whether \n     governmental or private, except the respondent, without the \n     approval of a majority of the Committee, until such time as a \n     report to the Senate is required under Senate Resolution 338, \n     88th Congress, as amended, or unless otherwise permitted \n     under these Rules. (See Rule 8 on Procedures for Handling \n     Committee Sensitive and Classified Materials.)\n       (j) Release of Reports to Public: No information pertaining \n     to, or copies of any Committee report, study, or other \n     document which purports to express the view, findings, \n     conclusions or recommendations of the Committee in connection \n     with any of its activities or proceedings may be released to \n     any individual or group whether governmental or private, \n     without the authorization of the Committee. Whenever the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman is authorized to make any \n     determination, then the determination may be released at his \n     or her discretion. Each member of the Committee shall be \n     given a reasonable opportunity to have separate views \n     included as part of any Committee report. (See Rule 8 on \n     Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified \n     Materials.)\n       (k) Ineligibility or Disqualification of Members and Staff:\n       (1) A member of the Committee shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that relates \n     specifically to any of the following:\n       (A) a preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating \n     to (i) the conduct of (I) such member; (II) any officer or \n     employee the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed \n     by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Committee \n     with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the committee \n     and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to supervise any \n     officer or employee consistent with the provision of \n     paragraph 12 of rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a \n     member of the Committee in a manner described in subparagraph \n     (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either the Chairman or the \n     Vice Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that \n     the member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in \n     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the \n     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to \n     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman. If the member believes that he or she is not \n     ineligible, he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, and if they both agree that the member is \n     not ineligible, the member shall continue to serve. But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before the \n     Committee and the determinations and recommendations of the \n     Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member \n     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in \n     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any Member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member. At the direction or with the consent of the \n     staff director or outside counsel, a staff member may also be \n     disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in \n     other circumstances not listed above.\n       (l) Recorded Votes: Any member may require a recorded vote \n     on any matter.\n       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members:\n       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question \n     before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of a \n     preliminary inquiry or an adjudicatory review, or the \n     issuance of a report or recommendation related thereto \n     concerning a Member or officer of the Senate. In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts Between Sessions and During \n     Extended Recesses: During any period in which the Senate \n     stands in adjournment between sessions of the Congress or \n     stands in a recess scheduled to extend beyond fourteen days, \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, or their designees, acting \n     jointly, are authorized to approve or disapprove blind trusts \n     under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n     Rule 2: Procedures for Complaints, Allegations, or Information\n\n       (a) Complaint, Allegation, or Information: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or \n     any rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the \n     conduct of any individual in the performance of his or her \n     duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or \n     has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the \n     Senate. Such complaints or allegations or information may \n     be reported to the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a \n     Committee member, or a Committee staff member.\n       (b) Source of Complaint, Allegation, or Information: \n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to \n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        Rule 3: Procedures for Conducting a Preliminary Inquiry\n\n       (a) Definition of Preliminary Inquiry: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) Basis For Preliminary Inquiry: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) Scope of Preliminary Inquiry:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) Opportunity for Response: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a deminimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n     adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule 4. No \n     adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate may be initiated except by the \n     affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee.\n\n\n        Rule 4: Procedures for Conducting an Adjudicatory Review\n\n       (a) Definition of Adjudicatory Review: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Adjudicatory Review: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report of Adjudicatory Review to Committee: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) Committee Action:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), \n     subsections (2), (3), & (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) Right of Appeal:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    Rule 5: Procedures for Hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes on order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d)).\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) Witnesses: (1) A subpoena or other request to testify \n     shall be served on a witness sufficiently in advance of his \n     or her scheduled appearance to allow the witness a reasonable \n     period of time, as determined by the Committee, to prepare \n     for the hearing and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right To Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\n     that the statement tends to adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions, \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible, unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly but \n     the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee, within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   Rule 6: Subpoenas and Depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of subpoena: The Committee, by recorded vote \n     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for \n     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons authorized to take depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n       (4) Deposition procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) Filing of depositions: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n   Rule 7: Violations of Law; Perjury; Legislative Recommendations; \n   Educational Mandate; and Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct\n\n       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of \n     law, including the provision of false information to the \n     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible \n     violation to the proper Federal and state authorities.\n       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such \n     preliminary inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a \n     report or resolution, including the holding of hearings in \n     public or executive session and the use of subpoenas to \n     compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     materials. The Committee may make legislative recommendations \n     as a result of its findings in a preliminary inquiry, \n     adjudicatory review, or other proceeding.\n       (d) Educational Mandate; The Committee shall develop and \n     implement programs and materials designed to educate Members, \n     officers, and employees about the laws, rules, regulations, \n     and standards of conduct applicable to such individuals in \n     the performance of their duties.\n       (e) Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code.\n       (2) The Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct if \n     the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was in \n     effect and the violation was not a matter resolved in the \n     merits by the predecessor Committee.\n\n\n  Rule 8: Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified \n                               Materials\n\n       (a) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive Materials:\n       (1) Committee Sensitive information or material is \n     information or material in the possession of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics which pertains to illegal or improper \n     conduct by a present or former Member, officer, or employee \n     of the Senate; to allegations or accusations of such conduct; \n     to any resulting preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or \n     other proceeding by the Select Committee on Ethics into such \n     allegations or conduct; to the investigative techniques and \n     procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics; or to the \n     information or material designated by the staff director, or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of Committee Sensitive information in \n     the possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for \n     protecting Committee Sensitive materials shall be in writing \n     and shall be given to each Committee staff member.\n       (b) Procedures for Handling Classified Materials:\n       (1) Classified information or material is information or \n     material which is specifically designated as classified under \n     the authority of Executive Order 11652 requiring protection \n     of such information or material from unauthorized disclosure \n     in order to prevent damage to the United States.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the \n     possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedure for \n     handling such information shall be in writing and a copy of \n     the procedures shall be given to each staff member cleared \n     for access to classified information.\n       (3) Each member of the Committee shall have access to \n     classified material in the Committee's possession. Only \n     Committee staff members with appropriate security clearances \n     and a need-to-know, as approved by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, acting jointly, shall have access to classified \n     information in the Committee's possession.\n       (c) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and \n     Classified Documents:\n       (1) Committee Sensitive documents and materials shall be \n     stored in the Committee's offices, with appropriate \n     safeguards for maintaining the security of such documents or \n     materials. Classified documents and materials shall be \n     further segregated in the Committee's offices in secure \n     filing safes. Removal from the Committee offices of such \n     documents or materials is prohibited except as necessary for \n     use in, or preparation for, interviews or Committee meetings, \n     including the taking of testimony, or as otherwise \n     specifically approved by the staff director or by outside \n     counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) Each member of the Committee shall have access to all \n     materials in the Committee's possession. The staffs of \n     members shall not have access to Committee Sensitive or \n     classified documents and materials without the specific \n     approval in each instance of the Chairman, and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Members may examine such materials in the \n     Committee's offices. If necessary, requested materials may be \n     hand delivered by a member of the Committee staff to the \n     member of the Committee, or to a staff person(s) specifically \n     designated by the member, for the Member's or designated \n     staffer's examination. A member of the Committee who has \n     possession of Committee Sensitive documents or materials \n     shall take appropriate safeguards for maintaining the \n     security of such documents or materials in the possession of \n     the Member or his or her designated staffer.\n       (3) Committee Sensitive documents that are provided to a \n     Member of the Senate in connection with a complaint that has \n     been filed against the Member shall be hand delivered to the \n     Member or to the Member's Chief of Staff or Administrative \n     Assistant.

The Committee shall decide by majority \n     vote whether to make documents or materials available. If \n     access is granted, the Member shall not disclose the \n     information except as authorized by the Committee.\n       (5) Whenever the Committee makes Committee Sensitive or \n     classified documents or materials available to any Member of \n     the Senate who is not a member of the Committee, or to a \n     staff person of a Committee member in response to a specific \n     request to the Chairman and Vice Chairman, a written record \n     shall be made identifying the Member of the Senate requesting \n     such documents or materials and describing what was made \n     available and to whom.\n       (d) Non-Disclosure Policy and Agreement:\n       (1) Except as provided in the last sentence of this \n     paragraph, no member of the Select Committee on Ethics, its \n     staff or any person\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform services for the \n     Select Committee on Ethics shall release, divulge, publish, \n     reveal by writing, word, conduct, or disclose in any way, in \n     whole, or in part, or by way of summary, during tenure with \n     the Select Committee on Ethics or anytime thereafter, any \n     testimony given before the Select Committee on Ethics in \n     executive session (including the name of any witness who \n     appeared or was called to appear in executive session), any \n     classified or Committee Sensitive information, document or \n     material, received or generated by the Select Committee on \n     Ethics or any classified or Committee Sensitive information \n     which may come into the possession of such person during \n     tenure with the Select Committee on Ethics or its staff.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nin mourning the death of our former colleague from California, Senator \nAlan Cranston. The nation lost a truly remarkable man last December.\n  Senator Alan Cranston had a long and effective career of public \nservice spanning six decades, including 24 years as a United States \nSenator. He first entered public service in 1942 as Chief of the \nForeign Language Division of the Office of War Information in the \nExecutive Offices of the President. This began his very productive life \nof public service.\n  I served side-by-side with Senator Cranston for six years. In those \nsix years alone he had his hand in many fundamental pieces of \nlegislation. For example he produced the Cranston-Gonzales National \nAffordable Housing Act of 1990, the first major piece of housing \nlegislation in a decade. He was also the original author of the \nCalifornia Desert Protection Act, which was enacted in 1993. Throughout \nhis long career, Senator Cranston was a true advocate for the \nenvironment, civil rights, and world peace.\n  Whether one agreed or disagreed with Alan Cranston's views, we here \nin the Senate will always remember him for his integrity and \ndedication. Alan Cranston fought tirelessly for his beliefs, no matter \nwhat the consequence. Yet he was also kind, energetic, and thoughtful.\n  Put simply, I admired and respected Senator Alan Cranston. I would \nnow like to take this opportunity to extend my thoughts and prayers to \nhis sister Eleanor Cranston, his son Kim, his daughter-in-law Collette \nPenne Cranston, his granddaughter Evan Cranston, and to his remaining \nfriends, family and staff. We will all miss him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when I heard that my friend, Alan \nCranston,\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\npassed away this New Year's Eve, I couldn't quite believe it. I \nremember Alan as a man in a constant state of motion, always pressing \non for the causes he cared for, plotting the next steps, pondering how \nhe could do more. It is hard to reconcile the finality of death with \nthe endless, focused energy that defined his life.\n  Alan's record of service spans the better part of the twentieth \ncentury. He was a journalist who covered World War II, an author who \nwarned Americans about the threat of Hitler, a leader of an \norganization that opposed discrimination against immigrants, long \nbefore that was fashionable.\n  He revived the California Democratic party in the 1950's, was the \nCalifornia state controller in the 1960's, and served his first term in \nthe United States Senate in the 1970's. He was a Senator for 24 years, \nincluding seven consecutive terms as Democratic whip, and he even made \na run for the Presidency in 1984. And since his retirement from the \nSenate in 1993, Alan had dedicated himself to the cause he cared about \nmost; eliminating nuclear weapons.\n  If you didn't know Alan, his impressive list of accomplishments might \nlead you to think that he must have been a man of great showmanship and \nobvious charisma. But that wasn't Alan.\n  Alan believed in the philosophy of Lao-tzu: ``A leader is best when \npeople barely know that he exists. But of a good leader, when his work \nis done, his aim fulfilled, they will all say, `We did this ourselves.' \n'' Accordingly, Alan did a lot of his work behind the scenes. He had \nneither the time nor the patience for back-slapping and schmoozing: he \nliked to cut to the chase, let you know what was what, and move on to \nthe next thing.\n  Alan was never loud or arrogant or flashy. He didn't have to be. His \nauthority came from a force deeper than personality. It came from his \nconscience.\n  The anti-war activist, Father Daniel Berrigan, once talked about the \ndanger of ``verbalizing . . . moral impulses out of existence.'' That \nwas never within the realm of possibility for Alan. Whether he was \nstanding up for veterans, working to save millions of acres of desert \nand wilderness, or speaking out for nuclear disarmament, Alan \nsteadfastly followed his conscience, even when it led him to the \nuncharted paths or difficult places where no one else would go.\n  I don't know whether it was the result of this active conscience or \nhis fierce intellect or some combination of the two, but Alan had this \nextraordinary prescience, this ability to predict with startling \naccuracy what the future would bring. He understood the threat of Adolf \nHitler long before many others, and he worked to warn us before it was \ntoo late. He fought discrimination against immigrants, long before most \nof us realized that was the right thing to do. He spoke out about \nnuclear weapons long before the disarmament movement took root in the \npopular imagination.\n  And he believed in the notion of uniform world law decades before the \nrise of the global age. In fact, many decades ago, he was the leader of \nthe World Federalist Association, a group dedicated to the idea of \nestablishing a uniform world law. Back then, the WFA must have seemed \nlike a somewhat eccentric organization, oddly out of synch with the \ntimes.\n  But it was vintage Alan, just another manifestation of his profound \nidealism. Alan really believed that people of all different \nnationalities and races and ethnicities could rise to meet the standard \nof a just rule of law.\n  Alan once said of nuclear deterrence: ``This may have been necessary \nduring the cold war; it is not necessary forever. It is not acceptable \nforever. I say it is unworthy of our nation, unworthy of any nation; it \nis unworthy of civilization.''\n  Alan had the highest hopes for our world. We owe it to him to try to \nlive up to them and to carry out his legacy of peace in the new \nmillennium he did not live to see.\n  In conclusion, I ask that a recent article from Roll Call on Alan \nCranston by Daniel Perry appear in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Dan Perry, a former staffer for Alan Cranston, is a leader in his own \nright. For years he has been on the forefront of aging and health \npolicy as head of the Alliance for Aging Research. His remarks reflect \nhis deep admiration for Senator Cranston and his commitment to the \nSenator's lofty ideals.\n  The article is as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, Jan. 4, 2001]\n\n   Cranston Legacy Serves as Model for Members of the 107th Congress\n\n                           (By Daniel Perry)\n\n       The sharply divided 107th Congress would do well to ponder \n     the quiet but enduringly effective political skills of the \n     late Sen. Alan Cranston (D) of California. His 24-year Senate \n     career, during tumultuous and partisan times, showed that \n     strong beliefs make good politics, but success begins with \n     respecting the motives and sincerity of others, including \n     your opponents.\n       Cranston's sudden death, just hours before the first day of \n     2001, ended a life devoted to issues about which he was \n     passionate: International peace and arms control, human \n     rights and protection of the environment. For this \n     Californian the quest for high public office--even the United \n     States Senate--was never a simple pursuit of power nor an end \n     in itself.\n       Politics and policy were the means by which he could help \n     make the human passage on earth fairer, safer and more \n     serene. His commitment to halting future use of nuclear \n     weapons began when he was introduced to Albert Einstein in \n     1946. He was still working tirelessly toward that goal when \n     he died, at age 86, eight years after he left the Senate.\n       In the shorthand of the obituary writer, Cranston is \n     remembered for winning four Senate elections, serving seven \n     consecutive terms as Democratic Whip, for having run for \n     president as the champion of a nuclear freeze and for being \n     tarred by the so-called Keating Five scandal. While all true, \n     that doesn't begin to describe a political career of amazing \n     productivity and accomplishment, showing just how much one \n     person quietly can do to shape his or her times.\n       By one count, there were 2,500 tallies in the Senate \n     between 1969 and 1989 that were decided by fewer than five \n     votes, and often by a single vote. Cranston was often a \n     crucial player, not only for his vote alone but as a behind-\n     the-scene strategist, head counter, marshaler of forces and \n     shrewd compromiser who always lived to fight another day.\n       He was frequently one-half of various Senate odd-couple \n     pairings, meshing his principles with pragmatism. He teamed \n     with conservative Senators such as Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) to \n     improve veterans programs, Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) on public \n     housing measures and the legendary Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) \n     to protect press freedoms guaranteed under the First \n     Amendment.\n       Cranston was liberal and an idealist to the core, but never \n     an ideologue or blindly partisan. That balance enabled him to \n     become one of the most durable and successful California \n     politicians of the 20th century. He was elected six times to \n     statewide office from California.\n       Representing the West Coast megastate in the Senate meant \n     skillfully balancing myriad insistent and often conflicting \n     home-state interests. Even as California changed politically \n     and demographically, Cranston managed to steer a delicate \n     course between the state's giant agribusiness interests and \n     those of consumers, family farmers and farm workers; he \n     weighed the claims of home builders and growing communities \n     against the need to preserve open spaces and wildlife \n     habitats.\n       Amazingly, he helped end the Vietnam War and was a major \n     figure in the nation's arms control and peace movements, even \n     as he effectively represented the epicenter of the nation's \n     defense and aerospace industries.\n       It is a measure of the man that he was able to separate the \n     warriors of Vietnam from the war itself. From 1969 to 1992 \n     all legislation concerning America's veterans bore his stamp, \n     especially measures improving health care and mental health \n     services for those who fought in the nation's most unpopular \n     war.\n       Teaming up with the late Rep. Phillip Burton (D) of San \n     Francisco on environmental issues, the two Californians \n     managed to place under federal protection as much acreage as \n     all the national park lands created earlier in the 20th \n     century combined.\n       Today there is a catalog of thousands of bills and \n     amendments he personally authored affecting virtually every \n     aspect of national life: civil rights, adoption and foster \n     care reform, wild rivers, research to improve aging and \n     longevity, workplace safety, emergency medical services and \n     much more.\n       He lived by the maxim that a leader can accomplish great \n     things if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.\n       The Cranston style has not been much in evidence in \n     Washington during recent years. However, Members in the 107th \n     Congress--where many a cause will be determined by one or \n     very few votes--would do well to consider the lessons of his \n     enabling career. If they study the Cranston legacy and seek \n     to emulate it, the nation and the world will be better for \n     it.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Kim, Colette, Evan, R.E.--let me begin by \nsaying I loved Alan too. I will never forget the 24 years of friendship \nand leadership and achievement with which he graced the Senate and the \nnation. So it's a special privilege and honor for\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nme to be part of this tribute today. Alan is profoundly missed by his \nfamily and friends, his colleagues in the Congress, and by all those \naround the world who pursue the great goals of hope and progress and \npeace.\n  I must say, I grew up thinking Cranston was a city in Rhode Island. \nBut Alan taught each of us that Cranston stands for something else as \nwell, the very best in public service.\n  Alan loved to lead behind the scenes, for 14 of those 24 Senate years \nwith us, he was our Democratic whip, and he wrote the book about the \njob. In those great years, we used to tease Alan about the position, \nbecause so few people outside Congress knew what it involved. Since \nAlan was from California, a lot of people thought the Minority Whip was \nthe name of a Leather Bar in Malibu.\n  But seriously, Alan was a giant of his day on many issues, and his \nconcern for social justice made him a leader on them all. We served \ntogether for many years on the Labor Committee and especially the \nHealth Subcommittee, and his insights were indispensable. I always felt \nthat if we'd had another Alan Cranston or two in those years, we'd have \nactually passed our Health Security Act, and made health care the basic \nright for all that it ought to be, instead of just an expensive \nprivilege for the few.\n  Perhaps the greatest legacy that Alan left us was his able and \ntireless work for democracy and world peace. Every village in the world \nis closer to that goal today because of Alan. No one in the Senate \nfought harder or more effectively for our nuclear weapons freeze in the \n1980's, or for nuclear arms control. His hope for a nuclear-free future \nstill represents the highest aspiration of millions, even billions, \nthroughout the world.\n  I also recall Alan's pioneering efforts to press for Senate action to \nend the war in Vietnam, and his equally able leadership for civil \nrights at home and human rights around the world. We know how deeply he \nfelt about injustice to anyone anywhere. His leadership in the battle \nagainst apartheid in South Africa was indispensable.\n  Throughout his brilliant career, the causes of civil rights and human \nrights were central to Alan's being and his mission--and America and \nthe world are better off today because Alan Cranston passed this way.\n  A key part of all his achievements was his unique ability to \ntranslate his ideals into practical legislation. Few if any Senators \nhave been as skilled as Alan in the art of constructive legislative \ncompromise that fairly leads to progress for the Nation.\n  He was a vigorous supporter of the Peace Corps, a strong overseer of \nits performance, and a brilliant advocate for all the Peace Corps \nVolunteers. He was a champion for health coverage of returning \nVolunteers, and one of the first to understand that good health \ncoverage had to include mental health services too.\n  In many ways, his first love was the Peace Corps, and I know that \nPresident Kennedy would have been very proud of him. Even before he \ncame to the Senate, he had his first contact with the Corps, as a \nconsultant for Sargent Shriver. As Alan often said, he became involved \nbecause he was so inspired by my brother's vision of a world where \nAmericans of all ages could work side-by-side with peoples throughout \nthe world to put an end to poverty.\n  Because of Alan, the Peace Corps today is thriving as never before--\nfree of the partisan tensions that divide us on other issues, spreading \ninternational understanding of Alan's and America's best ideals, \neducating new generations of young Americans about our common heritage \nas travelers on spaceship earth, teaching us about the beauty, the \nrichness, and the diversity of other peoples, other languages, and \nother cultures and about the enduring importance of the greatest \npursuit of all, the pursuit of peace.\n  Near the end of John Bunyan's ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' there is a \npassage that tells of the death of Valiant:\n\n       Then, he said, I am going to my Father's. And though with \n     great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not regret me \n     of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My \n     sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, \n     and my courage and skill to him that can get it. My marks and \n     scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me, that I have \n     fought his battle who now will be my rewarder.\n       When the day that he must go hence was come, many \n     accompanied him to the riverside, into which as he went, he \n     said, `Death, where is thy sting?' and as he went down \n     deeper, he said, `Grave, where is thy victory?' So he passed \n     over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.\n\n  We loved you, Alan. We miss you. And we always will.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is a special privilege to join all of \nyou today to honor the life and extraordinary accomplishments of Alan \nCranston.\n  As we all know, Alan was a sprinter and--always with an incredible \nmischievous twinkle in his eye he sprinted through life. I think one of \nthe most enduring images of him is of Alan on the eve of the Iowa \ncaucuses in 1984 at the Holiday Inn in Keokuk, Iowa, sprinting \nbarefooted down the 40-meter hallway, walking back and repeating the \nexercise for about 40 minutes. It was no coincidence that Alan's \nfavorite hotel in the country, Chicago's O'Hare Hilton, boasts 250-\nmeter hallways.\n  Three weeks ago in California we shared a goodbye to our friend, this \nsprinter, at a memorial service--calling to mind the many ways he \nenriched public lives and personal relationships.\n  There in the Grace Cathedral, we heard Colette Cranston say that in \ndeath Alan Cranston ``has become my Jiminy Cricket--that little voice \nin her conscience that says, `Colette, think before you leap.' '' It \nwould not be an exaggeration to say that warning was characteristic of \nAlan when he served here in the United States Senate. He wanted us to \nlook, and he wanted us to leap. He implored us to put a human face on \npublic policy--to think not in statistics and numbers and programs \nalone, but in terms of people: and the people he spoke of most often \nwere senior citizens, children, those without decent housing, \nimmigrants, and those in need of a helping hand regardless of race or \nreligion. He was a moral voice, a voice of conscience, someone who \nunderstood that even as he remained vigilant defending the needs of the \nhomefront in California, he was also a global citizen who knew this \ninstitution had global responsibilities.\n  Through four terms as a United States Senator, he remained a man of \nenormous humility on his answering machine he was simply ``Alan''--as \nhe was to so many who knew him. This personal sense of place and \nrestraint made it easy to underestimate the contributions he made to \nthe Senate, and to our country. Certainly he never paused long enough \nto personally remind us of the impact of his service, of the history he \nwas a part of and the lives he touched.\n  I first met Alan in 1971 when I had returned from Vietnam and many of \nour veterans were part of an effort to end a failed American policy in \nVietnam. In Alan Cranston we found one of the few Senators willing not \njust to join in the public opposition to the war in Vietnam, but to \nbecome a voice of healing for the veterans of the war a statesman whose \nleadership enabled others, over time, to separate their feelings for \nthe war from their feelings for the veterans of the war. At a time when \ntoo many wanted to disown its veterans, Alan offered Vietnam veterans a \nwarm embrace. He was eager to do something all too rare in Washington: \nlisten--and he listened to veterans who had much to say, much of it \nignored for too long. He honored their pride and their pain with \nsensitivity and understanding.\n  That's when I first saw the great energy and commitment Alan brought \nto the issues affecting veterans, especially those of the Vietnam era. \nHe was deeply involved on veterans' health care issues, among the first \nto fight for recognition of post-Vietnam stress syndrome, and a leader \nin insisting on coverage under the V.A. for its treatment. When the \nAgent Orange issue came to the fore, Alan insisted on getting answers \nfrom an unresponsive government about the consequences of exposure to \ndioxin, making sure that veterans and their families got the health \ncare they needed. Under his leadership Congress grudgingly increased GI \nBill benefits for Vietnam veterans--veterans who too often had to fight \nfor benefits they should have been guaranteed without question--indeed, \nfor veterans who had to fight if only to have a memorial and if only to \nhave the government recognize that they fought in a war and not a \npolice conflict Alan's leadership made all the difference. It is\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\na sad truth in our country's history that a weary Nation seemed eager \nto turn its back on so many Vietnam veterans who simply sought their \ndue; it should forever be a source of pride to the Cranston family that \nAlan was chief among those who insisted that America honor that service \nand keep faith with sons who left pieces of themselves and years of \ntheir lives on the battlefield in that far-away Nation.\n\n  This was a man who fought with the greatest of passion for those who \nhad fought in a difficult war--even as he was also the Senator who \nfought against all that war represents--remembering that war, \nbrutality, and killing are the ultimate failure of diplomacy.\n  Alan Cranston was above all a man of peace. With him it was not just \na policy but a passion. Remember: This was a man who, in 1934, found \nhimself in the same room as Adolf Hitler. Five years later, he wrote a \ncritical English translation of Adolf Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' in an \neffort to reveal the German leader's true plans. He wore Hitler's \nensuing lawsuit as a badge of honor, proud that he had stood up to try \nand warn the English-speaking world about the evils of Nazism.\n  Throughout the rest of his service he used public office to force \nAmericans to listen to other prescient warnings--about nuclear arms, \nabout a dangerous arms race spiraling beyond our control, and about \nhopes for peace that he refused to give up even as others chose to beat \nthe drums for war.\n  Senator Cranston came to his famous commitment to arms control after \nmeeting with Albert Einstein in 1946. He left that meeting convinced \nthat the threat of atomic weapons had to be stemmed--and he spent the \nbalance of his life arguing that conviction before the Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate leadership and a senior voice on the \nDemocratic side of the Foreign Relations Committee he worked to reduce \nthe nuclear threat. One of his most important efforts was one of the \nleast publicized. Throughout the 1970s and the 1980's, Alan convened a \nunique arms control study group the ``SALT Study Group''. This \nsenators-only gathering met monthly in his office, off the record, and \nface to face to define common ground. He knew the impact quiet \ndiplomacy could have on the issues he cared about most of all.\n  He loved what the Peace Corps does, and he fought for it. He fought \nto attach human rights conditions on aid to El Salvador and to halt \ncontra aid. He was a leading national advocate for a mutual verifiable \nnuclear freeze. He was always an idealist whose increase in political \npower was always met by progress for the issues he cared about so \ndeeply. It was not just the work of a career, but of a lifetime--after \nhe left the Senate he chaired the State of the World Forum and joined \nwith former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as chairman of the \nGorbachev Foundation/USA and in 1999, he founded the Global Security \nInstitute.\n  He did that because he sensed that the end of the Cold War, with all \nthe opportunity it afforded, created a more dangerous world, with aging \nnuclear weapons in increasingly disparate and unreliable hands. He was \nhaunted by the threat of nuclear terrorism. He was passionate about the \nnuclear test ban treaty and was angry when it went down to a shallow \nand partisan defeat in the Senate. We missed his voice in that debate; \nwe miss him still more today.\n  When he left the Senate, Alan reflected upon his service and his \naccomplishments. Of his lasting legacy, he said simply: ``Most of all, \nI have dedicated myself to the cause of peace.''\n  That dedication was real and lasting--a legacy of peace for a good \nand peaceful man who gave living embodiment to Culbertson's simple, \nstubborn faith that ``God and the politicians willing, the United \nStates can declare peace upon the world, and win it.'' That belief was \nAlan Cranston and it is a belief worth fighting for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1581-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1581-S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOME HEALTH CARE STABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a cosponsor \nto the Home Health Care Stability Act of 2001. I commend the leadership \nof my friends Senator Collins and Senator Bond and I am pleased to join \nmy many other colleagues in support of this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  This bill is two-fold, it will permanently eliminate the automatic 15 \npercent reduction in Medicare payments to home health agencies that is \ncurrently scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2002 and will also \nextend the temporary 10 percent add-on payment for home health patients \nin rural areas to ensure that these patients continue to have access to \nmuch-needed care.\n  Times are rapidly changing. Today more than ever, patients are \nspending less time in the hospital. More and more, we are seeing \nprocedures done on an outpatient basis, with recovery and care for \npatients with chronic conditions taking place in the home. In addition, \nin my State of Montana, for example, the number of elderly who are \nchronically ill or disabled continues to grow. How do we care properly \nand compassionately for these individuals? As our population ages, the \nanswer to this question becomes more and more important.\n  Increasingly, the answer for many is home health care. Home health \ncare is an important part of Medicare in which seniors and the disabled \ncan get the care they need, where they want it: in the comfort and \nsecurity of their own homes. Additionally, home health care is a \nnecessity because, for many, their health or physical condition makes \nit almost impossible to leave home. Not only is it convenient, but much \nmore importantly, patients love it. They love it because home health \ncare allows seniors and others with disabilities a feeling of \nindependence and dignity, despite their illnesses. Often home health is \nan alternative to more expensive services in hospitals, and, thus, is a \ncost-effective alternative to providing care.\n  However, folks, there is a home health care crisis--too many seniors \nand disabled who should be receiving health care services at home are \nnot getting it. This is wrong. Many of our most frail and vulnerable \nhave had to be repeatedly hospitalized with problems that could have \nbeen avoided had they been continuing to receive their home health \nbenefits. Others are trying to pay for the care themselves, often on \nvery limited means. Some are going without care altogether.\n\n  By the late 1990s, home health care was the fastest growing component \nof Medicare spending, growing at an average of 26 percent annually. We \nall know what happened next--in an effort to balance the budget and \nmake the home health program more cost-effective and efficient, \nCongress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, tried to cut the \ngrowth in Medicare spending. Unfortunately, the real results of this \naction went much farther than we intended, in large part because of \nfaulty implementation and excessive regulatory requirements of the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, HCFA. As the cuts and regulations \nspun out-of-control, health care providers struggled to survive, while \nmany were forced to close their doors entirely. Ultimately, patients \nsuffered the most. This story applies to patients and providers in all \nparts of Medicare, hospitals, nursing homes, home health care \nproviders, everyone.\n  Now, on the horizon, is yet another 15-percent cut that would put \nmany of our already struggling home health agencies at risk and would \nseriously jeopardize access to critical home health services for \nmillions of our Nation's seniors. In my State of Montana, access to \nhome health care is already a problem for many, we cannot make this \nproblem worse. Home health and, most importantly, the patients who \ndepend on its services cannot afford this. We must act now.\n  I am indeed proud that last year we passed legislation, the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and S-CHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act, which \nprovided some relief to struggling home health agencies. However, I do \nnot think that it went far enough. First, we must eliminate the 15 \npercent cut completely. The simple fact is that an additional 15 \npercent cut in Medicare home health payments would spell death for \nthose low-cost agencies which are currently struggling to hang on, and \nit would further reduce seniors' access to critical home care services. \nWe have already delayed this 15 percent cut three times--the time has \ncome to do away with it once and for all. Secondly, we must also make \npermanent\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nthe temporary 10 percent add-on for home health services furnished \npatients in rural areas. This, too, was included in last year's \nlegislation, this bill would make it permanent.\n  In Montana, we know too well how very expensive it is for home health \nagencies to deliver services to rural patients. They have to travel \nlong distances, and it takes a long time to reach those patients. That \nall adds to the cost.\n  The Home Health Care Stability Act will provide essential relief for \nour home health agencies that are struggling to make ends meet. I am \nproud to add my name as a cosponsor of this important piece of \nlegislation. I hope we can get quick action on this bill to ensure that \nseniors and the disabled have appropriate access to quality home health \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1582-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PUBLIC MEDAL OF VALOR ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Public Safety \nOfficer Medal of Valor Act, S. 39, which was introduced by Senator \nStevens. I thank him for his hard work on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I supported and cosponsored the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor \nAct in the last Congress as well. I was disappointed that this \nlegislation did not become law then. In April and May, 1999, I made \nsure that the Senate acted on this bill. On April 22, 1999, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee took up that measure in regular order and reported \nit unanimously. At that time I congratulated Senator Stevens for \nintroducing the measure and thanked him for his leadership. I noted \nthat we had worked together on a number of law enforcement matters and \nthat the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart supporter of the men \nand women who put themselves at risk to protect us all. I said that I \nlooked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing the \nextraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional \nofficers recognized with the Medal of Valor.\n  On May 18, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took \nthat occasion to commend Senator Stevens and all who had worked so hard \nto move this measure in a timely way. That was during National Police \nWeek nearly two years ago. The measure was sent to the House of \nRepresentatives where it lay dormant for the remainder of the 106th \nCongress.\n  Instead, the House, in the last Congress, insisted that the Senate \ntake up, fix and pass the House-passed version of this measure, H.R. \n46, if it were to become law. House members indicated that they were \nprepared to accept most of the Senate-passed text, but insisted that it \nbe enacted under the House bill number. In order to get this important \nmeasure to the President, we did that on December 15, 2000. We \ndischarged the House-passed version of that bill from the Judiciary \nCommittee, adopting a complete substitute, and sent it back to the \nHouse. Unfortunately, the House failed to act on our good faith effort \nlast year, and the Public Medal of Valor was never enacted.\n  This year, I have again worked with Senator Stevens, Senator Hatch, \nand others to get this important bill passed. I urge my colleagues to \nwork towards improvements to ensure that the Medal of Valor Board will \nwork effectively and efficiently with the National Medal of Valor \nOffice within the Department of Justice. Our legislation should \nestablish both of these entities. It is essential that they work well \ntogether to design the Medal of Valor and to create the criteria and \nprocedures for recommendations of nominees for the award. The men and \nwomen who will be honored by the Medal of Valor for their brave deeds \ndeserve nothing less. I hope the Senate will quickly act on these \nchanges to this important measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1582-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1582-S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I'd like to make a few comments today in \nrecognition of Black History Month. For a quarter-century, our country \nhas held the month of February in special regard as a time to remember \nand reflect on the rich history and extraordinary achievements of \nAfrican Americans. Today, I would like to speak about some important \nand influential African Americans from my home State of Massachusetts.\n  The diversity we celebrate during this month encompasses many areas. \nAfrican-American leaders should be recognized not only for their \nachievements in the face of racial discrimination, but for the \naccomplishments they have made in a wide variety of occupations. \nDiversity stretches beyond race and crosses into gender, age, and \noccupation. The following men and women cover a wide spectrum of \ninterests, eras, and accomplishments, and each has made a significant \ncontribution to the Massachusetts community.\n  In 1845, Macon B. Allen became the first African American officially \nadmitted to the bar, and he practiced law for many years in Worcester, \nMassachusetts before moving to South Carolina, where he became one of \nthe first black Federal judges in the Nation. Mr. Allen set a precedent \nthat opened many doors for the minority attorneys and judges who \nfollowed in his footsteps.\n  Dr. W.E.B DuBois has long been recognized as a figure of leadership \nin African-American history. Dr. Dubois fought racism through words, \nwriting in such publications as the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People journal. He approached civil rights \nboldly, advocating the eradication of all distinctions on the basis of \nrace or color. Throughout the early half of the 20th century, DuBois \nsought this ideal, in his words, ``to obtain without compromise such \nrights and privileges as belonged to members of civilization of which \nhe was a part.''\n  John Thomas, an athlete from Massachusetts, truly soared above his \ncompetition. As a freshman at Boston University, Thomas established a \nnew world record for the high jump at 7 feet, 1\\1/4\\ inches in 1959. As \nthe first athlete to consistently jump more than 7 feet, Thomas went on \nto break his own record twice. He represented America in the 1960 \nSummer Olympics in Rome, medaling in the high jump. In addition to his \nathletic activities, Thomas served his local community as a leader in \nseveral organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America and the \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  Dorothy West was heralded as ``the last living member of the Harlem \nRenaissance'' until her death in 1998. Despite her ties to the New York \nartists' movement, her roots in Massachusetts run deep. Ms. West was \nborn near Martha's Vineyard and spent nearly her entire life there. Ms. \nWest became an award-winning writer when she was still a teenager, and \nshe started and edited several literary magazines that focused on black \nwriters of the era. She returned to Martha's Vineyard to finish her \nfirst novel, The Living is Easy, published in 1948, and to write her \nsecond novel, The Wedding, later published in 1995.\n  These stories provide meaningful snapshot of how African Americans \nhave contributed greatly to Massachusetts and our Nation. Their \ntriumphs, along with the everyday achievements of African-Americans in \nmy state, should be applauded. I am proud that my State has such a \nrichly diverse history and I'm pleased we have set aside this month to \ncommemorate these accomplished individuals. I hope as a Nation we will \nremember these achievements not only this month, but everyday.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of this \nyear's Black History Month theme, ``Creating and Defining the African \nAmerican Community: Family, Church, Politics and Culture.'' I would \nlike to note that while we take time in February to recall the \ncontributions, accomplishments and services that our fellow citizens \nhave rendered, it is important to remember that the contributions of \nAfrican Americans to America happen everyday in every walk of life.\n  Moreover, in our review of these vital contributions, we are called \nupon to acknowledge the courage, talent, determination, leadership and \nvision of those men, women and children who made an impact in the face \nof incredible obstacles.\n  This year's theme, I believe, is fundamental not only in defining the \nAfrican American community, but the American community at large. The \nstruggle for a better America begins with each individual and his or \nher call to civic\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\nduty. The historical context of building a better America begins with \ngaining a deeper understanding of our history and how our social \nenvironment has been shaped.\n  The civil rights movement helped our Nation, and particularly our \ngovernment, recognize that universal participation and rights are \nenjoined upon all citizens, regardless of the color of their skin. One \nof the many lessons that can be gleaned from this movement is that it \nis our duty as Americans to embrace the diverse elements of our society \nso that future generations can see themselves in our Nation's past and \nrealize that they have a role to play in seizing the future's countless \nopportunities.\n  In acknowledging the various elements of the African American \ncommunity of Family, Church, Politics and Culture, I would like to \nacknowledge a few of the outstanding contributions of African Americans \nin the state of Minnesota. Their efforts have helped shape the social, \neconomic and political landscape of that vibrant community as well as \nthe community at large.\n  Just recently, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp in its \nPostal Service's Black Heritage commemorative series. This stamp \ncommemorates the life and accomplishments of one of the great leaders \nof the civil rights movement, Mr. Roy Wilkins, who grew up in St. Paul \nand attended the University of Minnesota. In 1931 he was appointed \nassistant executive secretary of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, NAACP, the largest civil rights \norganization in the U.S. From 1934 to 1949 he was editor of The Crisis, \nthe official magazine of the NAACP. Wilkins served as a consultant to \nthe War Department on black employment during World War II. After the \nwar he continued his service to the NAACP; he was executive secretary \nfrom 1955 to 1965 and executive director from 1965 until his retirement \nin 1977. He played a major role in the preparation of Brown versus \nBoard of Education of Topeka, 1954, and was one of the organizers of \nthe March on Washington in 1963. It is only fitting that the legacy of \na man of such integrity, vision, and deep conviction is given tribute \nthrough this special recognition. His leadership and dedication to the \ncivil rights cause is exemplary.\n  I am proud to honor the religious community not only for their \nspiritual guidance of the African American community, but also for \ntheir unwavering efforts to improve the quality of life in our cities \nand state. The Coalition of Black Churches in Minneapolis and the St. \nPaul Ministerial Alliance truly have made a difference in the community \nwith their outreach on behalf of their congregations and community, \nthrough their experience and sacrifice, through their political will \nwith their legislative agendas, and most importantly, through their \nleadership and exemplary behavior. They are not simply preaching the \nmeaning of values, family and community service, they are also showing \nus.\n\n  In the arena of politics, Ms. Neva Walker became the first African \nAmerican woman to be elected to the Minnesota Legislature just last \nfall. Given the dispiriting level of civic participation in our society \ntoday, I truly am appreciative of the vision and leadership that \nRepresentative Walker brings to her constituents and our state. I am \nhonored to know and work with Representative Walker. As the first \nAfrican American woman legislator in our state I know she will make \nimportant changes, provide needed leadership, and introduce legislation \nthat will greatly help many people.\n  Our community also is extremely privileged to have an organization \nwith the capacity and outreach of African American Family Services. For \n25 years, this organization has reached out to the community to provide \nculturally specific services and programs ranging from providing \ncritical services in clinical health, family preservation, domestic \nviolence, and adolescent violence prevention and anger management. In \naddition, this organization provides its clients and the community with \na resource center, which includes a resource library and a technical \nassistance center, which creates training programs to educate human \nresource professionals on enhancing service delivery to African \nAmerican clients.\n  A tribute to some of the heroes of the community would not be \ncomplete without a mention of two men who brought so much joy to the \nfans of the Minnesota Twins. Mr. Kirby Puckett and Mr. Dave Winfield, \nwho were both inducted into Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame, \nprovided Twins fans in Minnesota and around the country with some \nspectacular plays which will forever be in our memories. Aside from \ntheir outstanding professional accomplishments, both players continue \nto be exemplary role models and community leaders.\n  Let us take this opportunity to re-dedicate and re-invigorate \nourselves, as Americans, to the cause of working together to create a \nsociety which not only understands the concept of unity in diversity, \nbut lives it; which not only preaches economic justice, but implements \nit; that not only espouses equality of opportunity, but ensures it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1583-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JUNIOR RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on February 15th, I was pleased to join \nSenator Thurmond in introducing a bill that would remove current \nrestrictions preventing the expansion of the Junior Reserve Officers \nTraining Corps, JROTC. This bill would also address the shortage of \nJROTC instructors by expanding the qualifying criteria to National \nGuard and Reserve Officers. There is nearly unanimous agreement that \nJROTC is turning today's children into tomorrow's leaders. \nAdditionally, high school performance measures consistently indicate \nthat JROTC cadets attend class more frequently, are responsible for \nfewer disciplinary infractions, and are more likely to graduate. \nJROTC's blend of local, State, and Federal involvement has also been a \nmodel for good government, and it has sponsored teamwork not just in \nits cadets but also in the agencies responsible for the program. As \nmany members know, I have long been a supporter of the JROTC program, \nhaving secured $27 million in supplemental appropriation for JROTC in \n1999. By removing the current limitations on its expansion, we are \nenabling more students to participate in what has proven to be an \nexemplary program. The legislation would remove the congressionally-\nmandated ceiling of 3,500 JROTC units. It would also allow the Marine \nCorps to continue to expand their program which had previously been \ncapped at 210 units. All together the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine \nCorps have more than 2,700 school units totaling over 425,000 cadets, \nwith hundreds of schools nationwide on waiting lists for a JROTC \nprogram. JROTC has carried bipartisan support since Congress \nestablished it in 1926.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1583-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1583-S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NAVAL RESERVE'S 86TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on March 3rd we honor the 86th birthday \nof the United States Naval Reserve. Since 1915 the Naval Reserve has \nexemplified the highest virtues of loyalty, service, and sacrifice. \nThey have served and fought alongside their active duty comrades from \nthe Atlantic to the far reaches of the Pacific, to the jungles of \nVietnam and across the vast expanse of the Arabian desert as a battle-\ntested and skilled force that is the envy of the world.\n  Back in 1915, no one could have imagined the role that fledgling \nnaval reserve would play in supporting the Navy today. The term \n``Weekend Warrior'' no longer applies to these citizen-soldiers. As a \ntrained, professional and well-equipped cadre of dedicated men and \nwomen, they are a key component of everything the Navy does, both in \npeacetime and in war. Many of them have made the ultimate sacrifice in \nthe cause of freedom and we honor their memory.\n  They serve on ships, in squadrons, on staffs, and in hospitals \nperforming a myriad of tasks essential to mission accomplishment. \nSeamlessly integrated alongside their active-duty shipmates you cannot \ntell the difference between them. This is the reality of today's total \nforce and what enables our marvelous military to remain engaged around \nthe world.\n  They have a proud heritage and a bright future. In the spirit of the \nMinutemen of Lexington and Concord these great Americans stand ready to \nanswer their Nation's call at any time,\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\nand the world is a better place because of the sacrifice they and their \nfamilies make.\n  In my hometown of New Orleans, we are fortunate enough to be rich in \nNaval history and tradition. We are the proud home of the Naval Reserve \nHeadquarters where Rear Admiral John Totushek commands more than 88,000 \nreservists across the United States and around the world.\n  As we set out in this new century, the importance of the Naval \nReserve has never been more clear. Tomorrow, as today and for \ngenerations past, the razor sharp readiness of the United States Navy \nserves as a beacon to America's friends and a warning to our enemies, \npromising swift action, great victories and richer traditions yet to \ncome.\n  On this day, I offer warmest regards to all members of the Naval \nReserve, and to the families who also serve by supporting them. You \nrepresent all that is wonderful about our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TRIBUTE TO LEON KENISON UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Leon Kenison, an exemplary public official who dedicated himself \nto serving the people of New Hampshire for almost four decades. As \nCommissioner of the Department of Transportation since 1996, he has \nbrought to the office the professional skills and knowledge of the \npolitics and practice of road building so vital to an agency that \ntouches the lives of every person who lives in or visits the Granite \nState.\n  Leon began his career with the Department of Transportation in 1963, \na week before graduating from the University of New Hampshire. He is \nwidely respected for his transportation expertise at state, regional \nand national levels, and has chaired several key committees for the \nAmerican Association of State Highway Transportation Officials. During \nhis tenure with the DOT, Leon approached his work with a can-do \nattitude, and balanced what needs to be done with what can be done.\n  Throughout his career, Leon accomplished a great deal for \ntransportation in New Hampshire. The people of this state look upon him \nwith tremendous gratitude and admiration for all that he has done. I \nhave often sought Leon's support and expertise on transportation \nissues. We worked closely together to make sure that New Hampshire's \nneeds were met in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. \nUnder his leadership, the DOT not only secured funding to complete \nmajor highway projects including Route 101 and I-93, but also placed \nmore emphasis on environmental protection, car pools, express bus, rail \nand other new programs.\n  It is an honor and a privilege to serve Leon Kenison in the U.S. \nSenate and I wish him and his family godspeed in his retirement and in \nall of their future endeavors. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1584-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1584-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1584-S1586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-681.

A national park devoted to the history of \nthe steel industry will afford all Americans the opportunity to \ncelebrate this rich heritage, which is symbolic of the work ethic \nendemic to this great nation. There is no better place for such a site \nthan in southwestern Pennsylvania, which played a significant role in \nearly industrial America.\n  I have long supported efforts to preserve and enhance this historical \nsteel-related heritage through the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area, which \nincludes the City of Pittsburgh, and seven southwestern Pennsylvania \ncounties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Fayette, Greene, Washington and \nWestmoreland. I have been very pleased with congressional support for \nthe important work within the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area expressed \nthrough appropriations levels of $1 million annually since Fiscal Year \n1998. I am hopeful that this support will continue however, more than \njust resources are necessary. That is why I am introducing this \nimportant legislation today.\n  It is important to note why southwestern Pennsylvania should be the \nhome to the national park that my legislation authorizes. The \ncombination of a strong workforce, valuable natural\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nresources, and Pennsylvania's strategic location in the heavily \npopulated northeastern United States allowed the steel industry to \nthrive. Today, the remaining buildings and sites devoted to steel \nproduction are threatened with further deterioration or destruction. \nMany of these sites are nationally significant and perfectly suited for \nthe study and interpretation of this crucial period in our nation's \ndevelopment. Some of these sites include the Carrie Furnace complex, \nthe Hot Metal Bridge, and the Unites States Steel Homestead Works, \nwhich would all become a part of the Steel Industry National Historic \nPark under my legislation.\n  Highlights of such a national park would commemorate a wide range of \naccomplishments and topics for historical preservation and \ninterpretation from industrial process advancements to labor-management \nrelations. It is important to note that the site I seek to become a \nnational park under this bill includes the location of the Battle of \nHomestead, waged in 1892 between steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. The \nBattle of Homestead marked an important period in our nation's workers' \nrights movement. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, individuals, and \npublic and private entities have attempted to protect and preserve \nresources such as the Homestead battleground and the Hot Metal Bridge. \nFor the benefit and inspiration of present and future generations, it \nis time for the federal government to join this effort to recognize \ntheir importance with the additional protection I provide in this bill.\n  I would like to commend my colleague, Representative Mike Doyle, who \nhas been a longstanding leader in this preservation effort and who will \nsponsor the companion legislation in the House of Representatives. I \nlook forward to working with southwestern Pennsylvania officials and \nMr. August Carlino, Executive Director of the Steel Industry Heritage \nCorporation, in order to bring this national park to fruition. I urge \nmy colleagues in the United States Congress to cosponsor this \nlegislation and I will work for its swift passage. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Steel Industry National \n     Historic Park Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, a leading citizen of my State of North \nCarolina is a young man named Jim Goodmon. Jim is president and CEO of \nCapital Broadcasting Company in my hometown of Raleigh. Capital \nBroadcasting owns and operates several leading broadcast entities--TV \nstations, radio stations, and networks serving all of North Carolina \nand some bordering States.\n  James F. Goodmon is president and CEO of Capital Broadcasting \nCompany, where more than a quarter of a century ago I had the privilege \nof serving as an officer. When I was elected to the Senate in 1972, I \nshortly thereafter, as a Senator, divested myself of all ownership in \nthe company because Senators are often called upon to vote on \nlegislation affecting broadcasting and broadcasters.\n  At that time, in 1972-73, Jim Goodmon had just completed his studies \nat Duke University and had just married a lovely and very bright young \nTennessee lady--who, by the way, is herself prominent for her tireless \nwork in literally saving the lives of down-on-their-luck people who \nhave no place to go. She makes a place for them to go to rebuild \nthemselves and reshape their character.\n  Having said all that, my purpose in speaking in the Senate is a \nprofile on Jim Goodmon published in the December 13 edition of TV \nTechnology. That is the name of it. It is an industry publication whose \nspecialty is digital television. The headline on that article was ``Jim \nGoodmon: Mayberry Values Collide With Harsh DTV Reality.''\n  Now, this article, in my view, speaks well of Jim Goodmon, not merely \nregarding his business acumen, nor about the kind of businessman Jim \nis. I think it is, instead, a measurement of Jim Goodmon's sense of \npersonal responsibility. In that regard, the article speaks for itself, \nand I encourage Senators and all other readers of the Congressional \nRecord to review it.\n  I will refer to a couple of paragraphs in this publication, TV \nTechnology, written by Frank Beacham. It says, under the dateline of \nNew York:\n\n       Soft-spoken Jim Goodmon--like the mythical Sheriff Andy \n     Taylor of TV's Mayberry has a comforting way of tackling the \n     most intractable problems with common sense and good humor. \n     How else could he have done the seemingly impossible task of \n     making broadcast cynics feel warm and fuzzy about digital \n     television?\n       After hearing Goodmon explain his philosophy of \n     broadcasting, one can just imagine Andy, Barney, Thelma Lou, \n     and Aunt Bea sitting around their HDTV set enjoying the local \n     coverage of North Carolina's State Fair on WRAL, Goodmon's \n     Raleigh, N.C., station.\n       A third-generation North Carolina broadcaster whose first \n     job was giving free TV antennas to WRAL viewers in the 1950s, \n     Goodmon comes off as a radical reformer in Norman Rockwell \n     clothing. Unlike FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, who draws \n     lightening for saying many of the same things, Goodmon gets \n     nods of respect even from those who disagree with him.\n       ``He represents what broadcasting ought to be,'' commented \n     an audience member moments after hearing Goodmon speak in New \n     York City at the Consumer Electronic Association's DTV \n     Summit.\n       Unlike many of his broadcasting industry contemporaries, \n     Goodmon not only embraces the opportunities of digital \n     television but insists that all broadcasters should be \n     required to air some HDTV programming every evening. Eyebrows \n     inch up further when he advocates that broadcasters should be \n     held to a well-defined public service obligation enforced by \n     a new NAB code of conduct.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From TV Technology, Dec. 13, 2000]\n\n      Jim Goodmon: Mayberry Values Collide With Harsh DTV Reality\n\n                           (By Frank Beacham)\n\n       Soft-spoken Jim Goodmon--like the mythical Sheriff Andy \n     Taylor of TV's Mayberry has a comforting way of tackling the \n     most intractable problems with common sense and good humor. \n     How else could he have done the seemingly impossible task of \n     making broadcast cynics feel warm and fuzzy about digital \n     television?\n       After hearing Goodmon explain his philosophy of \n     broadcasting, one can just imagine Andy, Barney, Thelma Lou \n     and Aunt Bea sitting around their HDTV set enjoying the local \n     coverage of North Carolina's State Fair on WRAL, Goodmon's \n     Raleigh, N.C., station.\n       A third-generation North Carolina broadcaster whose first \n     job was giving free TV antennas to WRAL viewers in the \n     1950's, Goodmon comes off as a radical reformer in Norman \n     Rockwell clothing.

Eyebrows \n     inch up further when he advocates that broadcasters should be \n     held to a well-defined public service obligation enforced by \n     a new NAB code of conduct.\n\n\n                            Against the tide\n\n       As president and CEO of Capitol Broadcasting Company, \n     Goodmon is swimming against the tide in an era when media \n     corporations that own large station groups spend millions of \n     dollars to lobby Congress against such regulation.\n       A genuine broadcast pioneer, Goodmon guided WRAL as it \n     became the first station in the United States to broadcast an \n     HDTV signal. Now, four years later, the station is about to \n     become the first to begin all-HDTV newscasts.\n       Goodmon's business plan is simple: ``Our plan is to stay in \n     business. Period.''\n       ``What we are talking about here is the future of \n     broadcasting. How do we remain competitive in the future? The \n     way we do it is digital,'' he said in his address at the DTV \n     Summit.\n       Rejecting a recent mantra from many of his industry \n     colleagues, Goodmon said the DTV transition is not about new \n     revenue streams.\n       ``This is not about sending e-mail to watches or selling \n     our spectrum to high-speed data providers,'' he said. ``This \n     is about how we stay competitive. About how we can be good \n     local broadcasters in the future.''\n       He cited WRAL's motto: ``The main thing is to keep the main \n     thing the main thing.'' The main thing, Goodmon said, is \n     local news. ``That's why in January we are going to start \n     doing five hours a day of local news in high definition.''\n\n\n                         HDTV: LIKE BEING THERE\n\n       It was IID coverage of Sen. John Glenn's space shuttle \n     flight, Goodmon said, that convinced him news would benefit \n     from high-resolution video and Dolby Digital sound.\n       ``What is television news? It's being there,'' Goodmon \n     said. ``Putting the viewer there. There is no better way to \n     put the viewer there than high definition.''\n       Goodmon said viewers like the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio \n     and Dolby digital sound that HD provides.\n       ``Sound and 16:9 are a big deal. We're talking about \n     creating an experience here . . . getting wrapped up in it.''\n       He said, as a result of experiences in local HD production \n     over the past four years, the station sees HD bringing \n     significant enhancements to hockey, auto racing, football,\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\n     basketball, baseball, outdoor symphonies, art exhibits and \n     documentaries.\n       Multicasting has also benefited WRAL, Goodmon said, by \n     giving the station the opportunity to respond to new \n     programming opportunities.\n       ``We were broadcasting a basketball game and had some flood \n     news in North Carolina. We interrupted the game, did the \n     flood coverage and then said: `If you want to watch the \n     basketball game, stay on Channel 5.1. We are going to do \n     continuous flood coverage on Channel 5.2 and we'll have our \n     weather radar on all the time on Channel 5.3.' What you can \n     do with this technology is limited only by your \n     imagination.''\n       Goodmon said he sees multicasting as a way to expand the \n     station's brand with a broader array of programming.\n       ``We don't see multicasting as an opportunity to start a \n     new full-time channel or something like that.''\n       Ditto for datacasting. WRAL now has 200 volunteers with PCs \n     equipped to receive its data broadcasts.\n       ``We send IP traffic 24 hours a day. We ask users to allot \n     about 500 Mb on their hard drive and dedicate it to the \n     data.''\n       A key application is local news. The station is working \n     toward a service where viewers can watch a newscast on-demand \n     on their PC, either in its entirely or on an interactive \n     story-by-story basis.\n       Currently, WRAL has about 700 HD viewers in its 23-county \n     market. As in the early days of his career, Goodmon now makes \n     sure every new DTV set owner in the Raleigh-Durham area gets \n     an outdoor television antenna, courtesy of the station.\n       ``We know most of our viewers and get lots of comments from \n     them.''\n       The station uses an e-mail group conference to stay in \n     touch with digital set owners.\n       As for fellow broadcasters who see no business model for an \n     immediate return on their investment from digital television, \n     Goodmon offers another homily: ``Sometimes you have to spend \n     money just to stay in business.''\n\n\n                         must-carry a must-have\n\n       Though Goodmon's aggressive use of digital technology in \n     his local market is impressive, even he acknowledges the \n     national DTV transition is facing some big obstacles.\n       One of the largest stumbling blocks is digital must-carry, \n     something FCC Chairman Kennard has cautioned broadcasters not \n     to depend upon. Even if enacted, a new must-carry requirement \n     would face an uncertain future with years of legal battles \n     and appeals. But, to Goodmon, it's a make or break issue.\n       ``Cable has 70 percent of the homes,'' he said. ``How are \n     we going to get digital into the homes if they are not on \n     cable? I think we need full digital must-carry on satellite \n     as well. And I mean full digital must-carry--everything, \n     including our data.''\n       Goodmon proposes coupling digital must-carry with a now \n     elusive public service requirement.\n       ``How can we ask for digital must-carry if we don't agree \n     to public service standards? To me, the two go together.\n       ``Along with getting this digital license comes a \n     commitment to serve the public interest, whatever that is,'' \n     he continued. ``That's not a very defined notion. It needs to \n     be defined as a minimum standard. We need this standard set \n     and then we need to return to a broadcasting code of conduct. \n     I'm really showing my age talking about the NAB code, but \n     that was a great thing.''\n       Also essential for a successful transition, said Goodmon, \n     is a requirement for an integrated digital tuner in all new \n     DTV receivers, preferably by 2003, and a requirement that \n     every digital station air at least two hours of HDTV \n     programming each night between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.\n       ``We broadcasters asked Congress to do high definition,'' \n     reminded Goodmon. ``If you take a digital license, you should \n     be required to do HD each night. The networks need to push \n     primetime HD. If they do that, the stations will have to \n     carry it.''\n       Finally, he called on television receiver manufacturers to \n     come forward with public assurance of a fix for multipath \n     problems that can block reception in urban areas. Though he \n     said WRAL has had no problems with the 8-VSB transmission \n     standard and that he favors retaining it, a strong message of \n     assurance either through a technical standard or other \n     objective method must be sent to calm fears over the \n     technology.\n       ``Broadcasters need assurance,'' Goodmon insisted. ``Tell \n     us we don't have to worry about the multipath problem.''\n       In addition, he said the consumer electronics industry has \n     ``to stand up and say this receiver thing is not a problem. \n     It can be with a standard or some other way. But it must be \n     said.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/26/senate-section/article/S1590-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, President George Bush summoned Paul \nCoverdell to Washington one day in 1989 to ask Paul to consider serving \nas the 11th Director of the Peace Corps.\n  It will come as no surprise that Paul's tenure at the Peace Corps was \nmarked by intense effort, positive results, and commitment to American \ninterests. He gave a high priority to the well-being of the volunteers \nhe sent out, who were, after all, the face of young America to other \ncountries around the world.\n  There were significant hurdles to overcome at the Peace Corps, \nincluding flagging morale and limited resources. Nonetheless, Paul \nCoverdell recognized the need to respond to the high international \nhistoric drama of sweeping changes, for example, the fall of communism \nin Europe.\n  He found the necessary resources to send Peace Corps volunteers to \ncountries struggling to emerge from the weight of communist rule. Under \nPaul Coverdell's leadership, the first volunteers were sent to Hungary, \nPoland, Romania, and the Czech and Slovak Republics.\n  Paul Coverdell took great pride in the Peace Corps; for example, he \nunfailingly referred to it as ``The United States Peace Corps'' and he \ndescribed the Peace corps as ``a vibrant, vital part of United States \nforeign policy.''\n  In tribute to our esteemed and beloved departed colleague and friend, \ntoday we are approving legislation to designate the Washington office \nof the Peace Corps as the ``Paul D. Coverdell Peace Corps \nHeadquarters.''\n  I know Senators will unhesitatingly support this fitting tribute to a \nremarkable gentleman who was without question a committed public \nservant, a statesman, and a friend.\n  Mr. President, seeing nobody seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).
