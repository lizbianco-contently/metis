Mr. President, there will be no rollcall votes today. \nHowever, it is hoped there will be the offering of amendments during \nthe day. The same would apply to the Monday we get back, a week from \nthis Monday. We hope Senators will offer amendments then. It is the \nexpectation that we could complete the finite list of amendments that \nare now on file on Tuesday.\n  I reviewed those with the two managers of the bill last night. There \ndoesn't appear to be too much there that we could not complete on \nTuesday. I am confident some of those amendments will be accepted by \nthe managers. We will have a managers' amendment, and we are going to \nbe very certain that is going to be reviewed prior to the offering of \nthat amendment by a number of Senators who have expressed an interest \nin managers' amendments.\n  The next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, February 26, at 10 a.m.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see nobody seeking recognition at the \nmoment. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in morning business \nfor such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, to bring our colleagues up to date \nas to how we are going to proceed on the election reform bill. For the \npurposes of reviewing the bidding here, there will be no recorded votes \ntoday and no recorded votes on Monday, the 25th of February, when we \nreturn from the Presidents Day recess.\n  But as the two leaders indicated last evening, there is now a finite \nlist of amendments submitted by our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. Senator McConnell and I and our staffs are now going to go \nthrough those lists of amendments. When possible, we will attempt to \naccept amendments that have been offered. We may be able to start this \nprocess today and continue on Monday.\n  Some amendments may need modifications. If they can be so modified to \nbe acceptable to both sides, Senator McConnell and I will try to \naccommodate those without having recorded votes. Some amendments will \nrequire a decision by the body. We will try to keep those amendments to \na minimum. Obviously, some amendments are going to require the full \nmembership of this body to vote.\n  That being the case, on Tuesday, February 26, we will complete voting \non those amendments with the fervent hope that by the end of that day, \nor at some point on February 26, we will go to third reading and final \npassage of this election reform bill.\n  That is the plan. We hope that is exactly how it will work. There are \na number of amendments that are not drafted in proper amendment form. \nThey are concepts and explanations of what Members would like to do. It \nis a little difficult to try to come to some agreement on a proposal \nthat hasn't been crafted in legislative language. As a result, if you \nhave an amendment in that status, I urge you, over the next hour or so, \nto get it in legislative form sometime today. We can analyze it and \ndetermine whether or not that amendment can be accepted.\n  A number of Members listed relevant amendments. I don't have any idea \nwhat subject matter is contained in such relevant amendments. So \nMembers in that status ought to communicate with us as soon as possible \nabout the specifics of the amendment they are submitting about. Maybe \nsome Members just wanted a placeholder and said they had a relevant \namendment. These Members may have said they had a relevant amendment \nand really don't have any intention of offering any language to this \nbill. If this case, at this stage it would be very helpful if we knew \nthis. We could then reduce the list down to a manageable number without \nlimiting debate for our Members on all the important issues in election \nreform.\n  I urge Members on both sides to do all of these things that I \ndiscussed if they are applicable. Taking action can expedite the \nprocess to final passage. On February 26, we don't want to have a \nmarathon voting exercise all day, with 1 or 2 minutes in advance of a \nseries of recorded votes. I am not terribly attracted to that kind of \nprocess. I understand the value of stacking votes from time to time. \nBut I am not sure the institution shows its best effort when we engage \nin a vote marathon.\n  I would like to resolve as many amendments as possible and leave for \nthe floor the ones that really do require debate. I suggest that so \nMembers understand the real importance of what we are considering.\n  My plea is to urge all Members here to please get us your proposals. \nMy staff, Senator McConnell's staff, and Senator Bond's staff and \nSenator Schumer's staff, are all working on this bill. We can really \ntry to resolve as many of these issues as possible today and over the \nnext week. Then, on February 25, when we return, we can have a good \ndebate on the remaining two, three, or four--whatever the number is \namendments that deserve debate and consideration that go to the heart \nand core of some differences that may exist. That is how we are going \nto proceed.\n\n  I am grateful to colleagues for their participation over the last \ncouple of days. We have had quite a few amendments. We have resolved \nsome issues that needed resolution. I am heartened over the fact that \nwe are going to have a good bill, a bill all Members can be proud of. \nApproximately 14 months after the November 2000 election, we are going \nto return to our States and say to people in this country, who wondered \nwhether or not this body would ever be able to grapple successfully \nwith election reform, that yes we could.\n  We have come together and resolved differences. We modernize and \nreform an election system that was in desperate need. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows so well because he represents the wonderful State of \nFlorida that was the subject of such attention for not just our country \nbut the entire world.\n  As I have said to him and his colleague, Senator Graham, on numerous \noccasions, this is not only a Florida problem; this is not only a \nNovember 2000 election problem; but rather an election problem that has \ngone on for many years which makes the problem a national problem. The \nonly silver lining, I suppose, in all that unfolded in the November \n2000 election is that we are doing something we probably should have \ndone years before. Absent the national crisis that developed in the \nyear 2000, we probably would not have gotten to real election reform \nfor years to come.\n  As my mother always said, there is a silver lining in every dark \ncloud. The dark cloud is the November 2000 election. The silver lining \nis we are on the brink in this institution of reforming the manner in \nwhich Federal elections are conducted by our States and localities in a \nincremental way, but a significant and constitutional way. This means \nthat every eligible voter in this country who chooses to vote will have \nan equal opportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted. It will \nbe a user-friendly, accessible institution, and those who want to game, \ncheat or corrupt the system in some way are going to find it much more \ndifficult to do so successfully.\n  If we can achieve both of those goals in the coming days, then I \nthink the American public can rightfully say this Congress, the second \nsession of the 107th Congress, did not fail to take and meet the \nchallenge that the November 2000 election posed for us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2916\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of our colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis leadership on the legislation that has been pending. I want to talk \nabout wind energy. I suppose people will think then that I am talking \nabout the Senate, but that is not the case.\n  We are going to turn to an energy bill very soon. When we complete \nthe pending legislation before the Senate, we will turn to the subject \nof energy.\n  Our country and its economy are terribly dependent on a substantial \namount of energy coming from the Middle East. We understand the dilemma \nfor the American economy to be that dependent on a part of the world \nthat is so unstable. So we ought to find a way to be less dependent on \nthat part of the world.\n  I was in recent weeks in Central Asia and understand even more, once \nagain, how fragile circumstances are there. Our economy and our country \nwould be well advised to create an energy policy that extracts the kind \nof ultimate dependence we now have on an oil and energy supply from the \nMiddle East.\n  How do we do that? We write an energy policy that does a lot of \nthings: increases supply at home--oil, natural gas, and coal--and does \nso in an environmentally acceptable way; increases conservation; \nincreases efficiency of appliances we use; and also especially promotes \nlimitless and renewable sources of energy.\n  I am interested in the wide range of resources that belong to the \nlast category, renewables: biodiesel, using sunflower and canola oil to \nrun engines, taking a drop of alcohol from a kernel of corn and using \nthat to extend America's energy supply, and then still having the \nprotein feedstock from the kernel of corn.\n\n  Today, I also want to talk briefly about wind energy. The new \ntechnology in wind turbines is extraordinary. Being able to take energy \nfrom the air, from the wind, using new, high-technology blades and \ncoursing the wind through these turbines, then transmitting that energy \nacross the grid to provide electricity where it is needed in this \ncountry makes good sense. It is limitless energy. We can have it \nforever. We will never deplete the source of energy coming from the \nwind.\n  The production tax credit that has been on the books that provides \nthe enhancement for wind energy projects expired at the end of last \nyear. It is unthinkable that the Congress, poised to take up energy \npolicy legislation, has allowed the production tax credit for wind \nenergy to expire, and yet it did.\n  The production tax credit for wind energy needs to be extended, and \nnot for one year and not for 2 years, but for 5 years. We need to do \nthat now. We need to do that on an urgent basis.\n  We just cut a ribbon on the first commercial wind turbine along \nInterstate 94 in North Dakota. There are three blades on that turbine, \neach weighing 4,200 pounds. The turbine is a remarkable structure, and \nthe efficiency and the new technology of these turbines is outstanding.\n  When we look at all of the States and the opportunity to take energy \nfrom the wind, North Dakota is No. 1. We are 50th in native forest \nlands, so we are dead last in trees, but we are No. 1 in the potential \nfor wind energy. Any young boy or girl who has grown up in North Dakota \nknows that. We have a lot of breezes that move across the prairies in \nNorth Dakota. We are No. 1 in wind energy potential. They call us the \nSaudi Arabia of wind energy.\n  A week ago, I had a chief executive officer of a company come to my \noffice, and he said: we have a project ready to be built in North \nDakota--ready to be built right now. It will be a 150-megawatt wind \nfarm. The plans for it are complete. Regrettably, he said, they are on \nthe shelf until Congress extends the production tax credit.\n  It does not make any sense to me, at a time when we are trying to \nfigure out how we increase our supply of energy, to have companies that \nhave the money, the plans and the will to produce 150 megawatts of \nwind-generated electricity in a State such as North Dakota, but to have \nthose plans on the shelf because the Congress is dragging its feet.\n  I know some will say: the extension of the production tax credit for \nwind energy has been inserted in this bill or that bill. In fact, the \nHouse of Representatives included it, I believe, just yesterday. They \nwrote another stimulus bill, which is a perfectly terrible piece of \nlegislation, a big give-away to a lot of big companies that do not \ndeserve it, and then added the extension of the production tax credit \nfor wind energy on that vehicle. It is like putting earrings on a hog. \nIt just does not mean very much. That is not the way we are going to \nget an extension of the production tax credit for wind energy. The way \nwe are going to get it is for Members of the House and Senate to \nunderstand that we cannot come to the end of the year and have \nimportant policy issues, such as the production tax credit for wind \nenergy, expire so that we have fits and starts and an industry that \ncannot get off the ground.\n  A major blade manufacturer in Grand Forks, ND, laid off employees \nbecause, when the production tax credit expired at the end of last \nyear, projects were put on the shelf, including the project I just \ndescribed--a project worth $150 million in North Dakota that would \nproduce 150 megawatts of electricity. They have the money, they have \nthe plans, and it is not happening, because this Congress has been \ndragging its feet.\n  I know the Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, agrees with me that we \nought to do this. We ought to do it right now. Yet we cannot get it \ndone because we have some people who insist on playing games with \nstimulus packages that will go nowhere, because they make no sense and \nwill do nothing to stimulate this economy.\n  Let us extract the tax credit extensions from the stimulus package. \nLet us pass these on a stand-alone basis. Let us pass that package of \nextenders that should have been enacted by the end of last year. \nCongress should have done that. Everybody knows that. I hope when we \nreturn following next week's State work period that we will have, both \non the Democratic and Republican sides, a desire and a will to\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nsay that what we did not do at the end of last year we will commit to \ndo now, and we will do it on an urgent basis, because that is what will \ncontribute to a good energy policy for this country. Then we will turn \nto the energy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleague from North Dakota on the subject of wind energy. Clearly, \nthis is a circumstance in which the Government needs to act, and act \nquickly, to provide the incentives that have been previously put in \nplace but have now lapsed, incentives that can make a difference \nbetween projects going forward and not.\n  I do not know what could be more clear than that the incentives for \nwind energy are absolutely essential if we are going to diversify the \nbase of energy supply in this country, move to more renewables, and \nhave a greater chance of reducing our dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy that leave us vulnerable in a time of conflict in the very areas \nof the world in which much oil production is occurring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S882-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S882-S883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AGRICULTURAL PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when I came to my office this morning, I \nreceived the surprising news that our Secretary of Agriculture has now \napparently asked her counterpart in Canada to come to the United States \nto lobby against the farm bill that is pending.\n  I have never heard of such a thing. We now have reports that the \nSecretary of Agriculture of the United States is asking an official of \na foreign government to come to Washington to lobby the Congress \nagainst the farm bill that is designed to help American farmers? What \nis she thinking of?\n  The article I am referring to is from the Ottawa Bureau of the \nWestern Producer, and this story says the Canadian Agriculture \nMinister, Lyle Vanclief, received surprising advice when he called \nAmerican Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman to complain about the \npossibility that a new United States farm bill would authorize a \nmultiyear, multibillion-dollar farm subsidy program. Veneman invited \nVanclief to come south to get involved in the debate. This is a quote \nfrom the article:\n\n       She told Lyle to put pressure on Congress, Vanclief press \n     aide Donald Boulanger said. She said their political system \n     is different from ours because Congress has so much power. \n     She said--\n\n  This is quoting the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States--\n\n       Lyle, you have to help me lobby Congress.\n\n  This is not the way any Cabinet Secretary ought to do their business. \nIt is totally and thoroughly inappropriate for the U.S. Secretary of \nAgriculture to ask an agriculture minister of a foreign government to \ncome and lobby the Congress against a farm bill that is designed to \nhelp American farmers. This cannot be.\n  I am writing a letter today to the President asking him to renounce \nthese apparent efforts by his Secretary of Agriculture to have the \nofficials of a foreign country become involved in a domestic political \ndiscussion in our country.\n  This is a very serious matter. This cannot be the way this \nadministration does its business. I call on the President today to send \na very clear message to the Secretary of Agriculture in his \nadministration that she cannot be pursuing foreign government officials \nto come to this country to lobby this Congress to become involved in a \ndebate in our country. What is next by this Secretary of Agriculture? \nHas she forgotten whose side she is on? She is in the Cabinet of the \nPresident of the United States, not in the Cabinet of the Government of \nCanada. She is not in the cabinet of the European governments, which \nwould welcome the kind of advice that apparently she is giving and the \nkind of involvement in our domestic affairs she is reportedly seeking \nfrom the minister of agriculture in another country's government.\n  It is as though the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States has \ncompletely forgotten her obligation. The reason it is critically \nimportant for us to pass a farm bill is to try to level the playing \nfield to some degree with our major competitors.\n  In case our Secretary has forgotten, I have a chart which shows an \nanalysis of the difference between what our major competitors are doing \nfor their farmers and what we are doing for ours. This is Europe. They \nare our major competitors. This is what they are doing on average per \nyear to support their farmers: Over $300 an acre of support. The \ncomparable figure in the United States: $38. These are not my numbers, \nthese are the numbers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment. These are the international scorekeeper's numbers. They \nare the ones that are telling us our major competitors are doing far \nmore for their producers than we are doing for ours. And it does not \nstop there, because on world export subsidy, this is the picture: This \npie represents all world agricultural export subsidies. The blue part \nof this pie is Europe's share. Eighty-four percent of all world \nagricultural export subsidies is European. They are buying these \nmarkets. The U.S. share is this little red sliver--less than 3 percent. \nSo we are being outgunned nearly 30 to 1. And we have a Secretary of \nAgriculture who is reportedly calling on an official of a foreign \ngovernment to come to our country to lobby our Congress against a farm \nbill for our farmers? It is absolutely preposterous.\n\n  This is what our farmers are up against, and we have a Secretary of \nAgriculture who is supposed to represent American farmers, not Canadian \nfarmers. Here is what American farmers have experienced: The green line \nis the prices farmers have paid for the inputs they must buy. The red \nline shows the prices farmers have received.\n  It is very interesting that the peak of prices for farmers occurred \nat the time we wrote the last farm bill. Since that time, one can see \nwhat has occurred: A virtual price collapse. The gap between the prices \nfarmers are paid and the prices they pay has turned into this enormous \ngulf. It is no wonder agriculture in America is in deep trouble. It is \nno wonder when I ask my farmers what happens if they do not have this \nnew farm bill, the answer from one of the major farm group leaders in \nmy State was: It will be a race to the auctioneer.\n  That is the reality. That is because our farmers are out here playing \non the world stage. We are asking them to compete against the French \nfarmer and the German farmer, and we are telling them: While you are at \nit, take on the French and German Government, as well.\n  That is not a fair fight. We can either choose to wave the flag of \nsurrender and give up, throw in the towel, let our people be wiped out, \nor we can fight back. That is what this farm bill debate is about.\n  Now we have the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States \napparently calling her Canadian counterpart, urging him to come to this \ncountry to fight against the farm bill that is moving through our \nCongress. I have to wonder what she is thinking. She is not on the \npayroll of the Canadian Government. She is a part of the United States \nGovernment. It is thoroughly and totally inappropriate for her to be \nasking a representative of a foreign government to come to this country \nto lobby the U.S. Congress against a farm bill for American farmers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I listened to my colleague. I have not seen the report, \nnor do I know the contents of that report. However, as my colleague has \nstated, it is not appropriate, in my judgment, for Canadians to be \nlobbying our Congress about a domestic farm program, or for anyone from \nour administration to be inviting them down.\n  My hope is that that did not happen that the press report is \nerroneous--and the Secretary will put out a statement saying that is \nnot accurate. If it is accurate, it is inappropriate. Senator Conrad is \ncertainly right about that.\n  This raises the broader point that, for the last 6 months, trying to \nget a farm bill out of this Congress has been an awful process. It is \nas if those who knew that we needed to get a better farm bill in order \nto enable family farmers to survive have been on a bicycle built for \ntwo, and we have been on the front seat pedaling uphill as hard as we \ncould pedal, and the administration has been on the back seat with \ntheir foot on the break.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  Every step of the way the administration has said: we don't think you \nshould do this; we don't believe you need a new farm bill. The \nadministration told the House of Representatives not to write one. And \nthe House of Representatives said: it doesn't matter what you say, we \nwill do it.\n  The administration told the Senate not to pass a farm bill in 2001. \nWe had to go through three cloture votes and still could not get the 60 \nvotes necessary to pass it in 2001.\n  This year, We have finally gotten a bill out of the Senate. It is in \nconference. We need to complete this quickly.\n  With respect to the issue of Canada, Canada is a good neighbor of \nours, but it regrettably has undercut our Government and undercut our \nfarmers in every way possible since the United States-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement. Canada dumped its wheat in our country and refused to open \nits books and records that would demonstrate there is unfair trade. We \nhave sent people, including the GAO, to Canada to get those records. \nThe Canadians have effectively thumbed their nose at all of our \nrepresentatives and said: we are not going to give them to you.\n  I don't think we need advice from Canada about how to help our \nfarmers. What we need from the Canadians is for them to stop hurting \nour farmers. They have a State-sponsored monopoly in Canada called the \nCanadian Wheat Board that would be illegal in this country. Every day \nin every way for years they have been trying to undercut our family \nfarmers with unfair trade.\n  Senator Conrad is right when he says we do not need advice from \nCanadians about how to do domestic agricultural policy in our country. \nIt is not welcome in my view. What is welcome is for the Canadians to \ndecide that good neighbors ought not undercut each other with unfair \ntrade. If they take that step once, they help American farmers with \nrespect to fair trade.\n  I thank Senator Conrad for allowing me to respond to his comments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague for his insight. It is a remarkable \nset of circumstances. I call on the Secretary. If this press report is \ninaccurate, I hope she will say so publicly and do it today. But this \npress report quotes the spokesman, a press aide of her counterpart in \nCanada, the Canadian Agriculture Minister, Lyle Vanclief; his press \naide, a Mr. Donald Boulanger, is quoted. This is what the article \nreports:\n\n       She told Lyle [Mr. Vanclief, Canadian Agriculture Minister] \n     to put pressure on Congress.\n\n  That is in quotation marks. Following that, again quoting Mr. \nBoulanger, the press aide for the Canadian Agriculture Minister:\n\n       She said their political system is different from ours \n     because Congress has so much power. She said, Lyle, you have \n     to help me lobby Congress.\n\n  I hope it is wrong. I hope the Secretary will today indicate she \nnever made any such invitation, that she never made such a statement. \nIf this is her statement, I think she has a lot of explaining to do. It \nprobably should start with an explanation to the President of the \nUnited States, why a Secretary of Agriculture of the United States is \nimploring her Canadian counterpart to come to lobby the U.S. Congress \nagainst a farm bill that is pending before the Congress of this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S883-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S883-S884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on another subject, I noticed in today's \nWashington Times a story headlined: ``White House to Show Triumph of \nTax Cuts, Says Recession Stalled Jobs Added.'' This is a news story \nthat comes as a result of a speech later today to the Council on \nForeign Relations by Vice President Cheney, and it indicates that he \nwill present findings by the President's Council of Economic Advisers \nas an answer to Democratic critics of the tax cut. The findings the \nVice President will discuss show the third quarter growth last year \nwould have contracted at an annual rate of 2.5 percent instead of the \nreported 1.3 percent without the tax relief.\n  That should not be any great surprise to anybody. What is surprising \nis the Republicans attempting to claim credit for the tax cuts that \noccurred last year.\n  We should not rewrite the history of what occurred. Last year, it was \nthe Democrats who were proposing much greater tax relief than the \nPresident's proposal because we believed we needed to give lift to the \neconomy. Here are the facts. For 2002, the President's budget proposed \nalmost no tax relief. The Democratic budget proposed $60 billion of tax \nrelief last year.\n  Those are the facts. Absolutely, Democrats were for more tax relief \nlast year than the President proposed because we thought we needed to \ngive lift to the economy. In fact, we actually passed even greater tax \nrelief than that. But this is what was in our budget. That is what was \nin the President's budget. I don't think the administration should be \nrunning out and claiming credit for what was our idea.\n  This is what actually passed last year: a total of $73 billion, $33 \nbillion in the form of the rebate, and corporate tax changes of $40 \nbillion. Some of the latter were just timing questions that had no \nimpact on stimulus.\n  In terms of the fundamental question about differences in tax cuts, \nwe were not in favor of as much of a tax cut over the 10 years. While \nwe favored a much bigger tax cut last year in order to give lift to the \neconomy than the President proposed, we proposed a much smaller tax cut \nover the 10 years because we were concerned about the impact on long-\nterm interest rates.\n  Our tax relief proposal was $750 billion over 10 years; the \nPresident's proposal was $1.6 trillion. We said at the time that we \nfeared his tax proposal was too large and would threaten the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds.\n  Guess what? We were right on both counts. We were right to support a \nbigger tax cut last year, to give lift to the economy. We were right to \nsupport a smaller tax cut over the 10 years because the larger tax cut \nendangered the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare. The facts \nare now in, and it is just as clear as can be, we were right. The \nPresident's new budget shows he will be taking $2.2 trillion over the \nnext 10 years out of the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security. \nIn Social Security alone, the President will be taking over $1.6 \ntrillion of Social Security trust fund money to pay for his tax cut and \nhis other spending priorities. That is a fact.\n  So, yes, tax cuts are beneficial at a time of economic slowdown. \nDemocrats proposed them. Again, the budget difference is very clear. \nThe budget difference, in terms of what was proposed, is right here. \nThis is the President's budget: $183 million. That is what he proposed \nfor tax relief in his budget for last year. Our budget resolution had \n$60 billion of tax relief. That is the fact.\n  Let's not get confused about the 1-year and the 10-year. It is \nabsolutely true that over 10 years we proposed smaller tax cuts so as \nnot to raid the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. But for the \nVice President to run out now and claim the tax cuts of last year were \nreally their idea--you have to go back and look at the budget they \nsubmitted. It was not their idea. It was the idea of the Democrats who \nproposed much more significant tax relief last year to give lift to the \neconomy. That is the fact.\n  We also said last year that the 10-year tax cut the President \nproposed would have an adverse effect on long-term interest rates. \nAgain, I think the evidence is now quite clear. Here is what we see in \nterms of short-term rates versus long-term rates. We have had eleven \ninterest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve? You can see that by \nthe short-term rates: 11 reductions, and the short-term rates have come \ndown smartly.\n  But look at long-term rates. Long-term rates have been largely stuck. \nThey have not come down. That was one of the concerns we had about the \nPresident's long-term proposal, that the markets could see that his \nbudget plan did not add up and that would put pressure on long-term \nrates and keep them high. That is exactly what has happened. These \nrates are higher than we believe they would otherwise have been.\n  It is true that short-term rates have come down dramatically. Long-\nterm rates have not. So we believe our position has been confirmed on \nall counts. No. 1, we supported more tax cuts last year in our budget \nthan the President did in his because we wanted to give\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\nlift to the economy at a time of economic weakness. Now the Republican \nWhite House is going out and saying they are the ones who had the idea. \nThey are not. Anybody who cares to research it can go back and look at \nthe President's budget--not just the first budget he submitted, but the \nsecond budget he submitted, the follow-on budget in the spring. It is \nthe same thing. He had virtually no tax cut last year.\n  The February budget had virtually no tax cut, and his April budget \nhad virtually no tax cut. The people who were pushing for a big tax cut \nlast year for the year 2002 were those of us on this side of the aisle, \nDemocrats. And we were right.\n  As it turns out, we were also right to oppose the size of his 10-year \ntax reduction because we said then--two things. No. 1, it would \nendanger the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare, and we now \nknow that is true. No. 2, we said it would put upward pressure on \ninterest rates; that, even at a time when the Federal Reserve was \nlowering short-term rates, it would hold long-term rates up. That is \nexactly what we see. The evidence is in. It is just as clear as it can \nbe.\n\n  I hope as we move forward this year, we can move to rectify fiscal \nmistakes that were made last year. The raids on the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds, the President's budget plans, are dramatic.\n  Here are the facts. The President is going to be taking every penny \nof the Medicare trust fund surpluses over the next 10 years to pay for \nhis tax cuts and to pay for other spending priorities--every dime--over \n$500 billion, according to his own calculations.\n  The President is going to be taking, under his budget plan, over $1.6 \ntrillion of Social Security surpluses over the next decade to pay for \nhis tax cuts and other spending priorities. It is in his budget. That \nis his plan.\n  There is only $600 billion left, every dime of which is Social \nSecurity money. The Congressional Budget Office, we believe, when they \nrescore the President's proposal, will show that virtually all of that \nis gone because the President has dramatically underestimated the cost \nof Medicare over the next 10 years.\n  Yesterday, in a hearing with Health and Human Services Secretary \nTommy Thompson, I showed that the Congressional Budget Office believes \nthe President's budget has underestimated the cost of Medicare by $300 \nbillion over the next decade. So there is no money left except Social \nSecurity money. That is the hard reality. And the President's budget \nhas taken most of that.\n  I believe history will show very clearly that Democrats last year \nproposed a greater tax cut in 2002 to try to give lift to the economy, \nbut we proposed a more modest tax cut over the 10 years because we did \nnot want to endanger the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare, \nand we did not want to keep long-term rates from following short-term \ninterest rates down because that also gives lift to the economy.\n  What is important to understand is that fiscal policy--that is, the \nspending and tax policy of the Federal Government--can adversely affect \nthe monetary policy that is guided by the Federal Reserve Board. While \nwe move to give lift to the economy through stimulus, that can all be \ncountered by interest rates. If interest rates go up or stay high, that \ncan prevent the economy from gaining strength and moving forward.\n  Facts are stubborn things, as a previous President said. I believe \nthe facts of who stood where with respect to economic policy are just \nas clear as they can be--absolutely. Tax cuts last year helped reduce \nthe impact of the recession. But it was Democrats who advocated \nsubstantial tax cuts last year. It was not the President, either in his \nFebruary budget or in his April budget. He proposed virtually no tax \nrelief last year. That is the fact.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S884-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE ADMINISTRATION'S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS REPORT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the administration's Council of Economic \nAdvisers will issue today some self-serving economic revisionism--a \nlittle like a figure skating judge awarding the gold medal to his own \nteam. We are going to hear that the recession was somehow shorter and \nshallower than it would have been without last year's mammoth, surplus-\nswallowing tax cut.\n  Let me just say, I might like to change economic history, too, if I \nhad just blown a $5.6 trillion surplus in less than a year. But let's \nset the historical record straight.\n  The administration's proposed 10-year tax cut, when they offered it \nlast year, was $1.7 trillion, plus about $300 billion in interest--\nabout $2 trillion. Of that, there was zero stimulative tax cut. Not a \ndime was to go out to the American people in the year 2001, last year.\n  Let me restate that. There was no economic stimulus in the $2 \ntrillion tax cut that the administration originally sent to Congress.\n  Democrats who were concerned about the recession were the ones who \nproposed to give working American families immediate tax relief to get \nthe economy going again. Our Republican colleagues, as late as last \nweek, were arguing that there is no stimulative impact at all to \nrebates for working Americans.\n  But now we have the White House Council of Economic Advisers \nsuffering a case of convenient economic amnesia. They are not only \nforgetting that the administration did not propose a stimulus, they are \nalso forgetting what happened to long-term interest rates as a direct \nconsequence of their ill-advised, long-term fiscal policy.\n  The administration's plan, history will show, was exactly reversed: \nNo stimulus but huge, long-term fiscal damage.\n  The budget just released affirms the return to deficits. It has been \nhugely damaging to our long-term fiscal condition, including diverting \n$1.5 trillion of the Social Security trust funds just as the baby boom \ngeneration is about to retire.\n  Just as important, though, is that long-term fiscal mismanagement has \nhurt us in the short term. Long-term interest rates have remained \nstubbornly high even as the Fed reduced short-term rates 11 times. Ten-\nyear Treasurys were at 5.01 percent in January of 2001, and at the \nbeginning of February 2002, they were at 5.05 percent.\n  That means that homes are harder to buy, student loans are more \nexpensive, credit card interest rates remain unnecessarily high. All of \nthat has harmed people, and it has harmed the economy.\n  So let's just remember where we were last year at this time: The \nadministration had the wrong prescription for both the immediate and \nthe long term. They proposed no tax cuts at all during the year 2001--\nzero for working families. It was Democrats who insisted on a rebate \nthat ultimately passed without the support of the administration. But \nthen they gave huge giveaways--tilted heavily toward those at the top \nincome levels--that explode as we move forward. Those giveaways could \nexpose us to fiscal disaster as the baby boomers approach retirement.\n  So we should be clear on what happened. Democrats were for immediate \nstimulus for working families and for prudent long-term tax cuts that \nwould not have jeopardized our fiscal future or the retirement security \nof millions of Americans.\n  The report that we are going to get today from the administration is \ntrying to substitute political sound bites for sound economic \nanalysis. No fair judge would call the administration's economic plan a \nmedal-winning performance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S884-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S884-S888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, under the authority granted to me on \nThursday, February 14, I now call up Calendar No. 65, S. 517.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has the authority. The clerk will \nreport the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n\n       A bill (S. 517) to authorize funding for the Department of \n     Energy to enhance its mission areas through technology \n     transfer and partnerships for the fiscal years 2002 through \n     2006, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself \n     and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2917.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have seen in the last year that energy \nsecurity is related to economic security as well as to national \nsecurity. Americans need and deserve an energy plan that truly moves us \ntowards energy independence. At the same time, America's appetite for \nenergy continues to grow each year. Over the next 10 years, the United \nStates is expected to consume roughly 1.5 trillion gallons of gasoline, \nyet the United States holds only 3 percent of the known world oil \nreserves.\n  There is no question that we need to free ourselves from our \ndependence upon foreign oil and the volatility associated with it. But \nincreased production alone will not meet this demand. It is clear we \nneed a new approach.\n  Last year, Democrats promised our colleagues they would begin an open \ndebate on energy legislation before the Presidents Day recess. Today we \nare keeping that promise and bringing to the floor an example of that \nnew approach, a comprehensive, sensible, and balanced plan to address \nthe energy challenges of our Nation.\n  This bill will achieve a number of important objectives. It will \nreduce our dependence upon foreign oil. It will ensure abundant and \naffordable energy for all Americans. It will create jobs for American \nworkers. It will improve our air quality and reduce emissions of \ngreenhouse gases which will make the United States a more credible \nparticipant in the international effort to address this serious \nproblem.\n  This bill is the work of nine Senate committees. It reflects a broad \nrange of ideas and proposals. It has the provisions that will allow us \nto use our traditional fossil fuel supplies more intelligently and \nincentives to help us diversify our energy supplies with renewable \nsources such as wind and solar, geothermal, and ethanol.\n  This bill also seeks to take advantage of the huge opportunities for \ncommonsense conservation in our cars and homes, the appliances we use \nevery day. In fact, the fuel efficiency provisions of this bill will \nsave the United States as much oil as we import from the Persian Gulf.\n  If the goal--as so many of my colleagues have stated--is true energy \nsecurity, then this is the way to achieve it: By balancing production \nand conservation, innovation, and improvement in existing technology.\n  This bill also recognizes the linkage between energy policy and \nclimate change. To that end, it includes a number of bipartisan \nproposals to confront the rising tide of global warming. It has been \nsaid that we are all continually faced with a series of great \nopportunities brilliantly disguised as insolvable problems. Meeting our \nenergy challenges is a difficult problem, but it is also a great \nopportunity to demonstrate America's strength and American ingenuity.\n  I thank all the chairmen who worked so hard during the last few \nmonths to craft this legislation. I look forward to working closely \nwith them, with my Republican colleagues, and the White House to craft \nfinal legislation that hopefully will be signed into law this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was very pleased to hear the remarks \nof the majority leader relative to the introduction of the energy bill. \nI have that bill here. It is important to recognize that it is about \n500-some-odd pages. It is a very complex bill. I want to make a brief \nreference to the majority leader's comments where he thanked the \nchairmen who helped craft this bill.\n  This is what the bill looks like. As we start in, it is going to be \nquite an educational job because much of the bill is crafted without \nthe input of the members of the committees of jurisdiction.\n  When the majority leader says he wants to thank all chairmen, I join \nand applaud that effort, but what about the members of the committees \nof jurisdiction? To some degree, they have been left out of this \nprocess, which I think is extremely unfortunate. Did they help craft \nthis bill? Were they asked? Clearly the answer is no.\n  As an example, as the ranking member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I can certify that the committee has not had an \nopportunity to, in a markup, deliberate on the merits of this package \nof some 500 pages covering aspects as complex as electricity and \nelectricity deregulation.\n  It is fair to say this bill is going to require a great deal of time \nand a great deal of education. There are technicalities associated with \nthe electrical portion that are so complex that without having a \ncommittee process where it is debated within the committee so that we \nformulate positions and vote out the amendments on the basis of \nexamination, on the basis of a support group of both Republicans and \nDemocrats coming together, we are going to find ourselves in a \nsituation where we have to depend on a lot of time and explanation in \nthe Chamber.\n  Members are going to be torn in the educational process by lobbyists \nwho are going to educate Members on specific issues affecting their \nparticular area of energy-related activities.\n  When the majority leader says he wants to thank the chairmen, I point \nout and elaborate a little further that not only has the Energy \nCommittee been left out of the process but in the area of CAFE, which \nis a very controversial portion of this bill, the Commerce Committee \nhas been left out.\n  The rationale behind that is beyond me, but clearly the majority \nleader has seen fit to take this bill up without the input of the \nactions of the committee of jurisdiction, the Commerce Committee. \nTherefore, we are facing a situation where there is a CAFE standard in \nthe bill and it has not had examination from the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  To some extent this is also true of the Finance Committee inasmuch as \nthe tax components are to come in later, as I understand it, which \nbasically means the various incentives in this bill that are provided \nto encourage new technological developments in recovering energy from \ncoal-bed methane or developing hydrogen, and various other aspects \nwhich we want to encourage through tax incentives are also not in the \nbill because the Finance Committee simply has not been given an \nopportunity to vote out these issues.\n  It is a less-than-perfect process, though it is not the first time we \nhave had a less-than-perfect process around here.\n  As we review these 500 pages of the bill, I put my colleagues on \nnotice that since we finally got the bill introduced, we should reflect \non what we have before us rather than what we do not have; in other \nwords, be positive rather than negative.\n\n  I think the consequences of that reflection bear on the reality that \nI am going to have a lot more to say after we return from the recess. \nBut before we get into the real debate, which will probably occur \nTuesday or Wednesday after returning from the recess, I wish to point \nout a couple of points.\n  The President, in his State of the Union Address, charged us to help \nmake our Nation more secure. That ``us'' means both the House and the \nSenate. The House passed H.R. 4. The House has done its job. The job of \nthe Senate remains in front of us. But I think most Members would \nagree, our energy policy is a critical first step in\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nthis challenge. And it is a challenge. It is a challenge when we fight \nfor freedom, when we seize the day for democracy.\n  The rationale behind these comparisons is one thing. We need energy \nto accomplish them. When we pioneer technologies that save lives, when \nwe turn on the conveniences that mark the differences between modern \nlife and life in the past, we turn to energy.\n  We turn to energy as we look at the standard of living that Americans \nenjoy. If it is an SUV, it is an SUV because Americans prefer that as \nopposed to being dictated by Government as to what type of an \nautomobile they have to drive.\n  When our energy supply is threatened, that is another matter, and \nthat is why the work we are starting today is so critical. That is why \nthe process that got us to this point has been--well, it has been \nfrustrating. It has been a little embarrassing. I have highlighted it \nin my opening remarks.\n  Again, because the majority leader forced the Senate to consider the \nmeasure without the benefit of committee deliberation and action, he \nhas made the task of moving the bill much more complicated than it \nmight be ordinarily.\n  Difficult and divisive issues that could have and should have been \naddressed in committee are now going to be debated in the Senate \nChamber. That is going to require an educational process because many \nMembers simply are not familiar with many of the terms of much of the \ntechnology and there is not a basis of support coming out of the \ncommittee.\n  This is a flawed process, and I think it is unfortunate. It sets \nsomewhat of a precedent in this body that the Energy Committee has \nsimply been directed by the majority leader not to mark up the energy \nbill. That is rather extraordinary.\n  What is the rationale behind it? There are certain aspects in the \nbill to which the majority leader and others object. One of them \ncurrently is the ANWR issue, the contentious issue of the electricity \nmatters, the contentious issue of CAFE, and many others.\n  Some things are left out of this bill. ANWR is certainly left out of \nthe bill and, as a consequence, it is going to take 60 votes to put it \nin. Had we been able to vote it out of the Energy Committee--and we had \nthe votes to put it in the energy package--why, it only would have \ntaken 50 votes. The psychology is very clear. The majority leader has \nseen fit to set it up so that it requires a 60-vote point of order.\n  We can point fingers in each direction, and certainly in this \npolitical process within the rules of the Senate everything is fair, \nbut I did want to bring this to the attention of my colleagues.\n\n  Even with additional hurdles being put before us on this overall \nbill, I believe we can and I believe we must move the bill off the \nfloor and get it to conference, but we must do it in a way that \naddresses the difficult policy decisions that are before us rather than \navoid them.\n  What we have to do in realism and what is expected is to build a \nbridge. There is no question that we see in the numerous polls that the \ncountry expects us to pass an energy bill. The Nation needs an energy \nbill, one that is rooted in finding new alternative energy sources, one \nthat boosts our efficiency, helps us use less energy.\n  We all agree with this, but efficiency and alternatives alone are \nsimply a two-legged stool. Alone they will not close the gap between \nenergy supply and energy demand in this Nation. We must also seek to \nsafely increase our domestic energy resources. We must do it in a way \nthat protects our environment, and we can. We have the technology. We \nhave proven ourselves.\n  Make no mistake, we are the most energy-efficient economy in the \nworld, and we are getting better. So I think we have to recognize our \nstandard of living is directly related to the efficient use of energy.\n  Since the 1970s, it now takes 40 percent less energy to produce each \ndollar of our GDP.\n  This chart shows in 1973 it took approximately 18,000 Btu per dollar \nof our domestic GDP, and today we are down to roughly 10,000 Btu per \ndollar. That is realism. That is progress. That is efficiency. That is \nthe American way of life. It is the American standard of living. So we \nhave become 42 percent more efficient per dollar of GDP. Our efficiency \nhas increased.\n  We are going to hear a lot of criticism that we consume a quarter of \nthe world's energy. I will acknowledge we consume a quarter of the \nworld's energy, but let's hear the other side of the argument. We \nproduce a quarter of the world's economy. That does not come by magic. \nWe do not pick that off a tree. It is directly related to energy and \nour efficiency. Without the efficiency, we would not be using a quarter \nof the world's energy; we would be using a lot more. We use energy to \nproduce a quarter of the world's economy. Let us keep that in mind and \nbe proud of it, proud of the American worker and proud of our energy-\nproducing industries that provide jobs in this country.\n  In doing so, we have proven we can balance our conservation and our \nenvironmental protection with increased domestic energy production. \nThat does not mean we are doing it perfectly, but we are doing a better \njob, and we can continue to improve. For that reason, I refuse to take \npart in this fable being put forth by some in the environmental \ncommunity in their spin machine that says this Nation needs to make a \nchoice, a choice between using the energy technologies of today--our \ncoal, our oil, our gas, our hydro, our nuclear--or using energy \ntechnologies of tomorrow. Reality dictates we have to use both.\n\n  Some say we have to spend on technology, and if we spend, we will \ndevelop that technology. That is very easy to say. We have expended \nover $6 billion in the last 6 or 7 years on advanced technology through \ngrants and through the Department of Energy, and we should continue \nthat. But to listen to some who say this debate is about energy vis-a-\nvis the environment, that is to say it is about today versus tomorrow. \nSome insist whatever solutions we propose, they cannot be done safely \ntoday. That logic, in my opinion, sells the American worker and \nAmerican ingenuity far too short.\n  We need to strive for new technologies that diversify our energy \nsupply. We need to conserve more. We need to become more energy \nefficient. If this bill passes, we will not be driving hydrogen cars \ntomorrow. We will not be powered by solar or wind by tomorrow morning. \nWe simply cannot shut down the economy of this Nation and put our \nNation's national security on hold for a generation or more while we \nwork on a new technology that simply displaces our current dependence \non coal, oil, gas, hydro, and nuclear. We have to build a bridge to the \nfuture. I think that is one of the cautions I have about this bill.\n  Some suggest we can simply get there through conservation. Even if we \nget to the point where wind and solar and alternative energies emerge \nup to 20 percent of our energy mix, where does the other 80 percent \ncome from? It comes from energy sources we use today: Coal, oil, \nnatural gas, hydro, nuclear. We must thoroughly explore new \ntechnologies to reduce our consumption in the coming years.\n  One of the problems I have with this bill is their proposal on CAFE, \nto move it up to 37, 38 miles per gallon. That is a very easy thing to \nsay: Let's do it. How one gets there from here is something else and, \nas usual, the devil is in the details because the timeframe is \nsomewhere in the area of 15 years before we have to be held accountable \nfor setting a goal today that is going to come due 15 years from now. \nMost of us will not be here.\n  So who is going to be held accountable? It is easy to say, and vote \nfor, let us get 37 or 38 miles. But what does it really mean? Does it \nmean safer cars, lighter cars? What does it mean for the American \nautomobile industry in competing with the foreign automobile \nmanufacturers, the cost of cars, the American labor? There are many \nissues involved.\n  Sure, we have to conserve more. We have to get better mileage. But do \nwe want the Federal Government to dictate to the American people what \ntype of an automobile they can buy or do the American people want their \nstandard of living to dictate that?\n  I think these are some of the things we have to consider because we \nhave more than 200 million cars on the road and oil will continue to be \nthe primary ingredient in our surface transportation needs for the \nforeseeable future,\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\neven if we do get up to the 30 miles per gallon.\n  One can buy that kind of a car. They can buy a 56-mile-per-gallon car \nif they want to. So the technology is out there. The question is, How \ndo we get the American people to move over there?\n  Some are going to hang on to their old cars. They certainly have that \nright. We know some are going to take advantage of circumstances \ndepending on their environment and where they live. If someone drives a \nlong way and they want to be in comfort, they might want, obviously, a \nmore comfortable car. If they have a quick commute, they might get by \nwith a smaller car. My point is, we have these choices available \ncurrently.\n\n  The other issue is, again, as we address goals, which I certainly \nsupport, we also have to address heavily the accountability to achieve \nthose goals. There are going to be efforts by NHTSA, which is the \norganization that evaluates the technical ability to increase mileage; \nthey are going to come up with a study and some figures. I think we \nshould try to balance the attainability with the reality associated \nwith CAFE standards.\n  Furthermore, other sources of power are often confused with \ntransportation because we have a lot of energy sources--we have gas, \nhydro, coal, and as I have said, nuclear--but what moves America and \nwhat moves the world is oil. We have no other alternative. Perhaps we \nwish we had. So we have to be careful to recognize the vulnerability of \nthis Nation as we find ourselves 57 percent dependent on imported oil, \nand it is growing. The recognition that we are not going to have other \nrelief for moving America other than oil I think has to be reinforced \nin the minds of many Members. One does not fly in and out of \nWashington, DC, on hot air, even though there is a little bit around \nhere from time to time.\n  We have over 100 nuclear plants across the country. They are very \nimportant because they provide emission-free energy. Twenty percent of \nour entire energy mix is produced by nuclear. New electricity plants \nare being built today that run on natural gas. Yet we are pulling down \nour reserves of natural gas faster than we are finding new reserves. \nThat is a fact. The United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have \ncenturies of supply. Can we use our technology to make our coal \ncleaner? We can. We can use these resources, and we can use them in a \nmore efficient way, and we have to do that.\n  I conclude with a reference to jobs and the economy. Development of \nour domestic resources means lots and lots of jobs, thousands of jobs \nacross the country, for crafting pipe, developing new software, \nbuilding double-hull supertankers to move our oil from Alaska, my \nState, down to Washington and California.\n  This is a requirement under the Jones Act that mandates that oil must \ntravel in U.S. vessels between two American ports, from Valdez down to \nthe San Francisco Bay area, or the Puget Sound area, Los Angeles, and \nunload; double-hulled, supermillennium tankers built in U.S. shipyards \nwith U.S. crews, not foreign ships coming from Saudi Arabia.\n  They provide high-paying, high-skilled jobs that will help turn our \neconomy around and help get us back out of this recession. So jobs and \nthe economy are very important as we address this energy bill.\n  It is estimated we lost 700,000 jobs in this country since September \n11. It is payback time. It is time to put American workers back to \nwork. I reject the underlying premise of those who oppose domestic \nresource development and those who do not believe the American worker \nand American technology can develop our natural resources while fully \nprotecting the environment.\n  Some may unrealistically fail to recognize they can choose to rely on \nSaddam Hussein and others for energy supplies because we are currently \nimporting somewhere in excess of 750,000 barrels a day from Saddam \nHussein. On September 11, we were importing a million barrels a day. We \nall know we are enforcing a no-fly zone. We take out targets, we \nendanger lives of American men and women. We have been doing that since \n1992. We also know that as we take his oil and put it in our airplanes \nand take out his targets, he takes our money, develops missile \ncapability and aims it at our ally, Israel. We have not had U.N. \ninspectors in that country for 7 years. I hope we do not stand up \nsomeday and say, as we are saying about Osama bin Laden, we responded \ntoo late. We know what happened with bin Laden and his terrorists. They \nwere active in taking out our embassy. They were active in other \nterrorist activities. We waited. Are we going to wait too long with \nSaddam Hussein and Iraq as they build up the weapons?\n  There is a day of reckoning at some point in time. We will have to \nface the reality of what Saddam Hussein will do, or our insistence that \nwe inspect with the U.N. authority. The longer we put it off, the more \ndevastating the retaliation on his part might be. We have to reflect on \nthat. That is why I am so adamant in encouraging my colleagues to stand \nwith some of the proposals and amendments that will be offered to \nreduce dependence on the Middle East.\n  A way to do that is to open up that very tiny portion of the Arctic \nin Alaska. I will show the location. It is important in this debate to \nreassert the footprint. This area, called ANWR, is pretty big, 19 \nmillion acres; 19 million acres is the size of the State of South \nCarolina. In this case, we have wilderness in the light yellow, refuge \nin the dark color. Congress set up the Coastal Plain with the authority \nto determine whether it should be open and put up for competitive \nlease. This is the area where the prospects for major discovery are \nmost likely to occur.\n  It is estimated by the geologists that the recovery of oil in this \narea is somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels. What does that \nreally mean? We have all heard of Prudhoe Bay. We have seen the 800-\nmile pipeline between Prudhoe Bay and Valdez. At one time, it was \ncarrying 2 million barrels a day, 25 percent of the total crude oil \nproduced in this country. Today, it is a little over a million barrels \na day, about 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in this \ncountry.\n  What was the field estimated to produce? Ten billion barrels. It is \non the 13 billionth barrel. If the estimates are correct, somewhere \nbetween 5.6 and 16 billion barrels; if you want an average of 10 \nbillion barrels, it is as big as Prudhoe Bay.\n\n  The pipeline is in place. We are not talking about that. We are \ntalking about building laterals over here about 70 miles. This could be \nequal to what we import from Saudi Arabia for 30 years or Iraq for 40 \nyears. When Members say it is insignificant or it is a 6-month supply, \nMembers must recognize that argument simply does not hold oil. Some say \nit will be 10 years. We built the Empire State Building in a couple \nyears, the Pentagon in a couple of years. We could have oil flowing in \na couple of years.\n  When will it occur? In the wintertime. How does it look in the \nwintertime? The winter is long. I will show you what it looks like. \nWinter in Prudhoe Bay, winter in ANWR, runs about 10 months of the \nyear. It is tough. What is the footprint in the wintertime? We have ice \nroad technology, so there is no permanent scar on the tundra. This is \nan ice road. No gravel. Simply remove the snow, build a pad, put water \non it, take saltwater from the Arctic Ocean. This is the pad. That is \nthe drilling.\n  What does it look like in the summertime as a consequence of this \ntype of environmental commitment? That is it.\n  Returning to the first chart with a brief explanation, keep size in \nperspective. This area is 1.5 million acres out of 19 million acres. \nThe House bill said we could only make a footprint of 2,000 acres. That \nis what we are asking in the amendment which we will offer in this \nbill--2,000 acres of 19 million acres. Somebody in South Carolina that \nhas a 2,000-acre farm can relate to that. Gee, only 2,000 acres out of \nour whole State. The rest of the State will be either a wilderness or a \nrefuge.\n  Some say we should not be doing anything. They do not understand what \nrefuges are. This is a map of refuges for oil and gas and minerals that \nare developed in California, Texas, and Montana. These are the specific \nareas of activities. Louisiana has a lot of activity in refuges. Oil \nand gas exploration is not foreign to refuges.\n  Again, emphasize the footprint for those participating in viewing \nthis\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nchart; 2,000 acres is it. There is a village already here for those who \nsuggest somehow we are bringing a footprint in an area where there has \nnever been a footprint. There is an airstrip, the old radar station. \nAbout 300 or 400 people live there. There are the kids going to school.\n  My point is, there are people up there--not very many--but they want \na better way of life. This is a little social club. They want the same \nadvantages you and I have: Reasonable health care, opportunities for \ntheir children, insurance. It all relates to jobs. They do not want \nwelfare reform.\n  Some say we should not disturb their custom. Do we want to put a \nfence around those people? They have television. They know what is \ngoing on in the world. Their customs change. They maintain traditions. \nThat is very important because that is who you are.\n  By the same token, they do not want to live as they used to. You and \nI know what a honeybucket is. A honeybucket is an indoor toilet, really \na pail, as opposed to running water that you and I enjoy. They do not \nwant to live that way anymore. They want schools, opportunities, and \neducation. They support this. Yet there are some in the environmental \ncommunity who would dictate how they prefer them to live, how they \nprefer them not to have jobs.\n  As we look at this transition of our culture and our people, \nrecognize this is a very balanced area. If some are interested in more \nwilderness, I don't know whether that is possible or not. Clearly, we \nhave wilderness. We have refuges. We have a development. We have a very \nsmall footprint.\n  I hope, with this brief explanation, more Members can reflect on the \nreality that this can be done right. We have the technology to do it. I \nhave faith and confidence in this Nation's men and women who drive our \nenergy resources.\n  We need an energy bill that provides today's resources to move us to \ntomorrow's promise, not shallow measures with empty promises that \nexport our wealth and jeopardize national security, and ship our U.S. \njobs overseas.\n  I recognize the public policy debate about how best to approach our \nenergy policy is complex and will involve issues at the very heart of \nthe extreme environmental agenda. I think we should frame this in a \nsimple manner, in a manner the American people can understand. Is it \nbetter to have a strong domestic energy policy that safeguards our \nenvironment and our national security than to rely on the likes of \nSaddam Hussein and others to supply this energy--countries in the \nMideast that are clearly unstable and will be for some time? The answer \nin my mind is clearly yes.\n  I know some in this Chamber suggest this energy bill is just \npolitics, pure and simple. As far as another piece of the puzzle being \nlaid out is concerned, we have heard all kinds of explanations of why \nthis is bad. We have had broad support for reducing our dependence on \nimported energy sources. We have had veterans groups come up and \nsupport it. The response has been: ``False patriotism.'' I think that \nis inappropriate.\n  I refer to reality. Reality dictated a comment that was made by Mark \nHatfield, the Senator from Oregon. I served with Mark for many years. \nHe was a pacifist. He said: I'll vote for opening up this area, this \nsliver of the Coastal Plain, in a minute, rather than vote for a \nmeasure that would send American men and women overseas, in harm's way, \nto fight a war over oil in the Mideast.\n  As we look at the attitude of American veterans associations that \nsupport developing an oil supply here at home, I think we have to \nreflect on the comments of some of our Members who suggest this matter \nis really about false patriotism. They could not be more wrong.\n  I have been around here a long time. I have been around here long \nenough to know lots of people do things for their own reasons. What we \ncannot do is sell short the American family, the American laborer--\nAmerica's future, if you will. Energy is not about politics. It is \nabout families across the country wondering if their jobs will be there \nin the morning. It is about preserving the very independence of this \nNation. I believe in a nation that is dependent on no one but God \nalone.\n  Our President has made it clear. President Bush has mentioned, from \ntime to time, the necessity of having the Senate pass an energy bill. \nAs recently as the State of the Union Address, he stated the urgent \nneed for a national energy plan. He laid it down as one of his first \nproposals, with the Vice President. It is known. It has been \npublicized. It has been examined.\n  He knows energy is about jobs. He knows energy is about security. He \nwants to protect this Nation from what he calls a real axis of evil. \nWhen we apply that to Saddam Hussein, it sticks. To some extent it \nsticks in Iran. The very fact that we intercepted a ship filled with \narmaments for the PLO demonstrates that. Our President knows, as long \nas we are dependent on other nations for our energy, our very national \nsecurity is threatened and our future is at stake. So we should make \nevery effort, every responsible effort, to reduce that dependence.\n  Our challenge is clear. It is to deliver to this President an energy \nplan for our Nation and an energy plan for our Nation's future. I urge \nmy colleagues to recognize the weight of this task before us as we \nbegin the process. We should come together to have the courage to vote \non the difficult issues and do what is right for our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, yesterday the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers released a report claiming that the Bush tax cuts are \nresponsible for keeping the recession more mild than it otherwise would \nbe. They claim that the already passed tax cut has raised prospects for \na solid recovery and that by the end of this year there will be 800,000 \nmore jobs than there otherwise would have been.\n  The report of the Council of Economic Advisers is somewhat curious. \nIt is obviously self-serving. It does make a fundamental mistake. It \ntries to suggest that the Bush tax cut, which centered on the reduction \nof income tax rates principally benefiting the highest paid and most \naffluent Americans, is the cause of the slight stimulus we have seen \nover the last few months when in fact, to be honest about it, it has \nbeen the proposed rebates championed initially by the Democrats, not \npart of the initial Bush proposal, that has provided some stimulus \neffect over the last several months.\n  That goes to the nature of, first, a rebate directly to a whole host \nof Americans across a broad income range. Those rebates typically were \nspent, and that seems to be the case in this situation.\n  The reality of the Bush tax proposals is that, first, they were not \neffective this year. Much of his tax cut proposal does not become \neffective until the following fiscal year. As a result, to make claims \nthat his tax concept is a part of this stimulus effect is rather \nsuspicious on its face.\n  To suggest, as I think is the suggestion, that this ``tax plan'' will \nlead to further stimulus of our economy is also suspicious. What it \nwill lead to, which is already apparent, is increased Federal deficits. \nThis year, because of the poor economic performance of the country, we \nhave seen the Federal deficit materialize. But as we go forward, most \nof that deficit can be attributed not to adverse economic circumstances \nbut to the tax cut. As we deny resources that are necessary to have \nthis Government function and operate effectively in many different \nareas, we will see the deficit grow and grow.\n\n  The problem there becomes, in order to fund Federal programs, we must \ngo into the debt markets. We must borrow\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\nmore money. That puts pressure on interest rates, and that helps retard \nour economic progress and our growth.\n  The notion that the Bush plan has materially aided and assisted our \nrecovery or softened the recession is very dubious.\n  What is also unfortunate is that in the last few weeks, as we have \ndebated a possible stimulus package, there have been several proposals, \none of which would be broadening the rebate we enacted last spring to \ninclude those Americans who did not pay income taxes but paid a great \ndeal of taxes in terms of payroll taxes and other forms of wage \ntaxation. I don't know how many times I have been in the Chamber and \nheard Republicans assail that approach as being inappropriate, \nineffective, and inefficient.\n  What is curious is that the one aspect of last spring's tax plan that \nhelped the rebates through the income tax system is being not only \ntrumpeted as a Bush proposal but that exact or closely similar approach \nextended to payroll taxes is being derided and criticized by \nRepublicans in the Senate as being something unworthy of the Senate.\n  I disagree. Frankly, last year if we had adopted a proposal to cut \ntaxes that was targeted to lower income Americans, that was broad to \ninclude not just rebates for income taxes but rebates for payroll \ntaxes, we would have seen a much less severe recession than we are \nseeing right now.\n  In effect, what we have today is the Council of Economic Advisers not \nproviding good economic analysis but providing political spin on the \ntax plan we passed last year. I hope when we go back and reconsider the \nstimulus package, we will understand what stimulates the economy and \nnot what is appealing to the political winds of the moment.\n  Again, we are in the grips of a recession. There are multiple causes. \nThe President's tax proposal as originally proposed certainly did very \nlittle, if anything at all, to help soften the recession. I hope that \nwill become more and more apparent.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in joining the Secretary of \nAgriculture in applauding the decision that was reached by our U.S. \nTrade Representative this morning on the 301 investigation into the \nCanadian Wheat Board and on durum wheat. I think Minnesota is a \nproducer of durum, as we are in the Dakotas and in Montana. In her \nstatement--and I associate with her words this morning--we support the \nimmediate actions outlined in this decision, which will help us to move \nforward, removing the longstanding barrier in U.S.-Canadian relations. \nWe are committed to working with the USTR in our country and, of \ncourse, with the WTO, and those trade negotiations should produce \ndiscipline which will lead to fundamental reform.\n  As you well know, that has been a bone of contention among grain \nproducers in this country and, of course, with this Government and its \nrelationship with Canada.\n  This morning, I heard a statement from a colleague who quoted a news \narticle from a western producer in Canada, and by a secondhand source, \nthat claimed the Secretary of Agriculture urged her Canadian \ncounterpart to lobby Congress regarding the farm bill. I find that very \nunusual. In fact, I asked the Secretary this morning about that. I \npicked up the phone and called the Secretary and she denied making any \nsuch statement in its entirety. She did call the Minister of \nAgriculture in Canada, and he apologized for misstatements of his \nstaff. Of course, I find that everybody is entitled to their opinion \nand everybody is entitled also to the facts. I would find it very \nunusual if another country got involved in the internal affairs of \nanother. They usually do not do that, although we are now, it seems, at \nthe end of the debate of the farm bill. That is not going to weigh in \nas it goes into conference. It is important legislation.\n\n  If there was ever a time for solidarity in agriculture, it is now. I \nsay that to agriculturalists around the world because it seems as if we \nhave gotten into this mindset that it is a right to have what we \nproduce, when basically we have to figure out a way to make a living at \nit, one. Two, we don't like to see hungry people either, but quit \nputting up rules and regulations and deal with the market forces that \nwould allow us to produce food and fiber in this country.\n  It seems in this community and in the agricultural community, if we \nwant to take a shot at somebody, instead of using a straight line, we \nuse a circle for firing squads. That usually isn't a very good \nsituation. This morning, I again join the Secretary of Agriculture in \nthis 301 finding. Now we will move on and try to deal with the \nsituation with the Canadian Wheat Board. Living on the Canadian border \nis always a source of irritation whenever we have to move livestock and \ngrain back and forth across the Canadian border. Of course, with the \nculture as it is in our State, and as it is in Alberta and \nSaskatchewan, our values are alike. Most of our problems are from east \nof the 100th meridian in understanding the situations we have to deal \nwith in our production of food and fiber.\n  So I hope we can work this out and get away from misstatements or \nmisguided statements and come together in the agricultural community \nand work together because I think the time has come that we are going \nto need some solidarity, especially from producers. I don't see \nprocessors having a hard time or purveyors having a hard time or any \ndistributors of the food product having a hard time. But I know there \nare hard times when it comes to the production of food and fiber \nbecause we can't get a handle on our cost of production. We have to \ncontinue to think about that as Americans and think about the security \nthat we have. Ours is about the only country in the world where you can \nhave fresh lettuce in grocery stores in the wintertime in Minnesota.\n  It is a wonderful system in this country. You don't know how great it \nis until you travel around the world. Nonetheless, there are some \nmisgivings about what it costs and the work that it takes to get the \nbeans to the table.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss two disturbing and \nshameful milestones for our Nation, one that we reached this past \nDecember and one that is fast approaching. The milestone we have \nreached: 100 people in the United States have now been exonerated \nthrough the use of DNA testing. The milestone that approaches: The \n100th exoneration of a death row inmate.\n  We can no longer ignore the fact that innocent people can, and do, \nget convicted in our country, and in some cases they are sentenced to \ndeath. We need to focus on these cases. We need to learn from them. And \nwe need to do something about them. This is not a matter of whether you \nare for or against the death penalty, it is a matter of common \nconscience for our Nation.\n  So let me turn, first, to milestone No. 1, the 100th DNA exoneration.\n  In December 2001, a man named Larry Mayes became the 100th person in \nthe United States to be exonerated by postconviction DNA testing. Mayes \nserved 21 years in Indiana's prisons for a rape and a robbery--21 years \nfor a rape and a robbery--but a rape and a robbery he did not commit. \nFor 21 years an innocent man sat behind bars.\n  How was he exonerated? Was it by brilliant lawyers? Was it by the \njustice system recognizing a mistake? No. It\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nwas by law students at the Cardozo Law School's Innocence Project. They \nspent years searching for the rape kit that had been used at trial, \nonly to be told it had been lost.\n  But, fortunately--and, actually, fortuitously--the rape kit \neventually resurfaced, and DNA testing proved what Mayes had been \nsaying all along to anybody who would listen: He was the wrong guy.\n  This has become a familiar story. You can hardly pick up a paper \nthese days without reading about another person freed by DNA testing. \nLarry Mayes was No. 100, but No. 101 was not far behind.\n  Shortly after Mayes was released, Indiana prosecutors asked a court \nto vacate the conviction of another man, Richard Alexander, after DNA \ntests persuaded them of his innocence.\n  Like Mayes, Alexander was officially cleared of all charges and \nreleased.\n  Just last week we learned that DNA tests had cleared yet another man, \nBruce Godschalk, although the Philadelphia prosecutors initially \nrefused to let him out of prison. He was finally released yesterday, \nafter 15 years of what he called ``a living hell.''\n  Attorney General Ashcroft has referred to DNA testing as a kind of \ntruth machine, which can ensure justice both by identifying the guilty \nand by clearing the innocent. The Attorney General and I agree on this, \nand I think most prosecutors would agree on this.\n  I had the privilege of being a prosecutor for 8\\1/2\\ years. I know \nnothing worried me more--this would be similar for any good \nprosecutor--than thinking that you might charge the wrong person. You \nwanted to make sure the person you charged was guilty. You do \neverything possible to make sure that you do not put into the system \nsomebody who is innocent. Because the fact is that in many cases, the \nprosecutor is going to get a conviction no matter what.\n  That is why some prosecutors have taken the initiative when it comes \nto DNA testing, by systematically reviewing their convictions with an \neye toward identifying cases in which DNA testing may be appropriate, \nand then offering testing to the inmates in those cases. It is an \ninteresting choice to make. These prosecutors understand that their job \nis not to get convictions but to get at the truth, whatever it might \nbe, even if it means admitting error.\n  It could be a two-edged sword, too, because you have some who will \nclaim innocence but do not want the DNA testing because they know the \nclaim may not be real. But for some who are there, the claim is real. \nAnd those in the criminal justice system must make every effort to make \nsure they have the right person. I applaud those prosecutors who, \nhaving secured a conviction, say, if you think DNA is going to prove \ndifferently, then we will give you the DNA test.\n  Unfortunately, there are still some prosecutors and some courts that \ncontinue to resist requests for postconviction DNA testing. It took \nBruce Godschalk 7 years to get access to the DNA evidence that showed \nhis innocence, and weeks more before he was freed. When I prepared \nthese remarks, he was still in prison.\n  We committed ourselves to addressing this problem more than a year \nago when Congress passed legislation in which we resolved to work with \nthe States to assure access to postconviction DNA testing in \nappropriate cases. We can make good on our commitment in this session \nby passing the Innocence Protection Act, which I introduced last year \nwith Senator Smith, Senator Susan Collins, and others, which now has 25 \ncosponsors in the Senate, more than 200 in the House.\n  The bipartisan Innocence Protection Act proposes a number of basic \ncommonsense reforms to our criminal justice system. One of the \nprincipal reforms is aimed at ensuring that people like Larry Mayes and \nRichard Alexander and Bruce Godschalk can get the DNA tests they need \nto prove their innocence.\n  The need for Federal legislation could not be clearer. Just last \nmonth, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that convicted \noffenders do not have a constitutional right to postconviction DNA \ntesting. They reversed a lower court ruling in the case of a man \nserving 25 years for a rape he claims he did not commit. The Fourth \nCircuit concluded that postconviction DNA testing must be conferred by \neither State or Federal legislation.\n\n  When I first introduced the Innocence Protection Act in February of \n2000, only two States, New York and Illinois, had any postconviction \nlegislation dealing with DNA testing. Since then more than 20 States \nhave acted. My cosponsors and I are gratified that our bill has been a \ncatalyst for reform in many of these States, but there is much more to \ndo. By passing the Innocence Protection Act, we can assure that the DNA \ntruth machine is available nationwide to help remedy miscarriages of \njustice.\n  We should also be doing more to fund the use of DNA technology. In \nDecember 2000, Congress authorized two new grant programs to help our \nState crime labs update their facilities and reduce the backlog of \nuntested DNA evidence. Unfortunately, the administration has not \nrequested any funding for one of these programs, and neither is fully \nfunded.\n  To make matters worse, the Justice Department recently decided to \nshelve its plans to make $750,000 in grants available for \npostconviction DNA testing. In a multibillion-dollar budget, the \nJustice Department said it could not make available a small amount to \nmake sure that the people we have locked up are the right people. It is \none thing to talk the talk at the Department of Justice; it is time for \nthem to walk the walk. Certainly if they find that this cannot be \nfunded when their budget comes before my committee, I will look very \ncarefully at what things they believe should be funded.\n  With more than 100 DNA exonerations nationwide, we can be pretty sure \nthat more testing would uncover more wrongful convictions and save \ninnocent lives. I hope the Department reconsiders its ill-founded \ndecision and moves forward with this important program.\n  Let me turn now to milestone No. 2. An estimated 99 people have been \nexonerated and freed from death row since 1973, according to the Death \nPenalty Information Center. If history is any indicator, another death \nrow inmate will be exonerated in the next few months, bringing the \ntotal to 100.\n  To put this in perspective, consider this: 2 years ago, when I first \nintroduced the Innocence Protection Act, I pointed out the startling \nnumber of cases in which death row inmates had been exonerated after \nlong stays in prison. The number then was 85. In just 2 years, another \n14 people have been cleared of the crimes that sent them to death row. \nThese are people convicted, on death row, waiting to take that last \nwalk down to the death chamber and be executed, and only at the last \nminute we find, sorry, made a mistake, got the wrong guy. Gee, glad we \ndidn't pull the switch.\n  Most recently, in January, in the State of the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, prosecutors decided to drop all charges against Juan \nRoberto Melendez. He had spent 18 years on death row. A State judge \noverturned his conviction last year after determining that prosecutors \nin the original trial withheld critical information.\n  Not long before Melendez was released, the State of Idaho released a \nman named Charles Fain, who had also served 18 years on death row. The \nAttorney General of Idaho, Alan Lance, deserves a great deal of credit \nfor authorizing postconviction DNA tests in this case and then--when \nthe tests came back in Fain's favor--asking a Federal court to throw \nout the conviction. I applaud the Attorney General for doing that.\n  The third recent death exoneree was a man named Jeremy Sheets, who \nhad served 4 years on Nebraska's death row. The prosecutors dropped all \nthe charges against him after their State supreme court overturned the \nconviction.\n  Some people would argue that exonerations like these prove that the \nsystem is working. If you sat for years and years and years on death \nrow or spent 21 years in prison all for crimes you did not commit, all \nin cases where if people just checked the evidence they would know they \nhave the wrong person, and then they open the door of the prison and \nsay, sorry about that great chunk of your life, we will give you a new \nsuit and a bus ticket out of here, you can leave now, would you say \nthat is a system that is working? Families and lives are destroyed.\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n  In June of the year 2000, Professor James Liebman and his colleagues \nat the Columbia Law School released the most comprehensive statistical \nstudy ever undertaken in modern American capital appeals. They found \nthat serious error permeates American's death penalty system, \ncompelling courts to reverse more than two-thirds of all death \nverdicts.\n  With the capital system collapsing under the weight of its mistakes, \nthe risk of executing the innocent is shockingly high.\n  Part II of the Columbia study, which was just released this week, \nreaffirms the fundamental conclusion of his first study--that the death \npenalty is fraught with errors and inconsistencies nationwide. But it \nalso adds a new and disturbing twist: In a rigorous empirical \nexamination, the new study shows that the States and counties that use \nthe death penalty most are also the most error-prone, and the most \nlikely to send innocent people to death row. When I read that, it sent \na shiver up my spine. The States and counties that use the death \npenalty the most are the ones most likely to make mistakes.\n  When the legal machinery of the death penalty system is broken, \npractice does not make perfect. It is leading to more mistakes. Can you \nimagine how long any commercial enterprise would last if it accepted \nand refused to correct failure rates like these? And this is not a \ncommercial enterprise; here we are talking about life and death \ndecisions.\n  There is one other thing we should keep in mind. If the wrong person \nis on death row for a murder, if somebody is convicted of a murder they \ndid not commit, that means that the real murderer is still running \nloose. Maybe everybody can feel comfortable that we have locked up \nsomebody for that murder, but if there is still a killer on the loose, \neverything has broken down. Not only is an innocent man on death row, \nbut a guilty man is running free.\n  Thanks to the careful research of Professor Liebman and his team, \nresponsible people from across the political spectrum are now united in \nacknowledging that the question is not whether the system is broken, \nbut whether it can be fixed.\n  Shortly after the Judiciary Committee held its most recent hearing on \nthis subject last year, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nexpressed skepticism about the administration of capital punishment in \nthe Nation.\n  She said:\n\n       The system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to \n     be executed.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       Perhaps it is time to look at minimum standards for \n     appointed counsel in death cases and adequate compensation \n     for appointed counsel when they are used.\n\n  I could not agree more. In fact, the reforms suggested by Justice \nO'Connor mirror core components of the Innocence Protection Act.\n  In addition to providing for postconviction DNA testing, our bill \nwould establish a national commission to formulate reasonable minimum \nstandards for ensuring competent counsel in capital cases. Ask any good \nprosecutor. They will tell you they want a good, competent counsel on \nthe other side. You want to make sure you do not make mistakes.\n  As a prosecutor, I might win a case only to have it go up on appeal \nand get thrown out because of incompetent counsel on the other side. \nFive years later, I will be retrying the case. You want to do it right.\n  DNA tests, which have exonerated so many, are not as much a solution \nto the death penalty problem as they are a window, exposing the flaws \nof a broken system.\n  We have to understand in many cases--perhaps most--there will be no \nDNA evidence. In many cases--perhaps most criminal cases--there are no \nfingerprints. This is not Perry Mason. There probably will not be any \nDNA or fingerprints.\n  But where there is DNA evidence, it can show us conclusively, even \nyears after a conviction, where mistakes have been made. And what it \nhas shown us in case after case is that many of the mistakes that have \nlanded innocent people in prison and on death row could have been \navoided--and probably would have been avoided--if the defense counsel \nhad been reasonably competent.\n  Ensuring competent counsel is the single most important step we can \ntake to get at the truth and protect innocent lives. By helping States \nimprove the quality of legal representation in their life or death \ncases, the Innocence Protection Act strikes at the very heart of \ninjustice in the administration of capital punishment.\n  As I said when I began, it is not a question of whether you are for \nor against the death penalty. People of good conscience can and will \ndisagree on the morality of the death penalty. But we all share the \ngoal of preventing the execution of the innocent. I hope Senators will \nread the Columbia Law School study and consider the comments of Justice \nO'Connor. We should reflect on these two milestones and ask ourselves \nif we are satisfied with a system that condemns one innocent person to \ndeath for every 7 or 8 that it executes. It is past time for the \nstraightforward reforms of the Innocence Protection Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S891-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S891-S894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE BYRD RULE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Thursday a week ago yesterday, the Secretary \nof the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, appeared before the Senate Budget \nCommittee, at which time he and I had a discussion of the Senate rules, \nand particularly the ``Byrd Rule.'' I ask unanimous consent that the \ndiscussion to which I refer be printed in the Record. It speaks for \nitself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Byrd. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\n       On page 51 of the first volume of the President's Budget, I \n     noted the picture of Gulliver being tied down by the \n     Lilliputians. Here it is. The caption beneath it reads: \n     ``Many departments are tied up in a morass of Lilliputian \n     do's and don't's.\n       This is not the first time that the administration has \n     invoked the word ``Lilliputian'' when referring to the \n     priorities of Congress. It makes me wonder if the \n     administration may not be requiring the members of the \n     Cabinet to read Jonathan Swift's masterpiece of satire.\n       Last year, before the National Association for Business \n     Economics, Mr. Secretary, you used the word ``Lilliputian'' \n     in referring to the application of the Byrd rule on \n     reconsideration bills. You were quoted as saying: ``the rules \n     that have been created by just ordinary people are in some \n     ways more and more like the Lilliputians tying us to the \n     ground. I do not know why we have to live by these rules; \n     after all, so far as I can tell, God did not send them.''\n       Inasmuch as you have invoked the name of the Creator, I \n     would say that God works in mysterious ways his wonders to \n     perform. This is not my quotation, but he does. He believes \n     in rules, too. He gave them to Moses on Mount Sinai--the Ten \n     Commandments. They hang in my office. Those are rules. I feel \n     that God had his hand upon the destiny of this country when \n     those illustrious men gathered in Philadelphia to create the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       I do not know whether or not you have read Catherine \n     Drinker Bowen's book, but she says that at no other time \n     could these men have written this Constitution, which has \n     proved to be the earliest written Constitution in the world \n     and the most successful one. She says that 5 years earlier, \n     the people and their representatives who were at the \n     Convention would not have experienced enough of the \n     disadvantages or the shortcomings that they needed to have \n     experienced to have written this Constitution. She says that \n     were it 5 years later, the people would have been turned off \n     by the excesses of the French Revolution and the carnage by \n     the guillotine.\n       So the clock struck just at the right time. As far as I was \n     concerned, that was God's hand, if you want to invoke God's \n     name; that was God's hand at work.\n       You said ``The rules that have been created by just \n     ordinary people''--the rules, Mr. Secretary, of the Senate \n     have only had seven revisions in the more than 200 years of \n     the Senate's history. Their roots go back into the House of \n     Commons in Great Britain. Their roots go back to the \n     Continental Congress. Their roots go back to the \n     Confederation.\n       We are using rules of which the first 20 were written \n     within the first 10 days of the Constitutional Convention's \n     meeting. Those are rules.\n       Let us compare what Thomas Jefferson says about rules. Let \n     us compare it with what you say. You said, ``The rules that \n     have been created by just ordinary people are in some ways \n     more and more like the Lilliputians tying us''--now, who is \n     ``us''--``tying us to the ground. I do not know why we have \n     to live with these rules; after all, so far as I can tell, \n     God did not send them.''\n       Well, Mr. Secretary, I say with all due respect--and I have \n     great regard for you--that you seem to have gotten off the \n     track. You probably should have had a good study course in \n     American history before you came here--I am not talking about \n     the kind of history that comes up with cartoons like this. \n     Many of the so-called history books of our present time are \n     full of colorful cartoons just like this. They do not teach \n     real history.\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\n       I read Muzzey back in 1927, 1928, 1929, 1932, David Seville \n     Muzzey. That was history. There were pictures. Now, you say, \n     ``The rules that have been created by just ordinary \n     people''--these were not ordinary people, the men who signed \n     the Constitution. They provided for the rules of the Senate.\n       The Congress and certainly this Senate is not ordinary, and \n     it is certainly not Lilliputian. We are Senators. I have been \n     before the people at the bar of judgment 29 times in these 50 \n     years, counting this year, that I have served in Congress--29 \n     times. I have taken the oath to support and defend this \n     Constitution 16 times.\n       I am not asking you to answer this question--but how many \n     times have you been before the bar of judgment of the people? \n     In what elections did you run in order to represent the \n     people? You were appointed. We were elected by the people, \n     directly by the people--not like the President, indirectly, \n     by electors who were elected by the people--we were directly \n     elected.\n       Chairman Conrad. Senator, if I could say, I grant 7 minutes \n     and my first round of questioning to the Senator so he can \n     continue in his statement.\n       Senator Byrd. Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and I will not \n     dwell upon this any longer except to say that we are \n     Senators, and you have been in this town one year. I have \n     been in this town 50 years. I have seen many Secretaries of \n     the Treasury. And I just want to tell you that we Senators \n     are here to look after the interests of the people of our \n     States. They are not well-to-do people--not all of them--in \n     my State. They are not CEOs of multi-billion-dollar \n     corporations. They cannot just pick up the phone and call a \n     Cabinet Secretary.\n       In time of need--in drought, in floods, in famines, when a \n     bridge is near collapse, when safe drinking water is not \n     available, when health care services are endangered--they \n     come to us. The people come to us. Yes, they are ordinary \n     people. They are coal miners, they are farmers, they are \n     schoolteachers, they are ministers, they are lawyers, they \n     are bankers.\n       This cartoon on page 51 and comments throughout this budget \n     suggest that this administration believes that so-called \n     experts at bureaucratic agencies should determine the \n     priorities of this Nation--not the Congress, not the people \n     they represent. That suggests that the problems of the people \n     are too little to deserve the attention of the \n     administration.\n       Here is what the paragraph says by Dr. Gulliver: ``. . . it \n     is critical that the government operate effectively and spend \n     every taxpayer dollar wisely. Unfortunately, Federal managers \n     are greatly limited in how they can use financial handling \n     and other resources to manage programs. Federal managers lack \n     much of the discretion given to their private sector \n     counterparts to get the job done.''\n       We have seen what discretion given to private sector \n     counterparts has done. We saw that in Enron.\n       This budget, wrapped in the American Flag, says: \n     ``Government is ineffective under these conditions. During \n     wartime, turf protection cannot dictate the national \n     interest. The Congress should remove barriers and give the \n     administration the tools to do the job that must be done.''\n       You say the Federal managers are greatly limited in how \n     they can use financial resources. That is a good thing. These \n     people, the so-called Federal managers, are not elected by \n     the people, and we are talking about the taxpayers' dollars--\n     the taxpayers' dollars. That is why there are rules. That is \n     why we have rules.\n       So you say ``Federal managers lack much of the discretion \n     given to their private sector counterparts.'' Yes, because \n     they are dealing with tax dollars, the American people's \n     dollars.\n       My question would be does this kind of nonsense belong in a \n     budget document. Now, to be fair, if we are going to do that, \n     let us have a little more fun. Why not refer to the territory \n     that was called Brobdingnag. Swift also wrote about that. Dr. \n     Gulliver visited Brobdingnag, where there were not pygmies, \n     but giants as tall as church spires, and with respect to one \n     step of those giants, that step covers 10 yards.\n       I would refer to this since we are in the business of using \n     Swift's satire. This budget is a Brobdingnagian budget, a \n     Brobdingnagian budget. Not bad.\n       If we want to continue this, we can do it after the \n     meeting. I have been very generously given time at this \n     point.\n       I just want to remind you, Mr. Secretary, that a lot of us \n     were here before you came, and with all respect to you, you \n     are not Alexander Hamilton.\n       I have a question. Steel company representatives and steel \n     workers have worked through numerous hurdles and made a \n     number of concessions to reach consensus on a plan to \n     renovate the U.S. steel industry. They have let the \n     administration know that in order for this plan to work, the \n     President needs to conclude the Section 201 of investigation \n     of steel importation at the earliest possible date, with a \n     remedy of nothing less than a 40 percent tariff on steel \n     imports.\n       In addition, the steep companies and workers have asked for \n     the administration's help in removing barriers to steel \n     industry consolidation in the United States and in relieving \n     the costs to the maximum extent possible of health care and \n     pension benefits to retirees.\n       Steel industry representatives from my own State have \n     expressed optimism that this administration is working \n     positively with them to advance such a multifaceted solution. \n     In light of this very critical time for the steel industry \n     and this window of just a few weeks that could mean a turning \n     point to a revitalization of bankruptcy and collapse of an \n     industry that ties under our national security, this \n     administration submits a budget that cuts the steel loan \n     guarantee program by $96 million.\n       I find it hard to share in the optimism, and I will just \n     ask one question at this time, and I will have further \n     questions that I will submit.\n       What can you tell this committee specifically about this \n     administration's intentions with regard to helping the steel \n     industry with tariffs, reorganization, and legacy costs?\n       Secretary O'Neill. Well, Senator, what I said to the \n     National Association of Business Economists, I stand by, \n     because what I had in my mind and what I deeply believe is \n     this--that where we have rules made by men that restrict the \n     realization of human potential, they should be changed.\n       We had rules that said, ``Colored, do not enter here.'' \n     That was a manmade rule. And there are lots of those \n     same kinds of rules that limit the realization of human \n     potential, and I have dedicated my life to doing what I \n     can to get rid of rules that so limit human potential, and \n     I am not going to stop.\n       Senator Byrd. Mr. Secretary, I have been around for a long \n     time, and I try to live with the rules. You were specifically \n     talking about the Byrd rule.\n       Secretary O'Neill. I was talking about all rules that limit \n     human potential and the realization of human potential, and \n     referring to something different is fine if you wish to do \n     so, but I would also like to say, because there was an \n     inference in your remarks that somehow I was born on home \n     plate and thought I hit a home run--Senator, I started my \n     life in a house without water or electricity. So I do not \n     cede to you the high moral ground of not knowing what life \n     was like in the ditch.\n       Secretary Byrd. Well, Mr. Secretary, I lived in a house \n     without electricity, too, no running water, no telephone, and \n     with a wooden outhouse.\n       Secretary O'Neill. I had the same.\n       Senator Byrd. I started out in life without any rungs in \n     the bottom of the ladder. I am talking with you about your \n     comments concerning the Byrd rule and the people who wrote \n     these rules. I am not talking about putting a halter or a \n     break on anybody's self-incentive or anybody's initiative. I \n     have had that experience, and I can stand toe-to-toe with \n     you. I have not walked in any corporate board rooms. I have \n     not had the churning of millions of dollars into trust \n     accounts.\n       I lived in a coal miner's home. I married a coal miner's \n     daughter. So I hope we do not start down this road, talking \n     about our backgrounds and how far back we came from. I am \n     citing to you what you said in response to a question about \n     the Byrd rule. The Byrd rule has saved millions and millions \n     and millions of dollars for this Government, and we ought to \n     live up to it.\n       Perhaps you ought to study the Byrd rule a little bit if \n     you have not to the point that you can explain it. And just \n     remember, the rule that I am talking about, those ordinary \n     people--you are talking about Senators. They are ordinary \n     people, and they are not going to let you get away with it. \n     We are not going to let you get away with it.\n       So if you want to answer my question on steel.\n       Secretary O'Neill. All right. As you know because you have \n     been in some of the meetings that we have been having on the \n     subject of steel, we began last year to see if it was \n     possible to create a basis for the world to adjust the \n     arguably 30 percent overcapacity that the world today has in \n     steel, and through the President's efforts and administration \n     work, we succeeded in getting the OECD to provide a structure \n     for calling together the principal producers of steel in the \n     world to try to get them to stipulate the need for capacity \n     reductions, especially of capacity that is exporting its \n     goods around the world with Government subsidies and \n     undercutting the ability of almost any steel company in the \n     world to make enough money to cover the cost of its capital, \n     as a piece of a concerted, connected set of ideas about how \n     we should proceed in this area.\n       Subsequent to beginning that work, the President filed a \n     201, and he has until March 6, I believe, to make a final \n     decision of what level, if any, and kinds of combinations of \n     tariffs and impositions he should put on imports in the \n     United States to make sure that the world is fair in the way \n     that we provide a basis for our own steel industry to make a \n     living. There are day-by-day conversations going on to this \n     issue of what tariffs or barriers or provisions should be \n     imposed on the rest of the world, and as I say, the work will \n     be done by the appointed date of March 6.\n       Senator Byrd. I hope the President will act and act \n     immediately and act forcefully. He was in West Virginia and \n     told the steel workers that he would help them. The Vice \n     President certainly was in West Virginia and told the steel \n     workers he would help them. West Virginia went for Mr. Bush, \n     else you would not be sitting there today if my State had \n     gone for Mr. Gore.\n       So the steel workers are hoping and praying that the \n     President will act and act immediately to help them in this \n     regard.\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\n       Thank you very much.\n       Chairman Conrad. Senator Smith.\n       Senator Smith. Mr. Secretary, I was looking at your resume, \n     and I believe you started your professional employment as a \n     civil servant for the Office of Management and Budget. Is \n     that correct?\n       Secretary O'Neill. In fact I started at the Veterans \n     Administration as a computer systems analyst in 1961 and \n     completed my previous Government service at the office of \n     Management and Budget as deputy director in 1977.\n       Senator Smith. And you have served in the administrations \n     of Gerald Ford, is that correct----\n       Secretary O'Neill. That is right.\n       Senator Smith [continuing]. And President----\n       Secretary O'Neill. Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford.\n       Senator Byrd. Would the Senator yield to me?\n       Senator Smith. I would be happy to yield, Senator Byrd.\n       Senator Byrd. Since we are talking about how many \n     administrations we have been in----\n       Senator Smith. You can beat us all, I am sure.\n       Senator Byrd. I have served with--not under--11 Presidents.\n       Senator Smith. Well, I have great respect for Senator Byrd. \n     I feel badly, though, if you feel demeaned appearing before \n     this committee in any personal way, because I just want to \n     say again for the record as I did in my opening statement \n     that you did not need this job, but you are doing a fine job, \n     and I believe you have served in many administrations, and \n     you left a very lucrative position because you wanted to make \n     the world a better place. And I think that needs to be said \n     again. So I----\n       Senator Byrd. Would the Senator yield?\n       Senator Smith. I would be happy to yield to Senator Byrd \n     any time.\n       Senator Byrd. May I just add a little footnote along that \n     line?\n       Senator Smith. Of course.\n       Senator Byrd. I do not need to serve here, either. I \n     believe I could retire and get more money in retirement than \n     I earn as a Senator. I am talking about my retirement from \n     the years I have served in Government.\n       Senator Smith. I understand that.\n       I thank you, Secretary O'Neill, for your service to your \n     country, and I thank Senator Byrd for his service to our \n     country as well.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with reference to the word ``Lilliputians'', \nthat seems to be the prevailing way that officials in the Bush \nAdministration view members of Congress. Several members of the Bush \nCabinet have publicly used that term when speaking about the \ninconvenience of having to work with the people's representatives and \nthe laws and rules that Congress writes.\n  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld spoke to the National Defense \nUniversity on January 31, 2002. Referring to Congressional earmarks in \nthe defense appropriation bills, he said: ``The Congress has, for \nwhatever reason, decided that they want to put literally thousands of \nearmarks on the legislation--that you can't do this, you can't do that, \nyou can't do this, you can't do that. Well, your flexibility is just--\nit's like Gulliver with a whole bunch of Lilliputian threads over them: \nno one thread keeps Gulliver down, but in the aggregate he can't get \nup.''\n  OMB Director Mitchell E. Daniels testified before the Senate Budget \nCommittee in July 2001 on the economic and budget outlook. Referring to \nCongressional earmarks, the OMB Director said: ``I would point out that \nCongress has got to help here. We struggle with earmarks in the federal \nbudget, and . . . its very hard . . . when you are hogtied by a million \nlilliputian orders to do this, that, or the other, which maybe does not \nfit the strategy.''\n  Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill spoke to the National Association for \nBusiness Economics in March 2001 regarding the Administration's desire \nto see a permanent tax cut enacted. A question was raised regarding the \nByrd rule. Under current law, if the Senate passes a ten-year budget \nresolution, a tax cut reconciliation bill would have to sunset after \nten years in order to be in compliance with the Byrd rule.\n  In response, the Treasury Secretary said: ``There is a very \ninteresting thing that the rules that have been created by just \nordinary people--are in some ways more and more like the Lilliputians \ntying us to the ground. . . . I don't know why we have to live by these \nrules, after all, they were only made by other people, and so far as I \ncan tell, God didn't send them. . . . And, so, it's OK for us to \nentertain a different kind of an idea, and that . . . we don't have to \nlive by rules that were made in a different time for a different \npurpose and a different set of circumstances.''\n  The last quote in particular addressed an arcane and little \nunderstood rule whose author put it into place in 1985. Its purpose was \nto stop rampant abuses of Reconciliation Bills, which were originally \nintended to lock in deficit reduction measures.\n  Because of tight time limitations--20 hours--a nondebateable motion \nto reduce the time and only a majority vote needed to reduce it, and no \nopportunity to debate a motion to proceed, reconciliation is a supergag \nrule, one that makes cloture look like a mere speck by comparison.\n  Reconciliation bills have frequently been grossly misused to ram \ncostly spending measures through the Senate and to prevent thorough \ndebate of controversial measures. The Administration chose a \nreconciliation bill for its controversial tax cuts last year, in order \nto take advantage of the ``fast track'' nature of reconciliation bills. \nHowever, in 1985, the Senate unanimously adopted the Byrd Rule. One \npart of the Byrd Rule is a budgetary restriction which prohibits \nreconciliation bills from either reducing revenues or increasing \nspending in a year beyond the last year covered by the budget \nresolution. Last year's budget resolution covered 10 years. Therefore \nall revenue losses in that reconciliation bill had to sunset in 10 \nyears. The administration wanted the benefits of reconciliation, but \nnow they complain about the restrictions of that same process.\n\n  The Byrd Rule has been quite effective when it has been enforced. I \ndaresay that the Byrd rule has prevented billions of dollars' worth of \nquestionable spending. I know that the Byrd Rule has brought \ncontroversial measures out into the sunlight of public debate by \npreventing such measures from being wrapped in a reconciliation bill \nand hustled in protective armor through the Senate.\n  For instance, on October 13, 1989, I commended Senators Mitchell, the \nthen Majority Leader, and Senator Sasser, the then Chairman of the \nBudget Committee, on their tough enforcement of the Byrd Rule in the \nReconciliation process of that year, whereby some 300 provisions which \nviolated the Byrd Rule were stricken from the bill. May I add that \nreconciliation abuses are not only abuses promulgated by members of \nCongress. The administration's fingerprints are often on Byrd Rule \nviolations as well. I vividly recall when President Clinton wanted to \ninsert his entire healthcare reform package into a reconciliation bill, \ncosting billions, changing hundreds of laws, and shielding a very \ncontroversial proposal from the sunlight of debate. When I said that I \nwould raise a Byrd Rule point of order, the idea was dropped. The Byrd \nRule is totally nonpartisan. It has saved billions of tax dollars and \nprevented much legislative mischief by both parties. Although its \nauthor's name is Robert C. Byrd, the Byrd Rule has helped curtail \nfederal spending enormously.\n  It is well to remember that it is rules and laws that keep the \npowerful in check and the people in control. Yet, this year's budget \ndocument, ordinarily a relatively straightforward presentation of an \nAdministration's views on the budget, is rife with political commentary \nabout congressional earmarks, and even a cartoon--as I have already \npointed out--depicting Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians along \nwith accompanying text that reflects an attitude of arrogance and \ndisdain for the role of the Congress. It is a far cry from President \nGeorge W. Bush's stated intention to change the tone in Washington. \nPartisanship and distrust are all that is accomplished by such an \napproach, and there is certainly enough of both to go around already.\n  Members of Congress are often convenient targets for disdain by \nAdministration officials who do not have to stand for election and who \noften have independent wealth or lucrative careers to return to after \ntheir stint in public service is over. Congressional earmarks are easy \nto malign, but earmarks, such as the one which first funded the human \ngenome project, are rarely discussed. Congressional earmarks have done \nmuch good. Of course some have turned out to be poor investments, but \nthey are not the horrific evil that many suggest, and in reality their \nimpact on the budget is usually quite small. What those who serve\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nin Presidential Cabinets tend to forget is that the people did not \nelect them to anything. They are appointed, and they serve at the \nPresident's pleasure. And it is worthwhile here to note that even the \nPresident that these officials serve is not directly elected. Only \nmembers of Congress are directly elected by the people in federal \nelections, and it is to members of Congress that the people come for \nassistance or to express their heartfelt views. Not many ordinary \ncitizens have the wealth or influence to call up a Cabinet secretary or \nget an appointment with the President. Members of Congress are the \npeople's elected spokesmen and women, and when we are viewed as \n``Lilliputians'' by members of a President's cabinet, I suspect that \nthe good people who elected us to serve are viewed in much the same \nmanner. Tolerance of the arrogance of people in high places has worn \nvery thin in this country. The people have had enough of Enron egos, \nand all-knowing, all-powerful bureaucrats, and the people well \nunderstand the need for serious curbs on power. Some sage once observed \nthat the difference between a lynching and a fair trial is procedure. \nHow true that is.\n  Mr. President, those who dislike the rules and laws that reign them \nin make the best argument I can think of for the wisdom of the Framers \nin separating the powers of government. And while Swift's Gulliver's \nTravels, and his tale of Lilliput may be required reading for the Bush \nCabinet, I think that they may have actually missed the point of that \nfamous satire. The point is this. No matter how big you think you are, \nthe little people in this country can call you to heel. Because of the \nunique system of government we are blessed with, the people, in the \nfinal analysis, wield the power. And it is up to the Congress--the \npeople's branch--to continue to write the rules that help to keep \nPresidents, bureaucrats, and wayward corporate executives in check. So, \nfor my part I say, long live the Lilliputians! May they ever reign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S894-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S894-S895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night, the Senate voted to confirm \nthree additional nominees to the Federal district courts: James \nGritzner from Iowa, Richard Leon from Maryland, who will serve as a \njudge on the District Court for the District of Columbia, and David \nBunning from Kentucky.\n  With these votes, the Senate will have confirmed nine judges since \nbeginning the second session three weeks ago. With these confirmations, \nthe Senate will have confirmed 37 judges since the change in majority \nlast June. That number exceeds the number of judges confirmed in all 12 \nmonths of 1997 or 1999 and, of course, more than during the entire 1996 \nsession.\n  I would, again, urge the White House to work with home-state \nSenators, to work with Democratic and as well as Republican Senators, \nand to send nominees like James Gritzner, who received bipartisan \nsupport from his home-state Senators.\n  With the confirmation of Judge Gritzner, the Senate has confirmed two \nFederal judges from Iowa this week, the other being Judge Michael \nMelloy for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \nThe Judiciary Committee moved quickly on these nominations. Both Judge \nGritzner and Judge Melloy participated in the first nominations hearing \nof this session, which was the first confirmation hearing held in \nJanuary in more than half a decade. They were reported favorably by the \nCommittee at the earliest possible Executive Business Meeting this \nyear, on February 7, and they are now confirmed, just one week later.\n  Indeed, Judge Melloy's confirmation filled a judicial emergency \nvacancy. That seat on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, \nwhich includes eight states, Iowa, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri, \nNebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, has been vacant since May 1, \n1999.\n  I recall that it was not so long ago, in 2000, when the Senate was \nunder Republican control, that another nominee to this very seat on the \nEighth Circuit, Bonnie Campbell, did not receive the courtesy of a vote \nby the Committee following the hearing on her nomination. She did not \nreceive a vote due to the previous policy of allowing anonymous holds \nto be placed on nominees, even though in her case, both of her home-\nstate Senators, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, supported \nher nomination. Bonnie Campbell, the former Attorney General of Iowa, \ndid not receive the courtesy of a vote, up or down, during the 382 days \nbetween her nomination by President Clinton and the time that the Bush \nAdministration withdrew her name.\n  In contrast, we moved expeditiously to consider and confirm Judge \nMelloy's nomination to the Eighth Circuit. Judge Melloy's confirmation \neliminated the judicial emergency vacancy in that Circuit caused, in \npart, by the Committee's failure to act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination \nwhen Republicans controlled the Senate and the confirmation process.\n  Judge Melloy was the seventh Court of Appeals nomination confirmed by \nthe Senate in the last seven months. That is seven more Court of \nAppeals judges than a Republican majority confirmed in the 1996 \nsession, and as many as were confirmed in all of 1997 and in all of \n1999.\n  I think that the last District Court Judge confirmed in Iowa was \nJudge Robert Pratt in 1997. Nominated initially in early August 1996, \nJudge Pratt was not confirmed until late May the following year, more \nthan nine months after his initial nomination. I am glad that the \nCommittee and the Senate were able to act more quickly than that with \nrespect to Judge Gritzner.\n  In connection with both Iowa nominees confirmed this year, I thank \nthe Senators from Iowa for working with the Committee. I especially \nappreciate the kind words of the senior Senator, Senator Grassley, both \nat the Committee consideration and in connection with these \nconfirmation.\n  Last night, the Senate also confirmed Richard Leon to the United \nStates District Court for the District of Columbia. This is the third \nconfirmation to this District Court considered by the Senate since I \nbecame Chairman last summer. Indeed, nominees to the District of \nColumbia District Court were among those included in our unprecedented \nhearings during the August recess last year. I thank Representative \nEleanor Holmes Norton for working closely with the Committee to fill \nall three vacancies that had existed in this Federal court.\n  Richard Leon's nomination was fairly and expeditiously considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Senate. His nomination was received \nlast September, the ABA peer reviews were completed favorably in \nNovember, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on his nomination \nduring the first week the Senate was in session in January, his \nnomination was promptly considered by the Committee and reported \nfavorably to the Senate last week, and last night the Senate confirmed \nhis nomination to fill the last current vacancy on the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. Richard Leon received a \nunanimous well-qualified rating from the ABA peer reviews and received \nhigh recommendations from members of the legal community in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Of course, during the years preceding the change in majority, two \nnominees to the District Court for the District of Columbia, James \nKlein and Rhonda Fields, never received a hearing before the Committee \nor votes on their nominations. In fact, James Klein's nomination was \npending for almost four years without a hearing during both the 105th \nand 106th Congresses. Despite Representative Norton's strong and \nconsistent efforts during those years, we were unable to obtain any \naction in connection with the vacancies that we have now successfully \nfilled. Judge Leon will join Judge Bates and Judge Walton.\n  Last night the Senate also confirmed the nomination of David Bunning \nto a vacancy in the Eastern District of Kentucky. Since the elections \nin November 2000, three vacancies have arisen on the Eastern District \nbench. With this confirmation, the Senate will have acted to fill all \nthree.\n  I scheduled a hearing for Karen Caldwell just six days after her file \nwas complete. Her nomination was reported by the Committee 16 days \nlater, and only 25 days after her file was complete, Judge Karen \nCaldwell was confirmed by the Senate. Danny Reeves, another nominee for \nthat same district, was able to have a hearing within\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n40 days of his file being completed, was voted out of Committee only a \nfew weeks after that, and he was confirmed 69 days from the time all \nhis paperwork was complete. Indeed, we proceeded to confirm the first \ntwo nominees to the bench of the Eastern District of Kentucky so \nquickly that they had to delay being sworn in and assuming their \njudicial duties in order to wind down their legal practices.\n  This stands in sharp contrast to the length of time it took to get \nnominees hearings and confirmations in the recent past. During the last \nsix years of the Clinton Administration, it took an average of about \n150 days to move a district court nominee to confirmation. I am proud \nthat we have been able to do better since last July.\n  The hearing on the Bunning nomination included testimony by his home-\nstate Senators as well as testimony by representatives from the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee. While a majority of the \nABA Committee found the nominee not qualified and a minority found him \nto be qualified for the federal bench, three United States District \nCourt Judges and a former United States Attorney testified in support \nof his confirmation. Yesterday, the Senate acted to confirm the \nPresident's nomination, as we have with a number of other nominees who \nreceived mixed peer review ratings.\n  For 50 years, beginning with the Eisenhower Administration and \nincluding the Clinton Administration, the ABA had provided a valuable \npublic service to Presidents as they determined whom to nominate to the \nfederal bench. In addition, the Senate has had the benefit of the ABA \npeer reviews. No Senator is bound by the recommendations of the ABA.\n  As I have said before, it is unfortunate that President Bush decided \nto shift the ABA's role in the pre-nomination process, but I am \ngrateful that the ABA has agreed to continue to provide their \nevaluations to the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have always valued \ntheir contribution to the process and the willingness of the members of \nthe Standing Committee to volunteer their time, efforts and judgment to \nthis important task.\n  I congratulate each of the successful nominees and their families on \ntheir Senate confirmations.\n  I intend to notice another confirmation hearing for judicial \nnominations for February 26. Even though this is a short month with a \nweek's recess, the Committee will hold a second hearing involving \njudicial nominees in February. This will be the first time in four \nyears that the Committee will have held two February hearings for \njudicial nominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S895-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE SAFE AND FAIR DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Johnson-\nHagel-Reed-Enzi Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act of 2002, SFDIA, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it. I am proud to be one of the authors \nof this legislation, as I believe it will continue to ensure a strong \nand safe insurance system for our banks, and most importantly for the \nconsumers that put their trust in that system. The legislation before \nus also seeks to end the pro-cyclical method now in force, which tends \nto burden institutions in bad economic times, and not prepare for the \nfuture during good economic times. We need to change that, and I think \nthis bill begins to finally address this important issue in a very \nthoughtful manner.\n  The bill that my colleagues and I have introduced has five major \ncomponents. The first element addresses the most non-controversial \naspect of this issue, and that is merging of the two insurance funds. \nThis will obviously strengthen the reserve fund for all banks and \nsavings institutions, rather than diffusing that strength between two \nfunds. The second component is that of coverage limits. Although this \nissue has attracted quite a bit of discussion and controversy over the \npast few years, this is nonetheless an important issue for many banks \nand consumers alike. In this section, the legislation authorizes the \nlevel of general coverage to rise to $130,000, by indexing for \ninflation from 1974, when the level of coverage was at $40,000. Going \nforward, the bill proposes to index coverage for inflation every five \nyears in increments of $10,000. The bill also suggests that coverage \nfor retirement accounts be set at $250,000 now, and that those accounts \nalso be subject to indexing in the future. Lastly, on coverage issues, \nthe legislation would allow for additional coverage for municipal \ndeposits beyond the $130,000 level.\n  The SFDI Act would also allow for greater flexibility for the FDIC to \ncharge insurance premiums. Since 1996, the FDIC has been prohibited \nfrom charging premiums to banks that have the highest rating, as long \nas the reserve ratio was above the ``hard target'' of 1.25 percent. Our \nlegislation would remove that prohibition, as well as effectively \neliminating the hard target, and would instead substitute a range for \nthe fund. Again, these actions will lend the FDIC the necessary \nflexibility to manage the funds in a much more institution-friendly \nmanner, particularly by relieving pressure on them during the worst \nbusiness cycles.\n  In addition, the FDIC will be able to give a one-time assessment \ncredit to institutions, as well as allow for ongoing credits to manage \nthe fund. These credits will in all likelihood give most institutions, \nif they are well-managed and well-capitalized, the ability to avoid \npremiums for several years down the road. The FDIC will also be \nauthorized to provide cash rebates to institutions should the fund ever \nexceed 1.50 percent.\n  Although I would prefer to address the issue of coverage for \nmunicipal deposits in another context, I am confident that during the \nupcoming legislative process there will be a good debate on the issue, \nand the Senate will be able to work its will on the issue. I think it \nis important to note that the introduction of this bill will mark the \nbeginning of a strong, vigorous and positive discussion on the vital \nissue of deposit insurance. This has become the cornerstone of our \nbanking system's integrity, and it is imperative that the U.S. Congress \ninsure that it remain strong, healthy, and workable for many years to \ncome for both financial institutions and consumers alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S895-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S895-S896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL EMPLOYEES DESERVE PAY PARITY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the government moves to protect its \ncitizens, harden its borders, and defends American interests abroad, I \nwant to make sure that the Nation's Federal employees are given the \nresources and support needed to carry out these missions.\n  Numerous studies point to the government's inability to compete with \nthe private sector as one reason why we are unable to attract and \nretain qualified Federal employees. With a few exceptions, since 1981, \nmilitary and Federal personnel have received equal pay increases. Yet, \nthe administration's FY03 budget calls for an across-the-board \nadjustment of only 2.6 percent, while the military would receive a 4.1 \npercent increase. The proposed 2.6 percent increase is less than the \nformula used by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act and fails \nto close the pay gap between Federal and private sector workers.\n  In my capacity as Chairman of both the Senate Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal \nServices and the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and \nManagement Support, I am actively involved in issues relating to \nFederal employees. Our civilian workforce plays a significant role in \nthe support of our service members on active duty, in the reserves, and \nserving with the National Guard. I support a cohesive and coordinated \neffort in safeguarding America and believe a strong civilian workforce \nis crucial to our success in protecting our country.\n  By 2005, over half the Federal workforce will be eligible to retire, \nand as long as fewer young people are choosing Federal service to fill \nthese gaps, there should be a commitment from the highest levels of \ngovernment to ensure that agencies are adequately staffed with the \nright people and the right skills to run the government in an effective \nand efficient manner.\n  The American people know that the war on terrorism will be a long \nstruggle; a different kind of war with fronts both at home and abroad. \nOur civilian Federal workforce is on the front line of this war and \nmust be prepared to respond to the possibility of attack. We\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nshould not distinguish between our civilian and military workforces, \nboth of whom serve their country with equal dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S896-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      NOMINATION OF JAMES GRITZNER\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about \nJames E. Gritzner, who was approved by the Senate last night to serve \nas United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. I am \npleased that the Senate was able to move swiftly on this judicial \nnomination. Jim Gritzner has extensive trial experience and is fully \nqualified to serve on the District Court. His reputation for being fair \nand evenhanded is something we expect of all judges, and he will be a \ngreat addition to the Southern District of Iowa.\n  By way of background for my colleagues, Mr. Gritzner received a \nBachelors of Arts degree from Dakota Wesleyan University, a Masters of \nArts degree from the University of Northern Iowa, and a law degree from \nDrake University Law School. His distinguished legal career includes \nhaving practiced with several Iowa law firms, most recently with the \nDes Moines, Iowa firm of Neymaster, Goode, Voights, West, Hansell & \nO'Brien.\n  In addition to being in private practice for over 20 years, Mr. \nGritzner has had a long record of public service. He served as a member \nof the Iowa Board of Parole from 1980 to 1982. From 1985 to 1990, Mr. \nGritzner was the primary prosecutor for the Committee on Professional \nEthics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Association and the Client \nSecurity and Attorney Disciplinary Commission of the Iowa Supreme \nCourt.\n  I am sure everyone would agree that these are excellent \nqualifications. Jim Gritzner will serve the Federal bench very well, \nand I am proud to have supported his nomination to the Southern \nDistrict of Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S896-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CALIFORNIA COASTAL PROTECTION AND LOUISIANA ENERGY ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have joined my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, in introducing the California Coastal Protection and \nLouisiana Energy Enhancement Act. This legislation will add to the \nproduction of oil and gas off the Louisiana gulf coast while solving a \ndifficult problem associated with production off the coast of \nCalifornia.\n  The Federal Government, through the Department of the Interior's \nMinerals Management Service, MMS, manages oil and gas exploration in \nall Federal waters from 3 miles beyond the coastline. For years, leases \nhave been issued to companies, giving them the right to explore and \nproduce on these lands. Companies bid on proffered leases at the MMS, \nthen pay rental payments to the Federal Government to maintain their \nleases. Once oil or gas is flowing from Federal lands, companies pay a \nroyalty on the production to the Federal treasury.\n  Between 1968 and 1984, the MMS awarded 40 leases off the coast of \nCalifornia to a number of different companies so that they could \nexplore for oil and gas and bring these energy resources to market. The \nproven oil reserves under these leases are vast. Over the past 34 \nyears, owners of the leases have been working through the processes of \nFederal and State government to bring production from these lands \nonline, as was the original purpose of the lease sales. During this \ntime, the owners have been paying annual rental payments to the Federal \nGovernment. To date, none of them are producing.\n  The people of California have become increasingly opposed to new oil \nand gas production off their coast. This opposition has created a \ndilemma for the Federal Government and the leaseholders because while \nthe opposition of the people of California has made it more difficult \nto proceed with oil production, the ability to produce oil from these \nlands is exactly what the companies have been paying the Federal \nGovernment for all these years.\n  Senator Boxer and I have been working to solve this longstanding \nproblem. The legislation we are introducing today will essentially move \nthe investment these companies have made with the Federal Government \nfrom the California waters to the Federal waters in the central and \nwestern areas of the Gulf of Mexico. This investment will finally be \nput to the use for which it was originally intended, to provide a \ndomestic source of energy for the United States. This will mean a more \nvibrant oil and gas industry in my state and more jobs for \nLouisianians. It will maintain the integrity of the MMS leasing process \nand the Federal contracts that have been in place these many years. \nFinally, it will assist the people of California in reaching their goal \nof no new oil production off their coastline.\n  The California Coastal Protection and Louisiana Energy Enhancement \nAct gives the California leaseholders the option to move their \ninvestments to the central and western Gulf of Mexico. If the \nleaseholders choose, they may receive credits for the money that has \nbeen paid to the Federal Government for the California leases, and any \nother money invested in developing the leases. These credits may be \nredeemable at the MMS for lease bonus and royalty payments for \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico. participating companies would then \nsurrender the California leases and agree not to bring any future legal \nactions against the government for their inability to go forward with \nproduction over the past 34 years. Finally, our bill takes the lands \nthat were in the leases and creates an ecological preserve to protect \ntraditional fishing areas and provide conservational scientific and \nrecreational benefits.\n  About 65 percent of our Nation's energy needs are supplied by oil and \nnatural gas. The waters of the Gulf of Mexico have proven to be a \nsignificant source of oil and natural gas and are predicted to remain \nso for the foreseeable future. While states such as Louisiana continue \nto welcome the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \nresources in the Gulf of Mexico, this development is accompanied by \nadverse impacts on the infrastructure and public service needs of \nStates, counties and local communities that ``host'' the development of \nthese Federal sources. With the rest of the country consistently \nturning to the waters of the central and western Gulf of Mexico for oil \nand gas production, it is long past time to share a meaningful portion \nof the revenues generated annually from Federal offshore crude oil and \nnatural gas resources with the coastal states that serve as the \nplatform for this development: Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and \nAlabama.\n  I believe this bill is a creative solution to a difficult problem \nthat has been left unattended for too many years. I commend my \ncolleague, Senator Boxer, for taking a leading role with me in crafting \nthis legislation. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S896-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S896-S897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WICHITA HEIGHTS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, according to the Office of Justice \nPrograms, 40 percent of women killed with firearms are murdered by an \nintimate partner. In 1996, Congress passed legislation to deny firearms \npurchases to individuals who were under a domestic violence restraining \norder or convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor. Despite the \npassage of this law many people are slipping through the system. For \nexample, according to a November 1999 Washington Post article, a \nbackground check failed to discover that a Maryland man was the subject \nof a domestic violence restraining order that his wife had obtained. As \na result, he was able to purchase a gun and he later shot his 3-year-\nold daughter and 2-year-old son.\n  To help prevent such tragedies, Congress established the National \nCriminal History Improvement Program in 1995 to provide funding to \nassist States in compiling criminal records and establishing \nidentification systems as well as developing a comprehensive national \nrecord system. One of the goals of the NCHIP program is to ensure that \naccurate records are available to law enforcement to identify \nineligible firearm purchasers. The NCHIP program has put special \nemphasis on ensuring that domestic violence-related offenses are \nincluded in criminal records. As the Washington Post article suggests, \nthere is still work to be done. In fact, according to a January 2002 \nstudy released by Americans for Gun Safety, only 30 States have \nautomated records of both domestic violence misdemeanors and domestic \nviolence restraining orders. Fifteen States have no automated records \nof domestic violence misdemeanors and 13 States have no automated \nrecords of domestic violence restraining orders.\n  I have long supported programs that will ensure that guns do not get \ninto the hands of criminals, as well as individuals under domestic \nviolence restraining orders.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in September \n1997 in Waupaca, WI. A gay man was beaten because of his sexual \norientation. The assailants, Jeffery S. Schucknecht, 26, and Robert G. \nGuyette, 23, were charged with felony battery and a hate crime in \nconnection with the incident. I believe that government's first duty is \nto defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out \nof hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a \nsymbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S897-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S897-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/15/senate-section/article/S897-5", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INOUYE, from the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n       Report to accompany S. 1857, A bill to Encourage the \n     Negotiated Settlement of Tribal Claims.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor additional designations of renewal communities; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation that will provide for greater economic growth, job creation \nand improve the availability of affordable housing in some of our \nNation's most distressed communities. The legislation calls for the \ndesignation of a second round of Renewal Communities.\n  The Renewal Communities program is an economic development initiative \nthat was included in the Fiscal Year 2001 Consolidated Appropriations \nAct. The communities designated under the program benefit from a \nvariety of tax incentives designed to attract new companies and enhance \nbusiness opportunities in an area. Wage credits, a zero capital gains \nrate on new investments and similar tax breaks for business related \nexpenditures will augment the efforts of State and local governments to \npromote job growth and restore economic stability in their communities.\n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 21, \n2000, provided for the designation of 40 Renewal Communities. The \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development was responsible for the \nselection and designation of the new RCs. The Department announced the \nlist of 40 communities, which will share over $17 billion in tax \nincentives, on January 24, 2002.\n  The designations are based on poverty rates, median income, and \nunemployment rates in the community. The most recent Department of \nCommerce census data available during the application process was from \n1990. This was an issue of timing as passage of the legislation \noverlapped with the compilation of new census data in 2000.\n  The use of the 1990 census data, however, severely limited the \nability of many cities and localities which may be eligible based on \nthe most recent data. The 1990 data does not reflect the economic \nshifts which have taken place over the last decade throughout the \ncountry.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, many communities have been \ndevastated economically by plant closings since the census in 1990. The \nunemployment figures continue to rise when more businesses are forced \nto close down as the adverse financial effects begin to filter through \nthe community.\n  My legislation would provide for the designation of an additional \ntwenty renewal communities with the requirement that the most recent \n2000 census data would be used. I believe that a second round of \nRenewal Community designations would be appropriate and fair to those \ncommunities excluded by the limits of timing out of their control.\n  We cannot move forward as a Nation when the gap in the economy \nstability of our local communities grows deeper and they are left \nbehind. This is something the Federal Government can do to stimulate \nthe economy from the ground up and at the same time help those who need \nit most.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this initiative. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL DESIGNATIONS OF RENEWAL COMMUNITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1400E of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to designation of renewal communities) is \n     amended by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g) and \n     by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(f) Additional Designations Permitted.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In addition to the areas designated \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development may designate in the aggregate an additional 20 \n     nominated areas as renewal communities under this section, \n     subject to the availability of eligible nominated areas. Of \n     that number, not less than 5 shall be designated in areas \n     described in subsection (a)(2)(B).\n       ``(2) Period designations may be made and take effect.--A \n     designation may be made under this subsection after the date \n     of the enactment of this subsection and before January 1, \n     2003.

A bill to provide a restructured and rationalized rail \npassenger system that provides efficient service on viable routes; to \neliminate budget deficits and management inefficiencies at Amtrak \nthrough the establishment of an Amtrak Control Board; to allow for the \nprivatization of Amtrak; to increase the role of State and private \nentities in rail passenger service; and, to promote competition and \nimprove rail passenger service opportunities; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the time has come for us to have an \nopen debate to consider the future of rail passenger service in this \nNation. Given Amtrak's financial situation, which is extremely \nprecarious, I strongly believe we must work together to pass \nlegislation this year that will provide for a restructured, \nrevitalized, and streamlined rail passenger network. This will be no \neasy task. It will take commitments by all parties, including the \nAdministration, Congress, Amtrak, states and municipalities, and the \nprivate sector.\n  No one can argue with the fact that Amtrak is in a financial crisis, \nwith growing and substantial debt obligations already totaling over \n$3.3 billion. The Department of Transportation Inspector General, DOT-\nIG, issued a report just two weeks ago which found that Amtrak \nexperienced its largest losses in history in Fiscal Year 2002. \nSpecifically, the DOT-IG found ``Amtrak lost $1.1 billion last year'' \nand ``Amtrak is no closer to operating self-sufficiency now than it was \nin 1997.''\n  The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, provided Amtrak \nwith the statutory reforms Amtrak said were needed to enable it to \naddress its financial and operational problems existing at the time. In \nturn, the Act directed Amtrak to reach operational self-sufficiency \nfive years after enactment, which is December 2, 2002. The Act also \nestablished the Amtrak Reform Council, ARC, to oversee Amtrak and \nnotify the Congress if it found Amtrak would not be able to meet its \nstatutory obligations.\n  Despite repeated press statements and testimony by Amtrak officials \nover the past four years that Amtrak was well on its way to fulfilling \nits statutory directives, on November 9, 2001, the ARC issued a finding \nthat Amtrak will not be operationally self-sufficient as required by \nlaw. The ARC found there are major inherent flaws and weaknesses in \nAmtrak's institutional design and that it must be restructured. The \nrecent DOT-IG report confirmed the ARC's finding that Amtrak would not \nmeet its statutory mandate.\n  Finally, two weeks ago, even Amtrak officials admitted it cannot live \nup to the claims they had been making. At a recent press conference \nAmtrak's President stated, ``Everybody knows that you can't make a \nprofit while running a network of unprofitable trains''. Unfortunately, \nAmtrak officials are\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\nseeking to place blame for its financial problems everywhere other than \nwhere it most justly belongs.\n  As I mentioned, the 1997 Reform Act provided Amtrak with the tools it \nsaid it needed to reinvent itself. It was provided labor, liability, \nand procurement reforms. The Act even eliminated the mandated route \nstructure established in the 1970 act that created Amtrak, and \nauthorized Amtrak to run like a private business.\n  Following the Senate's passage of the Act in 1997, Amtrak's President \nat the time, Tom Downs, sent a letter dated November 5, 1997 to Senator \nHollings and myself praising the compromise legislation. He stated \nthat, ``enactment of the Amtrak Reform and Revitalization Act of 1997 \nwould be the single most significant action the Congress can take to \naid Amtrak in achieving operating self-sufficiency by 2002.'' Mr. Downs \nfurther commended ``The legislation reforms contained in the bill will \nallow Amtrak to operate in a more businesslike, cost effective manner, \nthus allowing greater productivity and increased savings.''\n  Although Amtrak has received over $5 billion in Federal assistance \nsince the reform bill's enactment, and received the authority to \nimplement management and structural changes, little if anything has \nbeen accomplished since the Reform Act's enactment. Amtrak loses money \non almost all of its 41 routes, but instead of cutting even one \nunprofitable route, Amtrak added routes. One such route initiated in \nJanesville, WI, resulted in a per passenger subsidy of over $1,000.00. \nWhere is the rationale in such a business decision? Moreover, Amtrak's \ndebt load has tripled since we approved the Reform Act, and now amounts \nto over $3.3 billion. Clearly, Amtrak officials did not take the \nstatutory mandates seriously.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to fundamentally transform rail \npassenger transportation in America. The bill offers a new approach to \nreform Amtrak's 30-year subsidy program that has funded rail passenger \nservice. It is designed to promote rail passenger service on viable \nroutes or where States will provide support when it is considered a \nnecessary form of public transportation. That does not equate to a \nroute in every Congressional district and may not even equate to a \nroute in every State, but nor, it should be noted, does the present \n``national system.''\n  The legislation I am offering today is one approach for how our \nNation's rail passenger system can be permitted to evolve. I recognize \nthat it may not garner the support of every member, but I encourage my \ncolleagues to approach the debate on the future of rail passenger \nservice with an open mind. The American public demands more than the \nstatus quo. We should as well. The public's expectations must be \nbalanced with the level of financial commitment that the Nation can \nafford. I ask that a summary of the Rail Passenger Improvement Act of \n2002 be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  I don't believe that the measure I am introducing could be the only \napproach that Congress considers. There are many proposals and ideas \nthat merit our consideration. For example, on February 7th, the Amtrak \nReform Council submitted its report on a restructuring and \nrationalization plan. I hope the Congress will give careful \nconsideration to the ARC's proposal. Other ideas to restructure \nAmtrak's route system include the creation of a Route Closure \nCommission modeled after the Department of Defense's Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission. This is an idea that has been raised in recent \nyears and should not be disregarded. Above all, we must get to work now \nand determine how best to address Amtrak's financial and operational \ncrisis.\n  While it might seem easier to simply throw more money at Amtrak \ninstead of making tough policy decisions, we would be failing in our \nCongressional responsibilities if we were to do this. To put rail \npassenger service back on track in this country, we need to address a \nnumber of tough questions. For example, what is the future for \nintercity rail passenger transportation? Where does it attract \npassengers and where doesn't it? Does rail passenger service have to \nequate to ``Amtrak'' or can we accept the fact that after 30 years, it \nis time to find a new approach? Where might high-speed rail service \nactually attract enough passengers to be economically viable? How does \nit fit into our national transportation system? What financial \nobligation will we be imposing on American taxpayers to pay for rail \npassenger service and what can they realistically expect for their \npayments?\n  I have continually doubted Amtrak could live up to the promises it \nhas made over the years. I reached this conclusion after years of \nlistening to promises from Amtrak officials about what it could deliver \nif Congress gave it more money. Those promises have been broken time \nafter time. There has been an endless flow of subsidy requests from \nAmtrak since its creation 30 years ago, even though it was to be free \nof all Federal assistance two years after it was established. Instead, \nAmtrak has received over $25 billion in direct subsidies.\n  The ARC, the DOT-IG, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and others \nwarned us that Amtrak was not going to live up to the rosy scenarios it \nhad been painting over the past several years. Ironically, while we are \ncriticizing private auditors for failing to ensure disclosure of the \ntrue financial picture of Enron, Congress has had clear indication from \npublic auditors that Amtrak was not financially solvent but chose to \nignore those warnings. Shouldn't we halt the double standard with \nrespect to our reaction to public and private audit findings?\n  We all need to face the fact that Amtrak is in dire financial straits \nand action must be taken once and for all to address the underlying \nproblems with Amtrak. The findings presented by the ARC and the DOT-IG \nmake it clear that Amtrak's Board and management have been unable to \nexecute the changes that need to be taken to turn Amtrak's finances \naround. As the DOT-IG recently stated: ``Amtrak is no closer to \noperating self-sufficiency now than it was in 1997.''\n  Amtrak's management has recently started to question publicly the \nstatutory requirement for Amtrak to achieve operational self-\nsufficiency. At a press conference held last week when Amtrak admitted \nit was not living up to its repeated claims of success, Amtrak's \nPresident referred to the self-sufficiency deadline as an \n``impractical, inappropriate and destructive concept to move forward \nwith.'' I find this statement shockingly untimely.\n  In the four years that have passed since the Reform Act became law, \nAmtrak officials have repeatedly said they were on the ``glide-path to \noperational self-sufficiency.'' Not once in testimony before Congress \ndid Amtrak officials raise concerns now held by Amtrak's President that \nthe once highly regarded Reform Act was no more than an ``impractical, \ninappropriate and destructive concept'' that would hamper Amtrak's \nability to produce results and turn Amtrak around. So I have to ask, \nwhy now? Were these same views held by Amtrak officials during the \nreform bill's enactment? That would not appear to be the case given the \nNovember 1997 letter I quoted from earlier. Why haven't we heard Mr. \nWarrington's critical views until now?\n  Again, the Reform Act provided the statutory reforms that Amtrak \nrequested so it could operate more like a private business. Why has its \nPresident suddenly decided to call its mandates into question? Maybe \nit's because management has made no progress towards meeting the \nrequirements mandated by the law, requirements that Amtrak agreed to in \nexchange for the reforms it requested and was granted? Requirements, \nthat until now, Amtrak said it would meet.\n  Since we now know Amtrak officials cannot make the tough decisions \nnecessary to improve Amtrak's operating and financial condition, the \nlegislation I am proposing creates an Amtrak Control Board, modeled \nafter the D.C. Control Board that was so successful in turning around \nthe financial crisis of the Government of the District of Columbia. The \nAmtrak Control Board would be directed to help address Amtrak's \nfinancial crisis and facilitate Amtrak's privatization.\n  Moreover, I believe we need to allow the States to take a greater \nrole in determining where rail passenger service should be provided. \nPerhaps it is only in the Northeast, or maybe just on State-supported \ncorridors. To help States retain passenger rail service\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nwhere they believe it is needed, I also think that we should allow the \nStates to spend their Federal transportation dollars on rail passenger \nservice.\n  In some areas of the country, such as the Northeast and on the West \nCoast where service is supported by State contributions, rail passenger \nservice seems to be working. We cannot ignore the fact, however, that \nall but two of Amtrak's intercity lines operate at a substantial \nfinancial loss. And while Amtrak has experienced an increase in its \nridership, the actual ridership numbers are dismal compared to other \npassenger modes, including intercity bus transportation and air travel. \nAfter 30 years and over $25 billion of taxpayers' investment, Amtrak is \nused by less than 1 percent of the traveling public.\n  Our urban areas are facing ever-increasing transportation congestion. \nAmericans are spending more and more time sitting in traffic as they \ntry to get to and from work. And each and every one of us has \nexperienced first hand the frustrations of flight delays due to new \nsecurity measures and capacity limitations in our aviation system. It \nis our responsibility to work to remedy these problems by developing \nand enacting sound federal transportation policies.\n  Amtrak is a failed experiment. While the legislation I am offering \nmay not be the approach the majority of the members will support, I \nassure my colleagues that I will do everything in my power to halt the \nhistorical authorization pattern that has taken place for 30 years. I \nwill strongly oppose any measure simply to reauthorize Amtrak in \nexchange for Amtrak promises. If we do that again, in a few years \nAmtrak will be back again explaining why it was unable to fulfill its \npromises and Amtrak will be seeking yet even more money and making even \nmore promises. This same pattern has continued for 30 years.\n\n  The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, which created the National \nRail Passenger Corporation, also known as Amtrak, to free the freight \nindustry from the burden of running passenger trains, was enacted with \nthe intent to provide Amtrak Federal support for only two years. \nClearly, that did not occur. After receiving appropriations for $40 \nmillion in direct grants, $100 million in loan guarantees, in addition \nto capital acquired from participating railroads, Amtrak was unable to \nfulfill the intent of the authorizing legislation. Two years later, \nAmtrak was back before Congress asking for more money in exchange for \nmore promises.\n  By 1978, after four trips to Congress to ask for more Federal money, \nAmtrak had received $2.5 billion in federal funding. But that level of \nfunding was still not enough. When Amtrak came back seeking more \nFederal assistance, Congress responded like it always had. It passed \nlegislation authorizing millions for operating, capital and debt \nreduction expenses. In exchange for this funding, Amtrak agreed to be \noperated and managed as a for-profit corporation and to turn around its \nmoney losing ways. Again, Amtrak failed to fulfill its promises.\n  This pattern has continued during the past 30 years. Amtrak has come \nto Congress year after year seeking a handout. Each time, Amtrak has \nmade promises in return for more federal assistance. Each time, Amtrak \nhas failed to achieve what was expected. Enough is enough.\n  It is interesting to note that before the 1978 law was enacted, the \nGAO warned that Amtrak would have to make serious cuts in its route \nstructure if it was to avoid continual dependence on Federal subsidies. \nAnd here we are nearly 25 years later and the GAO and the DOT-IG are \nrepeating these same realities. Is the Congress finally going to give \ncredence to these auditors' findings?\n  If rail passenger service is ever going to be successful, we must \ntake action to provide for a restructured and rationalized system. We \nneed to hear from the Administration, the States, and the American \npublic in order to develop sound Federal policy to permit safe, \nefficient, and cost-effective rail passenger service in areas that can \nattract riders. Now is the time for all interested parties to come \ntogether and chart a new course for intercity rail passenger \ntransportation.\n  The summary follows.\n\nThe Rail Passenger Service Improvement Act--Summary of Major Provisions\n\n       Purpose: to enable the emergence of a new rail passenger \n     system that would be overseen by the Department of \n     Transportation, but operated by competing franchises, \n     including Amtrak; to require Amtrak's restructuring, \n     financial stabilization and privatization through the \n     creation of an Amtrak Control Board; and to require States to \n     play a bigger role with regard to routing decisions and \n     financial responsibilities. Specifically the legislation:\n       Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a Rail \n     Passenger Development and Franchising Office within the \n     Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Beginning October 1, \n     2003, the Secretary would be authorized to contract out rail \n     passenger service to franchises that meet specified safety \n     and liability requirements, provided such operations would \n     not result in a significant downgrade in rail freight \n     service. Franchises would be required to demonstrate efforts \n     to reach mutual agreements with freight carriers to obtain \n     trackage access prior to being awarded a contract.\n       Directs Amtrak to restructure into three separate \n     subsidiaries to be managed as for-profit businesses with \n     transparent accounting systems: Amtrak Operations, Amtrak \n     Maintenance, and Intercity Rail Reservations. Each subsidiary \n     would be privatized no later than four years after enactment.\n       Establishes an Amtrak Control Board, modeled after the DC \n     Control Board, to help address Amtrak's financial crisis. The \n     Amtrak Control Board would direct Amtrak's operational \n     restructuring, approve budgets and financial plans, and \n     oversee privatization.\n       Requires States to play a greater role, both in route \n     decisions and financial contributions, to allow for a more \n     utilized route system to evolve, with service provided on \n     viable routes or where States contribute to cover operating \n     losses. Beginning October 1, 2003, Amtrak would halt service \n     over any route where revenues do not cover expenses unless \n     states contribute financial support to cover losses.\n       Gives States flexibility to use highway trust fund dollars \n     on rail passenger service at each state's discretion.\n       Authorizes funding to address rail passenger security and \n     tunnel life-safety needs.\n       Authorizes funding for Amtrak operating and Railroad \n     Retirement obligations on a reduced sliding scale. Authorizes \n     funding for the Secretary of Transportation to address rail \n     passenger capital costs and the backlog of infrastructure \n     investment identified by the DOT-Inspector General to bring \n     the Northeast Corridor up to a ``state of good repair.'' \n     Other users and states along the corridor would also \n     contribute to capital costs, much like States must contribute \n     toward highway and airport infrastructure. In exchange for \n     eliminating financial obligations, Amtrak must give up rights \n     and ownership to the Northeast Corridor for which the \n     Secretary already holds a 999-year mortgage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. fitzgerald, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1960. A bill to amend the Biomass Research and Development Act of \n2000 to encourage production of biobased energy products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Biobased \nEnergy Incentives Act of 2002. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nFitzgerald and Johnson. This legislation amends the Biomass Research \nand Development Act of 2000 and establishes a biobased energy incentive \nprogram within the Department of Agriculture.\n  The program provides payments to eligible biofuels producers through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation for using certain commodities to \nproduce ethanol and biodiesel. All ethanol and biodiesel producers will \nbe eligible to participate in the program. However, payment levels will \nbe a little higher for smaller producers, giving them a better chance \nto compete with their larger counterparts. Payments to any one producer \nwill be capped at 7 percent of the total funds made available for a \nfiscal year.\n  This legislation comes at the right time. The Department of \nAgriculture has run a bioenergy program on a pilot basis for the past \ntwo years. It has shown very promising initial results. In Iowa, for \ninstance, the program has helped bring down the price of soy diesel. \nCedar Rapids now has dozens of vehicles that run on a blend of soy and \nregular diesel. Over the same time that this program has operated, the \nU.S. ethanol industry has established production records almost every \nmonth. Nearly 20 new ethanol plants began construction last year, \nassuring continued expansion of the industry.\n  Yet there is no guarantee the Department will continue the program. A \ncontinuation is not in the Administration's budget proposal for fiscal \nyear 2003. We can't afford to see this type of initiative flounder or, \nworse yet, end.\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n Our bill, if passed, will require the Department of Agriculture to run \na bioenergy program indefinitely with secure funding.\n  The benefits of this legislation are obvious. Increased renewable \nfuel production lessens our dependence on foreign oil, provides \nenvironmental and public health gains, bolsters farm income, creates \njobs and boosts economic growth, especially in rural areas. This also \ncontributes to a sound homeland security strategy. The Nation must \nbecome energy independent, and domestically produced renewable fuels, \nalong with other forms of renewable energy like wind power and biomass, \nplay an important part in this endeavor.\n  I want to thank Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Johnson for co-\nsponsoring this legislation with me. Their leadership in this area will \nbe essential in moving the bill forward. I am hopeful we can pass this \nbill quickly to help secure a brighter future for our nation's farmers \nand fellow citizens.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows.\n\n                                S. 1960\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenator Graham, Senator Crapo, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire in \nintroducing the Water Investment Act of 2002. This legislation seeks to \nprovide additional resources to States, Tribes, and localities to meet \nwater infrastructure needs. Simultaneously, it seeks to move the state \nof the art in water program management forward by increasing the \nflexibility offered to States in administering their water programs, \nensuring that ``next generation'' of water quality issues receive the \nappropriate focus, and institutionalizing financial management capacity \ninto our Nation's water systems.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is critical to our Nation's future. \nWe tend to take clean water in our faucets and well-functioning, hidden \nsewage treatment systems for granted in this country. However, without \nvigilance, these luxuries can quickly disappear. The Water Investment \nAct of 2002 will help our communities be vigilant.\n  This legislation authorizes funding of over $20 billion over 5 years \nnationwide for clean water and $15 billion over 5 years nationwide for \nsafe drinking water projects.\n  There is significant new flexibility attached to these funds.\n  Many of the provisions already authorized in the Safe Drinking Water \nAct which allow an extension of loan terms and more favorable loan \nterms (including principal forgiveness) for disadvantaged communities. \nIn States such as my home State of Vermont, these types of provisions \nare critical as small communities struggle to meet water quality needs.\n  Recognizing the needs of larger communities with diverse income \ngroups within their borders, this bill includes a new opportunity for \nStates to provide more favorable loan terms to communities that may not \nbe disadvantaged as a whole, but may have pockets of disadvantaged \nindividuals as long as the community can demonstrate that the financial \nbenefit they received will be directed through the rate structure \ntoward disadvantaged individuals (based on income) in their service \narea.\n  The bill makes the authority to transfer funds between the Safe \nDrinking Water Act and Clean Water Act State revolving funds permanent.\n  There is financial accountability built into the Water Investment Act \nof 2002. We have included provisions for both the Clean Water Act and \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act that are designed to help water utilities \nbetter manage their capital investments using asset management plans, \nrate structures that account for capital replacement costs, and other \nfinancial management techniques. We encourage utilities to seek \ninnovative solutions by asking them to review options for \nconsolidation, public-private partnerships, and low-impact technologies \nbefore proceeding with a project.\n  Whenever one mentions ``consolidation'', concerns are often raised \nabout inadvertently providing incentives for excessive or uncontrolled \ngrowth. This legislation recognizes that concern and includes a \nprovision that specifically requires States to ensure that water \nprojects are coordinated with local land use plans, regional \ntransportation improvement and long-range transportation plans, and \nstate, regional and municipal watershed plans. As a package, this \nlegislation will help ensure that utilities seek the most efficient \norganizational structure to meet their water quality needs.\n  I am also very pleased that the bill includes provisions ensuring \nthat ``next generation'' of water quality issues receives the \nappropriate focus. As I worked on this legislation, I became aware that \nthere are opportunities to use low-impact technologies to solve water \nquality issues that may or may not be considered by states and \nlocalities as they seek to solve water quality issues. In response, our \nbill includes several incentives for use of non-structural \ntechnologies. We specifically state in the statute that these \napproaches are eligible to receive funding under the Clean Water Act \nState Revolving Fund and require that recipients of funds consider the \nuse of low-impact technologies. In addition, we authorize a \ndemonstration program at $20 million per year over 5 years to promote \ninnovations in technology and alternative approaches to water quality \nmanagement and water supply. This program requires that a portion of \nthe projects use low-impact development technologies.\n  The use of nontraditional technologies is the focus in the Water \nInvestment Act to ensure that nonpoint source pollution receives \nappropriate emphasis under the Clean Water Act. The modifications this \nbill makes to the priority listing requirements in the Clean Water Act \nensure that nonpoint source projects will be a part of the equation \nwhen funding decisions are made at the State level.\n  The bill also addresses eligibility issues. It clarifies that \nplanning, design, and associated preconstruction costs are eligible for \nfunds under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act State \nRevolving Funds as stand-alone items. This ensures that small \ncommunities who may not have the resources available to get a project \nready to go on their own can receive assistance.\n  Small communities will also benefit from a provision in the bill that \nallows privately-owned wastewater facilities to access the Clean Water \nAct State Revolving Fund Already permitted under the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, this will allow small, privately-owned wastewater systems \nsuch as those located in trailer parks, to obtain much-needed financial \nassistance.\n  To ensure that both public and private small systems can actually \ndevelop the projects to solve problems, our legislation provides three \nmain types of technical assistance for small communities. It authorizes \n$7 million per year over 5 years for technical assistance to small \nsystems serving less than 3300 people located in a rural area. It \nreauthorizes the Small Public Water Systems Technology Assistance \nCenters for an additional $5 million per year over 5 years. Finally, it \nreauthorizes the Environmental Finance Centers for $1.5 million per \nyear over 5 years.\n  We have heard from many organizations that public participation in \nthe execution of the state revolving loan funds needs to be increased. \nI hope that every individual interested in how water quality projects \nare selected and prioritized in their States takes full advantage of \nexisting opportunties for public participation. Our legislation takes \naction to ensure that there is ample opportunity for public comment \nwhen developing project priority lists and intended use plans.\n  There are a multitude of additional provisions in this legislation \nthat I will leave to my colleagues to discuss. I want to thank Senator \nGraham for his leadership on this legislation and Senators Crapo and \nSmith for their dedication to introducing a bi-partisan package today \nand their willingness to find a compromise when we needed one.\n  Water infrastructure is a major priority for the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee during this Congress. We plan to begin an \naggressive schedule to move this legislation through the Senate on \nFebruary 26 with our first committee hearing, followed by our second \nhearing on February 28 and a markup in early March. I recognize that \nthis issue is of great importance to every Senator, and I look forward \nto working with each of you to pass this important legislation that is \nso important to our Nation's water quality and drinking water safety.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 1962. A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital \nConstruction Fund for fishermen leaving the industry for the rollover \nof Capital Construction Funds to individual retirement plans; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, for \nmyself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Smith of Oregon, the Capital Construction \nFund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2002.\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\n  The groundfish fishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific \nNorthwest continues to face daunting challenges as a result of the \ngroundfish fishery disaster, resulting in a more than 40-percent drop \nin the income of Oregon fishers since 1995. To assist in rebuilding \nhealthy groundfish stocks, my goal remains to reduce overcapitalization \nin the groundfish fishery. We want to get the right number of fishers \nout there, at the right time, catching the right number of fish. This \nlegislation supports this effort by reforming the Capital Construction \nFund in a way that will ease the transition for groundfish fishers away \nfrom fishing.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, was created by the Merchant \nMarine Act of 1936, as amended in 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177. CCF has been a \nway for fishers to accumulate funds, free from taxes, for the purpose \nof buying or refitting fishing vessels. The program has been a success; \nhowever, the CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and today \nthe CCF is exacerbating the problems facing U.S. fisheries, including \nthe West Coast groundfish fishery.\n  CCF works like an Individual Retirement Account, IRA, in that \ndeposits to the fund earn interest and are deducted from the \nfishermen's taxable income. But unlike IRAs, there is no limit on \ncontributions to the CCF; so fishers are able to accumulate funds \nquickly. In Oregon, the amounts in the accounts range from $10,000 to \nover $200,000.\n  The problem my legislation will address is that fishers lose up to 70 \npercent of their funds in taxes and penalties if they withdraw funds \nfrom the CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels or upgrading \ncurrent vessels. Because of the environmental problems plaguing \ncommercial fishing, as well as the overcapitalization of the fishing \nfleet, fishermen who want to opt out of fishing are penalized for doing \nso.\n  This bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and \nmaking the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing \nindustry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of \ninvestments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the \nInternal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled \nover into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used \nfor the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity \nreduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account \nholders.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation, and I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows.\n\n                                S. 1962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON GLOBAL WARMING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the Earth's \n     average temperature can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years''.\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years, the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) The Environmental Protection Agency has found that \n     global warming may harm the United States by altering crop \n     yields, accelerating sea level rise, and increasing the \n     spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention of Climate Change, done at New York on \n     May 9, 1992, the ultimate objective of which is the \n     ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system'', and \n     which stated in part ``the Parties to the Convention are to \n     implement policies with the aim of returning . . . to their \n     1990 levels anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and \n     other greenhouse gases.''\n       (7) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (8) The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change further states that ``developed country Parties should \n     take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse \n     effects thereof'', as these nations are the largest historic \n     and current emitters of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) Senate Resolution 98 of July 1997, which expressed that \n     developing nations, especially the largest emitters, must \n     also be included in any future, binding climate change treaty \n     and such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the \n     United States economy, should not cause the United States to \n     abandon its shared responsibility to help find a solution to \n     the global climate change dilemma.\n       (10) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will respond to the threat of global warming.\n       (11) The United States has benefitted and will continue to \n     benefit from investments in the research, development and \n     deployment of a range of clean energy and efficiency \n     technologies that can mitigate global warming and that can \n     make the United States economy more productive, bolster \n     energy security, create jobs, and protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the United \n     States Congress that the United States should demonstrate \n     international leadership and responsibility in mitigating the \n     health, environmental, and economic threats posed by global \n     warming by:\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors;\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, emissions trading and carbon sequestration \n     projects that will reduce, avoid, and sequester greenhouse \n     gas emissions; and\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal at the next meeting of the \n     Conference of the Parties, with the objective of securing \n     United States' participation in a revised Kyoto Protocol or \n     other future binding climate change agreements in a manner \n     that is consistent with the environmental objectives of the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, that protects the \n     economic interests of the United States, and recognizes the \n     shared international responsibility for addressing climate \n     change, including developing country participation.\n                  Subtitle B--Climate Change Strategy\n\n     SEC. 1011.

and\n       (B) the investments that have been made have not been \n     guided by a comprehensive strategy;\n       (11) the negative trends in research and development \n     funding described in paragraph (10) must be reversed with a \n     focus on not only traditional energy research and \n     development, but also bolder, breakthrough research;\n       (12) much more progress could be made on the issue of \n     climate change if the United States were to adopt a new \n     approach for addressing climate change that included, as an \n     ultimate long-term goal--\n       (A) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system; and\n       (B) a response strategy with 4 key elements consisting of--\n       (i) definition of interim emission mitigation levels, that, \n     coupled with specific mitigation approaches and after taking \n     into account actions by other nations (if any), would result \n     in stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations;\n       (ii) technology development, including--\n       (I) a national commitment to double energy research and \n     development by the United States public and private sectors; \n     and\n       (II) in carrying out such research and development, a \n     national commitment to provide a high degree of emphasis on \n     bold, breakthrough technologies that will make possible a \n     profound transformation of the energy, transportation, \n     industrial, agricultural, and building sectors of the United \n     States;\n       (iii) climate adaptation research that--\n       (I) focuses on response actions necessary to adapt to \n     climate change that may have already occurred;\n       (II) focuses on response actions necessary to adapt to \n     climate change that may occur under any future climate change \n     scenario;\n       (iv) climate science research that--\n       (I) builds on the substantial scientific understanding of \n     climate change that exists as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (II) focuses on resolving the remaining scientific, \n     technical, and economic uncertainties to aid in the \n     development of sound response strategies; and\n       (13) inherent in each of the 4 key elements of the response \n     strategy is consideration of the international nature of the \n     challenge, which will require--\n       (A) establishment of joint climate response strategies and \n     joint research programs;\n       (B) assistance to developing countries and countries in \n     transition for building technical and institutional \n     capacities and incentives for addressing the challenge;
