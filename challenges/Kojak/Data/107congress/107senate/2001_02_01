The Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Ashcroft nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John Ashcroft, of \nMissouri, to be Attorney General.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 9:15 shall be under the control of the majority party.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 9:30 shall be under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after reviewing his testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee and studying his long public record, I cannot \nsupport the nomination of John Ashcroft to be United States Attorney \nGeneral.\n  This is not an easy decision for any of us. We have all served in \nthis body with former Senator Ashcroft. I cannot say that I was a \npersonal friend of his. We never associated socially or anything like \nthat, but I did have dealings with Senator Ashcroft, as we all do \naround here, on matters of legislative importance.\n  Quite frankly, in my dealings with him, I always found him to be \ncourteous to me and my staff. I found that we could work together even \nthough we did not have the same views, perhaps, on certain pieces of \nlegislation. I found\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\nthat we worked together in the spirit of compromise here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  When John Ashcroft's name was first announced as the nominee for \nAttorney General, I, of course, thought to myself, he certainly would \nnot have been my first choice, but then again George Bush was not my \nfirst choice for President. But I recognized that Presidents should \nhave fairly large leeway to have the people around them they want.\n  But, again, we also have an obligation, a constitutional obligation, \nin the advise and consent clause in the U.S. Constitution to look over \nthose individuals, to give careful scrutiny to those individuals, to \nmake sure that we, as a body collectively--at least by majority vote--\nare able to believe that nominated officials will have the honesty, the \ncharacter, and wherewithal to carry out their duties and to serve all \nof the American people well.\n  After long and difficult deliberation, I have come to the conclusion \nthat there are significant questions raised on John Ashcroft's fitness \nto be our Nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  First and foremost, I have serious concerns about the misleading \nstatements Mr. Ashcroft made during the confirmation hearings.\n  As we all know, Senator Ashcroft strongly opposed the nomination of \nMr. Jim Hormel as Ambassador to Luxembourg. Jim Hormel, a distinguished \nlawyer, successful businessman, educator, philanthropist a scion of our \nfamous midwestern families. We all have heard of Hormel Meats. We \nprobably had Hormel bacon in the morning, things such as that. They are \na fine family who came from Iowa and Minnesota. Mr. Hormel, of course, \nhas taken up his residency, as of late, in San Francisco, I don't know \nhow many years ago, but some years ago. Prior to that, he had been Dean \nof Students at the University of Chicago Law School.\n  I have known Mr. Hormel for many years. I consider him a friend. As I \nsaid, not only is he a great lawyer, businessman, educator, and \nphilanthropist, but he is also an outstanding family man.\n  In 1998, Mr. Ashcroft said he opposed Mr. Hormel's nomination because \nhe had--and I quote John Ashcroft's own words--``actively supported the \ngay lifestyle.''\n  Further, Mr. Ashcroft said that a person's sexual conduct--and I \nquote again Mr. Ashcroft's own words--``is within what could be \nconsidered and what is eligible for consideration'' for ambassadorial \nnominees.\n  However, in his testimony just 2 weeks ago, Mr. Ashcroft denied his \nopposition had anything to do with Jim Hormel's sexual orientation. He \nsaid he opposed him because, again, he had known Jim Hormel for a long \ntime, going back to the days when Hormel had--and I quote again John \nAshcroft--``recruited him'' for law school.\n  Mr. Ashcroft said he based his opposition to Jim Hormel being \nAmbassador to Luxembourg on the totality of Hormel's record. I spoke \nwith Ambassador Hormel just last week about this. He said he had never \nhad any contact with Senator Ashcroft, not when he was dean of students \nat the University of Chicago Law School and not since he was nominated \nin 1997. He did not recruit Mr. Ashcroft for law school. As dean of \nstudents, of course--and there are a lot of students there--Mr. Hormel \nwas honest; he said: I can't remember. Maybe when he was a student, I \nmight have met him. I might have talked to him. I might have said \nsomething to a group of students. He may have come into my office for \nsomething. But I have no recollection of that.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Hormel emphatically stated he did not ``recruit'' \nJohn Ashcroft for Chicago Law School. When he was nominated in 1997, \nMr. Hormel repeatedly tried to meet with John Ashcroft to talk to him. \nEven if I oppose someone, I at least give them the courtesy to come in \nand make their case. I have always made that policy, because maybe \nthere is something I haven't heard or something I would look at \ndifferently. John Ashcroft would not even meet with Jim Hormel.\n  Mr. Hormel did get a recess appointment from President Clinton, \nserved well, and was distinguished in his post in Luxembourg. I asked \npeople at the State Department in charge of that area how he performed, \nand they said extremely well. They said that he had conducted his \nposition in the best interests of the United States and as a \ndistinguished Ambassador. Again, sexual orientation should not have any \nbearing on a person's fitness for that job or any other job.\n  John Ashcroft also testified that he has never asked job applicants \nabout their sexual orientation. But in a recent Washington Post \narticle, a health care expert, Paul Offner, who had interviewed for a \ncabinet post under then Governor Ashcroft, remembers differently. \nOffner, who is now part of the Georgetown University faculty, recalled \nthat Governor Ashcroft's first question to him was whether or not he \nhad the same sexual preferences as most men. At the time it happened, \nOffner, also told others about the interview question.\n  If this is true, this does not seem to be the kind of individual who \nshould serve as Attorney General of the United States of America.\n  I am also disturbed by how, as an elected official--namely, U.S. \nSenator--Mr. Ashcroft used unseemly political tactics, including the \nreckless and unwarranted destruction of a judicial nominee's \nreputation, a sitting judge's reputation, for his own political \nbenefit. Senator Ashcroft led the campaign to block the Federal \njudicial nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White in \norder to gain political points in his reelection bid against then-\nsitting Gov. Mel Carnahan. Ashcroft on this very floor referred to the \ndistinguished and accomplished judge as ``pro-criminal and activist,'' \na man with a ``tremendous bent toward criminal activity.''\n  Mr. Ashcroft stood on this floor--I remember listening to him, and I \ncouldn't believe someone actually said this about a sitting State \nsupreme court justice from his own State--that Judge White had ``a \ntremendous bent toward criminal activity.''\n  I don't know Ronnie White. I have met him only once. But after I \nlooked over his record it seemed to me that what Mr. Ashcroft was \nsaying was not only false, it was defamatory. And it is behavior \nunworthy of a U.S. Attorney General. It is one thing in a political \ncampaign to take on your political opponent and hit him with tough \nwords in tough races, but you can fight back. I have been hit pretty \nhard in some of my political campaigns. But when the election is over, \nyou get over it because at least you are able to fight back. Here was a \nSenator using the privileges of the floor of the Senate to personally \ndefame the character of a sitting Supreme Court justice of the State of \nMissouri when that judge had no ability to fight back.\n\n  Finally Mr. White did get his day, sort of, in court before the \nJudiciary Committee. I commend Senator Leahy for making sure Ronnie \nWhite got his day here to show that he is a distinguished justice, that \nhe has absolutely the opposite of a bent toward criminal activity. He \nalso strongly believes in upholding the law, ensuring that every \nperson, no matter how low that person is, no matter how heinous the \ncrime--that every person has competent representation and a fair trial. \nMr. Ashcroft's own words and what he did to Justice White make me \nwonder if Mr. Ashcroft thinks every person, no matter how low, no \nmatter how heinous the crime, no matter how much you disagree with that \nperson, is entitled to competent representation and a fair trial.\n  I also have concerns about John Ashcroft's testimony about the \ndesegregation court order in Missouri when he was attorney general and \ngovernor. John Ashcroft said that Missouri did nothing wrong. But I \nthink most people would agree that upholding segregation and blatantly \ndefying a federal court order is the very definition of wrong. This was \nin the 1980s, not the 1950s.\n  Also while Governor, Mr. Ashcroft appointed the election boards in \nSt. Louis County and in St. Louis city. The county, an affluent area, \n84 percent white, votes mainly Republican; the city, less affluent, 47 \npercent black, votes mainly Democratic. During that period of time, the \ncounty hired 1,500 volunteers, such as out of the League of Women \nVoters, for training, for registration of voters. During that same \nperiod of time, the city board trained zero because the city election \nboard, appointed by John Ashcroft, refused to follow the policy on \nvolunteers used by his appointed board in the county and\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\nthroughout the state. The State legislature saw this anomaly and passed \ntwo bills in 1988 and 1989 to require the city to do the same as the \ncounty and the state. Governor Ashcroft vetoed both of those bills.\n  I am also troubled by parts of John Ashcroft's record which reflects \npoorly on his commitment to seeking justice for all Americans. Despite \nhis statements to the contrary, I am simply not convinced that John \nAshcroft will diligently and thoroughly uphold all of our laws.\n  I am particularly concerned about John Ashcroft's statements and \nactions regarding reproductive rights. Throughout his career, he has \nbeen a staunch opponent of the right of women to make their own \nreproductive decisions. He even wrote legislation to criminalize \nabortion, even in the cases of rape and incest. Yet during his recent \ntestimony, John Ashcroft told committee members he believes that Roe v. \nWade is the law of the land--and he would not try to overturn it. He \neven stated, ``No woman should fear being threatened or coerced in \nseeking constitutionally protected health services.'' How are America's \nwomen supposed to believe John Ashcroft in his recent testimony on a \nwoman's right to choose when he had repeatedly stated during his \npolitical career that there is no constitutional right to choose and \nthat Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided? I'm not sure he can.\n  I am not sure anyone can simply switch off decades of hostility to \nreproductive rights, intolerance towards homosexuals, and other views, \nand then fairly and aggressively enforce the laws--he deeply believes \nare wrong.\n  As I expect, John Ashcroft will be confirmed despite my vote. I hope \nthey will prove me wrong.\n  I thank the President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of \neditorials and material regarding the nomination be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Ashcroft Is the Wrong Man for Justice\n\n       John Ashcroft, the man who would be attorney general, is \n     quite a deft backpedaler. Just a few weeks ago, he was a \n     right-wing ideologue dedicated to banning abortion and \n     fighting the civil-rights tide. Now he says he's eager to \n     enforce the laws he hates. So which Ashcroft are we getting--\n     last year's true believer or a Bush-era compromiser?\n       It's impossible to tell, and maybe it doesn't matter. \n     Whether Ashcroft is an extremist in centrist garb or some \n     sort of changeling, Americans have reason to worry. They \n     needn't fret because of Ashcroft's conservative leanings; \n     anyone President Bush sends to Justice is bound to lean that \n     way. They should worry instead about Ashcroft's integrity. As \n     last week's hearings evinced, he has less of it than his \n     backers like to think.\n       For starters, there's the small matter of the truth. \n     Ashcroft isn't telling it. His declarations before the Senate \n     contradict his record. Some of his equivocation is penny-\n     ante--such as his claim that he'd never have spoken so fondly \n     of proslavery confederate leaders to Southern Partisan \n     magazine back in 1998 if he'd known the rag favored \n     slaveholding itself.\n       But other Ashcroft remarks are bold-faced revisionism: His \n     claim that he'd been ``found guilty of no wrong'' and \n     faithfully heeded all court orders in a St. Louis \n     desegregation case is false; the record shows Ashcroft \n     habitually flouted court orders. His insistence that he \n     derailed a federal judgeship for Missouri Supreme Court \n     Justice Ronnie White for principled reasons is belied by the \n     stealth, slurs and distortions Ashcroft used to achieve his \n     end.\n       An archaeologist could find a small heap of twisted facts \n     in last week's hearings, and with them many hints that \n     Ashcroft isn't the sort of man who ought to be running the \n     Justice Department. But this would be true even if Ashcroft \n     had been forthright about his past.\n       The central question of integrity involves the way \n     Ashcroft's mind works. What are senators to make of a man who \n     has spent his life expressing extreme convictions--and who \n     now says he won't lift a finger to fulfill them? They can \n     doubt him, which would be natural enough. The confirmation \n     process is generally regarded as a ceremonial gauntlet to be \n     run, not a serious test of honor. Dissembling is almost part \n     of the game, and it's up to the Senate to separate the clever \n     wheat from the lying chaff.\n       Perhaps Ashcroft falls into the second category. Perhaps \n     what he's saying isn't what he plans to do once he's got the \n     Justice Department under his thumb. The prospect is haunting, \n     and is reason enough to reject Ashcroft's nomination.\n       But what if Ashcroft is telling the truth--or at least \n     thinks he is? It could very well be, as the man himself said, \n     that Ashcroft really plans to enforce every last law of the \n     land whether he likes it or not. If that's the case, doubts \n     about Ashcroft should double. It's worth wondering about a \n     man who has spent his life vowing to topple the laws he now \n     says he'll enforce. Why should he want to do this? How will \n     he manage it? How can he possibly muster the spirit to do it \n     well?\n       An attorney general isn't just an attorney. He's also a \n     visionary, a keeper of the flame of American justice. He must \n     believe with all he has not just in the sanctity of ``the \n     law,'' but in the laws themselves. A quibble with a statute \n     here and there isn't enough to disqualify a seeker of the \n     office. But a nominee who has raged all his life against the \n     guiding lights of American law--against the promises of the \n     Constitution itself--is not a fit flame-keeper.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          John Ashcroft Should Be Rejected as Attorney General\n\n       It was not in the United States' best interests for George \n     W. Bush, the incoming president who vowed to unite the \n     country after a bruising and narrowly decided election, to \n     nominate for attorney general a man of such extreme beliefs \n     as John Ashcroft of Missouri.\n       While that bell cannot be unrung, the Senate should not \n     accommodate or be party to so drastic a move away from the \n     political center that the country is so comfortable with now.\n       In this unique case, senators--among them Washington \n     state's Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell--should forego their \n     customary deference to a president's Cabinet choice and \n     reject Ashcroft.\n       Not because of his beliefs. Because of his record as a two-\n     term state attorney general, the public office he has held \n     that most closely resembles the one he seeks. As the nation's \n     chief attorney, he would lead the Justice Department, a \n     mammoth government agency that has been described as being at \n     the front line of battles over emotional social issues like \n     civil rights, abortion, crime and the selection of federal \n     judges.\n       Personally, and as a governor and member of Congress, \n     Ashcroft had every right to vociferously oppose abortion, \n     even in the case of rape and incest; seek to limit government \n     funds for family planning, and work to defeat modest gun \n     control regulations.\n       In advance of Ashcroft's hearing before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, we posed a question to the senators who \n     would be asked to confirm the nomination: Could they be \n     persuaded that Ashcroft would enforce the laws as they are, \n     not as he would like them to be?\n       It is clear from the resulting testimony and Ashcroft's \n     long public record in Missouri that the answer is likely to \n     be no. As Missouri attorney general, Ashcroft was not \n     regularly even-handed or moderate on at least a couple of \n     thorny social issues that remain front and center in the \n     country's psyche--women's reproductive rights and civil \n     rights.\n       He attempted on several occasions to severely restrict a \n     woman's legal right to choose an abortion by seeking out \n     cases in which that was not the main issue and forcing them \n     upward through various layers of appeals to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court.\n       The end goal was to overturn Roe vs. Wade. His official \n     record invites serious questions whether he would (1) do the \n     same on the federal stage and (2) vigorously enforce existing \n     laws restricting violent and obstructive demonstrations at \n     abortion clinics by anti-abortion opponents.\n       Aside from Ashcroft's major misstatement during the hearing \n     about the culpability of the state in a long-running school \n     desegregation case, the record paints a picture of an \n     attorney general who obstructed the cause of equal education \n     for children of all races.\n       When a federal judge ordered the state and city of St. \n     Louis to submit plans for voluntary desegregation of the \n     public schools, Ashcroft balked. The court finally threatened \n     to hold the state in contempt if it did not meet the \n     deadline: ``The court can draw only one conclusion--the state \n     has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the \n     authority of the court.''\n       Moreover, Gary Orfield, a Harvard University education \n     professor and leading expert on school desegregation, said \n     Ashcroft was the ``most resistant individual'' he encountered \n     in more than 30 federal court cases on the issue.\n       The record demonstrates Ashcroft is not a uniter, but a \n     divider--something Bush and the country cannot afford in \n     these early stages of healing.\n       Within the ranks of the National Association of Attorneys \n     General are 17 people who share Bush's political affiliation, \n     including moderates such as Mike Fisher of Pennsylvania and \n     Carla Stovall of Kansas. We submit either would be a more \n     suitable U.S. attorney general than John Ashcroft.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the New York Times, Saturday, Jan. 20, 2001]\n\n                         After the Ball Is Over\n\n                            (By Frank Rich)\n\n       Presidents come and go, but a Washington cliche is forever. \n     Today we'll be lectured repeatedly on the poignancy of a \n     president's exit (not that he's actually going anywhere), the \n     promise of a new president's arrival, and on the glory of our \n     Republic. We'll be reminded that there are no tanks in the \n     streets when America changes leaders--only cheesy floats and \n     aural assault weapons in the guise of high school bands.\n       All true, and yet at this inaugural more than any other in \n     any American's lifetime\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\n     there is a cognitive dissonance between the patriotic \n     sentiment and the reality. More Americans voted for the \n     candidate who lost the election than the one who won. The \n     Washington Post/ABC News poll says that only 41 percent \n     believe the winner ``has a mandate to carry out the agenda'' \n     of his campaign. Even before the Florida fracas, the \n     country's black population rejected the republican candidate \n     (who assiduously tried to attract black voters) by a larger \n     margin than any since Barry Goldwater (who had voted against \n     the Civil Rights Act). And now come calamities ignored in a \n     campaign that dithered about prescription drugs, tax cuts and \n     schools: an energy melt-down in the nation's biggest state, \n     and a possible economic downturn.\n       George W. Bush seems like an earnest man. When he says he \n     has come to Washington to ``change the tone'' and ``unite, \n     not divide,'' I don't doubt his sincerity. But so far his \n     actions are those of another entitled boomer who is utterly \n     blind to his own faults. He narcissistically believes things \n     to be so (and his intentions pure) because he says they are.\n       Change the tone? As Clinton-Gore raised $33 million largely \n     from their corporate masters for their first inaugural, so \n     Bush-Cheney have solicited $35 million from, among others, \n     the securities firms that want to get their hands on your \n     privatized Social Security retirement accounts and the \n     pharmaceutical companies that want to protect the prices of \n     prescription drugs. And already foreign money is making its \n     entrance--in the form of a legal but unsavory $100,000 \n     contribution from the deputy prime minister of Lebanon, \n     channeled through his son.\n       Now comes the news--reported by the columnist Robert \n     Novak--that John Huang, the convicted Clinton-Gore fund-\n     raiser, repeatedly took the Fifth Amendment in November when \n     questioned in court about his alleged fiscal ties to \n     Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the No. 1 \n     opponent of the John McCain crusade for campaign finance \n     reform that Mr. Bush has yet to credibly embrace. (Mr. \n     McConnell is also the husband of Mr. Bush's latest labor \n     secretary-designate, Elaine Chao.)\n       Change the tone? Hard as it is to imagine that anyone could \n     choose an attorney general as polarizing as the last, Mr. \n     Bush has outdone himself. With a single cabinet pick he has \n     reproduced the rancor that attended the full Clinton legal \n     troika of Reno, Hubbell & Foster.\n       There's been much debate about whether John Ashcroft is a \n     racist--a hard case to make against a man whose history of \n     playing the race card to pander to voters is balanced by his \n     record of black judicial appointments. But there has not been \n     nearly enough debate about whether our incipient chief legal \n     officer has lied under oath to the Senate.\n       Perhaps his seeming fudging and reversals of his previous \n     stands on Roe v. Wade and gun control can be rationalized as \n     clever lawyerese. Perhaps some of his evasions can be \n     dismissed as a politicians' typical little white lies--and I \n     do mean white--such as when he denies he knew that a magazine \n     he favored with an interview, Southern Partisan, espoused the \n     slaveholding views of Southern partisans. But it took a \n     bolder kind of dissembling to contradict his own paper trail \n     in public office. After he swore that the state of Missouri \n     ``had been found guilty of no wrong'' in a landmark St. Louis \n     desegregation case and that ``both as attorney general and as \n     governor'' of the state he had followed ``all'' court orders \n     in the matter, The Washington Post needed only a day to \n     report the truth: A federal district judge in fact ruled that \n     the state was a ``primary constitutional wrongdoer'' in the \n     matter and threatened to hold Mr. Ashcroft in contempt for \n     his ``continual delay and failure to comply'' with court \n     orders.\n       Mr. Ashcroft may have left even more land mines in his \n     testimony about the businessman, philanthropist and former \n     law school official James Hormel, the Clinton ambassador \n     to Luxembourg whose nomination he had fought. Asked by \n     Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary chairman, if he had opposed \n     Mr. Hormel because Mr. Hormel is gay, Mr. Aschroft \n     answered, ``I did not.'' Then why did he oppose Mr. \n     Hormel? ``Well, frankly, I had known Mr. Hormel for a long \n     time. He had recruited me, when I was a student in \n     college, to go to the University of Chicago Law School,'' \n     Mr. Ashcroft testified, before adding a cryptic answer he \n     would repeat two times as Mr. Leahy pressed him: ``I made \n     a judgment that it would be ill advised to make him \n     ambassador based on the totality of the record.''\n       The implication of this creepy testimony is that Mr. \n     Ashcroft, having known the 68-year-old Mr. Hormel for \n     decades, had some goods on him. The use of the word \n     ``recruit'' by Mr. Ashcroft also had a loaded connotation in \n     context, since it's common for those on the religious right \n     who argue (as Mr. Ashcroft does) that sexual orientation is a \n     choice to accuse homosexuals of ``recruiting'' the young.\n       No senator followed up Mr. Ashcroft's testimony about Mr. \n     Hormel, who, unlike another subject of an Ashcroft character \n     assassination, Judge Ronnie White, was not invited to testify \n     at the hearings. I located Mr. Hormel by phone in Washington, \n     where he had traveled for final meetings at the State \n     Department after concluding his service in Luxembourg. He \n     strongly disputed Mr. Ashcroft's version of events.\n       ``I don't recall ever recruiting anybody for the University \n     of Chicago,'' Mr. Hormel said in our conversation Wednesday \n     night. As an assistant dean involved with admissions, he \n     says, he might have met Mr. Ashcroft in passing while touring \n     campuses to give talks to prospective law school applicants, \n     or in later office visits about grades or curriculum. But, \n     Mr. Hormel quickly adds, he doesn't recall ``a single \n     conversation with John Ashcroft.'' Nor has Mr. Hormel seen \n     him in the three decades since; Mr. Ashcroft didn't have the \n     courtesy to respond to repeated requests for a meeting during \n     Mr. Hormel's own confirmation process and didn't bother to \n     attend Mr. Hormel's hearing before opposing him.\n       ``I think he made insinuations which would lead people to \n     have a complete misunderstanding of my very limited \n     relationship with him,'' Mr. Hormel says. ``I fear that there \n     was an inference he created that he knew me and based on that \n     knowledge he came to the conclusion I wasn't fit to become an \n     ambassador. I find that very disturbing. He kept repeating \n     the phrase `the totality of the record.' I don't know what \n     record he's talking about. I don't know of anything I've ever \n     done that's been called unethical.'' The record that Mr. \n     Ashcroft so casually smeared includes an appointment to the \n     U.N. in 1996 that was confirmed by the Foreign Relations \n     Committee on which Mr. Ashcroft then sat.\n       Since Mr. Bush could easily have avoided the divisiveness \n     of the Ashcroft choice by picking an equally conservative \n     attorney general with less baggage, some of his opponents \n     will start calling him ``stupid'' again. That seems unfair. \n     Mr. Bush's real problem is arrogance--he thinks we are \n     stupid. He thinks that if he vouches incessantly for the \n     ``good heart'' of a John Ashcroft, that settles it. It \n     hasn't. Polls showed an even split on the nomination well \n     before the hearings. He thinks that if he fills the stage \n     with black faces at a white convention and poses incessantly \n     with black schoolkids and talks about being the ``inclusive'' \n     president ``of everybody,'' he'll persuade minority voters \n     he's compassionate. He hasn't.\n       George W. Bush likes to boast that he doesn't watch TV. He \n     didn't even tune in as the nation's highest court debated his \n     fate, leaving his princely retainers to bring him bulletins. \n     Maybe it's time for him to start listening; he might even \n     learn why so many Americans aren't taking his word for John \n     Ashcroft's ``heart.'' I don't doubt that our new president \n     will give a poetic Inaugural Address today, but if he remains \n     out of touch with the country, he will not be able to govern \n     tomorrow.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Austin American Statesman, Jan. 19, 2001]\n\n                  Ashcroft's Pledge To Enforce the Law\n\n       President-elect George W. Bush missed a chance to select a \n     uniter to heal divisions wrought by the bruising presidential \n     election when he chose John Ashcroft to be his nominee for \n     attorney general.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings this week on \n     Capitol Hill have exposed the grave reservations some \n     senators and witnesses have about Ashcroft's fitness for the \n     role of guardian of our country's laws and all Americans' \n     constitutional rights because of his staunchly conservative \n     record. At the same time, the hearings have galvanized \n     Ashcroft's supporters, who praise him as a man of character, \n     principle and honesty, a lawyer who would bring ample \n     leadership experience to the job.\n       Early indications are that Ashcroft will win Senate \n     confirmation. He was, after all, a member of the Senate, \n     having lost re-election in November. His colleagues know him \n     well and would need extraordinary evidence to sink his \n     nomination. It is customary for senators to give deference to \n     a president in selecting his team to reflect his views. As \n     any boss would attest, that tradition makes sense in building \n     a loyal team, but so does the Senate's valuable role in \n     providing confirmation.\n       The Judiciary Committee is carefully probing Ashcroft's \n     record as Missouri's attorney general for two terms, governor \n     for two terms and senator for one. Ironically, the man from \n     the Show Me State is being grilled to tell us how he will \n     perform as U.S. attorney general. While his record is mixed--\n     reflecting troubling stands on desegregation, gun control and \n     abortion rights--his words to the committee offer reassurance \n     that can only be tested with time.\n       The attorney general serves as the country's chief law \n     enforcement officer, vets federal judge nominees, decides \n     which laws to challenge, enforces civil-rights laws and \n     safeguards liberties, including women's reproductive rights.\n       In his most important pledge, he told the committee his \n     personal beliefs would not interfere with the job he will be \n     sworn to do.\n       ``I understand that being attorney general means enforcing \n     the laws as they are written, not enforcing my own personal \n     preference,'' he told the senators. ``I pledge to you that \n     strict enforcement of the rule of law will be the cornerstone \n     of justice.''\n       Ashcroft is a fierce opponent of the U.S. Supreme Court's \n     landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. He \n     supports a constitutional amendment that would prohibit \n     abortions even in cases of rape or incest and would allow \n     them only if the mother's life were in danger. In the \n     hearings, he said he would not seek to challenge Roe v. Wade \n     and viewed the abortion decisions as ``the settled law of the \n     land.'' He emphasized he knows\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\n     ``the difference between an enactment role and an enforcement \n     role. During my time as a public official, I have followed \n     the law.''\n       He defended his fight against landmark desegregation cases \n     in St. Louis and Kansas City, saying he had never opposed \n     integration. But The Washington Post reported Thursday that \n     court documents show the state of Missouri was labeled by a \n     federal district judge as a ``primary constitutional \n     wrongdoer'' in perpetuating segregated schools in St. Louis. \n     In 1981, U.S. District Judge William Hungate threatened to \n     hold then-state Attorney General Ashcroft and the state in \n     contempt for ``continual delay and failure to comply'' with \n     orders to file a desegregation plan. Hungate wrote later, \n     ``The state has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to \n     defy the authority of this court.''\n       Ashcroft also had to deflect criticism for blocking Ronnie \n     White, the first black Missouri Supreme Court justice, from \n     becoming a federal judge. In U.S. Senate proceedings in 1999, \n     Ashcroft called White ``pro-criminal,'' although White voted \n     to uphold the death penalty in 41 of 59 cases. ``I deeply \n     resent those baseless accusations,'' White told the Judiciary \n     Committee on Thursday. Ashcroft said White's dissents didn't \n     meet the standards for retrying cases.\n       Ashcroft's defenders make their best case when they give \n     examples of how the nominee enforced laws to which he was \n     personally opposed. He once argued as attorney general \n     against the dissemination of religious materials on public \n     school grounds, even though he favored the practice. He \n     created the structure for a lottery when it won approval in \n     Missouri, even though he calls gambling a ``cancer.'' In \n     other matters, he balanced eight straight budgets, increased \n     education funding, championed consumer protection and \n     advocated online privacy bills.\n       If his nomination is affirmed, as it appears it will be, in \n     time Ashcroft will be tested on his words to senators that no \n     part of the Justice Department is more important than the \n     Civil Rights Division and on his pronouncement, ``My primary \n     personal belief is that the law is supreme.'' Americans will \n     be counting on him to show us by his actions that his words \n     weren't convenient window-dressing for a record that reflects \n     effective public service but falls short of inspiring \n     national bipartisanship.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 9:45 a.m. is under the control of the Senator from South Dakota, \nMr. Johnson.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, while I have cast votes in favor of all \n15 of President Bush's nominees to come thus far before the Senate, I \nrise today to say, sadly, that I cannot vote in favor of Senator John \nAshcroft for the office of Attorney General of the United States.\n  My position on Cabinet level nominees during both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidencies has remained the same: a presumption in favor \nof a President's nomination rests with the nominee, and they should be \nrejected by the Senate only under extraordinary circumstances. Thus far \nduring the 107th Congress, I have voted in favor of: Paul O'Neill for \nTreasury Secretary; Spencer Abraham for Energy Secretary; Donald Evans \nfor Commerce Secretary; Donald Rumsfeld for Defense Secretary; Ann \nVeneman for Agriculture Secretary; Roderick Paige for Education \nSecretary; Colin Powell for Secretary of State; Melquiades Martinez as \nHousing and Urban Development Secretary; Anthony Principi as Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs; Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. to be Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget; Tommy G. Thompson for Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services; Norman Mineta as Transportation Secretary; \nElaine Chao as Secretary of Labor; Gale Norton as Interior Secretary; \nand Christine Todd Whitman as Environmental Protection Agency Director.\n  Even though numerous of these people have used positions that are \ncontrary to my own, I have respected the President's nominations, and \nhave cast my votes on all 15 of these instances in favor of the \nPresident's nominee.\n  The U.S. Constitution, however, requires the Senate to consider \nconsent or rejection of Cabinet nominees, and the Senate was not \nintended by the founders of our Nation to be simply a ``rubber stamp'' \nfor any President. I am particularly troubled by this nomination for \nAttorney General, knowing that office does not serve as ``the \nPresident's personal lawyer''--the President has White House counsel \nfor that purpose--but that the Attorney General serves as the peoples' \nlawyer; he is an advocate for all Americans in our courts of law.\n  I have applauded President Bush's expressions of support for \nbipartisan Government and the kind of political moderation that will \nbring Americans together rather than tear them apart. In turn, I have \nhelped organize a ``centrist caucus'' of Republicans and Democrats in \nthe Senate, and a ``New Democratic'' organization consisting of \nmoderate Democrats committed to working with moderate Republicans. I \nbelieve this is the kind of Government the American people want, and \nthat they are weary of political extremism and harsh ideologies of \neither the left or right.\n  I must conclude, based on testimony in Senate hearings, and from a \nreview of Senator Ashcroft's years in elective office, that this man is \nthe wrong man at the wrong time for the high office of Attorney \nGeneral. If ever there was a nominee who has committed his years of \npublic service to rejecting bipartisanship and moderation, it is \nSenator Ashcroft. This nominee has stated repeatedly that he will never \nbe a party to moderation, or to conciliation between the parties. He \nhas consistently mocked the very notion of bipartisanship during his \nyears in the Senate. He is famous for his observation when he says that \nonly two things will be found in the middle of the road--dead skunks \nand moderates, and I will be neither. How now, can Senator Ashcroft \ngain the confidence of all the American people that he will be their \ndefender and their advocate?\n\n  Senator Ashcroft refuses to distance himself from Bob Jones \nUniversity where he received an honorary degree, despite that \ninstitution's harsh criticism of the Pope as ``anti-Christ'' and the \nRoman Catholic and Mormon religions as ``cults.'' He declines to \ndisavow the Southern Partisan Quarterly Review, a magazine which, \nincredibly, has defended slavery. He has sponsored as many as seven \nconstitutional amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including one which \nwould outlaw most forms of contraception, and take away a woman's \nconstitutional right to determine for herself whether to have an early \nabortion, even where rape, incest, or severe physical injury would be \ninvolved.\n  Senator Ashcroft's record indicates that he has not always \ndistinguished between his strident advocacy and his willingness to \nenforce the law of the land. As the Missouri Attorney General, he did \nall in his power to undermine a voluntary school desegregation plan in \nSt. Louis, denouncing voluntary desegregation as ``an outrage against \nhuman decency.'' The St. Louis Post Dispatch described his campaign as \n``exploiting and encouraging the worst racist sentiments that exist in \nthe state.''\n  Perhaps most of all, I am troubled by Senator Ashcroft's handling of \nthe Judge White nomination. After the Pope, in a visit to St. Louis, \nhad convinced Governor Mel Carnahan, Senator Ashcroft's opponent at the \ntime, to not execute a certain Missouri prisoner, Ashcroft saw an \nopportunity to vilify Carnahan as ``soft on crime.'' One of his \nstrategies was to depict a distinguished and highly regarded African \nAmerican judge as ``anti-death penalty'' and use the blocking of his \nnomination to Federal district court as a high profile means of \nclaiming he would be tougher on crime then Governor Carnahan. This \ndespite the fact that Judge White had been endorsed by Republicans and \nDemocrats as well as the Missouri Bar Association and had upheld death \nsentences at about the same rate as all other members of the Missouri \nSupreme Court.\n  The very conservative columnist Stuart Taylor, wrote that the Judge \nWhite incident alone renders Senator Ashcroft to be ``unfit to be \nAttorney General.'' Taylor stated, ``The reason is that during an \nimportant debate on a sensitive manner, then-Senator Ashcroft abused \nthe power of his office by descending to demagoguery, dishonesty and \ncharacter assassination.'' I do not contend that Mr. Ashcroft is a \nracist, but I do believe his handling of this matter was characterized \nby naked political opportunism, dishonesty, and an utter disregard for \njustice.\n  I have no illusions about the end result of the vote on the Senate \nfloor; Senator Ashcroft will be confirmed. I have stated my opposition \nto any filibuster effort on this mater. A filibuster would have \nresulted in the need for Senator Ashcroft to secure 60 votes rather \nthan 51. While tactically, this might have increased the likelihood of \ndefeating his nomination, it is a process which has never been used on \nCabinet confirmations before, although\n\n[[Page S938]]\n\nSenator Ashcroft, himself, has used it against sub-Cabinet appointments \nand has frequently voted against cabinet nominees. I believe President \nBush is entitled to a fair, up-and-down vote on his nominee. Although \nthe confirmation is then, virtually certain, I want to make it clear \nthat I will have nothing to do with supporting this particular one of \nthe 16 Presidential nominations to come before the Senate so far.\n  Senator Ashcroft, I believe, is the wrong man to help heal America's \ndivisions, the wrong man to lead the U.S. Department of Justice, and \nthe wrong man to serve as the guardian of the constitutional rights of \nall the diverse people of our nation. I take my oath to the U.S. \nConstitution seriously, and I also take my South Dakota values of \nfairness, and integrity very seriously--for that reason I will vote no \non this nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Dakota. He is \none of the most thoughtful Members of this body. I know he has spent a \ngreat deal of time researching this. I know on an issue such as this, \nwhen it was time to make his decision, there were only two elements \nthat totally influenced him--his conscience and his oath of office. I \nknow my friend from South Dakota upheld them both.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anybody on the Republican side at the \nmoment. The order gives them control of this debate from 9:45 until 10 \no'clock. I ask consent to be able to continue. I know I have 4 minutes \nremaining, but if need be, I ask unanimous consent to take another 5 \nminutes with the understanding I will yield that back immediately if a \nmember of the Republican Party shows up to take their time, and I so \nask unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my good friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, \nhad mentioned me by name on several occasions during his remarks. I \nwill take a moment to respond to two of the points of the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  First, he said we somehow put Senator Ashcroft in an impossible \ncatch-22 situation where, if he promises to enforce the law, it is \ndescribed as a confirmation evolution or a metamorphosis. I think that \nis a significant oversimplification of what the record shows.\n  I had the record here yesterday. It is well over 2 feet high in just \nthe questions and answers.\n  It also oversimplifies what the job of the Attorney General is. It is \nnot simply to enforce the law. Nobody questions the fact that if you \nhave some terrible crime--Oklahoma City, for example--whoever is the \nAttorney General will enforce the law and bring down the full force of \nthe majesty of the law of this country regarding something that \nheinous. In airplane hijacking, assassination, any one of these things \nwhere the Attorney General gets involved in making decisions of who \ngets prosecuted, what the penalties are, nobody questions, no matter \nwho is Attorney General, instituting the full force of that law.\n  However, it is the discretionary areas that are troublesome. Many \nMembers in this body have been prosecutors. We know everybody who is an \nAttorney General, a district attorney, is faced with a number of issues \nwhere you can apply the law at any one area of severity. We all know \nyou can decide the interest of society might be not to apply the law, \nnot to seek an indictment. We also know that any prosecutor has broad \ndiscretionary powers in what to investigate and what not to \ninvestigate; when to initiate a case, when to withhold a case; when to \ndrop a matter or to settle a case. What do you do, for example, in \nantitrust? Do you bring the suit? Do you drop the suit? What do you do \nin seeking a civil rights remedy? Do you look into it or not? What \nhappens if you think there has been voter fraud that may affect your \nparty and not the other party? Do you still look at it as strictly, or \nnot?\n  The Attorney General is not the President's attorney. In fact, it \nshould be pointed out that the President is allowed to appoint a White \nHouse counsel--anybody he wants--and there is no Senate confirmation. \nThe reason for that is very simple: We have all believed whoever is \nPresident should have counsel, a lawyer, representing him and his \ninterests in the White House with whom nobody else can interfere. Every \nPresident has done that. It makes sense the President will pick them \nand we can't question them. We can't say, you shouldn't have picked \nthis person; you shouldn't have picked that person. That is the \nPresident's own attorney.\n\n  The Attorney General is different. The Attorney General is different \nfrom anybody else in the Cabinet because the Attorney General is not a \npolitical officer and a political arm of the White House. The Attorney \nGeneral represents all of us, whether rich, poor, black, white, \nDemocrat, Republican, old, young, conservative, liberal, moderate. We \nare all represented by the Attorney General. That is why the Attorney \nGeneral is given such enormous discretion--in fact, in many instances \nwell beyond, whether the President likes it or not. The President can \nalways fire the Attorney General, but the Attorney General has that \ndiscretionary power.\n  When Senator Ashcroft says he will exercise that discretion in a \nmanner that respects settled law, a number of areas in which he \naggressively and vigorously opposed throughout his career, then it is \nunderstandable that many Members may be troubled and skeptical.\n  My friend from Arizona says many Members have criticized the \nRepublicans for applying too tough a standard to the nomination of Bill \nLann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division, yet we seem to be applying \nthe same standard to Senator Ashcroft. When Bill Lann Lee swore under \noath and reiterated time and time again that he would enforce the law, \nwe were told by our friends on the Republican side of the Senate, this \nwasn't good enough, we couldn't accept that--basically using the same \nwords Senator Ashcroft used.\n  The difference is we were prepared to vote against; they wouldn't \nallow a vote. If they didn't believe him, they chould have voted \nagainst him; if they were for him, they could have voted for him.\n  It is different here. Here we are debating Senator Ashcroft to be \nAttorney General. We actually received the nomination in the Senate \nearlier this week. After the then-President-elect said he was going to \nnominate him, we moved forward to have a hearing and completed the \nhearing prior to the President's inauguration. That is a major \ndifference. We are going to vote on him.\n  Bill Lann Lee--we should point out, if people are going to raise that \nas a standard--Bill Lann Lee, a fine, dedicated person, who swore to \nuphold the law, was never even given the courtesy of a vote by the \nSenate.\n  Senator Ashcroft can be asked how he interprets the oath of office. \nIt is the same oath of office he will take as U.S. Attorney General. It \nis the one he took as Missouri's Governor and attorney general. That is \nwhy we have raised so many of the points in the hearing. They \ndemonstrate an interpretation of his oath of office in the past, his \ninterpretation of law that he now claims during 2 days of hearings, an \nentirely different interpretation from what he has shown for 25 years \nprior to those 2 days of hearings.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call \nfor the quorum be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized and has control of the time \nuntil 10:15 a.m.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first I want to say to the former \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--for 17 days, from January 3 \nuntil January 20--the very able and distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nI commend him for the hearings he held on the nomination of John \nAshcroft to be the Attorney General of the United States. I had the \nopportunity to watch some of the hearings. I followed them in the \npress. I think the able Senator from Vermont conducted a very \ncomprehensive, very careful hearing with respect to former\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\nSenator Ashcroft. I think he is much to be commended for doing an \noutstanding job. He obviously took very seriously the responsibilities \nof the Senate with respect to its constitutional advise and consent \nrole.\n  I thought a major effort was obviously made to hear from all sides on \nthis important question. It meant going late into the evening on more \nthan 1 day. But I thought it was a model of how hearings ought to be \nconducted.\n  It was not pro forma. It really probed deeply into some very basic \nand fundamental questions, and I, for one, want to express my very deep \nappreciation to the Senator from Vermont for the way he planned and \nconducted those hearings. The Senate is in his debt.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much coming from one \nof the intellectual giants of the Senate, my good friend from Maryland. \nI appreciate what he said. He and I are two who believe strongly in the \nSenate's role and to do all we can to carry it out. I appreciate his \nkind words.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination \nof John Ashcroft to be the Attorney General of the United States. I do \nnot do this lightly. I recognize, of course, the argument that is made \nthat Presidents ought to be able to have their Cabinet picks. I have \ngenerally in the past, although not always, deferred to that concept, \nalthough I think it obviously can be overdone, and the Senate needs to \nbe careful not to be taken down the path in which we simply become \nrubber stamps with respect to nominations for the Cabinet. If that is \nwhat the Founding Fathers had intended, presumably they never would \nhave put the advise and consent function in the Senate with respect to \nnominees to the executive branch of the Government.\n  Of course, the judiciary is an entirely separate matter since it is \nan independent branch of the Government, and I think there the standard \nis much higher and much less acknowledgment or deference should be \ngiven to the President's judgment. But I recognize the argument that is \nmade with respect to Cabinet members.\n  On the other hand, I think it is very important when we consider \nCabinet appointments, and particularly an office such as the Attorney \nGeneral, to be very careful in judging how the very important \nresponsibilities of that office will be carried out.\n\n  I thought the Senator from Vermont made a very important contribution \nto this debate in his statement when he outlined the importance of the \nposition of the Attorney General. I am not sure enough focus has been \nplaced on that dimension.\n  The Senator pointed out that it is a position of extraordinary \nimportance; that the judgment and priorities of the person who is the \nAttorney General affect the lives of all Americans; that the Attorney \nGeneral is the lawyer for all the people and the chief law enforcement \nofficer in the country.\n  The Attorney General controls a very large budget, over $20 billion. \nHe directs the activities of almost 125,000 attorneys, investigators, \nBorder Patrol agents, deputy marshals, correctional officers, and other \nemployees in over 2,700 Department of Justice facilities throughout \nthis country and in 120 foreign cities. He supervises the selection and \nactions of the 93 U.S. attorneys and their assistants; the U.S. \nmarshals; supervises the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service; the Drug Enforcement Agency; \nthe Bureau of Prisons; and many other Federal law enforcement \ncomponents.\n  Furthermore, the Attorney General evaluates judicial candidates, \nrecommends judicial nominees to the President, advises the executive \nbranch on the constitutionality of bills and laws, determines when the \nFederal Government will go into court, what statutes to defend in \ncourt, what arguments to make to the Supreme Court and other courts.\n  In other words, as the Senator from Vermont pointed out, the Attorney \nGeneral exercises a very broad discretion in terms of the judgments he \nmakes and the actions he takes. Therefore, it simply does not dispose \nof the issue of how someone will perform in the office to assert that \nhe will carry out the laws of the United States.\n  I would hope so. It is not much of a threshold for a Cabinet nominee \nto assert that, if confirmed, he will carry out the laws of the United \nStates?\n  That is the minimum threshold. In the instance of the Attorney \nGeneral, there is a broad range of activities that are subject to his \njudgment and discretion, subject to the Attorney General's sense of \npriorities, and that, of course, is what raises some very difficult \nquestions with respect to this nomination.\n  Senator Ashcroft has never hidden the fact that he has planted \nhimself at the extreme of the political spectrum. In fact, he has taken \npride in that fact and asserted it in the course of his political \ncareer. Moderation is not a word which enters into his political \nthinking. In fact, on more than one occasion, he has belittled \nmoderation, as the Washington Post pointed out in an editorial just a \nfew days ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to printed the editorial in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 2001]\n\n                           Wrong for Justice\n\n       The Constitution assigns to the Senate the duty to provide \n     a president advice and consent on his nominations. Had George \n     W. Bush sought senators' advice before designating John \n     Ashcroft as his choice for attorney general, the answer, in \n     our view, would have been easy. Former senator Ashcroft is \n     the wrong man for that job. But a president is entitled to \n     wide latitude in picking his advisers, wider than in \n     selecting judges whose tenure will outlast his, and in part \n     for that reason Mr. Ashcroft seems likely to win \n     confirmation. But if Mr. Bush is entitled to the attorney \n     general he wants, he is not entitled to take pride in the \n     pick, and we fear it is one that may not serve him or the \n     country well.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's views and record put him on the far right \n     edge of Republican politics. It is not just that we disagree \n     with many of his positions, on issues ranging from gun \n     control to campaign finance reform; it is that Mr. Ashcroft \n     seems in a different place from that which Mr. Bush seemed to \n     promise for his administration during his campaign and again \n     yesterday in his inaugural address. The Missouri politician's \n     support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion even \n     in cases of rape is only one example. Last week he indicated \n     in committee testimony that he would have no difficulty \n     living with Mr. Bush's more nuanced views, but if his \n     lifelong crusade against abortion has stemmed from deep \n     conviction--which we have no reason to doubt--it is hard to \n     understand how that could be so easily switched off. The same \n     is true of his intolerance of homosexuality.\n       More troubling than his views have been Mr. Ashcroft's \n     inflammatory political tactics. On a range of issues--as a \n     governing philosophy, in fact--Mr. Ashcroft has explicitly \n     belittled moderation; he would now assume a job that demands \n     a sense of balance, of respect for opposing views. He helped \n     block, as senator, the confirmation of well-qualified \n     nominees whose views he found noxious; we think in particular \n     of James Hormel, whom Mr. Ashcroft deemed unfit to serve as \n     ambassador to Luxembourg because of his advocacy of gay \n     rights, and Bill Lann Lee, whom Mr. Ashcroft opposed for a \n     Justice Department position on civil rights.\n       Most troubling of all is the designee's record of \n     insensitivity toward those rights, a record that raises \n     doubts about whether the Justice Department can maintain its \n     role in a Bush administration as a defender of minorities in \n     need of legal help. In 1984, Mr. Ashcroft based his \n     gubernatorial primary campaign on his zealous opposition as \n     attorney general to a voluntary desegregation plan for St. \n     Louis's public schools, boasting on the trail that his \n     tactics had risked a contempt of court citation and using \n     television attack ads to charge that his Republican primary \n     opponent was too soft in opposing desegregation. While \n     considering a run for president in 1999, Mr. Ashcroft granted \n     an interview to Southern Partisan magazine, which glorifies \n     the former Confederacy, and accepted an honorary degree from \n     Bob Jones University in South Carolina, site of a key GOP \n     primary. In testimony last week he claimed ignorance about \n     the magazine's more odious aspects, but in his interview he \n     explicitly endorsed its efforts to burnish the reputations of \n     Confederate leaders. Mr. Ashcroft also declined during his \n     confirmation hearing to repudiate his association with and \n     praise for Bob Jones (``I thank God for this institution''), \n     which maintained a ban on interracial dating at the time of \n     his visit.\n       Finally, as he prepared for his reelection campaign for the \n     U.S. Senate last year, then-Sen. Ashcroft grossly distorted \n     the record of black Missouri supreme court judge Ronnie White \n     in opposing his appointment to a federal appeals court, as we \n     wrote in this space at the time. On the Senate floor, Mr. \n     Ashcroft portrayed the respected judge as a man with a \n     ``tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' In one case, \n     Mr. White had favored a new trial for an African American \n     convicted before a judge who had made racially inflammatory \n     statements; Mr. Ashcroft claimed on the Senate floor, \n     falsely, that Judge White's complaint was that the judge in \n     question opposed affirmative action.\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\n       Mr. Ashcroft argues that in each of these instances he was \n     stressing legitimate policy positions, such as opposition to \n     busing, support for state's rights and resistance to a soft-\n     on-crime judiciary. But deliberately or not, he was also \n     playing racial politics.\n       Senators traditionally have voted to confirm nominees whose \n     ideologies they reject, and that is not a tradition to be \n     lightly set aside. We opposed Mr. Ashcroft's own tendency to \n     block nominations on ideological grounds, a standard that \n     seems no more right when turned against him. Moreover, it is \n     troubling to see opponents overreach and demonize the \n     Ashcroft record, as in Sen. Edward Kennedy's distortion that \n     Mr. Ashcroft considers the U.S. government to be a tyranny. \n     By the same token, though, Mr. Ashcroft's defenders are \n     mistaken when they allege that opposition to him is simply a \n     manifestation of religious prejudice or partisan politics.\n       If Mr. Ashcroft is confirmed, he, and even more the \n     president, will incur a particular obligation to staff the \n     Justice Department with people of demonstrated fairness and \n     integrity and to show that they can administer the law even-\n     handedly. With this appointment, it seems to us, Mr. Bush has \n     taken on a burden he did not need. We hope, for his sake and \n     the country's, that as attorney general Mr. Ashcroft would \n     behave as the measured and reasonable man he portrayed at \n     last week's hearings, and not with the opportunism that has \n     marred his career.\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. I now quote from that editorial:\n\n       More troubling than his views have been Mr. Ashcroft's \n     inflammatory political tactics. On a range of issues--as a \n     governing philosophy, in fact--Mr. Ashcroft has explicitly \n     belittled moderation; he would now assume a job that demands \n     a sense of balance, of respect for opposing views. . . .\n\n  Those of us who have interacted with him in the Senate have spoken \nabout the intensity and the zeal of his positions as an advocate, and I \nrecognize that. In fact, he has asserted it as one of his great \npolitical strengths and something in which he takes a great deal of \npride.\n  He has taken a number of positions which are well outside the \nmainstream of thinking--most Americans, I think, are in the middle of \nthe road. Senator Ashcroft has been quoted as saying that there are \nonly two things you find in the middle of the road--a moderate and a \ndead skunk.\n  I think one will find most of the American people are in the middle \nof the road.\n  There are extreme ideological positions here which of course, raise \nimportant questions. In fact, when Senator Ashcroft held up the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the head of the Civil Rights \nDivision--a man of extraordinary qualification and dedication, a life \nstory that ought to command the respect and admiration of all \nAmericans--he argued that Lee is ``an advocate who is willing to pursue \nan objective and to carry it with the kind of intensity that belongs to \nadvocacy, but not with the kind of balance that belongs to \nadministration . . . his pursuit of specific objectives that are \nimportant to him limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making \nthe judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the [Civil \nRights] Division.''\n  That is the mental framework, the perspective that he brought to this \nvery important nomination as the head of the Civil Rights Division in \nthe Department of Justice. I do not intend to simply turn that standard \nand apply it to him but I do think it is indicative of an attitude and \nof a mindset that gives me great pause when I come to consider someone \nwho is going to exercise the kind of discretion and broad range of \njudgments that are placed in the hands of the Attorney General of the \nUnited States under the statutes of our country.\n  Another instance I want to point to which has given me great concern \nis what John Ashcroft did to Judge Ronnie White. As others have spoken \nat length on that, I will not go into it in any great detail, But Judge \nWhite was ambushed on the floor of the Senate. That, simply put, is \nwhat it amounted to. And that ambush was, in effect, staged by John \nAshcroft.\n\n  Judge White is a man who worked his way up, the classic American \nopportunity story, to become a judge on the highest court of the State \nof Missouri, an African American who broke a barrier when he went on \nthat court. He was then nominated to be a Federal district judge. His \nnomination was brought out of the Judiciary Committee. The arguments \nused on the floor to ambush him were not raised in the Committee. On \nthe floor the Senate was told that ``he has a tremendous bent toward \ncriminal activity.'' Imagine saying that about a sitting judge of the \nState's highest court, a statement which upon examination cannot be \nsustained.\n  Furthermore, Senator Ashcroft argued about White that, if confirmed \n``he will use his lifetime appointment to push law in a pro-criminal \ndirection consistent with his own personal political agenda.''\n  No wonder that legal columnist Stuart Taylor, wrote in an article \nthat John Ashcroft's treatment of Judge White alone makes him unfit to \nbe Attorney General.\n\n       The reason is that during an important debate on a \n     sensitive matter, then-Senator Ashcroft abused the power of \n     his office by descending to demagoguery, dishonesty and \n     character assassination.\n\n  The Baltimore Sun, in an editorial of yesterday--I ask unanimous \nconsent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 31, 2001]\n\n               Ashcroft Isn't Right for Attorney General\n\n       Few people had ever heard of racial profiling a few years \n     ago.\n       But now it's a household phrase, because former Attorney \n     General Janet Reno's lawyers proved many police departments \n     were treating skin color as if it were a highway crime, \n     pulling over minority drivers for one reason--their race.\n       It was an important reminder that discrimination is still \n     very much alive in America.\n       During Ms. Reno's tenure, Justice Department lawyers delved \n     into problems in employment, fair housing and lending, \n     education, public accommodations and voting. They \n     investigated Americans With Disability Act violations, \n     enforced federal laws protecting access to abortion clinics.\n       The point: Ms. Reno didn't merely acknowledge or respect \n     the existence of civil rights and other laws designed to \n     protect Americans. She embraced them and enforced them \n     doggedly, because discrimination still robs entire classes of \n     Americans of their most basic liberties.\n       That brings us to the troubling nomination of former \n     Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft to head the Justice Department.\n       His record suggest no such embrace of civil rights laws or \n     the premise of equal protection under law. Many things he has \n     said and done betray a vicious hostility toward them.\n       He has blasted the judiciary (which he calls the least \n     representative branch of government) for granting ``group \n     rights'' to minorities, without regard to the group \n     discrimination that necessitates those rights.\n       He has opposed public school desegregation--in one instance \n     to the point of being threatened with judicial contempt--and \n     proposed a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion in all \n     forms for any reason.\n       And he has defended or stood mute in the face of other \n     institutions that attack the very premise of equal rights--\n     Bob Jones University, a neo-Confederate magazine called \n     Southern Partisan, even groups with ties to the Ku Klux Klan.\n       His record has inspired progressive groups around the \n     country to oppose Mr. Ashcroft's nomination. It's also why \n     some Democratic senators are threatening a filibuster to \n     block a confirmation vote.\n       We share the concerns about Mr. Ashcroft's civil rights \n     record. We worry that his confirmation as attorney general \n     could mean the end of the Justice Department's important \n     efforts to level Americas uneven playing fields.\n       But that alone would be insufficient for us to call for \n     derailing a Cabinet nominee. Generally, we believe presidents \n     should be given wide latitude in making their appointments.\n       There is another, a more important reason to oppose Mr. \n     Ashcroft--his character.\n       When Mr. Ashcroft tanked the federal judicial nomination of \n     Ronnie White, he demonstrated recklessness with truth and \n     integrity that the nation can't countenance in an attorney \n     general.\n       He lied about Mr. White's stance on death penalty cases, \n     painting him as an anti-death penalty maverick when, in fact, \n     Mr. White had affirmed death sentences 71 percent of the time \n     as a Missouri Supreme Court judge.\n       And to this date, Mr. Ashcroft has not owned up to what he \n     did. During his own confirmation hearings before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ashcroft defended what he did to Mr. \n     White--and denied that it represented a distortion of the \n     truth.\n       Whatever the reasons for Mr. Ashcroft's actions, they speak \n     to a willingness to pursue his own agenda by any means \n     necessary, without regard to veracity of fairness.\n       That makes it difficult--or near impossible--to imagine Mr. \n     Ashcroft setting a credible legal agenda from the seat of the \n     nation's highest law enforcement officer.\n       It also makes it hard to believe any of what Mr. Ashcroft \n     said during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, when he passionately stated he would abide by and \n     enforce laws that don't necessarily coincide with his \n     personal beliefs.\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee voted yesterday to confirm \n     Mr. Ashcroft. The full Senate could vote by Thursday.\n       A ``no'' vote in the full chamber--however unlikely that \n     might be--is the only course that will save the Justice \n     Department from the taint of Mr. Ashcroft's improbity.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. In commenting on John Ashcroft's distortion of Judge \nWhite's record, said:\n\n       Whatever the reasons for Mr. Ashcroft's actions, they speak \n     to a willingness to pursue his own agenda by any means \n     necessary, without regard to veracity or fairness.\n\n  This from an editorial in the Baltimore Sun entitled ``Ashcroft isn't \nright for attorney general.''\n  I just want to add one other instance or example of the kind of \napproach and attitude in John Ashcroft's record that concerns me.\n  When he was attorney general of the State of Missouri, charged with \ncarrying out the laws, he repeatedly, in school segregation cases, was \nrebuked and overruled by the courts, both State and Federal courts, on \nvery sensitive and important school segregation cases.\n  In my view, he has had a consistent record of being at the extreme, \nof taking positions well outside the mainstream. And we are now faced \nwith the question of whether he should be placed in a position where he \nwill have broad discretion and will be making very sensitive judgments. \nIt is a position that the whole country looks to to sustain its civil \nrights and its civil liberties.\n  The Nation needs to have confidence that the person serving as \nAttorney General will personify fairness and justice to all our people \nall across our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent to speak for another 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The New York Times, in an editorial opposing this \nnomination, made reference to President Bush's inaugural visions of ``a \nsingle nation of justice and opportunity.'' In my view John Ashcroft \ndoes not carry out that vision. I oppose his nomination. I ask \nunanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 2001]\n\n                    Opposing the Ashcroft Nomination\n\n       The days after an inauguration are always marked by a \n     spirit of optimism and well-wishing. But it also has to be a \n     time for marking out fundamental principles that should come \n     into play as the nation seeks the new civic accord that \n     President George W. Bush eloquently endorsed in his inaugural \n     address. It is within this framework that the Senate should \n     consider the nomination of John Ashcroft as attorney general.\n       For our part, we wish that we could simply acquiesce in a \n     confirmation that seems assured by the expectation that all \n     50 Republicans and a number of Democrats will vote to approve \n     Mr. Ashcroft. But the matter is more complex than that.\n       As in our first commentary on Mr. Ashcroft's nomination, we \n     stipulate that we are convinced he is a man of sincere \n     conviction and personal rectitude. But the testimony before \n     the Judiciary Committee established that he is not a nuanced \n     or tolerant thinker about law, about constitutional tradition \n     or about the general direction of an increasingly diverse \n     American society.\n       Any reasonable reading of the extensive Judiciary Committee \n     testimony shows that Mr. Ashcroft's zeal has overruled \n     prudence in cases that bear directly on issues relevant to \n     the Department of Justice. For example, the desegregation of \n     public schools, often under voluntary agreements supervised \n     by federal courts, has bipartisan roots reaching back to the \n     Eisenhower presidency. But as Missouri attorney general, Mr. \n     Ashcroft opposed a court-approved voluntary desegregation \n     plan for St. Louis and failed to come up with an alternative \n     that would have ameliorated the segregated conditions.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's tactics in blocking Judge Ronnie White's \n     elevation from the Missouri Supreme Court in the federal \n     bench raise problems of another sort. Judge White had a \n     strong record of supporting capital punishment and often \n     voted with Mr. Ashcroft's appointees on the Missouri Supreme \n     Court. But on the floor of the Senate, Mr. Ashcroft advanced \n     the fabricated charge that Judge White was ``pro-criminal'' \n     and had ``a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.''\n       Before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ashcroft persisted in \n     this demagogic attack, insisting that he was merely \n     exercising his prerogative as a senator to reach an \n     independent judgment. He was equally unpersuasive in \n     explaining his plainly homophobic opposition to the \n     confirmation of James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. Mr. \n     Hormel is a man of sterling legal and diplomatic credentials. \n     Yet Mr. Ashcroft declared that he opposed Mr. Hormel based on \n     the ``totality'' of his record.\n       As President Bush likes to say, we cannot read what is in \n     another's heart. But neither can any civic-minded participant \n     in this process fail to consider Mr. Ashcroft's history of \n     opposition and code-worded condemnation of those whose color, \n     sexual preference, religious views and attitude toward \n     abortion differ from his own.\n       On the issue of abortion, Mr. Ashcroft swore that his 30-\n     year history of legislative and constitutional attacks on \n     abortion rights would not lead him to oppose the ``settled \n     law'' supporting those rights. Of equal importance, he \n     testified under oath that he would not use his powers as \n     attorney general to invite a Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. \n     Wade, the ruling that guarantees reproductive freedom of \n     choice for American women.\n       We welcome those statements as a solemn pledge to the \n     American people on a pivotal issue of civil liberties and \n     constitutional law. But that reassurance does not lift from \n     this page or the Senate the obligation to look at the entire \n     mosaic pieced together by the Judiciary Committee. In the \n     Senate, Mr. Ashcroft's legislative record shows a public \n     official with a history of insensitivity to minority concerns \n     and a radical propensity for offering constitutional \n     amendments that would bring that document into alignment with \n     his religious views. He even favored an amendment to make it \n     easier to revise the Constitution.\n       We urge a unified Democratic vote in the Senate against \n     confirmation. If 40 or more Democrats cast a vote of \n     principle against Mr. Ashcroft's record, he and Mr. Bush will \n     be on notice that sensitivity to and regard for the beliefs \n     and rights of all Americans have to be governing realities at \n     the Department of Justice.\n       We do not argue that Mr. Ashcroft is a bad man. We do \n     assert that his record makes him a regrettable appointee for \n     a new president who speaks with conviction about creating an \n     atmosphere of reassurance for all members of the American \n     family. Given this newspaper's long history of defending \n     civil liberties, reproductive freedom, gay rights and racial \n     justice, we cannot endorse Mr. Ashcroft as an appropriate \n     candidate to lead a department charged with providing justice \n     for all Americans. But recognizing that his confirmation is \n     probable, we can hope that Mr. Ashcroft's performance as \n     attorney general will be based on the president's inaugural \n     vision of ``a single nation of justice and opportunity'' \n     rather than on the general philosophy of Mr. Ashcroft's \n     public career to date.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 shall be under the \ncontrol of the majority party.\n  The Chair recognizes the assistant majority leader, the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise in total and complete support of John Ashcroft \nto be the next Attorney General of the United States. I do that with \ngreat pleasure, and with pride, because I know him. And I am not amused \nwhen I hear people talking about John Ashcroft in a way that is not the \nJohn Ashcroft I know.\n  I know John Ashcroft. I have served with John Ashcroft. I have spent \nhours and hours and hours with John Ashcroft on a multitude of issues. \nI have absolute, total, and complete confidence that he is going to be \none outstanding Attorney General of the United States.\n  He is as qualified as anybody that has ever been an Attorney General. \nIf you look at his qualifications, he was attorney general for the \nState of Missouri for 8 years. He was named head of the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General which means the other attorneys \ngeneral all across the country elected him to be their leader.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say he is extreme. That is not the \ntype of person a bipartisan group of Attorneys General would pick. He \nwould not have been picked as the head of the National Association of \nAttorneys General.\n  He served for 8 years as Governor of the State of Missouri. He was \nelected head of the National Governors' Association. Again, that is not \nan extremist. That is not somebody outside the mainstream. He was \nelected by his peers, by the bipartisan group of Governors, to be head \nof the National Governors' Association.\n  He then was elected to the Senate which is how I really got to know \nhim. Of course, I had known him by reputation as being an outstanding \nattorney general and outstanding Governor.\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\n  He was an outstanding Senator. He served 6 years in this institution. \nI served with him in countless meetings, and I could not have come away \nknowing a person of greater intellect and integrity--a person of \nconviction, a person who can get things done, a person who is willing \nto listen to all people on all sides, a person who is fair. Again, I \nhave come to the conclusion that he will be an outstanding Attorney \nGeneral.\n  I am bothered by the opposition. I wonder where it comes from because \nmaybe they are talking about a different person.\n  On the issue of fairness, I have heard people say that we have done a \ngood job since we have confirmed all of President Bush's nominees \nexcept one, and it has only taken a couple weeks.\n  I go back 8 years ago, after President Clinton was elected, when \nevery one of President Clinton's nominees were confirmed by voice vote, \nunanimously, by January 21, except for one, and that was for Attorney \nGeneral. And that delay was not because Republicans were fighting the \nAttorney General nomination. It was because President Clinton ended up \nsending three names to the Senate because he had some problems with the \nfirst two before he submitted his final nominee. The delay was not \nbecause of Senate opposition. It was because he had some problems with \nthe first couple of nominees he submitted.\n  When we eventually got to Janet Reno, after he submitted her to the \nSenate, she was confirmed in very short order without all this rancor, \nwithout all this partisan nonsense. She was confirmed 98-0. She was \nevery bit as liberal as John Ashcroft is conservative--every bit.\n  In addition, Ms. Reno said she was going to uphold the law. I have \nheard the intensity of this debate since John Ashcroft is pro-life. \nWill he enforce the law and access to abortion clinics? John Ashcroft \nsaid he would. He took an oath. He said: I will uphold the law of the \nland.\n  In comparison, it is interesting to note that the Beck decision is \nthe law of the land.\n  Attorney General Reno and the Clinton Administration did not enforce \nthat decision. Also, the law of the land on campaign finance says it is \nunlawful to solicit or receive funds on Federal property. She did not \nenforce that statute in spite of the fact that her own people in the \nJustice Department said: You need to appoint a special counsel. She did \nnot do it. Although it was the law of the land, she did not enforce it. \nSome of us are troubled by that. Maybe I wish I had my vote back.\n  If people want to vote against John Ashcroft, they can vote against \nhim, but to make these character assassinations is totally unfair. It \ncertainly is not what happened 8 years ago.\n  Let me touch on a couple other things. I have heard he should not be \nconfirmed because he was opposed to Judge White. Well, I voted against \nJudge White, and I would vote against him again. Why? I have been in \nthe Senate for 20 years almost as long as Senator Leahy, the ranking \nminority member on the committee. I don't remember a single time a \nnational law enforcement group or association contacting Senators to \nsay please vote no on a Federal judge.\n  I remember getting a letter from the National Sheriffs' Association \nsaying: Vote no on Judge White. I said: Why? Well, there was a case \nwhere three deputy sheriffs were murdered and a sheriff's wife was \nmurdered and the defendant confessed. That case is the reason they \nwrote the letter. Of seven Missouri Supreme Court judges, Judge White \nwas the sole dissenter who said: Let's review this case. There may be \nextenuating circumstances and the defendant deserves another trial.\n  The sheriffs didn't feel that way. The prosecutors didn't feel that \nway. Other prosecutors, the sheriffs, and the chiefs of police in \nMissouri, said: Don't confirm Judge White. I can't remember, again, \nanother nomination where you had the chiefs of police all across the \nState who know the particular judge say: Don't confirm him. That was \nsomething I needed to know.\n  I am also troubled when some people say: You didn't confirm Judge \nWhite because of his race. Most of us didn't know what race he was. We \nknew law enforcement was against him, and we voted no. I make no \napologies for that vote.\n  To imply that someone is a racist because they oppose a nominee is \nwrong. Most of us opposed Judge White because he was opposed by law \nenforcement groups.\n  I heard somebody say: John Ashcroft, back when he was Governor, \nopposed a court decision on desegregation. Then we find out that \nSenator Danforth, who is probably as respected a moderate as anybody, \nalso opposed that decision, and Congressman Gephardt opposed that \ndecision. At that time, I think Mel Carnahan, who was also an elected \nofficial in the State of Missouri, opposed that decision. Yet some \npeople are trying to make that a reason to oppose John Ashcroft.\n  John Ashcroft has had about three decades of public life. His record \nhas been scrutinized to the nth degree. People are almost making up \nthings to try to oppose his nomination. I think it is unwarranted. It \nis unfounded. A lot of it is below the belt and is beneath the dignity \nof the Senate. People have a right to oppose a nomination. If they want \nto oppose somebody, they can vote no, but they should not \nmischaracterize his record. I think what has happened repeatedly is \nbeneath the dignity of the Senate, below the civility of the Senate.\n  I urge people to be cautious when they make personal attacks against \nother individuals, and especially against a former colleague. Again, \nmany of us in this body have had the privilege to know John Ashcroft. \nWe know him. We know him well. I know him well. I am very proud to cast \nmy vote today in support of John Ashcroft to be the next Attorney \nGeneral. I look forward to him being the next Attorney General. I am \nconfident he will represent this country extremely well in that \ncapacity.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some \nadditional op-ed pieces, columns, and others be printed in the Record \nregarding this nomination.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2001]\n\n                         Ashcroft The Activist\n\n                         (By William Raspberry)\n\n       Opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney \n     general have been turning over every rock in sight, hoping to \n     find some outrageous statement, some political skeleton, some \n     evidence that he is unfit to be the nation's chief law \n     enforcement officer.\n       His supporters have been doing their best to prove that the \n     nominee is technically qualified for the job and is, \n     moreover, a decent man who would enforce the law fairly.\n       The whole thing seems to be missing the point. I have never \n     doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal \n     abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would \n     be unfair.\n       But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief \n     cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement \n     policy.\n       It is from that office that decisions are made on which \n     laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to \n     be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement \n     resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland \n     reassurances that Ashcroft would ``enforce the law fairly'' \n     aren't much help.\n       To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce \n     America's drug laws ``fairly''? Does it mean locking up \n     anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does \n     it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law \n     also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from \n     enforcement to treatment--or the other way around? Does it \n     mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in \n     violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things--\n     allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and \n     ``crack'' cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity \n     that results from it.\n       To promise to enforce the law without talking about which \n     policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at \n     all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter, \n     law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general \n     to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some \n     against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. \n     Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their \n     own\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\n     way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so \n     many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this \n     time?\n       The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has \n     fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well \n     outside the American mainstream--on gun control, on abortion, \n     on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to \n     deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by \n     a significant minority. I say only that his views are \n     unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an \n     ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating \n     views that are well away from the political center and put \n     him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to \n     say he'll ``enforce the law.''\n       Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when \n     he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe \n     v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor \n     general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition \n     the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine \n     the Justice Department's standing before the court.\n       He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the \n     attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.\n       Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out \n     of fear that his personal and religious views would influence \n     his role as attorney general?\n       As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it \n     is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann \n     Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice \n     Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny \n     him the job.\n       He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional \n     ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on \n     affirmative action) ``limit his capacity to have the balanced \n     view of making judgments that will be necessary for the \n     person who runs the division.''\n       Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will \n     run the whole department?\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2001]\n\n                           Civil Rights `R Us\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       Obviously, it's a case of mistaken identity.\n       That man sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee is \n     no kooky right-winger. He's not anti-black, anti-Catholic, or \n     antisemitic, as holding an honorary degree from Bob Jones \n     University might suggest. He is against abortion, he admits \n     it, but he'll observe Roe v. Wade. He's a man of law.\n       Segregation? He's against it. Never mind that he fought \n     integration when he was attorney general and governor of \n     Missouri. He's a little sentimental about the Confederacy, \n     yes, but if he had been alive at the time of the Civil War, \n     he would have fought for the Union. Don't call him a partisan \n     Republican, please. When he's looking for the name of an \n     illustrious predecessor at Justice, Robert Kennedy leaps into \n     his mind. Harry Truman leads his list of prominent \n     Missourians.\n       This is an erstwhile club member who thanks senators for \n     mean questions and humbly praises their candor when they \n     blast his record.\n       Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) noted his sense of humor and \n     pointed out how handy it would be when the witness was \n     discussing ``the death penalty and other weighty matters'' at \n     the Justice Department.\n       The makeover of John Ashcroft, a cranky extremist, for his \n     confirmation hearings is a masterpiece. His handlers have \n     created a genial healer; his haberdashery is impeccable and \n     so are his manners. Five young men with black suits and stern \n     expressions sit a row behind him and hand over notes when \n     things get dicey.\n       This graduate of Yale and Harvard Law is pretty \n     sophisticated about most things, but not about hot potatoes \n     like Bob Jones U. and Southern Partisan magazine, a \n     publication to which he confided his misty-eyed appreciation \n     for the Confederacy, and one that has a profitable sideline \n     in T-shirts celebrating the assassination of Lincoln. \n     Wouldn't you know Lincoln is Ashcroft's favorite political \n     figure? He was shocked, shocked to learn about Southern \n     Partisan's excesses.\n       Ashcroft the nominee was engulfed in loving friends, \n     colleagues and family with a heavy sprinkling of blacks and \n     women who were so conspicuous in the protest groups outside. \n     This John Ashcroft wouldn't dream of turning down a \n     president's choice for the Cabinet just because there were \n     differences of opinion. He's tolerant almost to a fault, and \n     his opening statement could have been the bid of an aspirant \n     to the chairmanship of the ACLU, not top gun for George W. \n     Bush's legal team.\n       Opening day theatrics went like clockwork. Sen. Jean \n     Carnahan (D-Mo.), the widow of Ashcroft's opponent, Gov. Mel \n     Carnahan, brought her poignant dignity to a cameo appearance \n     as a presenter of the nominee. Her words were notably chilly. \n     She urged her colleagues to be fair, but it made a nice \n     picture.\n       Committee Republicans came through with econiums to the \n     nominee's character and integrity. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-\n     Iowa) fervently praised Ashcroft as someone ``who always does \n     right by the family farmer.'' Even Ashcroft's 2-year-old red-\n     headed grandson, Jimmy, performed perfectly. He came onto the \n     scene wailing, but his grandfather cheerfully introduced him \n     and he fell miraculously quiet.\n       On Day Two, a little celebrity caucus was brought on just \n     before the lunch break. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) gushed \n     about Ashcroft. So did former senator John Danforth (R-Mo.), \n     the patron of Clarence Thomas, Bush I's land mine Supreme \n     Court appointment. Like father, like son: Thomas was supposed \n     to flatten all objections because he is black; for Bush II, \n     Ashcroft's club membership is expected to stifle resistance.\n       There were moments of discord and disbelief, but these were \n     treated like caterer's mistakes at a splashy wedding. Sen. \n     Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) challenged Ashcroft's record on \n     school desegregation and voter registration. In Missouri, \n     Ashcroft had resisted a voluntary desegregation plan and \n     vetoed a registration expansion scheme. To answer Kennedy, \n     Ashcroft read his veto messages.\n       If the hearings resume next week, Ashcroft can expect a \n     kinder, gentler hand on the gavel in the person of Sen. Orrin \n     Hatch (R-Utah). Sen. Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, was \n     temporary chairman but turns into a pumpkin when W. takes the \n     oath.\n       There's only one thing wrong with the Ashcroft picture, the \n     figure of Judge Ronnie White, the Missouri Supreme Court \n     judge who was deprived of a seat on the federal bench by the \n     persecution of Ashcroft, who got every Republican in the \n     Senate to vote against his nomination. Ashcroft found White \n     insufficiently enthusiastic about the death penalty.\n       By all accounts, Ronnie White is a distinguished member of \n     the State Supreme Court. Ashcroft misrepresented his record. \n     Ronnie White is black. Ashcroft, his allies insist, is no \n     racist. Did he slander Ronnie White for crass politics--an \n     effort to make the death sentence an issue in his campaign \n     against Carnahan? The paragon in the witness chair would not \n     do anything like that. Malice is a singularly unattractive \n     trait in an attorney general.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2001]\n\n                      The Ashcroft Double Standard\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       A review of the record, a reading of the relevant \n     transcripts and some telephone interviews with people in the \n     know lead me to conclude that if John Ashcroft were a \n     Democrat, he would oppose his own nomination as attorney \n     general. For once, he would be right.\n       The Ashcroft of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings is \n     a package of hypocrisy. His message is that his ideology, \n     hard right and intolerant, ought to be beside the point. What \n     is supposed to matter is his determination to uphold the law, \n     even the laws he believes are in contradiction to what God \n     himself intends. This is what Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) \n     calls the ``Ashcroft standard.'' It is utter nonsense.\n       Take, for instance, the way Ashcroft handled the nomination \n     of James C. Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel was a \n     man of some accomplishment as, in fact, Ashcroft had \n     firsthand reason to know. Back in 1964, Hormel was a dean at \n     the University of Chicago Law School when Ashcroft was a \n     student there. Nonetheless, Hormel was gay and not \n     particularly shy about it, either. For that reason--and that \n     reason only--Ashcroft opposed the nomination.\n       This episode tells you quite a bit about Ashcroft. By any \n     measure, Hormel was certainly qualified to be ambassador to \n     this dot of a European country. As mentioned, he had been the \n     dean of a prestigious law school, had become a well-known San \n     Francisco civic leader and philanthropist and had been \n     endorsed by, among others, the Episcopal bishop of \n     California, the Right Rev. William Swing, and the former \n     everything (secretary of state, etc.), George Shultz.\n       Ashcroft was unmoved. Along with Trent Lott, he considered \n     homosexuality a sin and, as with racists, polygamists, \n     misogynists and you-name-its, he could cite this or that \n     passage of the Bible to support his intolerance. Whatever the \n     reason, he would not even meet with Hormel. He would not take \n     his phone calls.\n       Ashcroft explained his vote against Hormel in committee as \n     one based on the fear that Hormel was ``promoting a \n     lifestyle'' and what, when you come to think of it, this \n     might mean to embattled Luxembourg. And then he said this: \n     ``People who are nominated to represent this country have to \n     be evaluated for whether they represent the country well and \n     fairly.''\n       There you have it: The Perry Mason Moment in which Ashcroft \n     blurts out the reason he is not suited to be attorney \n     general. His qualifications, as with Hormel's, are beside the \n     point. It's what he advocates that matters--whether, as he \n     would put it, he represents the country well and fairly.\n       It's Ashcroft's extreme views on abortion--not late-term or \n     mid-term, but what you might call pre-term. (He would ban so-\n     called morning-after pills.) It's his approach to gun \n     control, his reactionary approach to civil rights \n     legislation, his opposition to lifesaving needle exchange \n     programs or his insistence that drug treatment programs are a \n     sheer waste of money since junkies can--to quote an old Nat \n     King Cole tune--simply ``Straighten Up and Fly Right.'' Only \n     experience teaches otherwise.\n       It might be one thing if George W. Bush had won a mandate \n     for such policies. But he did not even win the popular vote. \n     In no way did the country register its support or even tacit \n     approval of the ``soft bigotry'' that\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\n     Ashcroft represents. It does not matter that he says he will \n     administer laws he doesn't particularly like; it matters only \n     that he is unsuited by rhetoric, ideology and political \n     conduct to lead our criminal justice system.\n       If confirmed, Ashcroft would be instrumental in picking the \n     next generation of federal judges. Bush has already declared \n     himself a committed delegator who will CEO the federal \n     government from the Oval Office. (He has a Harvard MBA, don't \n     forget.) If that's the case--and a man who was among the last \n     to know his vice presidential nominee had suffered a heart \n     attack clearly delegates to a fare-thee-well--then the job of \n     picking federal judges will be left to Ashcroft. The federal \n     bench is going to look like the faculty lounge at Bob Jones \n     University.\n       John Ashcroft must be laughing to himself. He knows that if \n     the shoe were on the other foot, he would never confirm an \n     attorney general who had views so antiethical to his own. \n     Maybe he'd find something in the Bible or, as he did with the \n     judicial nomination of Ronnie White, distort the record, but \n     he would be true to his beliefs. His opponents should be true \n     to theirs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 16, 2001]\n\n               The Confederacy's Favorite Cabinet Nominee\n\n                        (By Derrick Z. Jackson)\n\n       If the Senate Judiciary Committee straightens its backbone \n     rather than slap the back of attorney general nominee John \n     Ashcroft, we may get to see why his hallucinations about Bull \n     Run will make him a bull in the china closet of civil rights.\n       Any serious line of questioning should start like this:\n       Sen. Ashcroft, you praised Southern Partisan magazine for \n     ``defending'' patriots like Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, \n     and Jefferson Davis: ``Traditionalists must do more. I've got \n     to do more. We've all got to stand up and speak in this \n     respect, or else we'll be taught that these people were \n     giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and \n     their honor to some perverted agenda.''\n       Let's explore what you meant by that.\n       Senator, why are you, in the year 2001, praising Davis, the \n     president of the Confederacy, who personally italicized the \n     portions of the Constitution that preserved slavery? Why do \n     you laud a man who said white superiority over African-\n     Americans was ``stamped from the beginning, marked in decree \n     and prophecy''?\n       Why do you love a man whose vice president, Alexander \n     Stephens, said the ``cornerstone'' of the Confederacy ``rests \n     upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white \n     man; that slavery, subordination, to the superior race, is \n     his natural and moral condition''?\n       Why do you complain about Davis being maligned by \n     historians when Davis tried to rewrite history? He said on \n     the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1860 that ``Negroes formed \n     but a small part of people of the southern states.''\n       For the record, in 1860 black people were 55 percent of the \n     population in Davis' home state of Mississippi, 58 percent of \n     South Carolina, and between a third to a half of the people \n     of most of the rest of the slave states.\n       Now, Senator, I am reading this sentence again, where you \n     say we've all got to stand up or else we'll be taught that \n     Davis, Lee, and Jackson were subscribing their ``sacred \n     fortunes'' to some ``perverted'' agenda. That sounds a lot \n     like what Davis said in his first Confederate inaugural \n     address when he said the North ``would pervert that most \n     sacred of all trusts.''\n       Senator, since we know that that sacred trust was slavery, \n     what is it that you are trying to say? Does that mean you \n     will not investigate charges of black voter fraud in Florida?\n       Senator, let's move on to Lee. You say today's history \n     books ``make no mention of Lee's military genius!'' Why is \n     that so important to you when the same Lee called Mexicans \n     ``idle worthless and vicious''? Why do you praise a man who \n     said as he exterminated Indians: ``The whole race is \n     extremely uninteresting . . . they are not worth it.'' Where \n     can we find Lee's genius in saying that killing Indians was \n     ``the only corrective they understand and the only way in \n     which they can be taught to keep within their own limits''?\n       Why is Lee so good when he justified the ripping of black \n     people out of Africa to enslave them by saying, ``The blacks \n     are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, \n     socially, and physically. The painful discipline they are \n     undergoing is necessary for their instruction as a race''?\n       Why does Lee need to be revered when his troops, like other \n     Confederate divisions, hated free black people so much that \n     they sometimes massacred defeated black Union soldiers even \n     though they had thrown down their arms in surrender?\n       Senator, may I read you a passage from the new book, ``The \n     Making of Robert E. Lee,'' by Michael Fellman? A Confederate \n     major wrote in 1864 after one battle, ``such slaughter I have \n     not witnessed upon any battlefield anywhere.\n       ``Their men were principally Negroes and we shot them down \n     until we got near enough and then run them through with the \n     bayonet . . . We was not very particular whether we captured \n     or killed them, the only thing we did not like to be pestered \n     burying the heathens.''\n       Senator, why do you praise Lee when, after the Civil War, \n     he actively resisted Reconstruction? Lee said white people \n     are ``inflexibly opposed to any system of laws that would \n     place the political power of the country in the hands of the \n     Negro race.'' He said black people lacked the ``intelligence \n     . . . necessary to make them safe repositories of political \n     power.''\n       Senator, thank you, but in light of your reverence for such \n     men, we'll be asking President-elect George W.

Mr. President, I don't want to leave the impression in \nthis Chamber that there is some kind of unanimity of law enforcement in \nopposition to Judge Ronnie White. In fact, a very substantial number in \nlaw enforcement in Missouri wrote to us, wrote to the Members of the \nSenate, and said they strongly supported Judge Ronnie White. One of the \nleading law enforcement organizations wrote to us and said they were \ndistressed that he was not confirmed on the basis that somehow he might \nbe pro-criminal.\n  The record showed that he voted with appointees by then-Governor \nAshcroft something like 95 or 96 percent of the time in death penalty \ncases.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just for a point of clarification, is the Senator \nreferring to the Fraternal Order of Police sending a letter in support \nof Judge White?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Wasn't that letter sent after Judge White was defeated?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Indeed, it was.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print additional editorials \nand material regarding the nomination in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [From Newsday]\n\n               Ashcroft's Rights Do Not Include Being AG\n\n                           (By Clarence Page)\n\n       Now that George W. Bush has nominated Sen. John Ashcroft \n     (R-Mo.) to be attorney general, it would not be inappropriate \n     for Ashcroft's fellow senators to treat him as fairly as he \n     treated Judge Ronnie White.\n       In other words, will they tar him as an extremist? Will \n     they roast him, not for his personal qualifications, which is \n     what confirmation hearings are supposed to be about, but for \n     his personal beliefs? Will they paint him as an extremist and \n     distort his record without giving him an opportunity to \n     respond? That was how Ashcroft handled President Bill \n     Clinton's nomination of Judge Ronnie White to the federal \n     bench in 1999. Civil rights groups are particularly angry \n     that Ashcroft led the successful party-line fight to defeat \n     White.\n       Ashcroft painted White's opinions as ``the most anti-death-\n     penalty judge on the Missouri Supreme Court'' and said that \n     his record was ``outside the court's mainstream.'' Actually, \n     whether you agree with him or not, White can hardly be called \n     ``pro-criminal'' or ``outside the mainstream.'' Court records \n     show that White voted to uphold death sentences in 41 out of \n     59 capital cases that came before him on the state supreme \n     court. In most of the other cases, he voted with the majority \n     of his fellow justices, including those appointed by Ashcroft \n     when he was Missouri governor.\n       In fact, three Ashcroft appointees voted to reverse the \n     death penalty a greater number of times than White did.\n       On the Senate floor, Ashcroft singled out two of the only \n     three death-penalty cases in which White was the sole \n     dissenter. In one of them, White questioned whether the \n     defendant's right to effective counsel had been violated. \n     Whether you agree or not, you don't have to be ``pro-\n     criminal'' to value the rights of the accused, especially in \n     a death-penalty case. In the other, White questioned whether \n     the lower court judge, Earl L. Blackwell of Jefferson County \n     was biased and should have recused himself in a trial that \n     began the morning after Blackwell issued a controversial \n     campaign statement.\n       Blackwell, explaining in a press release why he had \n     switched to the Republican Party, said, ``The truth is that I \n     switched to the Republican Party, said, ``The truth is that I \n     have noticed in recent years that the Democrat Party places \n     far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as \n     homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a \n     skin that's any color but white.'' Again, the judge has the \n     right to express his views, but you don't have to be an \n     extremist to understand why White, the first African American \n     to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court, might question that \n     judge's even-handedness.\n       When Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) asked White if he opposed \n     the death penalty, White said, ``Absolutely not.'' But White \n     did not get a chance to rebut Ashcroft's charges because \n     Ashcroft did not raise them until\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\n     months after White's confirmation hearings. This tactic was \n     characterized as ``delay and ambush'' by Elliot Mincberg, \n     vice president and legal director of People for the American \n     Way, one of several liberal groups that oppose Ashcroft's \n     confirmation.\n       To charge that Ashcroft is a bigot, as some have done, \n     misses the point. He has a right to express strong views \n     without being called names. He has a right to oppose \n     affirmative action and gay rights, as he has done in the past \n     with other nominations. He has a right to favor a ``right to \n     life'' until someone has been sentenced to death.\n       But he does not have a right to be attorney general. \n     Therefore, it is not surprising that the four pillars of the \n     liberal establishment--civil rights, abortion rights, \n     organized labor and environmental protection--have begun to \n     rally their opposition to his confirmation.\n       Why, they ask, should this country have an attorney general \n     who opposes sensitive laws that he is supposed to enforce? \n     Ashcroft will have a chance to answer that question in his \n     confirmation hearings. The Senate will let him offer his side \n     of the story. That's more than Ashcroft gave Ronnie White.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the DesMoines Register, Jan. 5, 2001]\n\n                          Uneasy With Ashcroft\n\n     Will he enforce the laws even-handedly--even those he \n         disagrees with?\n       The record of Senator John Ashcroft inspires no confidence \n     that he'll enforce the laws of the land impartially as \n     attorney general of the United States.\n       The Missourian, who lost his re-election bid to the Senate \n     this fall, vigorously opposes abortion rights under virtually \n     all circumstances. So would he fully enforce federal laws \n     safeguarding abortion clinics from violence and harassment? \n     Will he actively protect the legal right of women to choose \n     even though he personally thinks women should not have that \n     right?\n       Ashcroft is President-elect George W. Bush's nominee to be \n     the next attorney general. As head of the Justice Department, \n     he would be in charge of overseeing the FBI, enforcing \n     antitrust laws, litigating on the government's behalf and \n     enforcing the civil rights of citizens, among other things.\n       How interested in assuring civil rights is Ashcroft? He's \n     been criticized for his opposition to the elevation of \n     Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White, an African-\n     American, to the federal bench. Ashcroft called White ``pro-\n     criminal,'' even though White had voted to uphold the death \n     penalty in 41 of 59 cases--said to be about the same share as \n     that of the judges whom Ashcroft appointed when he was \n     governor. Consider that along with Ashcroft's failed fight to \n     keep David Satcher, a respected black physician, from \n     becoming surgeon general because Satcher is against a ban on \n     late-term abortions. And in 1999, Ashcroft accepted an \n     honorary degree from Bob Jones University in South Carolina, \n     which at that time prohibited interracial dating.\n       Bush Cabinet selections such as moderate African-American \n     Colin Powell for secretary of state don't soften the hard-\n     line insensitivity Ashcroft presents. He is not a leader who \n     brings people together.\n       Those who share Ashcroft's religious conservatism are no \n     doubt heartened by the expectation that their points of view \n     will be well represented. But all Americans should at least \n     be comfortable that the next attorney general will be fair-\n     minded and even-handed as the nation's chief law-enforcement \n     officer.\n       Before confirming him, the Senate should expect a pledge \n     from Ashcroft that he will enforce the laws of the land as \n     they exist, not as he would like them to be.\n       The Missourian vigorously opposes abortion rights under \n     virtually all circumstances. So would he fully enforce laws \n     safeguarding clinics?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 4, 2001]\n\n                           Fairness for Whom?\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       We keep hearing that George W. Bush's choice for attorney \n     general, John Ashcroft, is a man of honor, a stalwart when it \n     comes to matters of principle and integrity. Former Senate \n     colleagues are frequently quoted as saying that while they \n     disagree with his ultra-conservative political views, they \n     consider him to be a trustworthy, fair-minded individual.\n       Spare me. The allegedly upright Mr. Ashcroft revealed \n     himself as a shameless and deliberately destructive liar in \n     1999 when, as the junior senator from Missouri, he launched a \n     malacious attack against a genuinely honorable man, Ronnie \n     White, who had been nominated by the president to a federal \n     district court seat.\n       Justice White was a distinguished jurist and the first \n     black member of the Missouri Supreme Court. Mr. Ashcroft, a \n     right-wing zealot with a fondness for the old Confederacy, \n     could not abide his elevation to the federal bench. But there \n     were no legitimate reasons to oppose Justice White's \n     confirmation by the Senate. So Mr. Ashcroft reached into the \n     gutter and scooped up a few handfuls of calumny to throw at \n     the nominee.\n       He declared that Justice White was soft on crime. Worse, he \n     was ``pro-criminal.'' The judge's record, according to Mr. \n     Ashcroft, showed ``a tremendous bent toward criminal \n     activity.'' As for the death penalty, that all-important \n     criminal justice barometer--well, in Mr. Ashcroft's view, the \n     nominee was beyond the pale. He said that Ronnie White was \n     the most anti-death-penalty judge on the State Supreme Court.\n       Listen closely: None of this was true. But by the time Mr. \n     Ashcroft finished painting his false portrait of Justice \n     White, his republican colleagues had fallen into line and \n     were distributing a memo that described the nominee as \n     ``notorious among law enforcement officers in his home state \n     of Missouri for his decisions favoring murderers, rapists, \n     drug dealers and other heinous criminals.''\n       This was a sick episode. Justice White was no friend of \n     criminals. And a look at the record would have shown that \n     even when it came to the death penalty he voted to uphold \n     capital sentences in 70 percent of the cases that came before \n     him. There were times when he voted (mostly with the \n     majority) to reverse capital sentences because of procedural \n     errors. But as my colleague Anthony Lewis pointed out last \n     week, judges appointed by Mr. Ashcroft when he was governor \n     of Missouri voted as often as Justice White--in some cases, \n     more often--to reverse capital sentences.\n       But the damage was done. Mr. Ashcroft's unscrupulous, mean-\n     spirited attack succeeded in derailing the nomination of a \n     fine judge. The confirmation of Justice White was defeated by \n     Republicans in a party-line vote. The Alliance for Justice, \n     which monitors judicial selections, noted that it was the \n     first time in almost half a century that the full Senate had \n     voted down a district court nominee.\n       The Times, in an editorial, said the Republicans had \n     reached ``a new low'' in the judicial confirmation process. \n     The headline on the editorial was ``A Sad Judicial Mugging.''\n       So much for the fair-minded Mr. Ashcroft.\n       A Republican senator, who asked not to be identified, told \n     me this week that he could not justify Mr. Ashcroft's \n     treatment of Ronnie White, but that it would be wrong to \n     suggest that the attack on his nomination was racially \n     motivated.\n       That may or may not be so. It would be easier to believe if \n     Mr. Ashcroft did not have such a dismal record on matters \n     related to race. As Missouri's attorney general he was \n     opposed to even a voluntary plan to desegregate schools in \n     metropolitan St. Louis. Just last year he accepted an \n     honorary degree from Bob Jones University, school that is \n     notorious for its racial and religious intolerance. And a \n     couple of years ago, Mr. Ashcroft gave a friendly interview \n     to Southern Partisan magazine, praising it for helping to \n     ``set the record straight'' about issues related to the Civil \n     War.\n       Southern Partisan just happens to be a rabid neo-\n     Confederate publication that ritually denounces Abraham \n     Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. and other champions of \n     freedom and tolerance in America.\n       This is the man George W. Bush has carefully chosen to be \n     the highest law enforcement officer in the nation. That \n     silence that you hear is the sound of black Americans not \n     celebrating.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Time Magazine, Jan. 2, 2001]\n\n                      The Wrong Choice for Justice\n\n                           (By Jack E. White)\n\n       What was president-elect George W. Bush thinking when he \n     selected John Ashcroft as his nominee for Attorney General? \n     That since he was designating three superbly qualified \n     African Americans for high-level positions--Secretary of \n     State Colin Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza \n     Rice and Secretary of Education Rod Paige--blacks would \n     somehow overlook Ashcroft's horrendous record on race? Or \n     that it was compassionately conservative for Bush to hire a \n     man who had just lost re-election as Missouri's junior U.S. \n     Senator to a dead man? (Governor Mel Carnahan, who died in a \n     plane crash during the campaign, won the seat, and his widow \n     is serving in his place.) It certainly couldn't have been \n     that appointing Ashcroft would enhance Bush's image as a \n     uniter, not a divider. Ashcroft's positions on civil rights \n     issues are about as sensitive as a hammer blow to the head.\n       It's puzzling, because the nomination of an extremist like \n     Ashcroft is so needlessly out of synch with the rest of \n     Bush's utterly respectable Cabinet choices. He could have \n     satisfied the right by selecting Oklahoma Governor Frank \n     Keating, who is as tough on crime as Ashcroft, yet far less \n     controversial. But as we are about to find out, Ashcroft \n     won't be confirmed without a fight. The angriest coalition of \n     liberal, civil rights and feminist organizations Washington \n     has seen since the 1987 battle over Supreme Court nominee \n     Robert Bork is lining up to oppose him. The opposition's \n     leaders concede that as a former member of the club, Ashcroft \n     would normally sail through the Senate. But since Ashcroft \n     has been on the wrong side of every social issue from \n     affirmative action to hate-crimes legislation and women's \n     rights, there may be a chance to peel off enough moderate \n     Republicans to make him the first Cabinet appointee to be \n     bounced since 1989, when John Tower lost his chance to be \n     Secretary of Defense for President Bush the Elder.\n       Pushing Ashcroft through will cost the younger Bush \n     considerable political capital, and might be only the start \n     of his headaches. As a leading G.O.P. strategist puts it, \n     ``The risk will be that about every six months, [Ashcroft] \n     will do something that he thinks is clever or politically \n     interesting, and they will open their papers at the White \n     House and say, ``What the hell is he doing?'' Certainly there \n     is plenty in Ashcroft's record to unsettle fair-minded \n     conservatives--and to\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\n     raise questions about the sincerity of Bush's attempts to \n     reach out to blacks. As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted in \n     an editorial in December, Ashcroft ``has built a career out \n     of opposing school desegregation in St. Louis and opposing \n     African Americans for public office.''\n       When he served as Missouri's attorney general in the 1980s, \n     Ashcroft persuaded the Reagan Administration to oppose \n     school-desegregation plans in St. Louis, then used the issue \n     to win the governorship in 1984. Since his election to the \n     Senate in 1994. Ashcroft has consistently appealed to the \n     right wing of his party, even when his approach risked \n     appearing racist. He fought unsuccessfully against the \n     confirmation of David Satcher, a distinguished black \n     physician, as surgeon general, because Satcher proposes a ban \n     on late-term abortions. In 1998 Ashcroft told the neo-\n     segregationist magazine Southern Partisan that Confederate \n     war heroes were ``patriots.'' In 1999 he accepted an honorary \n     degree from South Carolina's Bob Jones University, which \n     hadn't yet dropped its ridiculous ban on interracial dating.\n       Most disturbing of all, as Ashcroft was gearing up a short-\n     lived campaign for the White House last year, he verbally \n     attacked Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White, an \n     African American whom Bill Clinton has appointed to the \n     federal bench, for supposedly being ``pro-criminal'' and soft \n     on capital punishment. The charge was outright slander. White \n     had voted to uphold the death sentence in 41 of the 59 cases \n     that came before him, roughly the same proportion as \n     Ashcroft's court appointees when he was Governor. No wonder \n     Gordon Baum, leader of white supremacist Council of \n     Conservative Citizens, in 1999 included Ashcroft along with \n     Pat Buchanan in the circle of politicians he'd like to see in \n     the White House.\n       Does Baum know something Bush doesn't? Can Ashcroft be \n     trusted to oversee the investigation of alleged voting-rights \n     abuses in Florida, which many blacks believe disenfranchised \n     them and delivered the presidency unfairly to Bush? This is \n     one nomination that, pardon the pun, should be consigned to \n     the Ashcroft of history.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The point is, the Fraternal Order of Police were dismayed \nthat he was defeated on the basis that he might be anti-law \nenforcement. They pointed out that he was pro-law enforcement. The \nconcern has been expressed and was expressed at the hearing for Judge \nWhite, concern that prompted an apology from some Republicans who had \nvoted against Judge White, regarding the way he was basically \nambushed--that is the expression that has been used--on the Senate \nfloor. We have never had a case where a judicial nomination has been \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee, brought to the Senate floor, and \nthen defeated--in this case, on a party-line vote.\n  What happened and what has created a great deal of concern is that \nhere is a person who came from very humble beginnings, worked his way \nthrough law school, was considered a highly respected member of the bar \nin Missouri, became a justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri, and \nthen, sort of at the pinnacle of his legal career, was nominated to be \na Federal district judge. He went through the hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee, was voted out by the Judiciary Committee by a lopsided \nmargin. It comes to the floor and then, in a party-line vote, is \ndefeated.\n  As my friend from Oklahoma mentioned, the Missouri State Lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police indicated that on behalf of 4,500 law \nenforcement officers they viewed Justice White's record as a jurist as \none whose record on the death penalty was far more supportive of the \nrights of victims than of the rights of criminals. The president of the \nMissouri police chiefs association described Justice White as an \nupright, fine individual. They had a hard time seeing that he was \nagainst law enforcement and never thought of him as pro-criminal.\n  One can debate a judge's position. Basically, as I said, he voted on \ndeath penalty cases 95 percent of the time with justices appointed by \nthen-Governor Ashcroft. What bothered me and bothered a lot of \nSenators--and bothered Republican Senators who publicly then apologized \nto Judge White--was the fact that he was basically ambushed on the \nSenate floor.\n  There was testimony before our Judiciary Committee that it was not \nhis vote on one particular case but, rather, the fact that he was made \na political pawn in a Senate race. That is wrong.\n  We should keep the judiciary out of politics. He was dragged in and \nhis reputation was unnecessarily besmirched. His career was damaged. \nAll he had worked for all of his life was for naught, and it was done \nfor political purposes.\n  That is what most people objected to. That was certainly what the \nletters indicated that I have received--including concern expressed by \npeople who told me, first and foremost, they voted for then-Governor \nBush to become President Bush but felt that this was wrong.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just to give a little different flavor, I \ndon't like the word ``ambush'' applied to Judge White.\n  To clarify again a couple of things that happened, the reason why \nthis Senator voted against him--and I would guess the reason why the \nmajority of Republicans voted against him--was because we received a \nletter from the National Sheriffs' Association that said: Vote against \nJudge White. They had good reasons expressed in that letter. In this \nprincipal case that we are talking about, three deputy sheriffs were \nmurdered, and the wife of a sheriff was murdered, and Judge White was \nthe sole judge saying: Let's retry it; let's have a new hearing. The \nMissouri law enforcement community was very opposed to that.\n  In addition to that, several Chiefs of Police contacted us and \nsuggested we vote no, and to review this dissent. We also heard from \nprosecutors about this case and other cases who said vote no on Judge \nWhite.\n  The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police sent us a letter in support of \nJudge White, but they sent that letter after the vote.\n  Why did we have the vote at that time? Our colleagues on the Democrat \nside were clamoring for a vote. Why did people vote for Judge White in \ncommittee and then vote against him on the floor? The letters of law \nenforcement did not come up until after he was approved by the \nJudiciary Committee. I will grant my colleague from Vermont that later \nthere were other letters from law enforcement.\n  The letter from the National Sheriffs' Association was not before the \nJudiciary Committee. I wish they would have written it before the \nJudiciary Committee had voted, but they did it afterwards when it was \nthe pending nomination before the floor of the Senate.\n  One other clarification I wish to repeat is that I am just very \ntroubled by the allegation that he was opposed because of his race \nbecause most people did not know what his race was. I sat through a \nmeeting where these letters by law enforcement were discussed, and \nJudge White's race was never mentioned. I know that to be the case. I \nsat in that meeting. That wasn't an issue. It didn't come up.\n  What came up was law enforcement opposition and at that time the only \nlaw enforcement letters we saw were in opposition. If we had the letter \nfrom the FOP saying confirm him, maybe that would have made a \ndifference, and probably would have. Maybe if the sheriffs' \norganizations would have gotten their letter out before the Judiciary \nCommittee vote, it might have made a big difference in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Timing is important. But it is important to remember that \nthe reason why we had the vote on the floor at that time, I believe, \nwas because our colleagues on the Democrat side were clamoring for a \nvote.\n  I don't like the word ``ambush.'' Maybe that vote should have been \ndelayed so we could have had a little more discussion of why these law \nenforcement groups were against him. Maybe some might have been for him \ngiven more time to enter into that debate. But that didn't happen, and \nI wasn't involved in scheduling the vote.\n\n  But my point is I didn't feel as though he was ambushed. I do say \nwhat was unique was that during my 20 years in the Congress, this is \nthe only time I can remember national law enforcement agencies coming \nup and saying vote against this person, which is what they did in \ncontacting Members of the Senate. I think that is the reason Judge \nWhite went down.\n  Be that as it may, there are lots of other issues dealing with John \nAshcroft.\n  Again, I think John Ashcroft is one outstanding individual who is \nmore than qualified to be Attorney General of the United States. And I \nam absolutely confident that when he is confirmed, we will look back \nand say he is an outstanding Attorney General for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just so the Record is straight on law \nenforcement officers, it is interesting that there was no contact of \nanybody on this side. Senator Ashcroft said the reason he stopped Judge \nWhite was because of that urging of law enforcement groups. But then \nsubsequently, press reports and then the reports by the law enforcement \nofficials themselves and Senator Ashcroft's own testimony at his \nhearing contradicted that; that he had instigated and orchestrated the \ngroups' opposition to Ronnie White. I am not suggesting Ronnie White \nwas defeated because he was an African American, but it would be hard \nfor anybody not to know he was insofar as that was mentioned at great \nlength in the debate the day before and the debate just before the vote \nby those who were on the floor debating it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 10:45 \na.m. shall be under the control of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman. He is so recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have known John Ashcroft for almost 40 years, as a \ncollege classmate, a fellow State attorney general and a colleague in \nthe Senate. Throughout that time, our views on important issues very \noften have diverged, but I have never had reason to doubt his sincerity \nor his integrity. It strikes me in this regard that the often-noted and \nsometimes derided notion that Senators judge their colleagues more \nleniently than outsiders misses an important point. It is not that we \nreflexively defer to our former colleagues. It is instead that we as \nhuman beings find it tremendously difficult to pass judgment on those \nwe have worked with and know well. And it is because I have known \nSenator Ashcroft for so long that I find the conclusion I have \nreached--which is to oppose his nomination--so awkward and \nuncomfortable. But that is where my review of the record regarding this \nnomination and my understanding of the Senate's responsibility under \nthe advice and consent clause lead me.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have voted on hundreds of \nPresidential nominees. In each case, I have adhered to a broadly \ndeferential standard of review. As I explained in my first speech on \nthe Senate floor--in which I offered my reasons for opposing the \nnomination of John Tower to serve as Defense Secretary--the history of \nthe debates at the Constitution Convention make clear that the \nPresident is entitled to the benefit of the doubt in his appointments. \nThe question, I concluded, I should ask myself in considering nominees \nis not whether I would have chosen the nominee, but rather whether the \nPresident's choice is acceptable for the job in question.\n  That does not mean that the Senate should serve merely as a rubber \nstamp. Were that the case, the Framers would have given the Senate no \nrole in the appointments process. Instead, the Senate's constitutional \nadvice and consent mandate obliges it to serve as a check on the \nPresident's appointment power. As I put it in my statement on Senator \nTower's nomination, I believe this requires Senators to consider \nseveral things: First, the knowledge, experience, and qualifications of \nthe nominee for the position; second, the nominee's judgment, as \nevidenced by his conduct and decisions, as well as his personal \nbehavior; and third, the nominee's ethics, including current or prior \nconflicts of interest. In unusual circumstances, Senators can also \nconsider fundamental and potentially irreconcilable policy differences \nbetween the nominee and the mission of the agency he or she is to \nserve.\n  On a few occasions during my 12 years in the Senate, I have \ndetermined that the views of certain nominees--on both ends of the \npolitical spectrum--fell sufficiently outside the mainstream to compel \nme to oppose their nominations. In each case, I had serious doubts \nabout whether they could credibly carry out the duties of the office to \nwhich they were nominated. In 1993, for example, I voted against \nPresident Clinton's nominee to head the National Endowment for the \nHumanities because I believed that his active support of so-called \ncollege speech codes cast doubt on his ability to administer the NEH \nappropriately. That same year, I expressed opposition to another of \nPresident Clinton's nominees--his choice to head the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division--because I feared that her writings \nand speeches demonstrated an ideological vision of what the voting \nrights laws should be that was so far from what they had been that I \nwas reluctant to put her in charge of enforcing those laws, regardless \nof whether or not she had pledged to abide by the law as it existed.\n  In 1999, just last year, I concluded that a nominee to the Federal \nElection Commission held views on the nation's campaign finance laws \nthat were so inconsistent with the FEC's mission that I could not in \ngood conscience vote to place him in a position of authority over that \nagency. And just this week I reached a similar conclusion with respect \nto President Bush's nominee to lead the Interior Department.\n  In short, although I believe that the Constitution casts the Senate's \nadvice role as a limited one and counsels Senators to be cautious in \nwithholding their consent, I nevertheless have opposed nominees where \ntheir policy positions, statements, or actions made me question whether \nthey would be able to administer the agency they had been nominated to \nhead in a credible and adequate manner. Regretfully, I conclude that \nsuch a determination is again warranted on this critically important \nnomination--because of the record of the nominee and because of the \nposition for which he has been nominated.\n\n  The Justice Department occupies a unique role in the structure of the \nFederal Government. As its mission statement declares, the Justice \nDepartment exists ``to ensure fair and impartial administration of \njustice for all Americans.'' No other agency every day and every hour \nmakes decisions about how and on whom to bring to bear the force of the \ncriminal and civil law, making countless decisions not only on whom to \nprosecute or sue, but also on how harsh a sentence to seek and even on \nwho--in the name of the people of the United States--should face death \nas punishment for their actions. No other agency has such broad and \nsweeping authority to take away our citizens' life, liberty or \nproperty--an authority we as Americans accept because no other agency \nhas more consistently sought to exemplify the rule of law and the \nabiding American aspiration of equal justice for all. No other official \nof the United States government bears as great a responsibility as does \nthe Attorney General for protecting and enforcing the rights of the \nvulnerable and disenfranchised in our society. If we are to sustain \npopular trust in the law, which is so important for ``domestic \ntranquility,'' it is absolutely critical that the Department which is \ncharged with enforcing the law not only be administered according to \nlaw, but also that the great majority of Americans have confidence in \nthe fairness and integrity of its leadership.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Ashcroft's past statements and actions have \ngiven understandable suspicions to many citizens--particularly some of \nthose whose rights are most at risk--that he will not lead the \nDepartment in a manner that will protect them. Others have detailed his \nrecord so extensively that I need not do so again. Suffice it to say \nthat on issues ranging from civil rights to privacy rights, Senator \nAshcroft has repeatedly taken positions considerably outside of the \nmainstream of American thinking.\n  When given the opportunity to consider laws as Missouri's Governor \nand enforce them as Missouri's attorney general, he took actions that \ntoday raise serious questions among many in this country about his \ncommitment to equal justice and opportunity. In speeches and articles, \nhe has spoken and written words that have particularly led many in the \nAfrican-American community to question his sensitivity to their rights \nand concerns. And, when acting on nominees in the Senate--including \nJudge Ronnie White and Ambassador James Hormel--he has made statements \nthat have raised sincere questions in the minds of many about whether \nhe will make fair and appropriate decisions regarding groups of \nAmericans that have frequently been victimized by discrimination.\n  The cumulative weight of these words and deeds leaves me with \nsufficient doubt about Senator Ashcroft's ability to appropriately \ncarry out--and be perceived as appropriately carrying\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\nout--the manifold duties of Attorney General, so that I have decided \nnot to support his nomination.\n  Before yielding the floor, I would like to comment on one more issue \nthat has come up during the consideration of this particular \nnomination: Senator Ashcroft's religious beliefs and his public \nprofession of his faith. During the time since the President nominated \nSenator Ashcroft, many have argued--too often privately--that Senator \nAshcroft's deeply held beliefs and his religious practices somehow cast \nsuspicion on his ability to serve as Attorney General. I emphatically \nreject--and am confident my colleagues will reject--any suggestion that \nSenator Ashcroft's religious beliefs bear in any manner at all on the \nconsideration of his nomination.\n  All across this nation, tens of millions of Americans of a multitude \nof faiths daily and weekly make professions of faith privately and \npublically that elevate, order and give purpose to their lives. To \nsuggest that all of us who believe with a steadfast faith in a Supreme \nBeing as the Universe's ultimate Sovereign have an obligation to mute \none of our faith's central elements if we wish to serve in government \nis not to advance the separation of church and state, but instead to \nerect a barrier to public service by Americans of faith which is \ntotally unacceptable. To consider the private religious practices of a \nnominee or a candidate for public office which are different from \nmost--whether Pentecostal Christian, Orthodox Jewish, Shia Muslim, or \nany other faith--as a limitation on that person's capacity to hold that \noffice is profoundly unfair. It is wrong.\n  Nowhere in the first amendment or anywhere else in the Constitution \nor in the jurisprudence surrounding them is there any suggestion that \nof all the values systems that those in public life are permitted to \ndraw upon to inform their views and their actions, religion stands \nalone as being off limits. Let us remember that the Constitution and \nthe Bill of Rights were drafted by people of faith whose belief in the \nCreator was the direct source of the rights with which they endowed us \nand which we enjoy to this day. To suggest that one may justify his or \nher views on abortion, environmental protection, or any other issue \nwith reference to a system of secular values, but not by drawing upon a \ntradition of religious beliefs, seems to me to be at odds not only with \nthe freedom of religion and expression enshrined in the first \namendment, but also with the daily experience of the vast majority of \nour fellow citizens. The first amendment tells us that we may not \nimpose our religion on others. It most decidedly does not say that we \nmay not ourselves use our religion to inform our public and private \nstatements and positions.\n  It is Senator Ashcroft's record, not his religion, that we should \njudge. I admire Senator Ashcroft for his private and public adherence \nto his faith, but for the reasons stated above, based on his record, I \nwill vote against his confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to continue for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is on the floor, I appreciate the last part of his remarks. \nI will speak more about it later today.\n  I am concerned that there has somehow been this strawman put up as \nthough there is a religious test. As I and others stated at the \nbeginning of these hearings and as I stated on the floor, one of the \nthings I admire most about Senator Ashcroft is his commitment to his \nfamily, his commitment to his religion. As practically everybody has \npointed out, whether we are for or against him as Attorney General, \nthese are two things we have admired the most: his commitment to his \nfamily and his commitment to his religion. There should be no doubt \nabout that in the public's mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes that under the previous \norder the time until 11 a.m. shall be under the control of the majority \nparty. We have gone over by 10 minutes, so the Senator is recognized \nfor 10 minutes. If the Senator's remarks are 15 minutes in length, he \ncan ask unanimous consent for that time.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, thank you for your courtesy.\n  Over the past 8 years, I believe our Justice Department has \nfloundered dangerously, challenging our most basic understanding of the \nrule of law and starkly reminding us in America of the awesome power of \nthe Federal Government and the dangers that the exercise of that power \ncan present to a free society such as ours. I believe public confidence \nin our system of justice has been seriously damaged in the past 8 years \nand that our country has suffered as a consequence.\n  I believe it is time to restore the public trust, and I do not \nbelieve there is a better qualified or more honorable man to do that \njob than Senator John Ashcroft, our former colleague. Indeed, he is one \nof the most, if not the most, experienced nominees for Attorney General \nwe have ever had in our history. He is one of the best educated, most \nexperienced nominees for Attorney General I have seen in my 23 years in \nWashington.\n  What is most outstanding about Senator Ashcroft is not his resume, \nalthough we could go on and on and on about that. It is not his strong \nrecord of leadership as the attorney general of his State of Missouri \nand his leadership as the Governor of the State of Missouri. No, it is \nnot his impressive legislative accomplishments in the Senate.\n  I submit what is most outstanding about John Ashcroft is his \ncharacter. It is the strength of that character that makes him so well \nsuited to be Attorney General of the United States. His principles and \nhis integrity underscore the kind of leadership the Justice Department \nso desperately needs and the American people so rightly deserve in an \nAttorney General.\n  John Ashcroft's conscience and his conviction ensure rather than \nquestion his commitment to enforce the laws of our land fairly and \nimpartially. I do not believe even for a moment that Senator Ashcroft's \nmost fierce opponents truly believe he will not endeavor to enforce our \nlaws faithfully. While his conservatism threatens them, their real \nfear, I believe, is that he will enforce the law without prejudice, \nthat he will be uniform in his application. This is because their \ngreatest ideal, I believe, is to use the Justice Department as a tool \nto advance the political and social agenda of America by selectively \nenforcing laws with which they agree and ignoring those with which they \ndisagree.\n  John Ashcroft, I submit to you, is not going to do that. As a man who \nrespects the rule of law and the importance of the public trust in our \njustice system, I have no doubt that he will enforce the laws of the \nland rather than creatively interpret them, twist or contort them to \nmatch his personal beliefs.\n  I am pleased to support the nomination of John Ashcroft to be the \nAttorney General of the United States. I sincerely believe he will \nhonor the office of Attorney General and he will restore integrity to \nthe Justice Department. I look forward to his confirmation later today \nby the Senate and his future service to the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I trust the debate is moving along \ntoward a successful vote here in the not too distant future.\n  I rise today to emphatically support the nomination of John Ashcroft \nto become the next Attorney General of the United States. He has served \nour Nation with distinction and with honor. I do not take lightly my \nsenatorial duties to review the qualifications of any nominee for this \noffice. The Attorney General is the Nation's highest law enforcement \nofficer, and without the strong and faithful execution of the laws we \npass, representative democracy shall fail. Our laws become mere words. \nIt is with this understanding, and a high personal regard for the \noffice, that I support John Ashcroft's nomination.\n  It has become clear to me and others, after following the unusually \npersonal debate on this nomination, that no one can question John's \nqualifications to perform the duties of this job. In fact, I believe \none would be hard-pressed to find a more qualified, experienced \nnominee. John has served with distinction, as has been noted and \nstated, as attorney general, as Governor, and as\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\nU.S. Senator in this body. Not once during his long and successful \ntenure as a public servant has he ever failed to uphold an oath of \noffice.\n  Think about that. We have had some experience in debating the merits \nof the oath of office and just what it means. I think to all of us it \nis a very sacred oath, a very meaningful oath, and one that should be \nreflected on. John has never failed to uphold his oath of office in any \ncapacity. I know John Ashcroft does not plan on starting now.\n  Unfortunately, this nomination process has done a grave disservice to \na very decent and honorable man. We as legislators often disagree on \npolicy. I am sure I have disagreed with John on some issues. But our \nactions as legislators are guided by our own personal convictions. We \nmust vote our conscience and represent the people who graced us with \ntheir votes.\n  But we are not here to elect a legislator. Rather, we deal with the \noffice of the Attorney General of the United States. This is not John \nAshcroft the Senator but, rather, John Ashcroft the Attorney General. \nLike all of us who have served in different roles throughout our lives, \nI know John fully understands his position in government.\n  John will faithfully enforce our Nation's laws without a hint of \npersonal bias or a hidden agenda. He will uphold the rule of law for \nall Americans, enforcing laws as they are enacted by the Congress. At \nthe end of the day and at the end of this debate, my vote will be cast \nin favor of this nomination for one simple reason: John Ashcroft is a \nman of his word. I have yet to hear anyone demonstrate in this debate \nthat he is not.\n  John has clearly stated numerous times that he will not allow his \npersonal beliefs to interfere with his ability to enforce the law. I \nbelieve him. Throughout his long and successful career, he has never, \nnever given anyone a reason to doubt his word. I thank John for his \nwillingness to further serve our Nation and his willingness to \nwithstand the numerous unjustified personal attacks that have been made \non him. My thanks will be expressed in my vote in favor of the \nnomination. I encourage my fellow Senators to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:10 \na.m. shall be under the control of the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nEdwards. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Nation is emerging from an extraordinarily close \nelection that has left much of the country feeling divided. It is a \ntime when all of us have an enormous responsibility to unite our \ncountry. In order to unite this country, we have to turn to leaders who \ninspire confidence and bring us together. In my judgment, with the \nnomination of Senator Ashcroft, President Bush has fallen short of that \ngoal.\n  Why has he fallen short? Because in a time when our country \ndesperately needs a unifier, the President has nominated a man to be \nthe chief law enforcement officer of the country--the people's lawyer, \nthe lawyer for all the people--who has a long record of divisive and \ninflammatory rhetoric which results in him being viewed as a polarizing \nfigure.\n  There are some folks who argue that his positions are just the result \nof very deeply held beliefs. Some people believe his positions are \nextreme. In the end, the one thing that is certain is that he is, in \nthe view of many Americans, a polarizing and divisive figure.\n  Senator Ashcroft opposed the nomination of Ronnie White, a very well-\nrespected African American justice on the Missouri Supreme Court, for \nwhat at least appeared to be simply political reasons. In opposing the \nnomination of Justice White, Senator Ashcroft used words and language \nthat not only were inflammatory but showed a fundamental disrespect for \na man who had lifted himself out of poverty, worked his entire life to \nbecome a justice on the Missouri Supreme Court, and committed his \nprofessional life to the fair administration of justice.\n  It is not unfair for some Americans to question whether Senator \nAshcroft can adequately represent their public interests given his \nhistory.\n  Some argue that Senator Ashcroft, in fact, has given his word that he \nwill follow the law and enforce the law. The problem is that the \nrealities of the Justice Department are that there are daily choices \nthe Attorney General will be required to make. He will be required to \ndecide which laws will be vigorously enforced and which laws will be \ndefended from attack.\n  Senator Ashcroft has spoken very eloquently about the reasons he \npursued certain cases while he was attorney general of Missouri and why \nhe challenged certain laws and legislation. Whether you agree or \ndisagree with what Senator Ashcroft did as attorney general of \nMissouri, you can count on the fact that those same situations can and \nwill arise, in fact, during the term of the next Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  The Attorney General will be required to make daily decisions, \ndiscretionary decisions, that are critical to the lives of very many \nAmericans. Again, it is not unfair for some Americans to question \nwhether Senator Ashcroft, even keeping his word, which he has given us, \nwill make decisions that will adequately represent and protect them \ngiven his prior statements and actions. The question is whether he \nwill, in fact, be all the people's lawyer, as he has a responsibility \nto be.\n  The post of the Attorney General is very different from other Cabinet \nposts. The Attorney General advises the President about the \nconstitutionality of the legislation he is being asked to sign. He \nmakes recommendations to the President about judicial nominations. As I \nalready discussed and as others have discussed, Senator Ashcroft's \nhistory does not support the notion that he will recommend candidates \nfor nomination to the Federal bench solely on the basis of their \nqualifications and abilities to serve.\n\n  It is critical to note that the Attorney General is not the \nPresident's lawyer, he is the people's lawyer. He represents our Nation \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. Senator Ashcroft once called a U.S. \nSupreme Court decision ``illegitimate.'' Again, such statements show a \nfundamental disrespect for the rule of law which we believe is so \ncritical in this country. When our U.S. Supreme Court speaks, whether \nwe agree or disagree with them, they are the final word and they are \nthe law of the land.\n  It is very important to recognize also that the vast majority of the \ndecisions that will be made by our Attorney General over the next four \nyears will be difficult judgments made behind closed doors and under \nthe national radar screen, outside the television cameras. When so many \nAmericans believe that when the doors are closed and the lights and the \ncameras are off, Senator Ashcroft will not protect their interests, our \nresponsibility is to do what is best for the country. The people have \nto believe that the Attorney General is the people's lawyer and that he \nwill serve all Americans.\n  Some of Senator Ashcroft's supporters suggest that the opposition to \nhim is about his religion and about his faith. I want to make clear \nthat I think strong faith is an enormous asset in any public servant. \nIn fact, personal touchstones of faith and morality are critical to \nproviding leadership and governance in this country.\n  I served with Senator Ashcroft in the Senate. I know him, and I \nabsolutely believe his strong faith is deep and sincere. I applaud and, \nin many ways, share the strength of his religious conviction and his \nreligious faith. It is certainly not because of his faith that I reach \nthe decision I do today. In fact, it is in spite of it.\n  In conclusion, at a time when our Nation desperately needs unifying \nleaders, Senator Ashcroft is the wrong man for the wrong job at the \nwrong time. So it is with deep regret that I will not be able to \nsupport the nomination of Senator Ashcroft.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  (Disturbance in the galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. allard). There will be order in the \ngalleries.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have to say that as I listen to this \norganized campaign against John Ashcroft, I sometimes wonder if there \nis not an effort to make the love of traditional values a hate crime in \nAmerica.\n  Fifty years ago, a person who set out to engage in public service \nmight unfairly be criticized for not being a\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nmember of a church or not professing religion, but who would have \nthought 50 years later that a man would be mocked for holding a deeply \nheld faith? Who would have thought 50 years later that calling on the \nAlmighty to help you fulfill trusts that were given to you by your \nState and your Nation would be held up to ridicule?\n  The plain truth is, we may have ``In God We Trust'' on our coins, but \nwe do not have it in our heart.\n  As I have looked at this caricature that has been created, that his \nopponents claim is John Ashcroft, this is not the man I know. This is \nnot the man with whom I have worked for 6 years. This is not the man \nwhose son attended college with my son. This is not the man who, in \npublic or private in 6 years, I never heard say a mean word against \nanyone. This is not the man who, remarkably, in my opinion, can express \nhimself without ever using profanity.\n  I hear him criticized for opposing judges with no good reason, and \nyet in the case of Judge White he was opposed by 77 sheriffs in the \nState. He was opposed by both Senators, and he was opposed and rejected \nby the Senate on an up-or-down vote.\n  In short, when I look at all of these criticisms, and when I weigh \nthem against the bottom line facts, there is no basis for them at all.\n  I thank Jon Kyl and I thank Jeff Sessions for the excellent job they \nhave done in putting out the facts.\n  A person who fits the ugly caricature that has been presented here in \nthe Senate and around the country could not be the John Ashcroft I \nknow.\n  A person who fit that ugly caricature could not have been elected \nAttorney General twice in the State of Missouri. A person fitting that \ncaricature would not have been chosen by his fellow attorneys general \nto be the president of the National Association of Attorneys General. A \nperson who fit the ugly caricature presented here could not have been \nelected Governor of Missouri twice, and would not and could not have \nbeen chosen by his 49 fellow Governors to head the National Governors' \nAssociation.\n  I know George Bush. I have a pretty good idea what is in his mind and \nin his heart. And a person who met this ugly caricature that we hear \ncould not and would not have been nominated by George Bush. The plain \ntruth is that John Ashcroft is probably the most qualified person ever \nto be appointed Attorney General.\n  I want to conclude with this thought. I am beginning to wonder if \nthis was all an effort to smear and defeat John Ashcroft or whether \nthis was an effort to cow John Ashcroft; whether this is an effort by \nthose who lost the election, who hold views that are alien to the views \nof most Americans, to try, through smearing John Ashcroft, to cow him \nin office, and in the process prevent him from carrying out George \nBush's agenda. I want to say I vote for John Ashcroft with the happy \nknowledge that that effort will fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time does not expire until \n11:15. Does he wish to yield that time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield that time to my dear colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of John Ashcroft. \nIt will not take me long to make my point.\n  Although I represent the State of Montana, I was raised in the State \nof Missouri on a small farm, and I understand some of the mindset that \nis in that State. My mother and father both were active in the \nDemocratic Party. Mom was in the State Democratic Committee in that \nState and was county chairman. She often wondered what happened to me, \nbut I tried to explain to her about it one time: When you see the \noutside world, maybe your philosophy changes just a little bit.\n  I have heard nothing but those who would have reservations about John \nAshcroft enforcing the law. It would seem to me, after two terms as \nattorney general in the State of Missouri, two terms as Governor, and 6 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, it would surface somewhere that he would not.\n  I thank Senator Kyl and Senator Sessions for the research they have \ndone. I have talked to some of the law enforcement people in Missouri \nand have done some research in my own home State of Montana. What I \nhave found is that we couldn't have chosen a better man to represent \nthis country in the halls of the Attorney General. I shall support \nhim--and support him wholeheartedly--because we have a man of substance \nand of fiber.\n  I thank my good friend from Texas for yielding some of his time. I \nalso thank my good friend, Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, for \nyielding some of his time he has reserved and allowing me to go at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:45 \nshall be under the control of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have voted for any number of the \nPresident's nominees to serve in our Cabinet, even though I am 100-\npercent sure I am going to be in disagreement with them on some of the \nreally major public policy questions that face our country.\n  It is very rare that a Cabinet nominee is defeated by the Senate. It \ndoes not happen very often. There is a presumption that the President \nshould be allowed to choose his or her people to serve in the Cabinet. \nIn addition, I do know Senator Ashcroft. I respect his religious \nconvictions. I have had personal interaction with him, which I have \nenjoyed. And if he is confirmed, I will wish him the very best because \nhe will be Attorney General for our country.\n  But there is also a set of other questions that are important to me \nas a Senator from Minnesota. To be the Attorney General, and to head \nthe Justice Department, is to be the lawyer for all the people in the \ncountry.\n  I had a great man who worked for me here who passed away from cancer \nthis last year, Mike Epstein. When I first met Mike, he said to me: I \nhave been in Washington for 30 years, but I still believe in changing \nthe world. I hope we can work together.\n  He came to the Justice Department and worked with Bobby Kennedy, \ndealing with enforcement of the Civil Rights Act; the Justice \nDepartment, dealing with enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Colleagues, in Minnesota, when we were celebrating the life of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., I was speaking at a gathering. I didn't expect \nthe reaction. I remember a book Dr. King wrote called ``Where Do We Go \nFrom Here: Chaos or Community?'' I had this cadence where I said: We \nhave a long ways to go. And in the cadence, I said: We have a long ways \nto go when people of color are pulled along the side of the road on \ntheir way to vote because they are people of color.\n  I could not believe the reaction of the African American community, \nthe Latino community, the Southeast Asian community, and the Native \nAmerican community. They know that what happened in Florida was wrong. \nSomething went wrong there. And they are very mindful of voting rights, \nthe hate crimes legislation, the Violence Against Women Act, the Church \nArson Act.\n  The Attorney General is the person who advises the President on \njudicial appointments, whether it be to a Federal district court, the \ncourt of appeals, or the U.S. Supreme Court. I do not honestly believe \nJohn Ashcroft is the right person to be Attorney General for our \ncountry.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--I just heard \nthis as I came in, getting ready to speak--have labeled disagreement \nwith this choice and questions that have been raised--I am going to \nraise civil rights questions; this is my background; this is my life--\nas a personal attack on John Ashcroft. I don't see it that way.\n  In fact, I said to John on the telephone: I never will savage you. I \ndon't believe in it. I hate it. Some of my colleagues have spoken on \nthe floor with a considerable amount of eloquence about that.\n  But my baptism to politics was the civil rights movement. I learned \nfrom men and women of color--many of them young, and many of them old, \nand hardly any of them famous, though they should be famous--about the \nimportance of civil rights and human rights. This is the framework I \nbring to the Senate. This is why I am going to vote no.\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\n  I don't agree with some of the positions Senator Ashcroft took as a \nSenator, but that is not the basis of my vote.\n  Some of his views on abortion, to make abortion a crime even in the \ncase of rape and incest, are extreme and harsh. I once said in a TV \ndebate that John Ashcroft gives me cognitive dissonance because I like \nhim as a person and I don't understand how a person whom I like can \nhold, sometimes, such harsh views. I don't agree with his position on \nabortion. I don't agree with some of his other positions.\n  It is not his voting record. Without trying to be self-righteous on \nthe floor of the Senate or melodramatic, I have spent hardly any time \nwith groups or organizations except at the beginning when people came \nby and I said: Please give me everything to read and let me think this \nthrough myself.\n  I am troubled by the statements made by John Ashcroft and his role in \nblatantly distorting the record of Judge White. I am going to say \n``blatantly distorting the record'' because I think that is what \nhappened. The evidence is compelling. We heard from Judge White about \nthat as well. To call him a pro-criminal judge on the basis of the \ndecisions he had rendered--I don't want to say it was \n``extraordinary''--crossed a line. I have a right as a Senator to say, \nif John Ashcroft, as Attorney General, with the key position he would \nbe playing in terms of judges and the Federal judiciary, is going to \nuse the same standard and the same methodology he used to oppose \nJustice White, then a lot of justices, a lot of men and women who could \nserve our country in the Federal judiciary, will never make it. That is \none of the reasons I oppose this nomination.\n  The question was put to John Ashcroft in the committee about his \nopposition to Jim Hormel: Did he oppose Jim Hormel because he was gay? \nSenator Ashcroft stated that ``the totality of circumstances suggested \nthat Mr. Hormel would not make a good ambassador.'' What made up that \ntotality? Senator Ashcroft didn't attend Mr. Hormel's hearings. He \nrefused to meet with Mr. Hormel. He never returned any of Mr. Hormel's \ncalls. And in the hearing, John Ashcroft suggested or stated that Mr. \nHormel ``recruited him'' to the University of Chicago School of Law. \nBut Mr. Hormel says: I don't ever recall recruiting anybody for the \nUniversity of Chicago. And he can't remember a single conversation with \nJohn Ashcroft over the past 30-some years.\n  John Ashcroft also told us, in the battle over the nomination, that \nMr. Hormel, by simply being an openly gay man who is also a civic \nleader, has ``been a leader in promoting a lifestyle, and the kind of \nleadership he has exhibited there is likely to be offensive to \nindividuals in the setting in which he is assigned,'' suggesting that \nLuxembourg, as a Catholic nation, would find it difficult to receive \nhim.\n  The evidence is that Luxembourg openly embraced him. He was a great \nAmbassador. It is also a questionable assumption, because it is a \nCatholic country, that Catholics would not embrace a person, would not \njudge a person by the content of his character.\n  I want to be clear that as a Senator, as I think about who should \nhead the Justice Department and who should be the Attorney General and \nI think about my own life, when I was teaching, I used to insist that \nstudents answer the following question: Why do you think about politics \nthe way you think about politics? Then I never graded their answer. I \njust wanted them to think about what really shaped their viewpoint. I \nhave been thinking a lot about that in relation to this debate. There \nare sets of facts and different versions of truth and all the rest.\n  What shapes my viewpoint? I am a product of the civil rights \nmovement. I am not a hero like John Lewis, but I helped. Men and women \nin the civil rights movement were my teachers. This is a civil rights \nvote. This is a human rights vote.\n  I know that John and his supporters will say: Judge us by what is in \nour heart. For people across the country, people of color, people who \nhave a different sexual orientation, they judge you by your actions. \nThey judge you by what you have said. And I believe the Justice \nDepartment has to be all about justice. I don't think John Ashcroft is \nthe right person to head this Justice Department.\n  It is not any one thing. I will be honest. I will admit a bias. I \ndon't have a great feeling for Bob Jones University. As long as we are \ntalking about race, they banned dating between students of different \nraces and continue to have a policy that states that gay alumni--yes, \nformer students--should be arrested for trespassing when they step foot \non the grounds of their alma mater. I don't have a good feeling for \nthis school. I am speaking within the civil rights and human rights \nframework. I don't know why John Ashcroft accepted an honorary degree. \nI don't know why you would want to honor such a school. I don't know \nwhy you wouldn't want to renounce all of those policies.\n  It is just one piece of evidence, and I know John has made it clear \nthat he disagrees with some of what the school is about.\n  I don't understand the interview with Southern Partisan magazine. I \nfind it to be bizarre. This is a magazine which goes out of its way not \nto promote racial reconciliation or healing but just the opposite. I \ndon't understand John Ashcroft's animus toward Ron White or toward Jim \nHormel. If it wasn't that, then it probably was some form of political \nopportunism. I certainly don't understand the association with Southern \nPartisan magazine and not even being willing to renounce this magazine \nor acknowledge his error in doing the interview at the recent hearings.\n  I don't know why he refused to sign the pledge that his office would \nnot discriminate in its employment practices based on sexual \norientation. It is his first amendment right. The point is, we are \ntalking about somebody to head up the Justice Department.\n  I consider this to be a civil rights vote and a human rights vote. \nThat is why I am voting no. Despite what John Ashcroft said during the \nhearings about his limited role in the State of Missouri on any number \nof legal cases dealing with civil rights and human rights, I will \ndiscuss his role in opposing what was a voluntary desegregation order. \nI will highlight the testimony of one who knows John Ashcroft's record \nin this area best, Bill Taylor. I will highlight Bill Taylor's \ntestimony because I consider him to be a giant. I am proud to say he is \none of my teachers. He is a real hero. He is one of those who joined \nThurgood Marshall's team in the years just after the Brown decision to \nwork for full implementation of Brown v. Board of Education.\n  Over two decades, he served as the lead counsel for a class of \nparents and students in the St. Louis case. During the most active part \nof that time, John Ashcroft was attorney general and Governor of \nMissouri. Listen to the words of Bill Taylor in his testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee:\n\n       I have thought seriously since this nomination about \n     whether Mr. Ashcroft's conduct in the St. Louis case was \n     simply that of a lawyer vigorously defending the interests of \n     the State or whether some of his actions went over the line \n     of strong advocacy and reflect on his qualifications to serve \n     as Attorney General of the United States. My conclusion is \n     that the latter is the case. I believe that in his tenure as \n     Attorney General, Mr. Ashcroft used the court system to delay \n     and obstruct the development and implementation of a \n     desegregation settlement that was agreed to by all major \n     parties except the State.\n       In so doing, he sought to prevent measures that were a \n     major step toward racial reconciliation in an area where \n     there has been much conflict, and to thwart a remedy that \n     ultimately proved to be a very important vehicle for \n     educational progress. John Ashcroft massively resisted this \n     desegregation effort.\n\n  I think the most troubling aspect of the Missouri school \ndesegregation issue, to me, is that John Ashcroft consistently used his \nfervent opposition to the Federal judge's desegregation order as a \npolitical issue in the campaign.\n  I want to be real clear about it because I am not going to get into \nany pitched, acrimonious battle with anyone here on the floor of the \nSenate. But the fact that I talk about his resistance to this voluntary \ndesegregation case is that I am so troubled by the ways in which he \nwent after Justice White; the fact that I talk about Bob Jones \nUniversity and Southern Partisan magazine is not because I am \ninterested in any personal attack. I already said I don't understand \nhow it is that a person I like so much personally can hold such harsh \nviews. But he is the lawyer for all the people of the\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\nUnited States of America if he is Attorney General. He will head up the \nJustice Department. This is the Voting Rights Act. This is the Civil \nRights Act. This is the Violence Against Women Act. This is all about \nwhether or not you can have a man or a woman--in this particular case a \nman--who will head the Justice Department and will lead our country \ndown the path of racial reconciliation.\n  We have a huge divide in the United State of America on the central \nquestion of race. We have a question before us as to whether or not we \nhave a man who can lead the Justice Department for justice for all \npeople and who will be a leader when it comes to basic human rights \nquestions. He is not the right choice.\n  I thank the Judiciary Committee, Democrats and Republicans alike, for \nthe way in which they conducted the hearings.\n  I say to John Ashcroft, whom I am sure is viewing this debate and \nlistening to all of us, that if confirmed, again, I wish him the very \nbest. He will be the Attorney General for all of us in our country. But \nI also would like to say, to me, this is, in my 10\\1/2\\ years in the \nSenate, as close as I can remember coming to a basic civil rights vote, \na basic human rights vote, and I cannot support John Ashcroft to be \nAttorney General and to head the Justice Department; not on the basis \nof everything I believe in about civil rights and human rights; not on \nthe basis of the younger years of my life; not on the basis of being a \nUnited States Senator from the State of Minnesota who had Senator \nHubert Humphrey, who gave one of the greatest civil rights speeches \never at the 1948 Democratic Party Convention.\n  I am in a State which is a civil rights State. I am from a State \nwhich is a human rights State which passed an ordnance that said there \nshall be no discrimination against people, not only by race but sexual \norientation, for housing, employment--across the board. Therefore, I \nvote the tradition of my State; I vote my own life's work ``no'' to \nthis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy's \n15 minutes be given to Senator Kennedy, the Senator from Massachusetts; \n7\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh; and 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes to the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer; and that Senator \nDaschle's time from 12:45 until 1:15 be given to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the following editorials and \nmaterials regarding the nomination of John Ashcroft be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Dec. 28, 2000]\n\n                         The Joker in the Deck\n\n       We know that George W. Bush would have to appease the \n     Republican Party's ultra-right-wing.\n       By nominating John Ashcroft for attorney general, Bush has \n     delivered, big-time. The booby prize goes to the civil rights \n     and human rights communities.\n       Though Ashcroft's a Missouri Republican--he was attorney \n     general, governor and most recently U.S. Senator--he's a good \n     ol' boy in the old South tradition.\n       ``With the possible exception of Sen. Jesse Helms, I do not \n     believe anyone in the United States Senate has a more abysmal \n     record on civil rights and civil liberties'' said Ralph Neas, \n     president of People for the American Way.\n       Why, Ashcroft was given an honorary degree by the notorious \n     Bob Jones University, the South Carolina school that until \n     recently banned interracial dating.\n       Meanwhile, graycoats still fighting the Civil War (see Tony \n     Horowitz's book, Confederates in the Attic) must have been \n     glad to read the interview in which Ashcroft delivered a \n     strong defense of Southern ``patriots'' like Robert E. Lee, \n     Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson.\n       Does he defend slavery, too?\n       It's scary that this sort of rhetoric fell so recently from \n     the lips of one who, as attorney general, will oversee the \n     FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Services, the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration and federal prisons, prosecutors \n     and marshals. The attorney general is often instrumental in \n     the selection of federal judges as well.\n       Wade Henderson, director of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights, likened Ashcroft's nomination as ``political \n     three card monte.''\n       That's a card game often played by hustlers who scoop up \n     the dollars of suckers convinced that they can pick the right \n     card from among three that the cardsharks shuffle around.\n       In other words, while many were starting to warm up to Bush \n     with his nominations of retired Gen. Colin Powell and \n     Condoleezza Rice as secretary of State and national security \n     advisor, respectively, the real joker in the deck is \n     Ashcroft.\n       ``The issue is not whether a senator will vote against \n     Ashcroft's nomination,'' Henderson said. ``The question is \n     whether the Judiciary Committee will conduct a full and fair \n     confirmation hearing that will allow Ashcroft's complete \n     record and philosophy to be presented to the American \n     people.''\n       There already are clues as to what Ashcroft's tenure at the \n     Justice Department could mean.\n       For example, he opposed President Clinton's nomination of \n     Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's civil rights \n     division. He opposed, unsuccessfully, David Satcher's \n     appointment as Surgeon General.\n       In fact, Ashcroft opposed several of President Clinton's \n     black nominees, especially for the federal bench. He spent \n     two years killing Ronnie White's reputation and elevation to \n     federal judge.\n       Ashcroft claimed that White, the first black on Missouri's \n     Supreme Court, was more committed to criminals than to \n     victims. In fact, in more than 40 of 58 death penalty cases, \n     White upheld the sentence, and when he didn't he often was \n     joined by judges Ashcroft appointed when he was governor.\n       We also know that Ashcroft is committed to the death \n     penalty, and is aggressively opposed to the right of choice \n     in women's decisions about pregnancy.\n       Kate Michelman, of the National Abortion and Reproductive \n     Rights Action League, notes that Ashcroft voted 42 times in \n     the Senate to restrict abortion, and he co-sponsored a bill \n     to outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.\n       Ashcroft often received 100 percent ratings from the \n     American Conservative Union, and zero, or near zero, ratings \n     from civil rights and environmental groups. ``Bush is playing \n     a very sophisticated game of politics and manipulation,'' \n     said Henderson, who noted that, in the federal hierarchy, the \n     attorney general is the crown jewel of the social justice \n     movement.\n       By nominating Ashcroft, Henderson said, the President-elect \n     is showing contempt, ``not unlike the contempt his father \n     showed in an equally important position, the U.S. Supreme \n     Court.'' Under the guise of bringing the best and the \n     brightest, he named Clarence Thomas.\n       ``It's a cruel mockery that speaks volumes about that \n     administration's character and integrity,'' Henderson said.\n       With Ashcroft's history, unless there's an epiphany, I \n     wonder whether he will be able to transcend his own beliefs \n     to enforce the laws of the land--whether he likes them or \n     not.\n       With Ashcroft, George W. Bush confirms many African \n     Americans' worst fears. Moreover, Bush must be listening to \n     those who say he mustn't betray an important GOP base in the \n     name of bipartisanship.\n       Just forget about healing wounds; act like you've got a \n     mandate, Dubya.\n       For this liberal, the best thing about John Ashcroft's \n     nomination is its potential to bring even more blacks and \n     minorities to the polls in 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatcher, Dec. 24, 2000]\n\n                       Mr. Ashcroft and Equality\n\n       There is a case to be made that the Senate should confirm \n     John Ashcroft as attorney general. He has a distinguished \n     record of honest and effective public service. He is a smart \n     lawyer who was a strong state attorney general. And the \n     Senate should give some deference to a new president's \n     Cabinet choices.\n       In addition, Mr. Ashcroft has the institutional tradition \n     of senatorial courtesy on his side. He served in the club and \n     fellow senators will be reluctant to treat him badly.\n       Nevertheless, the Senate should set aside its sensibilities \n     and scrutinize Mr. Ashcroft's record as it relates to the job \n     of attorney general. In particular, it should investigate Mr. \n     Ashcroft's opposition to civil rights, women's rights, \n     abortion rights and to judicial nominees with whom he \n     disagrees.\n       The Ashcroft choice is at odds with President-elect George \n     W. Bush's image as a uniter. When Mr. Ashcroft was running \n     for president in 1998, he said: ``There are voices in the \n     Republican Party today who preach pragmatism, who champion \n     conciliation, who counsel compromise. I stand here today to \n     reject those deceptions.'' So much for compassionate \n     conservatism and bipartisanship.\n       It would be an exaggeration to say Mr. Ashcroft is a \n     racist. It would be an exaggeration to say Mr. Ashcroft is a \n     racist. He recalls that his father, a noted evangelist, \n     urged him as a boy to read Richard Wright's account of the \n     trials of a black youth in ``Black Boy.'' Africans, whom \n     his father had met on church travels, stayed at the family \n     home in segregated Springfield, Mo.\n       But Mr. Ashcroft has built a career out of opposing school \n     desegregation in St. Louis and opposing African-Americans for \n     public office. As attorney general in the 1980s he lobbied \n     White House counselor Edwin Meese III to help persuade the \n     Reagan Justice Department to switch sides and oppose a broad\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\n     school desegregation plan in St. Louis. He eventually \n     succeeded.\n       In the early stages of negotiating the voluntary city-\n     county school desegregation plan in St. Louis, Mr. Ashcroft's \n     office had actually taken a positive role. But Mr. Ashcroft \n     ended up opposing the plan because the state had to pay for \n     it and because he considered it an example of judicial \n     excess. He told the U.S. Supreme Court that he had ``little \n     doubt'' that ``a minority'' would be treated better in court \n     than the state.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's really inexcusable act was riding his \n     opposition to the St. Louis desegregation plan into the \n     governor's mansion. His so-called ``McFlip'' TV ad, accusing \n     Gene McNary of flip-flopping on desegregation, is credited \n     with helping win a tough GOP primary in 1984.\n       Mr. Ashcroft's U.S. Senate record deepens the concern about \n     his attitude toward African-Americans. He tried \n     unsuccessfully to block the appointment of Surgeon General \n     Dr. David Satcher. He scuttled the judicial nomination of \n     Ronnie White of St. Louis. He wrote, in a South Carolina \n     magazine, that, ``traditionalists must do more'' to defend \n     Confederate leaders ``or else we'll be taught that these \n     people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred \n     fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda.'' And he \n     accepted an honorary degree from Bob Jones University in \n     1999. (It's a wonder that Mr. Bush would want to remind \n     anyone of his own disastrous trip there.)\n       Mr. Ashcroft's successful campaign against Mr. White is \n     especially troubling. He opposed Mr. White for having voted \n     as a Missouri Supreme Court judge to overturn death \n     sentences. Mr. Ashcroft neglected to mention that some of his \n     own appointees had voted to overturn as many capital \n     sentences. Retired Missouri Supreme Court Judge Charles \n     Blackmar, a Republican appointee, criticized Mr. Ashcroft at \n     the time, saying: ``The senator seems to take the attitude \n     that any deviation is suspect, liberal, activist and I call \n     this tampering with the judiciary because of the effect it \n     might have in other states . . . where judges, who might hope \n     to be federal judges, feel a pressure to conform and to vote \n     to sustain the death penalty.''\n       Mr. Bush said Friday that he was not worried about the \n     White case because of Mr. Ashcroft's record of appointing \n     African-Americans to the bench. In truth, Mr. Ashcroft had an \n     abysmal record and never appointed a black Supreme Court \n     judge.\n       Mr. Ashcroft favors the most extreme form of a \n     constitutional amendment to ban all abortions. As state \n     attorney general he filed an unsuccessful antitrust suit \n     against the National Organization of Women because of its \n     economic boycott against states that opposed the Equal Rights \n     Amendment. More recently, he has opposed a strong federal \n     hate crimes law and a bill to bar job discrimination against \n     gays.\n       All of which raises the question: Is John Ashcroft the \n     person who should be in charge of the nation's civil rights \n     enforcement? Is John Ashcroft the person to protect women who \n     are harassed on their way into abortion clinics? Is John \n     Ashcroft the right person to screen federal judges? In short, \n     is John Ashcroft's commitment to equal justice deep enough to \n     qualify him to be the nation's chief legal officer?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 23, 2000]\n\n                       Mr. Bush's Rightward Lurch\n\n       The right-wingers who were beginning to feel like \n     wallflowers at George W. Bush's cabinet dance can stop \n     complaining. Mr. Bush, who made his earlier selections from \n     his party's ideological center, threw a big bouquet to the \n     ultraconservatives yesterday when he chose John Ashcroft, the \n     recently deposed Republican senator from Missouri, for the \n     post of attorney general. The nomination later in the day of \n     Christie Whitman, the moderate Republican governor of New \n     Jersey, to run the Environmental Protection Agency tilted the \n     overall composition of Mr. Bush's early choices back toward \n     the center. But that could not mute the widespread dismay \n     over Mr. Bush's troubling choice of Mr. Ashcroft.\n       Mr. Bush is clearly hoping that Mr. Ashcroft's old \n     colleagues will extend him the usual senatorial courtesies \n     and confirm him with little dissent. But Mr. Ashcroft's hard-\n     line ideology and extreme views and actions on issues like \n     abortion and civil rights require a searching examination at \n     his confirmation hearing. He should not be given an automatic \n     pass. The Senate is duty-bound to determine whether he will \n     be able to surmount his cramped social agenda to act as the \n     guardian of the nation's constitutional values.\n       The attorney general has great discretion in deciding how \n     much energy to devote to protecting civil rights, broadening \n     civil liberties, keeping society free of crime, enforcing the \n     antitrust laws and making sure that the president and his \n     cabinet members are held to the same high standards--an area \n     in which the job's present occupant, Janet Reno, has been \n     deficient. More than any other cabinet officer, the attorney \n     general sets the moral tone of an administration.\n       The position should clearly be filled with someone with a \n     reputation for balance, fairness and independence. Mr. \n     Ashcroft is by all accounts honest and hard-working. Yet he \n     is also, judging by the public record, a man of cramped \n     vision, unyielding attitudes and limited tolerance for those \n     who disagree with him. His actions on racial matters alone \n     are enough to give one pause. As Missouri's attorney general, \n     he opposed even a voluntary school desegregation plan in \n     metropolitan St. Louis. He also conducted a mean-spirited and \n     dishonest campaign against Ronnie White, Missouri's first \n     black State Supreme Court justice, when Justice White was \n     nominated for a federal judgeship. Mr. Ashcroft claimed, \n     erroneously, that Justice White was soft on the death \n     penalty. As an added insult, Mr. Ashcroft also accepted an \n     honorary degree last year from Bob Jones University, a \n     bastion of the Christian right with a history of racial \n     discrimination.\n       Mr. Ashcroft has been one of the Senate's most adamant \n     opponents of a woman's right to choose an abortion. During \n     his political career in Missouri, he sought to criminalize \n     abortion, and he has consistently supported an extreme \n     constitutional amendment that would ban abortion even in the \n     case of rape or incest. Mr. Ashcroft has a poor record on \n     church-state issues and on gay rights, and a dismal record on \n     the environment. There is thus reason to wonder how \n     vigorously he will help Mrs. Whitman enforce environmental \n     laws.\n       With Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Bush has offered a far more \n     appealing nominee for high office. His pledge to elevate the \n     E.P.A. post to cabinet level is also commendable. The E.P.A. \n     is no less important than the Interior Department in \n     providing responsible stewardship of the nation's natural \n     resources.\n       On the plus side, Mrs. Whitman seems genuine in caring \n     about the environment, and as a Northeasterner, she is \n     intimately familiar with the problems of polluted air and \n     water. She joined with Gov. George Pataki of New York in \n     lawsuits aimed at curbing the pollution that drifts eastward \n     from Midwestern power plants, and she has worked to protect \n     the New Jersey coastline by investing in sewage treatment and \n     storm drainage projects. Although land conservation is mainly \n     Interior's responsibility, Mrs. Whitman demonstrated a real \n     appreciation for the importance of saving natural resources \n     for future generations when she sponsored a $1 billion open \n     space program, the largest in New Jersey's history.\n       On the minus side, she slashed the budget for environmental \n     law enforcement and stopped levying meaningful fines against \n     big polluters. That pro-business mind-set will be disastrous \n     if continued in her new job, as will her oft-repeated but \n     naive faith in ``voluntary'' compliance with environmental \n     laws. As Mrs. Whitman will discover, there will be times when \n     negotiating skills simply don't suffice. She must be willing \n     to enforce the law in the face of relentless pressure, not \n     only from the big interest groups but from her superiors in \n     the White House.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2000]\n\n                           Building a Cabinet\n\n       President-elect Bush has been assembling a team that for \n     the most part is impressive in stature as well as diversity \n     of race, gender and background. His designation of New Jersey \n     Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to head the Environmental \n     Protection Agency fits that pattern. She has a mixed record \n     on the environment, but on the whole she has pushed to \n     protect open space and to marry economic growth to \n     environmental responsibility. Unfortunately, Gov. Bush also \n     took a step yesterday that was inconsistent with this \n     otherwise constructive performance. John Ashcroft, recently \n     defeated as Missouri senator, has a history out of sync with \n     the Bush rhetoric of inclusiveness. For the crucial post of \n     attorney general, Mr. Bush should have reached higher.\n       Gov. Whitman, in seven years as New Jersey chief executive, \n     won passage of a $1 billion initiative that aims, over the \n     next decade, to save a million acres of open space from \n     development. Clean-air advocates give her credit for backing \n     tough federal air pollution standards and for efforts to \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Jersey. Her \n     administration has strongly supported the new heavy truck and \n     diesel fuel pollution standards the Clinton administration \n     issued this week. She has fought ocean dumping and cleaned up \n     beaches, and she is currently heading a Pew Foundation-funded \n     commission to assess what national steps are needed to \n     protect oceans and marine life.\n       Gov. Whitman's efforts to make New Jersey more business-\n     friendly, particularly in the early days of her \n     administration, earned her sharp criticism from local \n     environmental groups. She was condemned for cutting the staff \n     and budget of the state's environmental agency in her first \n     term and for reducing the reporting requirements on toxic \n     chemical emissions. It will be important for her to make \n     clear in confirmation hearings how she intends to pursue \n     EPA's enforcement mission, but she brings stature and \n     experience to the job. The new administration's posture on \n     the environment will become clearer after Gov. Bush selects \n     his interior and energy chiefs and fills critical sub-Cabinet \n     positions. But Gov. Whitman's appointment, and Gov. Bush's \n     decision to keep the EPA chief in the Cabinet, are positive \n     first steps.\n       Not so the Ashcroft pick. Mr. Ashcroft handled with class \n     and sensitivity his defeat last month by a dead man, the late \n     Gov. Mel Carnahan. But his Senate tenure was marked by hard-\n     right stances on abortion rights, civil liberties and other \n     issues. He fought confirmation of many of President Clinton's \n     judicial nominations, including well-qualified moderates. In \n     the case of Ronnie White, an African American justice of the \n     Missouri Supreme Court whom Mr. Clinton nominated to a \n     District Court vacancy in Mr. Ashcroft's\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\n     state. Mr. Ashcroft rallied the Senate's Republican caucus to \n     defeat the nomination in a manner tinged with racial politics \n     and unfair to the nominee. Gov. Bush campaigned as a \n     conservative, and he should be expected to appoint \n     conservatives to his Cabinet, as he has with impressive \n     choices for the State Department, the Treasury Department and \n     other posts. But the Senate confirmation process should \n     examine whether Mr. Ashcroft's particular brand of \n     conservatism is best suited to the attorney general's post.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just six weeks ago, President Bush \nnominated Senator John Ashcroft to serve as Attorney General of the \nUnited States. Since then, the nomination has been a source of intense \ncontroversy in the Senate and across the nation.\n  At the center of the debate is one basic question--will Senator \nAshcroft enforce the law fairly and vigorously. Today, I will cast my \nvote against Senator Ashcroft, because I believe that he cannot do so.\n  My belief is based on Senator Ashcroft's quarter century track record \nas a relentless opponent of civil rights--as an architect of a \ncontinuing legal strategy to dismantle Roe v. Wade--as an outspoken \nadvocate of extreme Second Amendment rights--and as a harsh and unfair \nopponent of the nominations of well-qualified men and women to \nimportant positions in our government.\n  On the issue of segregation in the schools of St. Louis, Senator \nAshcroft testified before the Judiciary Committee that the State of \nMissouri had done nothing wrong and had not been found guilty of any \nwrongdoing.\n  But that's not true. On numerous occasions, the courts specifically \nfound that the State was responsible for the segregation.\n  Senator Ashcroft testified that he complied with all court orders in \nthe desegregation case.\n  But that's not true. In fact, the court ruled that he had a \ndeliberate policy of defying the court's authority.\n  Senator Ashcroft testified that he never opposed integration.\n  But that's not true. In fact, he referred to the St. Louis voluntary \ndesegregation plan as ``an outrage against human decency.'' And he \nfanned the flames of racial division by campaigning against the \ndesegregation plan in his race for Governor in 1984.\n  On the issue of voter registration, Senator Ashcroft's record as \nGovernor is equally troubling.\n  In heavily white St. Louis County, he endorsed a policy of training \nvolunteers to register voters.\n  But in St. Louis City, which has the State's largest African American \npopulation, he and his appointed election board refused to allow \nvolunteers to be trained to register voters.\n  In fact, he even went so far as Governor to veto 2 bills to use \nvolunteer registrars in the City.\n  As a result there were 1,500 volunteers involved in voter \nregistration in St. Louis County and zero in St. Louis City.\n  After Governor Ashcroft vetoed the two voter registration bills, the \nvoter registration rate in St. Louis dropped by almost 20 percent.\n  With this record, how can anyone believe that Senator Ashcroft will \nbe a champion of voting rights for all Americans, particularly African \nAmericans?\n  Senator Ashcroft testified that Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the \nland, and that he would not try to overturn it.\n  But his record of three decades of non-stop attacks on a woman's \nright to choose tell a different story.\n  As Attorney General of Missouri, he defended a state rule that \nprevented poor women from obtaining abortions that were medically \nnecessary to protect their health. He even tried to prevent Missouri \nnurses from providing basic family planning services.\n  As Governor of Missouri, he continued his intense assault on a \nwoman's right to choose. He made clear that his mission was to have the \nSupreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  He boasted about Missouri's record of having more anti-choice cases \nin the Supreme Court than any state in the Nation.\n  He even proposed legislation to prohibit many common forms of \ncontraception.\n  As a Senator, he has strongly supported a Constitutional Amendment to \nban abortions--even in cases of rape or incest.\n  The power of the Attorney General is vast. The person who holds that \nposition must have a genuine commitment to enforce the law fairly for \nall citizens.\n  But Senator Ashcroft has a deeply disturbing record on issue after \nissue of enormous importance to millions of Americans.\n  Throughout his long career, he has been a relentless opponent of many \nfundamental rights. He's wrong on civil rights--wrong on a woman's \nright to choose--wrong on needed steps to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and children. He's wrong on many other fundamental issues, \nand he's the wrong choice to be Attorney General of the United \nStates. It is wrong to send him to be the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. I intend to vote no.\n\n  I withhold the remainder of my time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I spoke at length yesterday about the \ndeep sense of pain and sadness and fear engendered by this nomination. \nIt has not been an easy few weeks for those who have been involved. \nWhatever the result today, scars remain. There are some scars, of \ncourse, on Senator Ashcroft, but he is a strong and God-fearing man and \nI know he will recover from those and I hope and pray that he does.\n  There are scars on the Senate in terms of our bipartisanship and \nability to work together. Again, I think the desire for bipartisanship \nis strong in this body, and I don't think those scars will be \npermanent. There are some scars from the initial days of the Presidency \nof George Bush, who had campaigned for inclusiveness, bringing people \ntogether. This nomination clearly did not do that, whatever else it has \ndone.\n  Again, most of the other President's nominees, this nomination \nnotwithstanding, have been bipartisan nominees, and hopefully while \nthis is clearly a setback in bringing people together in that \nbipartisanship, it is not going to be a problem.\n  I have made my views known on the floor and in committee as to why \nJohn Ashcroft does not deserve to be our Attorney General, despite his \ncareer in public service, despite his deep faith, and despite the fact \nthat he is seen as an honorable man by most in this body.\n  But I hope one thing. Out of the scar tissue and the divisiveness and \nthe argument we have had, I hope something good comes about, and that \nis this: I hope the President has seen the sadness and the pain and the \nfear engendered by this nomination. I hope when he nominates people to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court we will not have a repeat of what has happened \ntoday. I hope he nominates somebody of intelligence and judicious \ntemperament and devotion to fairness. But I hope he nominates somebody \nwho unites the American people, who brings us together, who is not \nidentified with one extreme faction--either on the far right or the far \nleft.\n  I do not expect George Bush to nominate a liberal to the Supreme \nCourt, but I hope and pray this nomination has taught us that rather \nthan a nomination of somebody on the extreme, when it deals with the \njudicial issues, the legal issues that affect us, it is much better off \nfor either a Democrat or Republican President to nominate a moderate--a \nthoughtful jurist but a moderate.\n  I think what has happened with the Ashcroft nomination in terms of \ndivisiveness would look small compared to the divisiveness that would \noccur if someone of Senator Ashcroft's beliefs were nominated to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  At the end of the day we will all vote what we think is best. We will \neach\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\nvote our conscience. But I think every one of us can take a lesson from \nwhat has happened here in the last few weeks. That lesson is a simple \none. When it comes to enforcing the law, as the Attorney General does, \nwhen it comes to sitting on the highest court of this land, moderation \nis, indeed, a virtue.\n  I hope and pray all of us, including our President, will take from \nthis battle the view that his nominations for the Supreme Court will \nbetter serve the Nation if they come from the middle, from the broad \nmoderate section of our political spectrum.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against Senator Ashcroft. I do that with \nthe conviction that it is the right thing to do in terms of my beliefs, \nin terms of what is good for the people of New York, in terms of what \nis good for the people of America. I hope we will not have to go \nthrough a similar battle when Supreme Court nominees come before us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New York \nfor his words. Could the Chair please advise the Senator from Vermont \nwhat is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time that was allocated to the Senator \nfrom Vermont was reallocated, by unanimous consent, to Senators \nKennedy, Bayh, and Schumer.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. My understanding is the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, will be here presently. To use his \ntime, I will continue under the time reserved to this side. I would \nlike to commend a number of Senators for their contributions to this \nmatter during the day and a half we have been debating it.\n  I believe Senator Kennedy--we just heard him--made extraordinarily \npersuasive, fact-based presentations on some troubling aspects of the \nnominee's background. I hope all Senators listened to the remarks of \nSenator Mikulski, who spoke to the heart of the question and put to \nrest the false charge the Democrats are applying a narrow ideological \nlitmus test. I appreciate the eloquent words of her colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Sarbanes, this morning. In the fashion to which we \nhave become accustomed from Senator Sarbanes, he discussed the history \nof the nomination, including the hearing. I continue to marvel at the \nexpertise of the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, for his \ncomprehensive remarks distilled so wisely and lucidly from the hearing \nrecord. Senator Durbin spent an extraordinary amount of time on this \nduring the hearings. I think the whole Senate benefitted from the \nknowledge he gained from those hearings. Senator Levin presented his \ncharacteristically thoughtful remarks and careful reasoning. I thank \nhim for that.\n  As I said, we heard just now from the senior Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer. Not only did he speak so well on the floor, but all the \nSenate was helped by his thorough work during the hearings and with the \nkind of committee service that distinguished him on the Judiciary \nCommittee both here and in the kind of service he had in the other body \nbefore.\n  We heard the fine remarks of my friend from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman; the forthrightness of Senator Carper; the plain-spoken \neloquence of Senator Stabenow; the statesmanship of Senator Kerry.\n  I think of the words of the distinguished senior Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, who brought to the Senate the important \ncircumstances of his State and his concerns--unique among all of us \nhere.\n  Of course, my friend, the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid \nof Nevada, has given the kind of help he always does in debates. It is \nsomething the public does not see, but he is the glue that holds \neverything together. Then, added to that was his own strong statement \non the floor.\n  I think of Senator Byrd, almost my seatmate in the Senate, with whom \nI served for over a quarter of a century and thank him for sharing his \nviews.\n  I thank my Republican colleagues for their views, those Senators who \nsupported this nomination, as Senator Byrd did.\n  I think about what Senator Harkin said when he spoke again eloquently \ntoday, and Senator Lieberman, who spoke not only about his relationship \nwith Senator Ashcroft but of his own concerns about the issues of \nmorality and of one's upbringing, and Senator Edwards, a person who \nwent from the courtroom to the Senate, and represents the best of both \nplaces.\n  I also commend Senator Hatch, of course, for his management of the \ndebate.\n\n  I yield to the senior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank our leader on this issue on this \nside of the aisle, the senior Senator from Vermont, for the fine, \noutstanding job of leadership and fairness that he has shown throughout \nthese hearings. Every witness who was called on got to testify. We had \nplenty of time to question. All the questions were brought out in a \nfair and strong way, but not in any kind of mean-spirited way. When \nthings began to drift a little bit out of hand, the Senator would wield \nhis big gavel that he had at the beginning of the hearing and his own \npersonal gavel that he wielded throughout. He did a wonderful job. And \nof course his speeches on the floor and in committee have been among \nthe most thoughtful, erudite, and well researched of all of them. I \nthink I speak for all of us on the Judiciary Committee and in the \nSenate as a whole: We really thank the senior Senator for the great job \nhe has done during these trying weeks.\n  I yield to the senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New York. I have often said how \nmuch I enjoyed being on the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the \nreasons is that the Senator from New York serves there.\n  It is a committee where we often have spirited debates. We usually \ndebate the most interesting issues before the Senate, but I rely more \nand more on the Senator from New York to boil down the essence of the \narguments and to lead that debate.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Utah is not on the floor at the moment, \nbut the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I worked very hard to put \ntogether a hearing where both sides could be heard. I believe we did \nthat. In fact, unlike the usual practice here, both sides had the same \nnumber of witnesses. If I recall, in this case, the minority side, the \nRepublican side, actually had one more witness. But we tried to make \nsure that anybody who could add anything to the debate and should be \nheard was heard.\n  Even during the hearings, we actually had people who were added at \nthe last minute at the request of Senator Hatch. He showed unfailing \ncourtesy throughout all that, and I thank him for that.\n  I see the Senator from Indiana in the Chamber. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following editorials and materials with regard to the \nAshcroft nomination be printed in the Record:\n  A column by Steve Neal from the Chicago Sun-Times of January 31, \n2001;\n  An editorial from the Christian Science Monitor of today, February 1, \n2001;\n  An editorial from the Rutland Daily Herald of January 24, 2001;\n  A column by Stuart Taylor from National Journal of January 13, 2001;\n  A column by Stuart Taylor from National Journal of October 10, 1999; \nand\n  An op-ed by Benjamin Wittes from Washington Post of October 13, 1999.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 1, 2001]\n\n                         Ashcroft's Tough Tasks\n\n       President Bush asked the Senate to look into the hearts of \n     each of his cabinet nominees. Through careful, albeit \n     contentious, hearings for his nominee for attorney general, \n     John Ashcroft, the Senate tried to do just that.\n       In those hearings, Americans got a first, strong taste of \n     the rancor that can occur when the Senate, and the country, \n     is split right down the middle on social issues. The \n     controversy over Mr. Ashcroft's nomination broke along \n     clearly partisan lines.\n       Ashcroft may now be confirmed by the Senate, but the \n     Democrats have fired a warning shot over the Bush ship of \n     state. Their message: Expect more battles over conservative \n     legal appointments--to the Supreme Court or elsewhere.\n       Ashcroft's deeply conservative views on abortion, civil \n     rights, and guns were subjected to extraordinarily close \n     scrutiny by\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\n     Democrats and liberal groups. Still, his critics were left \n     unsatisfied.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's \n     ranking Democrat, summarized much of the concern over Mr. \n     Ashcroft's candor when he spoke on the Senate floor this \n     week: ``Most of us in this body have known the old John \n     Ashcroft. During the hearings, we met a new John Ashcroft. \n     Were the demurrals of his testimony real, or were they \n     delicate bubbles that could burst and evaporate a year or a \n     month or a day from now under the reassertion of his long-\n     held beliefs?''\n       The core issue is whether, as attorney general, Ashcroft \n     will put his own ideology above the law.\n       Supporters, such as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R) of Iowa, say \n     Ashcroft has demonstrated the integrity to maintain his ``by-\n     the-book approach to governing'' as he goes about cleaning up \n     a Justice Department he and others feel has lacked integrity.\n       The new attorney general's adherence to that standard will \n     be closely watched. As he promised the committee, he'll have \n     to ``vigorously'' uphold the laws of the land whether he \n     personally agrees with them or not--including the Supreme \n     Court's decision legalizing abortion, Roe v. Wade, which \n     Ashcroft acknowledged as ``settled law.''\n       Testimony regarding Ashcroft's opposition to the \n     appointment of a black Missouri judge to the federal bench \n     was particularly disturbing. The judge, Ronnie White, said \n     then-Senator Ashcroft distorted his record, calling him \n     ``pro-criminal,'' based on his interpretation of a few of \n     Judge White's written decisions.\n       Even if Ashcroft's motives at the time were political, not \n     racial, the episode leaves doubts about his judgment among \n     African-Americans and others.\n       Ashcroft will have to work especially hard to surmount both \n     his critics and some elements of his own record, and to prove \n     to the country that he will be, as Senator Leahy said, an \n     attorney general ``for all the people.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Jan. 31, 2001]\n\n                      Some More Equal Than Others\n\n                            (By Steve Neal)\n\n       The attorney general is supposed to represent all of us.\n       That's what is so troubling about John Ashcroft's \n     nomination to be the chief law enforcement officer of this \n     country.\n       Some of our more distinguished attorneys general served in \n     Republican administrations. Edward Levi restored integrity in \n     the Justice Department after Watergate. Elliot Richardson \n     showed great principle in resigning when Richard M. Nixon \n     ordered him to fire the special prosecutor investigating \n     Nixon's role in the scandal that brought down his presidency. \n     Herbert Brownell drafted the first civil rights law since \n     Reconstruction and recommended the use of federal troops when \n     the governor of Arkansas sought to block integration of \n     Central High School in Little Rock.\n       Each of these three men was committed to equal justice \n     under the law. Ashcroft doesn't meet that standard. Though he \n     is a person of ability and intelligence, his public record is \n     one of unfairness, intolerance and exclusion.\n       His role in sinking the nomination of Missouri Supreme \n     Court Justice Ronnie White for the federal bench was \n     disgraceful. Ashcroft twisted and distorted White's judicial \n     record. The Judiciary Committee, which had a GOP majority at \n     the time of White's nomination, recommended his confirmation. \n     Then Ashcroft waged a mean-spirited crusade that destroyed \n     White's chances. He was dishonest in labeling White's \n     judicial philosophy as ``pro-criminal'' and claiming that he \n     had ``a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' There is \n     no evidence that Ashcroft went after the African-American \n     judge because of his race. It is more likely that he attacked \n     White as part of his re-election strategy.\n       Ashcroft's record on civil rights, though, is alarming. As \n     governor and attorney general of Missouri, he bitterly \n     opposed court-ordered school desegregation in Kansas City and \n     St. Louis. More than two decades after the Brown vs. Board of \n     Education ruling made equal access to public education the \n     law, Ashcroft still was making the argument that it was \n     better to have segregated schools. As a candidate for \n     statewide office, he fanned racial tensions with his shrill \n     attacks on school integration. He didn't seem to care that \n     African-American youngsters were being denied an equal \n     education.\n       As governor of Missouri, he vetoed legislation that would \n     have boosted voter registration in minority communities. He \n     claimed that the proposed law would have led to voter fraud. \n     If he is confirmed as the next attorney general, he would \n     have responsibility for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.\n       During his Senate testimony, Ashcroft said that he would \n     not attempt to undermine Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court \n     decision that upheld a woman's legal right to have an \n     abortion. But he has spent his entire public career trying to \n     outlaw abortions or make them impossible to obtain. He is \n     opposed to abortion even in cases of rape or incest.\n       ``Both now and in my first term as [Missouri] attorney \n     general,'' he told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in \n     1981, ``I have devoted considerable time and significant \n     resources to defending the right of the state to limit the \n     dangerous impacts of Roe vs. Wade, a case in which a handful \n     of men on the Supreme Court arbitrarily amended the \n     Constitution and overturned the laws of the states related to \n     abortions.'' Ashcroft has previously referred to the Roe \n     decision as ``error-ridden.'' Most Americans disagree with \n     that viewpoint.\n       In his written response to the Judiciary committee, he \n     vowed not to re-fight these battles because the issue had \n     been settled ``through the passage of time and reaffirmation \n     by the Supreme Court.'' But he never has stopped trying to \n     reverse this landmark decision.\n       Ashcroft was misguided in his assault on the nomination of \n     the openly gay James C. Hormel to be ambassador to \n     Luxembourg. ``Based on the totality of Mr. Hormel's record of \n     public positions and advocacy, I did not believe he would \n     effectively represent the United States in Luxembourg, the \n     most Roman Catholic country in all of Europe,'' he said in \n     1998.\n       Based on the totality of Mr. Ashcroft's record, he is less \n     than committed to equal protection under the law. This cold-\n     hearted man is unfit to be the people's lawyer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Jan. 24, 2001]\n\n                             No to Ashcroft\n\n       Democrats should not be shy about voting against John \n     Ashcroft when his nomination for attorney general comes \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the Senate \n     floor.\n       If they are afraid of being tarred as partisan extremists \n     for opposing Ashcroft's nomination, they ought to recognize \n     that Bush's decision to appoint Ashcroft was in itself an \n     unapologetic partisan action.\n       The Senate almost never rejects a president's cabinet \n     nominee, and the vote count suggests it will not reject \n     Ashcroft. It would be an extraordinary turn of events if it \n     did.\n       That's because Senate Republicans are lined up unanimously \n     on the side of their party and their president. That includes \n     Sen. James Jeffords, who is a member of a vocal quartet with \n     Ashcroft and who plans to endorse his appointment.\n       This is not one of those moments when the Senate's moderate \n     Republicans are inclined to stray from the party line. On \n     other issues--campaign finance, tax cuts, missile defense--\n     the Republican leadership will not be able to rely so surely \n     on unanimity within the party.\n       Ashcroft's nomination has also won the support of a few \n     Democrats, which assures him of victory in the Senate. But \n     for most Democrats, a no vote on the Ashcroft nomination \n     sends an important signal: that bipartisan progress is not \n     achieved by pushing the most extreme brand of Republican \n     ideology.\n       Under questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     Ashcroft felt compelled to repudiate an ideology opposed to \n     civil and women's rights. One wonders why Bush appointed him \n     if it meant he would have to shed the views that have shaped \n     his career. The likely reason is that Bush wanted to appease \n     the religious right.\n       Everyone was quick to praise Ashcroft's integrity and to \n     deny that he was a racist. But what kind of integrity is \n     involved in the attempt to smear another person's reputation, \n     as he did with Ronnie White, a judge who had been appointed \n     to the federal bench?\n       In many areas, Democrats are likely to cooperate with \n     Republicans for the sake of bipartisan achievement. It \n     appears that Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Edward Kennedy are \n     willing to work with Bush to put together an education \n     package. And Bush appears willing to court Democratic support \n     by gearing his education package toward low-income students.\n       In the same vein, Republicans such as Jeffords should be \n     willing to break the party line for the sake of campaign \n     finance reform, health care, and other initiatives that the \n     Republican leadership has long opposed.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee was able to win concessions \n     from Ashcroft on civil rights and women's rights, but his \n     work as attorney general will involve far more than the high-\n     profile issues on which the interest groups always focus.\n       He will help shape anti-trust policy and the government's \n     position on the Microsoft case. He will help shape policy on \n     juvenile justice, which has been slipping back toward the \n     dark ages, and on sentencing policy, which has become \n     dangerously rigid because of mandatory sentences. He will \n     apportion resources within the Department of Justice, \n     deciding how much emphasis to put on civil rights \n     enforcement.\n       In electing a Republican, Vermonters might have expected \n     that Jeffords would maintain party loyalty in instances such \n     as the Ashcroft nomination. Jeffords will have many other \n     opportunities to show his independence, and Vermonters will \n     be watching.\n       In electing a Democrat, Vermonters expect Leahy to uphold \n     civil and women's rights. In voting no on Ashcroft, he will \n     be affirming that even with a Republican president, these \n     values should not be allowed to erode.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Journal, Jan. 13, 2001]\n\n          A Character Assassin Should Not Be Attorney General\n\n                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)\n\n       Former Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., is an able and \n     accomplished man who won the respect of many Senate \n     colleagues in both parties. But he is unfit to be Attorney \n     General. The reason is that during an important debate on a \n     sensitive matter, then-Sen. Ashcroft abused the power of his \n     office by descending to demagoguery, dishonesty, and \n     character assassination.\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\n       The debate was over President Clinton's nomination of \n     Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to become a federal \n     district judge. Although too liberal to be picked by a \n     Republican President, White had shown himself to be an \n     honest, skilled, and sometimes eloquent jurist, well within \n     the moderate mainstream. But Ashcroft, leaning hard on \n     Republican Senators who would otherwise have voted to \n     confirm, engineered a 54-45 party-line vote on Oct. 5, 1999, \n     to reject White's nomination. Worse, Ashcroft claimed on the \n     Senate floor that Judge White had ``a serious bias against . \n     . . the death penalty''; that he was ``pro-criminal and \n     activist, [and would] push law in a pro-criminal direction''; \n     and that he had ``a tremendous bent toward criminal \n     activity.'' The first statement was a wild exaggeration. The \n     second was a demagogic distortion. The third was a malicious \n     smear.\n       Ashcroft is not the man to head the Justice Department. The \n     job is vested with such vast authority over the lives of \n     people great and small, and such symbolic importance, that \n     the minimum qualifications should include honesty, fair-\n     mindedness, and judicious self-restraint in the exercise of \n     power. Every new President is entitled to Senate deference in \n     choosing his Cabinet, even when the nominee's policy views \n     draw bitter liberal or conservative opposition. (Linda Chavez \n     might have become a distinguished Labor Secretary but for her \n     sad mistake of failing to tell Bush vetters up front what \n     they needed to know about her illegal-immigrant issue.) But \n     no President is entitled to put a character assassin in \n     charge of law enforcement.\n       All this would be true even if Judge White were white, if \n     Ashcroft had not expressed such fondness for the Confederacy, \n     if race were not an issue, and if Ashcroft were in tune with \n     the Bush pledge to be a uniter, not a divider. But White is \n     black. The racial context makes Ashcroft's orchestration of a \n     floor vote against a judicial nominee, the first since 1987 \n     (when Robert H. Bork's Supreme Court nomination went down), \n     all the more deplorable. And Ashcroft's confrontational \n     advocacy of absolutist views makes him a divider, not a \n     uniter.\n       This is not to endorse the unfounded and tiresomely \n     irresponsible suggestions by some liberal critics that \n     Ashcroft's attacks on Judge White were motivated by racial \n     bias or hostility to antidiscrimination laws. Nor is it to \n     join the claque who would fight any conservative nominee for \n     Justice as racially insensitive and divisive. But it does \n     appear that Ashcroft was deliberately engaging in \n     inflammatory racial politics--in part to boost his own 2000 \n     re-election prospects by hanging the ``pro-criminal'' label \n     both on Judge White and on then-Gov. Mel Carnahan, who had \n     appointed White and was gunning for Ashcroft's Senate seat. \n     Ashcroft must have known that accusing a black judge \n     (falsely) of being ``pro-criminal'' and of ``a tremendous \n     bent toward criminal activity'' would stir the worst \n     instincts of those voters who stereotype criminality as \n     black.\n       One result of Ashcroft's reckless roiling of racial \n     tensions is that he would have especially low credibility \n     with the vast majority of African-Americans, including \n     moderates and conservatives who eschew the race-baiting \n     rhetoric of victimologists such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \n     Indeed, people who hope to see the Justice Department move \n     away from its long-standing advocacy of race-based \n     affirmative action preferences (as I do) should wonder: Can \n     John Ashcroft be a credible advocate of making the law more \n     color-blind? I doubt it.\n       Deceptive rhetoric aside, is Ronnie White soft on crime? \n     Not unless one equates measured concern for civil liberties \n     with softness. According to Justice Department numbers, \n     White, as of October 1999, had voted to uphold 41 (almost 70 \n     percent) of the 59 death sentences he had reviewed. He voted \n     to reverse the other 18, including 10 that were unanimously \n     reversed and just three in which he was the only dissenter. \n     (Some say that White reviewed 61 death sentences and voted to \n     reverse 20.) His rate of affirmance was only marginally lower \n     than the 75 percent to 81 percent averages of the five \n     current Missouri Supreme Court judges whom Ashcroft himself \n     appointed when he was governor.\n       Ashcroft stressed that Judge White had dissented from \n     decisions affirming death sentences four times as often as \n     any Ashcroft-appointed colleague. True. But does this suggest \n     that White would ``push law in a pro-criminal direction,'' as \n     Ashcroft said--or that Ashcroft appointees were rubber-\n     stamping unfair trials?\n       The two dissents most directly assailed by Ashcroft in fact \n     exude moderation and care in dealing with the tension between \n     crime-fighting and civil liberties. In a 1998 decision, the \n     majority upheld the murder convictions and death sentence of \n     a previously law-abiding Vietnam veteran named James Johnson, \n     who had suddenly turned violent. He stalked and killed a \n     sheriff, two deputies, and another sheriff's wife in a \n     horrifying succession of shootings that erupted out of a \n     domestic dispute. The only defense was insanity. The \n     immediate issue was whether Johnson should get a new trial, \n     after which he would either go back to death row or be locked \n     up in a mental hospital.\n       If Johnson ``was in control of his faculties when he went \n     on this murderous rampage,'' Judge White wrote, ``then he \n     assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given.'' But the \n     jury's consideration of the insanity defense had been skewed \n     by an egregious blunder. Johnson's court-appointed attorney \n     had begun by stressing that a rope-and-tin-can ``perimeter'' \n     around Johnson's garage was evidence that he had been under a \n     delusion that he was back in Vietnam, at war. This was a gift \n     to the prosecution, which blew the back-in-Vietnam strategy \n     to bits by showing that the police had set up the perimeter.\n       Both Judge White and his colleagues faulted the defense \n     attorney (for inadequate investigation) as well as the \n     prosecution (for leaving the defense attorney with a false \n     impression of the facts). They differed only on whether there \n     was a ``reasonable probability'' that the jury might \n     otherwise have found Johnson insane. The majority said no. \n     Judge White said yes. His conclusion was plausible, \n     debatable, highly unpopular (especially among police), and \n     (for that reason) courageous. For Ashcroft to call it ``pro-\n     criminal'' was obscene.\n       In the second case, one Brian Kinder was sentenced to die \n     for a heinous rape-murder. Judge White's ``only basis'' for \n     voting to give Kinder a new trial, Ashcroft claimed, was that \n     the trial judge had said he was ``opposed to affirmative \n     action.'' False. In fact, Judge White's dissent termed that \n     comment (made in a campaign press release) ``irrelevant to \n     the issue of bias.'' Instead he stressed another, \n     ``indefensibly racist'' assertion in which the trial judge \n     had contrasted ``minorities'' with ``hard-working \n     taxpayers.'' This cast grave doubt on the impartiality of a \n     judge who was to try a black man for murder in just six days, \n     Judge White concluded. His dissent was far more candid and \n     convincing than the majority opinion.\n       Pro-criminal? Some police groups, including 77 of \n     Missouri's 114 sheriffs, criticized Judge White's record. But \n     other law enforcement officials praised him as a good judge \n     and ``an upright, fine individual,'' in the words of Carl \n     Wolf, president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association.\n       The smearing of Judge White makes the many testimonials to \n     Ashcroft's integrity ring a bit hollow. But quite apart from \n     that episode, it was most unwise for President-elect Bush to \n     choose Ashcroft for Attorney General. The reason is that \n     Ashcroft is an uncompromising absolutist with a bellicose \n     approach to issues ranging from gay rights and gun control to \n     abortion (which would be a crime, if Ashcroft had his way, \n     even in cases of rape and incest). He is also dead wrong (in \n     my view) on major issues, including his aggressive push to \n     cram even more nonviolent, small-time offenders who pose no \n     threat to society into our prison-industrial complex, which \n     has already mushroomed to 2 million inmates.\n       What would I be saying if it were President-elect Al Gore \n     trying to put the Justice Department under (say) Sen. Edward \n     Kennedy, D-Mass.--who smeared another judicial nominee (in \n     1987) by saying: ``Robert Bork's America is a land in which \n     women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would \n     sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break \n     down citizens' doors in midnight raids .  .  .''\n       I would be saying that a character assassin should not be \n     Attorney General. How about you?\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Journal, Oct. 16, 1999]\n\n                   The Shame of The Ronnie White Vote\n\n                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)\n\n       The Democratic spin is that the Republican Senate's Oct. 5 \n     party-line vote, 54-45, to reject Ronnie L. White's \n     nomination for a U.S. District Court seat in Missouri was \n     tinged with racism. At the very least, as President Clinton \n     put it, the vote adds ``credence to the perceptions that they \n     treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and \n     unequally.''\n       The Republican spin is, not surprisingly, quite different. \n     In the words of White's main critic, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-\n     Mo., White's record as a Missouri Supreme Court judge is \n     ``pro-criminal and activist,'' and exudes a serious bias \n     against * * * the death penalty,'' even ``a tremendous bent \n     toward criminal activity,'' Indeed, said Sen. Don Nickles, R-\n     Okla. ``many'' Republican Senators ``didn't know what race \n     Judge White is.''\n       Which is the closer to the truth?\n       Numbers supply part of the answer. Judge White has voted to \n     uphold 70 percent (41) of the 59 death sentences he has \n     reviewed, while voting to reverse the other 18, including 10 \n     that were unanimously reversed and three in which he was the \n     only dissenter. That's a bit below the 75 percent to 81 \n     percent averages of the five current Missouri Supreme Court \n     judges whom Ashcroft himself appointed when he was Governor, \n     according to numbers compiled by the Missouri Democratic \n     Party. It's well above the 53 percent average of Elwood \n     Thomas, the now-deceased Ashcroft appointee whom White \n     replaced in 1995.\n       As for race, the raw fact is that the Senate's rejection of \n     the 46-year-old White--the first black person ever to sit on \n     the Missouri Supreme Court--was its first floor vote against \n     any judicial nominee since 1987, when the Senate spurned \n     Robert H. Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court. But Democrats are \n     quick to cite statistics showing that the Senate has \n     confirmed a substantially smaller percentage of Clinton's \n     minority judicial nominees than of his white nominees--while \n     taking longer to bring their nominations to a vote. Some \n     Republicans claim that a higher percentage of Clinton's \n     minority nominees are liberal activists. Perhaps that's true. \n     But does Ronnie White fit that bill?\n       Consider White's two lone death-penalty dissents \n     specifically criticized by Ashcroft. One involved a rape-\n     murder for which one\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\n     Brian Kinder was sentenced to die. Judge White's ``only \n     basis'' for voting to give Kinder a new trial, Ashcroft told \n     his colleagues, was that Earl R. Blackwell, the trial judge, \n     had said he was ``opposed to affirmative action.''\n       This was a cynical distortion. In fact, White's dissent \n     stated that Judge Black-well's criticism of affirmative \n     action--which came in a campaign press release explaining his \n     decision to leave the Democratic Party--was ``irrelevant to \n     the issue of bias.'' What was ``indefensibly racist,'' he \n     continued, was the following assertion in Blackwell's press \n     release:\n       ``While minorities need to be represented or [sic] course, \n     I believe the time has come for us to place much more \n     emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this \n     country.''\n       As White wrote, this ``pernicious racial stereotype * * * \n     is not ambiguous or complex (nor, unfortunately, original).'' \n     It means ``that minorities are not hard-working taxpayers.''\n       And for Judge Blackwell to issue such a statement--six days \n     before he was to begin the trial of a black man facing the \n     death penalty--``created a reasonable suspicion that he could \n     not preside over the case impartially.''\n       Judge White was right. And his eloquent dissent was both \n     more candid and more consistent with his court's own \n     precedents than was the majority opinion.\n       Ashcroft also assailed White's dissent from a 1998 decision \n     upholding the murder convictions and death sentence of \n     one James Johnson. In an appalling succession of shootings \n     growing out of a domestic dispute at Johnson's home, the \n     previously law abiding Vietnam veteran had stalked and \n     killed a sheriff, two deputies, and the wife of another \n     sheriff. His only defense was insanity.\n       ``If Mr. Johnson was in control of his faculties when he \n     went on this murderous rampage, then he assuredly deserves \n     the death sentence he was given,'' Judge White wrote. But a \n     blunder by Johnson's defense lawyer, White added, had so \n     ``utterly destroyed the credibility'' of his insanity defense \n     as to deny him a fair trial.\n       In his opening statement, the defense lawyer had focused on \n     a story that Johnson--who claimed to have no memory of what \n     he had done--had strung a ``perimeter'' of rope and cans \n     around his garage under the delusion that he was ``back in \n     Vietnam,'' in combat. This scenario was soon exposed as \n     fiction: The prosecution revealed with a flourish that the \n     ``perimeter'' had been the work of police staking out \n     Johnson's home after the killings.\n       The majority and Judge White alike faulted both the defense \n     lawyer (for inadequate investigation) and the state (for \n     leaving him with a false impression of the facts). They \n     differed on whether there was a ``reasonable probability'' \n     that, but for these unprofessional lapses, the jury might \n     have upheld the insanity defense. The majority said no; Judge \n     White--noting that Johnson's homicidal conduct suggested at \n     least ``something akin to madness''--said yes.\n       I'm not sure whether he was right. But it surely was a case \n     on which reasonable judges could disagree.\n       And in another such case, in 1996, it was Judge White who \n     wrote the court's decision upholding a brutal killer's death \n     sentence--and it was an Ashcroft appointee, then Chief Judge \n     John C. Holstein, who dissented. The cornerstone of any \n     civilized system of justice,'' Holstein wrote then, ``is that \n     the rules are applied evenly to everyone, no matter how \n     despicable the crime.''\n       That does not seem to be the view of many Senate \n     Republicans now. Their treatment of Ronnie White suggests \n     that they prefer judges to rubber-stamp the decisions of \n     trial judges, prosecutors, and police.\n       Sen. Ashcroft also stressed criticism of White's record by \n     police groups, including 77 of Missouri's 114 sheriffs. This \n     may help explain why the state's other Republican Senator, \n     Christopher S. Bond, joined Ashcroft in opposing Judge White \n     on the floor--after having introduced him to the Judiciary \n     Committee last year as ``a man of the highest integrity and \n     honor,'' with the ``qualifications and character traits'' to \n     be a federal judge.\n       But it turns out that Ashcroft himself orchestrated some of \n     the police opposition. He faces a tough re-election battle \n     next year and seems to be running as Mr. Death Penalty \n     against the man who appointed Judge White--Democratic Gov. \n     Mel Carnahan. (Carnahan also supports the death penalty.)\n       Ashcroft urged at least two police groups to oppose White, \n     according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Carl Wolf, \n     president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association, told the \n     newspaper that Ashcroft's office had called to solicit his \n     opposition. Wolf declined because his group does not comment \n     on judicial nominations. Besides, he said: ``I really have a \n     hard time seeing that [White's] against law enforcement. I've \n     always known him to be an upright, fine individual.''\n       In short, the record shows that Judge White takes seriously \n     his duty both to enforce the death penalty and to ensure that \n     defendants get fair trials. It suggests neither that he's \n     ``pro-criminal'' nor that he's a liberal activist. What it \n     does suggest is courage.\n       And while White may be more sensitive to civil liberties \n     than his Ashcroft appointed colleagues are, his opinions also \n     exude a spirit of moderation, care, and candor.\n       Would the Republicans who voted against Ronnie White--most \n     of them in deference to Ashcroft and Bond--have treated an \n     otherwise identical white nominee any better?\n       I doubt it. But by giving such transparently bogus reasons \n     for trashing a nominee who happens to be black--at a time \n     when statistics have already raised troubling questions about \n     the Senate's handling of minority nominees--Republicans \n     provoked suspicious not only among those who are profligate \n     in flinging charges of racism, but also among many fair-\n     minded people.\n       And those who claimed to have been ignorant of White's race \n     compounded insensitivity with obtuseness. Even if true, this \n     shows that they went into the first floor vote in 12 years to \n     reject a judicial nominee without listening to what their \n     Democratic colleagues were saying or learning anything about \n     the nominee's admirable life story.\n       In an era of politicized law, as I wrote recently, the best \n     antidote for partisan gridlock over judicial nominees is for \n     Presidents to shun ideological crusaders and choose moderate \n     centrists. That's what President Clinton did here. And that's \n     why--race aside--the Senate's vote and the smearing of Judge \n     White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 13, 1999]\n\n                          Judge White's Judges\n\n                          (By Benjamin Wittes)\n\n       Anyone who believes that race played no role in the \n     Senate's rejection last week of the judicial nomination of \n     Ronnie White should read the case of Missouri v. Kinder. Sen. \n     John Ashcroft, the Missouri Republican who led the fight to \n     kill White's nomination to a federal district court vacancy \n     in his state, cited Kinder on the Senate floor as one of \n     three cases that showed not merely White's hostility to the \n     death penalty but his ``tremendous bent toward criminal \n     activity.''\n       Ashcroft described White--the first African American to \n     serve on Missouri's Supreme Court--as willing to grant a new \n     trial to a clearly guilty rapist and murderer who had been \n     sentenced to death, because ``the trial judge had indicated \n     that he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties \n     based on that.'' This charge, if true, would indeed be \n     evidence that White had placed politics before the law. But \n     it is a gross distortion. The reality is that by using \n     White's well-reasoned dissent in Kinder as a cudgel against \n     him, Ashcroft provided as clear an example of racial politics \n     infecting the nomination process as one could ever hope to \n     see.\n       Brian Kinder was tried in the court of an elected judge \n     named Earl R. Blackwell, At the time of the trial, Blackwell \n     was facing a reelection campaign. Six days before Kinder's \n     trial was to begin, Blackwell announced in a press release \n     that he was switching parties because he found ``repugnant'' \n     the Democratic Party's ``reverse-discriminatory quotas and \n     affirmative action.''\n       The politics of the statement were not the problem. The \n     problem was its all-but-overt racism: ``The truth is that I \n     have noticed in recent years that the Democrat party places \n     far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as \n     homosexuals, people who don't want to work, and people with a \n     skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need \n     to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for \n     us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-\n     working taxpayers in this country.''\n       Faced with a judge who had just gone on the record \n     contrasting minorities with hard-working taxpayers, Kinder--\n     an unemployed black man--asked Blackwell to recuse himself. \n     The judge refused, saying he did not discriminate whether \n     individuals ``are yellow, red, white, black or polka dot.'' \n     Kinder, after his conviction, appealed, arguing that the \n     trial was invalid because recusal should have been mandatory.\n       The surprising thing about this case is not that Ronnie \n     White voted to reverse the conviction but that he was the \n     only member of the Missouri Supreme Court--several of whose \n     judges were appointed by Ashcroft when he was the state's \n     governor--to stand up for the principle that a minority \n     defendant is entitled to a trial before a judge who does not \n     make public slurs against minority groups. Like Ashcroft, the \n     court majority pretended Blackwell was merely making a \n     political statement against affirmative action and concluded \n     merely making a political statement against affirmative \n     action and concluded that ``we do not agree that the \n     statements in the press release . . . would cause a \n     reasonable person to question the impartiality of the \n     court.''\n       White, in an opinion characterized by admirable restraint, \n     cut through this nonsense. ``No honest reading of \n     [Blackwell's statement] can show that it says anything other \n     than what it says: that minorities are not hard-working \n     taxpayers,'' he wrote. ``I doubt that any reasonable person \n     would think that a judge who makes provocative comments in a \n     campaign press release . . . would be able to scrupulously \n     set aside those views just because the judge dons a robe.'' \n     Because of this appearance problem, he argued, recusal was \n     required. And ``since the judge here failed to sustain the \n     motion that he recuse himself, Mr. Kinder must receive a new \n     trial before a judge whose impartiality is beyond reproach.''\n       As a general matter, the White House and its allies \n     overstate the claim that minority and women nominees are \n     discriminated against in the confirmation process. Having \n     looked at many nominations, I am convinced that white men \n     with histories and records similar to those of the women and \n     minority\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\n     nominees who get bogged down in the Senate would also have \n     problems. And race, to be sure, was not the predominant \n     factor in White's rejection, either. The politics of the \n     death penalty and the 2000 Missouri Senate race have that \n     dishonor.\n       But if White was not rejected because he's black, it is \n     also impossible to read racial politics out of his rejection. \n     Consider what would have happened had White and Kinder both \n     been Jewish and had Kinder been tried before a judge who had \n     issued a press release denouncing the political parties' \n     support for Israel that included analogous language: ``While \n     Jews need to be represented, of course, I believe the time \n     has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on \n     moral people who are not obsessed with money.''\n       No senator would dare argue that an appeals court judge who \n     insisted that such overt hostility to Jews compelled a new \n     trial--even for a guilty defendant--should be kept off the \n     federal bench for having done so. To argue that the Kinder \n     case is reason to keep Ronnie White off the bench is no less \n     outrageous--just a little more socially acceptable.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I convey my thanks and \ngratitude to my colleague from Vermont for his extraordinary leadership \non this matter of utmost public importance. He has written another \nhonorable chapter in the history of this body, and I am privileged to \nserve with him, as was my father privileged to serve before me.\n  I rise today as someone who was invited to Austin, TX, several weeks \nbefore the new year to discuss with our new President the cause of \nbipartisanship when it comes to improving the quality of our public \nschools.\n  I rise as someone who was in the White House several nights ago to \ndiscuss with the President bipartisanship when it comes to improving \nthe quality of health care.\n  I rise as someone who wants to work with this President to enact a \nfiscally responsible tax cut.\n  I rise as someone who shares his conviction that faith-based \norganizations have much to contribute to the welfare and well-being of \nour country.\n  I rise as someone who deplores the gridlock in recent years and \npolitics of personal destruction and yearns to return to bipartisanship \nand principled compromise for the sake of the United States of America.\n  Because of all these things and all we can accomplish together, I \nalso rise to express my opposition to the President's nomination of \nJohn Ashcroft to be the next Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Let me say at the beginning I do not believe in pointing fingers or \ncalling names. Some of the things that have been said about Mr. \nAshcroft, such as he is a racist, are, frankly, not true, and unfair, \nand for that I have deep regret. We need more civility in this town. \nFrankly, I wished Mr. Ashcroft himself practiced more civility when he \nhad the privilege of gracing this Chamber. But he is the wrong man for \nthis job.\n  He is the wrong man for several reasons: First, the unique character \nof the Justice Department. Mr. Ashcroft has said he will enforce the \nlaw, and I am sure that is true, but it begs the central question: What \ndoes Mr. Ashcroft consider the law to be? The law is not carved in \nstone and not subject to difference of opinion or dispute. Very able \nlawyers can have heated differences of opinion about what the law \nmeans, and in the Justice Department each and every day, hundreds of \ndecisions, or thousands of decisions, will be made--some of which the \npublic will never be aware--about which there are varying \ninterpretations of the law. What will happen in those cases? It will be \nMr. Ashcroft's interpretation; it will be Mr. Ashcroft's discretion; it \nwill be Mr. Ashcroft's law that will be put into effect for the \nAmerican people.\n  I have no doubt whatsoever that he will bring some of his more \nstrident views to bear on that office in ways that will cause great \nconflict and controversy for this President and the people of our \ncountry.\n  I think about the Supreme Court. We are not dealing with a Supreme \nCourt nominee here, but before my colleagues cast their vote, I ask how \nthey would vote if Mr. Ashcroft had been nominated for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States because, in many ways, the Attorney General \nhas as much or more discretion as does a member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. At least before a decision of the Supreme Court is handed down, \na Justice must get four of his or her colleagues to agree. Very often, \nthe Attorney General of the United States can make unilateral decisions \nand interpretations of the law.\n\n  At least the Supreme Court is bound to some degree by precedent. The \nAttorney General very often addresses entirely new areas of the law for \nwhich there is no precedent, giving more discretion and more free rein \nto the views and ideology of that individual. In Mr. Ashcroft's case, I \nbelieve that will not serve our country well.\n  I have been troubled by some of his behavior, and it has been \noutlined in the hearings Senator Leahy and my colleague, Chuck Schumer, \nwho just left, so ably outlined in the Judiciary Committee, but I want \nto particularly mention the issue of Ronnie White.\n  I disagree with those who say Mr. Ashcroft's opposition to Judge \nWhite was racially based. I do not believe that to be true. I believe \nit was based upon prior political disagreements when Judge White served \nin the State legislature--but, frankly, when it comes to the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States engaging in political payback, it is very \ntroubling--and it was based also upon Mr. Ashcroft's desire to be \nreelected to this body, and the fact that he was willing to \nmisinterpret the record of Judge White for his own political personal \ngain should concern us all. Not that political payback or sometimes \ninterpreting or misinterpreting one's record is unique even to this \nChamber and other political candidates across the country--it happens \nall the time--but it should not happen in the Justice Department of the \nUnited States, and it is not a characteristic we look for in the \nAttorney General of the United States of America.\n  I was watching these proceedings last evening, and I will not name \nnames, but I heard a speech of one of our colleagues who expressed his \nbelief that behind opposition to Mr. Ashcroft was, in fact, an \nopposition to those who are devoutly Christian in their beliefs serving \nin positions of high public office. I say as one Senator, nothing could \nbe further from the truth. On the contrary. I have a deep respect for \nMr. Ashcroft's religious convictions. I think he should wear them as a \nbadge of honor. His devout faith is something we can all look to as a \nsource of pride on his part.\n  It is his secular views and what implementation of those views would \nmean for the American people with more polarization, more divisiveness, \nand, as a result, more gridlock, that troubles me. It has nothing to do \nwith his religious views, just as those of John Kennedy, Joe Lieberman, \nand others had absolutely nothing to do with their fitness for public \nservice.\n  We need to state unequivocally on the record his religious \nconvictions have nothing to do with the reservations that at least this \nSenator--and I believe the majority of my colleagues who stand in \nopposition--has expressed.\n  Finally, it is quite clear that before long, Mr. Ashcroft will become \nthe next Attorney General of the United States of America. He can take \none of two lessons from the proceedings of these last several weeks. On \nthe one hand, he can draw from these proceedings the conclusion that he \nshould pay no attention to his critics; that there was no basis to any \nof the objections raised to his nomination; that he needs no reason \nwhatsoever to reach out to those who have expressed their concerns; and \nhe can operate as Attorney General as he will.\n  On the other hand, he can decide to take the criticism not personally \nbut seriously. He can decide to reach out to those who have raised \nobjections to his nomination. He can reach out to those who have grave \nconcerns about how he conducts himself in the very important position \nof Attorney General of the United States. He can dedicate himself to \nproving those who raised objections to his nomination were, in fact, in \nerror and those objections were ill-founded.\n  It is that course of action that I hope he will take because in the \nfinal analysis, any Attorney General of the United States of America \nmust dedicate himself to ensuring that our country lives out the full \nmeaning of our\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\ncreed: Liberty and justice for all Americans--all--regardless of \nideology, race, creed, or orientation.\n  I hope it is that America to which Mr. Ashcroft will dedicate himself \nas the next Attorney General of the United States of America and prove \nthat the concerns that have been expressed on the floor of this body \nwere, in fact, misplaced.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the honor of addressing my colleagues \nonce again. I yield the floor to my colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is somebody controlling time on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont actually has the time \nuntil 12:15.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, seeing my friend from New Mexico, I \ncertainly yield to him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to vote for John Ashcroft to \nbe Attorney General of the United States. Let me first say, if you read \nwhat he has done in his life, he is eminently qualified. For those who \nare wondering whether the President of the United States has picked a \nperson who can, in fact, be a real Attorney General for the United \nStates, they can have no doubt about it. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School, which is a very reputable university. \nIn fact, it is one you do not get into unless they already know you are \nvery bright. That means, if you look at that, he was trained to be a \ngood lawyer.\n  Frankly, we have had a lot of Attorneys General of the United States \nwho were not good lawyers. There is no question he is trained and has \nproven that he is not simply good but very good at matters that pertain \nto law.\n  Secondly, as a Senator from one of the sovereign States, I feel very \nconcerned about the way this man is being treated and why the votes are \nbeing garnered against him because if I were from the State of Missouri \ninstead of the State of New Mexico--and maybe I will transplant myself \nthere just for the next 3 or 4 minutes--I would ask, what kind of \npeople live in Missouri? I think I would conclude that, as you look \nacross America, they are very good people, very diverse. They earn a \nliving in very different ways, from agriculture to manufacturing. And \nguess what. They elected this man who has been under fire day after \nday, they elected him to be attorney general of their State two times. \nThey elected him to be Governor twice. Then they elected him to be a \nSenator.\n\n  Frankly, does anybody really believe the people of Missouri would \nelect a person who would discriminate against people in the State of \nthe population that has been discussed here? Do they think the citizens \nof the State of Missouri would elect more than once a man to be \nattorney general of their entire State, for all of their people, and \nthat they have all been beguiled and fooled because he really was not a \ngood attorney general; that he was prejudiced; that he was \ndiscriminatory against people; that he did not follow the law? That is \npure bunk because he followed the law; he enforced the law. They \nelected him Governor twice.\n  For this Senate to spend this much time trying to find little things \nabout this man that are almost the kind of things you would not even \nask anybody about--I looked at some of the questions Senators asked \nthis man, and they are not only petty in some respects, but they \ndeserve an answer, a simple answer: I don't remember. I can't \nunderstand. It's too long ago.\n  They asked him questions about conversations 15 years ago with \nreference to one of the subject matters: Did you talk to so-and-so? \nWell, I do not remember.\n  I am a reasonably good Senator, and I can tell you right now, I \nreally remember things when I was 9, and 10, and 12, but I don't \nremember too well things that happened 2 years ago. And I bet you there \nare a lot of Senators like that. I will bet you there are a lot of \ngreat attorneys general in the United States like that.\n  In fact, John Ashcroft enforced laws in his State as attorney general \nthat were inconsistent with his beliefs. And you know what. Attorneys \ngeneral across America are doing that all the time. They are elected by \nthe people. The people know they differ in many respects. They go in, \nand what do they do? They follow the law. He is going to follow the \nlaw.\n  The one difference versus many other Attorneys General, is that he is \na real lawyer. He will be a real Attorney General. He will run that \nplace because he has the intellectual capacity, the organizational \nability, and the desire to be a great Attorney General.\n  My friend and former colleague, Senator John Ashcroft, is fully \nqualified to serve as the next Attorney General of the United States, \nand I will vote to confirm his nomination.\n  I served in this body with Senator Ashcroft for 6 years, and I know \nhim as a man of great honesty and integrity. Unfortunately, honesty and \nintegrity are often characteristics worthy of only secondary praise in \ntoday's society. Nevertheless, it is vitally important that the public \nhas confidence that our Attorney General, who enforces our laws, is \npossessed of these traits.\n  Of honesty, George Washington once remarked, ``I hope I shall always \npossess firmness of virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most \nenviable of all titles, the character of an Honest Man.'' It is my \nbelief that Senator Ashcroft possesses such character and is worthy of \nthe title.\n  Senator Ashcroft graduated from Yale University and the University of \nChicago Law School. He practiced law in his State of Missouri, and then \nserved as Missouri's attorney general from 1976-1985. He was twice \nMissouri's Governor. He was later elected to the U.S. Senate, where he \nserved with distinction on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Throughout his career, he has had an impressive record on crime. \nDuring his tenure as Governor, he increased funding for local law \nenforcement, which resulted in a significant increase in full-time law \nenforcement officers.\n  He helped enact tougher standards and sentencing for gun crimes, and \nled the fight against illegal drugs. His tough stance on drugs is \nimportant to me because we are seeking to eradicate a growing heroin \nproblem in northern New Mexico.\n  While Governor, total State and Federal spending for antidrug efforts \nin Missouri increased nearly 400 percent. In the Senate, he cosponsored \nthe Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996.\n  Despite his impressive credentials and proven record, Senator \nAshcroft's opponents suggest that his religious and ideological beliefs \nwill prevent him from enforcing our Nation's laws. It is true that he \nis a religious man with strong convictions. It is untrue that this will \nprevent him from carrying out his duties.\n  Time and time again throughout his distinguished career, this nominee \nhas enforced laws that run counter to his personal views. While serving \nas Missouri's attorney general, a Christian group that Senator Ashcroft \nfavored was distributing Bibles on school grounds. After careful \nreview, he issued an opinion stating that such activity violated the \nState constitution.\n  On another matter, even though Senator Ashcroft is pro-life, he has \nunequivocally stated that he will investigate and prosecute any conduct \nby pro-life supporters at abortion clinics that violates the law. His \nprior actions support this assertion.\n  He once asked pro-life marchers to sign a nonviolence pledge and to \nobserve ordinary rules of courtesy with both ``friend and foe.'' It was \nconcern about potential violence at clinics that led to his vote for \nSenator Schumer's amendment to the bankruptcy bill that made debts \nincurred as a result of abortion clinic violence non-dischargeable in \nbankruptcy.\n  Other critics contend that this nominee is insensitive to minorities. \nHis record on the whole indicates otherwise.\n  This is a charge I take very seriously because my state of New Mexico \nhas a large population of Native Americans and Hispanics. I am deeply \nconcerned about the interests of these and other minority groups \nthroughout the nation, and I have always worked to ensure that minority \nrights are protected. In fact, I have supported affirmative action \nprograms in nearly every federal agency. I will hold this nominee's \nfeet to the fire on minority issues.\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\n  As Governor, Senator Ashcroft enacted Missouri's first hate crimes \nbill. He was also one of the nation's first governors to sign into law \nthe Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. In addition, he appointed numerous \nAfrican Americans to the state bench, including the first African \nAmerican ever selected associate circuit judge in St. Louis County.\n  After this appointment, the Mound City Bar Association of St. Louis--\none of the oldest African-American Bar Associations in the United \nStates--said of then-Governor Ashcroft:\n\n       Your appointment of attorney Hemphill demonstrated your \n     sensitivity, not only to professional qualifications, but \n     also to the genuine need to have a bench that is as diverse \n     as the population it serves. . . . The appointment you have \n     just made and your track record for appointing women and \n     minorities are certainly positive indicators of your \n     progressive sense of fairness and equity. We commend you.\n\n  This is not the description of a man who is insensitive to the needs \nof minorities.\n  Senator Ashcroft's concern for minorities did not stop when he came \nto the U.S. Senate. As a matter of fact, while in the United States \nSenate, he and Senator Feingold convened the first Senate hearing on \nracial profiling, a practice Senator Ashcroft described as \nunconstitutional. He testified during his recent confirmation hearings \nthat if confirmed he would make the elimination of racial profiling a \npriority.\n  Senator Ashcroft supported 26 of 27 African-American judges who were \nnominated to the federal judiciary. However, he did not support \nMissouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White. Nor did a majority of the \nU.S. Senate, 77 Missouri sheriffs, the National Sheriffs' Association, \nand other law enforcement groups. Senator Ashcroft's opposition to \nJudge White was based on a review of Judge White's dissenting opinions \nin death penalty cases.\n  In my view, a person with honesty and integrity who has a strong law \nenforcement record and a demonstrated willingness to follow the law \nregardless of personal beliefs is exactly the type of individual that \nshould lead the Justice Department. That's the Senator Ashcroft I know, \nand he will serve with distinction as Attorney General. He has my full \nsupport. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased, and I congratulate the leadership \nhere on our side and on their side for finally deciding we would vote \ntoday, not too long from now. I am hoping John Ashcroft will be \nconfirmed. I do not know what this magical number of whether the \nDemocrats can get 40 or 41 is all about, but I surely would not like to \nbe a Senator on the other side who is told: We need your vote so we can \nget 41 votes against this man. What does that mean? Is that some reason \nto vote against this candidate? To me, if I were on that side and \nsomebody told me: We only have 39 against him; we need you to make 40, \nand then told somebody else 41, I would say: Don't you think I ought to \ndecide whether I want to vote for him? What does this 49, 40, or 41 \nmean? I don't understand it, except some think it means that is \nstrength.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am finished. I will yield the floor.\n  It is strength, meaning you can defeat the next person President Bush \nsends up to be a Supreme Court judge. What is that about? Nobody knows \nwho he is going send, what his philosophy is going to be. Pure \nspeculation. Pure speculation. And they are asking Senators to vote so \nthey can have that kind of message to those who are worried about \ncandidates who are conservative like this man? I don't really think it \nmatters too much if it is 39, 38, 40, or 41; he is going to be Attorney \nGeneral.\n  I tell you, I really predict he will be a good one, a very good one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize we are on the time of the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, but I wonder if I might take 30 \nseconds to respond to what my friend from New Mexico said.\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course.\n  Mr. LEAHY. One, I commend both sides for the way they have managed \nthis. But I tell my friend from New Mexico, this Senator has not asked, \nurged, or cajoled any Senator to vote one way or the other. I have not \nlobbied one single Senator in this body or told them how I expect them \nto vote.\n  The only time I have heard--I tell the Senator from New Mexico, if I \ncould have his attention----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The only time I have heard numbers expressed was from the \nRepublican leadership, when they stated before the hearings began--\nbefore 1 minute of hearings was held--that all 50 Republican Senators \nwere expected to, and would, vote for Senator Ashcroft, and, of course, \nplus Vice President Cheney, which would make a majority.\n  I do also appreciate him saying that we now come to the vote. I point \nout this matter has come to a vote much quicker than the last contested \nAttorney General, which was in President Reagan's term, with a \nRepublican-controlled Senate, where they took about 10 months to bring \nit to a vote. The nomination papers arrived Monday, we voted in the \ncommittee on Tuesday, and we are going to have a final vote on \nThursday.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are at the end of this particular \ndebate. We are rapidly coming up to the time where we are all going to \nhave to vote.\n  It would be an understatement for me to say I have been disappointed \nin a number of our colleagues and the approaches they have taken \ntowards this particular nominee.\n  There has not been a person in the Senate who has not admitted that \nJohn Ashcroft is a person of integrity, decency, and honesty. He is a \nvery religious man who believes in what he is doing.\n  I believe some of the arguments that have been made have been pretty \nbad. They have distorted his record. Mischaracterizations have been \nthroughout this matter. It has been really hard for me to sit here and \nlisten to some of the arguments that have been made.\n  Article VI of our Constitution, while requiring that Officers of the \ngovernment swear to support the Constitution, assures us that ``no \nreligious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office \nor public Trust under the United States.'' I fear that with regard to \nthe nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of the United \nStates, we are coming very close to violating the spirit, if not the \nletter of that assurance.\n  In response to a question I posed to Senator Ashcroft about the wide \ndisparity of treatment accorded him as a person of faith and that \naccorded to Senator Lieberman when he was running for Vice-President, \nand whether anything in his religious beliefs would interfere with his \nability to apply the law as critics had charged, Senator Ashcroft said:\n\n       In examining my understanding and my commitment and my \n     faith heritage, I'd have to say that my faith heritage \n     compels me to enforce the law and abide by the law rather \n     than to violate the law. And if in some measure somehow I \n     were to encounter a situation where the two came into \n     conflict so that I could not respond to this faith heritage \n     which requires me to enforce the law, then I would have to \n     resign.\n\n  If anyone is looking for reassurances about whether Senator Ashcroft \nwill enforce the law as written, I do not think anyone would have to \nlook farther than this brief paragraph. Senator Ashcroft's critics and \nsupporters uniformly agree that Senator Ashcroft is a man who takes his \nfaith seriously. And if he says his faith compels him to abide by the \nlaw rather than violate it, I think his promise carries some weight. As \nhe said in his opening statement, he takes his oath of office \nseriously, it being an oath taken enlisting the help and witness of God \nin so doing.\n  Nevertheless, he has been attacked as a dangerous zealot by many of \nhis opponents, who suggest that his faith will require him to violate \nthe law, or as a liar who cannot be trusted when he says he will uphold \nthe law, even when he disagrees with it, as he has in similar \ncircumstances in the past. His critics cannot have it both ways. They \nseek to impose either a caricature of strong faith--a faith defined by \nthem--followed with zealous determination in violation of law, or of \none who flouts his faith convictions by lying about his principles to \nget through the confirmation process. Which is it? Apparently, his \ncritics do not understand either a faith that transcends politics and\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\npower-grabs or the distinction between being an advocate for change in \nthe law and being an impartial magistrate applying the law. This is not \nsurprising, given the proclivity of many of his critics for a largely \nlawless, results-oriented, politicized approach to law, whether at the \nJustice Department, in the Courts, or elsewhere.\n  I think the corrosive attacks on a qualified nominee because of his \nreligious beliefs not only weakens our constitutional government, but \nalso undermines the ability of citizens in our democracy to engage in a \nmeaningful dialog with each other. When such attacks are made on the \nground that a man's faithful conviction will prevent him from \ndischarging the duties of his office, whole segments of our democracy \nare disenfranchised, and the American heritage of religious tolerance \nis betrayed.\n  Strangely, though many have commented on these issues, some claim the \ninability to see any such religious attack on Senator Ashcroft and the \nlarge number of Americans who believe much of what he does. Following \nmy question to Senator Ashcroft, Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Judiciary Committee, engaged in the following exchange with Senator \nAshcroft:\n\n       Mr. Leahy. I just would not want to leave one of the \n     questions from my friend from Utah to give the wrong \n     impression to the people here and just, sort of, make it very \n     clear. Have you heard any senator, Republican or Democrat, \n     suggest that there should be a religious test on your \n     confirmation?\n       Mr. Ashcroft. No senator has said, ``I will test you,'' but \n     a number of senators have said, ``Will your religion keep you \n     from being able to perform your duties in office?''\n       Mr. Leahy. I'm amazed at that.\n\n  I have been amazed too, and I am not alone. I ask unanimous consent \nto have a sampling of editorials that have pointed out the religious \ntest element in these attacks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 19, 2001]\n\n                           Ashes to Ashcroft\n\n                         (By James W. Skillen)\n\n       Do deeply held religious convictions pose a threat to \n     government? May we trust a man like John Ashcroft, whose \n     outlook appears to be saturated by faith, to serve as U.S. \n     attorney general.\n       It may seem odd, at first, that such a question is asked at \n     all. Odd that sincere religious belief--at least when it \n     comes to holding public office--should be counted as a \n     liability, whereas agnosticism and atheism are presumed to \n     pose no problem whatsoever. But there is a logic to the \n     question--if indeed there is a reasonable concern that some \n     higher authority will interfere with the republic's human \n     ones.\n       But is there a reasonable concern? That depends. There are \n     religions, and then there are religions. Clearly a man whose \n     God calls for him to overthrow the American system of \n     government would disqualify himself for public office \n     immediately, as would a theocrat for whom clerical edicts \n     would trump federal and state laws.\n       But of course John Ashcroft is not this sort of man. He is, \n     rather, the kind of Christian whose belief wholeheartedly \n     supports democracy, the rule of law and religious freedom. To \n     put it starkly: He believes that his savior and lord, Jesus \n     Christ, approves of the American system of government.\n       But that won't save him from his critics, who cringe at \n     such a claim, since they don't think the name of Jesus should \n     be used in a political conversation. But this is a kind of \n     bigotry. We easily accept the idea that broad liberal \n     sentiments inspire public service and that secular, \n     humanitarian ideals are harmonious with American democracy. \n     Why not religious convictions too?\n       Of course, any truths that anyone holds dear--secular or \n     divinely ordained--must exist in the real world on the same \n     footing as others, under constitutional provisions that hold \n     for everyone. But there is nothing in Mr. Ashcroft's record \n     to suggest that he thinks otherwise.\n       So why do some people still find his religion so \n     threatening? The answer, I think, is almost philosophical. It \n     has been standard modern practice to speak of religion in \n     isolation, as something separate. Thus we hear of ``religion \n     and society'' or ``religion and politics.'' This manner of \n     speech has its roots in the European Enlightenment's \n     conviction that Christianity was a kind of residual entity \n     that would soon be made obsolete by the progress of science \n     and reason.\n       The U.S. was founded at a time when the Enlightenment was \n     beginning to win American converts. Thomas Jefferson \n     expressed the new moralism of the Enlightenment when, in a \n     letter to his nephew, Peter Carr (Aug. 10, 1787), he \n     encouraged him to read the Bible. If such reading, Jefferson \n     wrote to Carr, ``ends in a belief that there is no God, you \n     will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and \n     pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others \n     which it will procure you. If you find reason to believe \n     there is a God, a consciousness that you are acting under his \n     eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional \n     incitement.''\n       From this point of view, religion is judged by its \n     pragmatic usefulness--its power to inspire public virtue. \n     Whether God exists, whether faith can be felt to be \n     personally true, does not matter.\n       The problem with Mr. Ashcroft, in the eyes of those who \n     have been influenced more by the Enlightenment than by \n     Christianity, is that he reveres God as truly superior to \n     himself and, in a moral sense, to the republic. That is, he \n     takes religion too seriously for a modern man. He does not \n     treat it as either a utilitarian devise or a merely private \n     affair.\n       Of course, if Mr. Ashcroft's political convictions on, say, \n     abortion were the same as those who now fault him, his \n     critics would applaud his belief as an incitement to virtue. \n     But he holds views contrary to their own. How to explain his \n     unwillingness to join their moral majority? Disparage his \n     religion as something dangerous--something out of the \n     mainstream that belongs to a darker, or less ``enlightened,'' \n     age.\n       And the best way to do this is to suggest, implausibly, \n     that Mr. Ashcroft is blinded by his faith, that it is so \n     illiberal that it renders him unable to honor his obligations \n     as a public official, to revere the Constitution, to obey the \n     law it is his job to enforce. But it is an absurd suggestion: \n     After all, George W. Bush will put his hand on the Bible \n     tomorrow as he takes the oath of office, just like other \n     presidents before him. Somehow, the republic will survive, \n     and perhaps even prosper.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 17, 2001]\n\n                          Ashcroft Under Fire\n\n       If John Ashcroft is to be known as an extremist because he \n     is a man of faith; if, as his former Senate colleague Charles \n     Schumer repeatedly intimates, he is deemed ill-equipped to \n     enforce the law--even incapable of knowing whether he is \n     enforcing the law--because of his ideological and \n     philosophical beliefs; if the man is to be labeled a racist \n     because, as a senator from Missouri, he opposed one black \n     judicial nominee while supporting 26; if all these wholly \n     spurious charges are allowed to stand in a disgraceful \n     attempt to, first, smear an honorable and supremely \n     distinguished man and then defeat his nomination for attorney \n     general, it would become clear that the American mainstream \n     is a sterile, even hostile environment.\n       To be sure, the Senate Judiciary Committee, under Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy's leadership this week, seems to be just such \n     an inhospitable place. Even before Mr. Ashcroft gave a jot of \n     testimony, answered any questions, explained a single point \n     of view or action, or even said howdy-do, the Senate \n     Democrats had bayonets affixed and were on the attack. In an \n     ill-mannered rant harkening back to that science-fictional, \n     if slanderously effective attack on Robert Bork's Supreme \n     Court nomination, Sen. Ted Kennedy depicted an Attorney \n     General Ashcroft as someone who would ``advance his personal \n     views in spite of the laws of the land''--the baseless, \n     indeed, fanciful implication being that Mr. Ashcroft would \n     serve as some kind of Cabinet-level desperado in the new Bush \n     administration. Of course, Mr. Kennedy, reprising his oft-\n     played role as Democratic heavy in the confirmation hearings \n     of Republican nominees, was just warming up.\n       Mr. Schumer, if more cordial, was hardly more temperate in \n     his opening remarks, injecting a note of condescension into \n     the hearings by wondering how such an ``impassioned and \n     zealous advocate'' as Mr. Ashcroft could, as attorney \n     general, ``just turn it off? That may be an impossible \n     task,'' said Mr. Schumer, implying that Mr. Ashcroft is \n     constitutionally--religiously?--incapable of enforcing the \n     law when it conflicts with his convictions.\n       One might have thought that Mr. Ashcroft had pricked most \n     of the grossly--and grotesquely--inflated charges against him \n     with his compelling opening testimony during which he \n     emphasized his commitment to enforcing the law as written for \n     all Americans, regardless of race, color or creed. Hardly \n     striking an orthodox conservative pose, Mr. Ashcroft spoke of \n     his commitment, not to a color-blind society, but rather to \n     diversity and integration. He elaborated on his record of \n     supporting minority appointments and nominees throughout his \n     career, and he spoke of his opposition to racial profiling. \n     On the incendiary issue of abortion, Mr. Ashcroft declared \n     that, consistent with previous Republican attorneys general, \n     he believed Roe vs. Wade to have been wrongly decided, but \n     affirmed his unwavering acceptance of the landmark cases \n     upholding abortion's legality.\n       So what's the liberals' problem? Does anyone still take \n     seriously the charges of racism--even after, say, the brother \n     of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers came out for Mr. \n     Ashcroft this week? Does anyone--even a Senate Democrat--\n     genuinely worry that Mr. Ashcroft would not enforce abortion \n     laws even after learning, for example, that he has supported \n     a ban on violence against abortion clinics? Mr. Ashcroft has \n     made it clear that, as attorney general, he would uphold the \n     Constitution and the laws of the nation. After eight years of \n     an increasingly degraded Justice Department, that would be--\n     may we say it?--the department's salvation.\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 17, 2001]\n\n                         A Christian, a Citizen\n\n                         (By Robert A. Sirico)\n\n       Grand Rapids, MI.--Some of the objections to the John \n     Ashcroft nomination for attorney general hint that the \n     problem with his conservative politics is that it is rooted \n     in his Christian faith.\n       It is true that Mr. Ashcroft has made it clear that he is \n     Christian and that his religious beliefs inform his judgment \n     of the world. But why shouldn't someone who holds this \n     particular belief be qualified to lead the Justice \n     Department?\n       We must remember our country's progressive tradition of \n     religious tolerance. In our nation's history, certain states \n     subjected public officeholders to certain religious tests. \n     For instance, in 1961, the Supreme Court struck down a \n     Maryland law that required public officials to swear to a \n     belief in the existence of God. Progressives fought valiantly \n     against these religious tests, and it would be a grave error \n     to promote a new religious test that would in effect block \n     committed Christians from public service.\n       And yet some understandable questions remain. From the time \n     of ancient Israel and the early church, believers have held \n     that there is a law higher than those issued and enforced by \n     government. Its source is transcendent and binds people's \n     souls in a way in which statutory law cannot. Indeed, the \n     idea of a natural law that transcends the political process \n     is a powerful argument against tyranny.\n       Every serious believer and every conscientious person in \n     public office must balance respect for law with the dictates \n     of conscience. Many have disagreed profoundly with certain \n     policies and wondered whether their religious commitments \n     permitted them to cooperate in enforcing those policies.\n       Surely, as attorney general, Mr. Ashcroft would also have \n     to struggle with this conundrum--particularly when it comes \n     to abortion, which he opposes. But it is perfectly within \n     Christian belief that one can participate in an essentially \n     just system that sometimes produces unwise laws that must be \n     enforced, as Mr. Ashcroft would do. That is at least as \n     principled a position as that of those Catholic politicians \n     who personally oppose abortion but vigorously support Roe v. \n     Wade.\n       George W. Bush's response to the attacks on Mr. Ashcroft \n     hints at the distinction between administering the law and \n     advocating legislation. He says that as attorney general, Mr. \n     Ashcroft will enforce, not interpret, the law, until such \n     time as Congress changes them. Presumably that also includes \n     the nation's laws on abortion.\n       The Bible, in Chapter 13 of Romans, tells Christians that \n     ``the powers that be are ordained of God.'' That passage has \n     never been held to mean that every regime governs according \n     to God's will. But the phrase does imply that Christians face \n     no moral obligation to flee from public life merely because a \n     nation's laws do not always perfectly conform to the highest \n     moral standards.\n       We are a nation that holds firm to the conviction that a \n     person's religious commitments, or lack thereof, need not bar \n     him or her from public life. The Ashcroft nomination provides \n     an opportunity to reaffirm the best of this old liberal \n     virtue of tolerance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2001]\n\n                     Disqualified by His Religion?\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       A senator is nominated for high office. He's been reelected \n     many times statewide. He has served admirably as his state's \n     attorney general. He is devout, speaking openly and proudly \n     about his religious faith. He emphasizes the critical role of \n     religion in underpinning both morality and constitutional \n     self-government. He speaks passionately about how his \n     politics are shaped by his deeply held religious beliefs.\n       Now: If his name is Lieberman and he is Jewish, his \n     nomination evokes celebration. if his name is Ashcroft and he \n     is Christian, his nomination evokes a hue and cry about \n     ``divisiveness'' and mobilizes a wall-to-wall liberal \n     coalition to defeat him.\n       Just two months ago I addressed a gathering of the Jewish \n     Theological Seminary arguing that the Lieberman candidacy--\n     the almost universal applause his nomination received, the \n     excitement he generated when he spoke of his religious \n     faith--had created a new consensus in America. Liberals has \n     long vilified the ``religious right'' for mixing faith and \n     politics and insisting that religion has a legitimate place \n     in the public square. No longer. The nomination of Lieberman \n     to the second highest office in the country by the country's \n     liberal political party would once and for all abolish the \n     last remaining significant religious prejudice in the \n     country--the notion that highly religious people are unfit \n     for high office because they confuse theology with politics \n     and recognize no boundary between church and state. After \n     Lieberman, liberals would simply be too embarrassed to return \n     to a double standard.\n       How wrong I was. The nomination of a passionate and devout \n     Christian for attorney general set off the old liberal anti-\n     religious reflexes as if Joe Lieberman had never existed.\n       Of course, the great anti-Ashcroft revolt is not framed as \n     religious. The pretense is that it is about issues. Hence \n     this exchange during John Ashcroft's confirmation hearing:\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy: ``Have you heard any senator, \n     Republican or Democrat, suggest that there should be a \n     religious test on your confirmation?''\n       John Ashcroft: ``No senator has said `I will test you.' But \n     a number of senators have said, `Will your religion keep you \n     from being able to perform your duties in office?' ''\n       Sen. Leahy: ``All right, well, I'm amazed at that.''\n       At the clumsiness, perhaps. No serious politician is \n     supposed to admit openly that Ashcroft's religion bothers \n     him. The religious test that is implied is not just un-\n     American, it is grossly unconstitutional.\n       The ostensible issues are abortion and racial preferences, \n     both of which Ashcroft fundamentally opposes. But are they \n     really? In a country so divided on these issues, can one \n     seriously argue that opposing abortion and racial preferences \n     is proof of extremism? It would be odd indeed if the minority \n     of Americans who believe in racial preferences and the \n     minority who believe in abortion-on-demand were to define the \n     American mainstream. In fact, under these issues lies a \n     suspicion, even a prejudice, about the fitness of a truly \n     religious conservative for high office. ``Christian Right'' \n     is a double negative in the liberal lexicon. It is meant to \n     make decent Americans cringe at the thought of some religious \n     wing nut enforcing the laws. Torquemada at Agriculture \n     perhaps. But not Justice, God forbid.\n       To the anti-Ashcroft coalition, the Christian Right--\n     numbering at least 30 million, by the way--is some kind of \n     weird fringe group to whom bones are thrown by otherwise \n     responsible Republicans to induce them to return to their \n     caves. Politically, they are a foreign body to be ignored, \n     bought off or suppressed. Hence the charge that the very \n     appointment of a man representing this constituency is, in \n     and of itself, divisive.\n       Hence the salivation when news broke that there was a tape \n     of Ashcroft's commencement address at Bob Jones University. \n     In it, he declared that Jesus is a higher authority than \n     Caesar. That sent some fundamentalist church-state \n     separationists into apoplexy. This proved, said Barry Lynn, \n     the executive director of Americans United for Separation of \n     Church and State, that Ashcroft ``has little or no \n     appreciation for the constitutional separation of church and \n     state'' and thus is disqualified from serving as attorney \n     general.\n       What Ashcroft did was not merely to state the obvious--that \n     the American experiment has always recognized its source in \n     the transcendent--but to restate in his own vernacular what \n     Joe Lieberman had been saying up and down the country \n     throughout the summer and fall.\n       It was a great day when Joe Lieberman was nominated. and it \n     was even greater that he publicly rooted his most deeply held \n     political beliefs in his faith. It is rather ironic that we \n     now need to go through that same process for Ashcroft's \n     constituency of co-believers. When the Senate confirms him, \n     we will have overcome yet another obstacle in America's \n     steady march to religious toleration.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me point to just a few instances of \nthese amazing attacks on Senator Ashcroft, made on largely religious \ngrounds, since he was nominated. In fairness to my colleagues in the \nSenate, they have tried to draw a distinction between the liberal \npressure groups' attacks on Senator Ashcroft's religious views and my \ncolleagues' questioning into his ``values'' or ``beliefs.'' But their \nwholesale adoption of the rest of the liberal interest group critique \nof John Ashcroft does suggest a connection between the objections, \ndespite a generally more guarded rhetoric. However, I was disappointed \nthat just this morning one of our colleagues was quoted in The New York \nTimes as saying, ``he believed Mr. Ashcroft's `fundamental beliefs and \nvalues' would conflict with the attorney general's responsibility to \nenforce the law.'' NY Times, Feb. 1, 2001.\n  Let me turn to the testimony of Professor James M. Dunn, who \ntestified at our Senate hearings as an expert on religion issues. I \nbegin here because Professor Dunn is the most explicit in his religious \nattack on Senator Ashcroft.\n  Most attacks have been based on the divergence of his religious \nbeliefs and a particular law, such as abortion rights, or a suggestion \nthat the strength of his deeply-held convictions will make it \nimpossible for him to analyze the law dispassionately and apply it \neven-handedly. Professor Dunn makes his attack explicitly on religious \ngrounds. On a personal note, I am deeply disappointed that a Divinity \nProfessor, who has worked on important religious liberty legislation \nwith me and other people of conscience and people of faith, would use \nsuch harsh and intemperate language to attack a person of good faith, \napparently over a policy difference.\n  Professor Dunn says explicitly what others have coyly and carefully \nimplied. He says, and I quote what is essentially the thesis statement \nof his testimony before the Judiciary Committee: ``The long history of \nSenator\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nAshcroft's identification with and approval of the political agenda of \nreligious, right-wing extremism in this country convinces me that he is \nutterly unqualified and must be assumed to be unreliable for such a \ntrust.''\n  Let me quote that point again: ``The long history of Senator \nAshcroft's identification with and approval of . . . religious, right-\nwing extremism in this country convinces [Professor Dunn] that he is \nutterly unqualified and must be assumed unreliable for such a trust.''\n  That is about as baldly as the matter can be put, John Ashcroft is \n``utterly unqualified'' and ``unreliable'' because of his ``religious, \nright-wing extremism.''\n  As if the name-calling were not enough, to make this an even more \nstunning assertion, the case Professor Dunn offers to prove this \nperceived ``extremism'' is that John Ashcroft was the ``principal \narchitect'' of the so-called ``charitable choice'' legislation which \nwas passed by the Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996.\n  To suggest that duly passed legislation, adopted by two branches of \ngovernment controlled by different political parties is outside the \nmainstream is simply ludicrous, and suggests that the one outside the \nmainstream is not Senator Ashcroft, but rather his critics. This is a \npoint that could be made on a number of policy fronts.\n  This critique is particularly odd when both major-party presidential \ncandidates have been talking up the concept of charitable choice very \nrecently in their campaigns.\n  I am disappointed when policy disagreements deteriorate into name-\ncalling, but considering the source I am particularly disappointed. I \nwould hope that the United States Senate would never countenance such \nattacks in the consideration of this, or any other, nominee. I hope no \nweight will be given to such intemperate vitriol, nor more guarded \nattacks made in the same spirit. I hope that none of my colleagues \nwould join in such attacks, whether explicitly stated or couched in \nmore careful language.\n  I am glad that at least Professor Dunn's clear statement can put to \nrest the question of whether Senator Ashcroft is being attacked in part \non his religious beliefs. Dunn is not alone, either. For example, Barry \nLynn, of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, in \nattacking Senator Ashcroft's nomination also cites charitable choice--\nagain, a law adopted by two branches of government controlled by two \ndifferent parties--as an instance of Ashcroft's ``extreme views.'' And \nto underscore the broader point, Lynn points to the apparently decisive \nfact that ``Religious Right leaders find Ashcroft's fundamentalist \nChristian world view and his far-right political outlook appealing.'' \nLet us be clear here: the charge is guilt by association with religious \npeople.\n  As a number of my colleagues have suggested that the nominee might \nwant to apologize for some of his associations or take the opportunity \nto dissociate himself from them, I would invite my colleagues to show a \nsimilar indignation for these attacks on people of faith, and \ndissociate themselves from these intolerant statements, unless they too \nwould like their silence to be considered approval of such intolerance. \nPerhaps there needs to be greater sensitivity shown here.\n\n  In addition to such explicit attacks, others attack Senator Ashcroft \nbecause his religious beliefs can be viewed as diverging from the legal \nresults favored by far left liberal interest groups.\n  For example, in the area of abortion, Ms. Gloria Feldt, the President \nof Planned Parenthood Federation of America criticized Senator Ashcroft \nfor ``his belief that personhood begins at fertilization,'' saying \n``his actions and statements over time with regard to choice and family \nplanning represent no mere commentary on policy decisions of the day, \nbut rather illustrate deeply held beliefs that put him at odds with the \noverwhelming majority of Americans.'' She went on to argue that his \nview is ``one of the most extreme positions among those who oppose a \nwoman's right to make her own reproductive choices, John Ashcroft \nactually believes that personhood begins . . . at the moment that sperm \nmeets egg, the moment of fertilization.'' Well, call it extreme if you \nwill--that word is a hobby horse of the far left liberal groups who \noppose this nominee--but I understand that is the position of a number \nof churches, including the Catholic church. What is striking and \nchilling about this attack is the implication that anyone who holds \nthis belief, including believing members of many churches, including \nthe millions of believing Catholics, are unfit for the office of \nAttorney General because of their ``extreme positions.'' Surely, the \nSenate cannot take the position that faithful Americans who adhere to \nthe pro-life doctrines of their churches, or even those who are pro-\nlife on secular grounds, are unfit for office because of this view.\n  Where all of this leads is down one of two roads. Either the \npolitical views of about half of the country--including a duly elected \npro-life President--make one unfit for office, which clearly cannot be \nright in a democracy. Or religious people who actually believe their \nreligions are unfit for public office, which clearly cannot be right in \na tolerant and pluralistic society founded in part on religious \nfreedom.\n  Or there is a third path. That path is the one John Ashcroft's \nopponents have added most recently to counter his assurances that he \nwill follow the law, even where he disagrees with it. That path is to \ntry to brand as a liar a person who, while disagreeing on policy, \npromises to honor the law as the policy-makers have made it. This path \nattacks the very notion of dispassionate analysis and even-handed \napplication of the law.\n  Besides undermining our basic assumptions supporting the rule of law, \nthis position raises two additional objections. First, it unfairly puts \nthe nominee in a lose-lose position where he cannot ever win the \nargument because if he disagrees with his opponents on policy he is \nbranded a dangerous extremist, but if he disarms the policy dispute by \nacknowledging his role as enforcer of policy made by others, his \nveracity is called into question. There seems to be no way to satisfy \nthese critics without violating the oath to uphold the law; they seem \nto want a promise that he will make up new liberal law in his \nenforcement position.\n  Besides being little more than a desperate attempt to justify \nopposition under any circumstances, this path leads to a second, and \nmore chilling result for religious tolerance, namely that of Senator's \njudging a nominee on the basis of their views of the nominee's \nreligious faith and that faith's priorities. John Ashcroft responds to \nthose who criticize him for his beliefs about abortion and the \nbeginning of life, for example, by stating that his religion requires \nhim to follow the law as written when he is filling an enforcement \nrole, and his oath to do that will be binding on him. Those who \nchallenge his veracity on this point are picking and choosing which of \nSenator Ashcroft's religious beliefs they feel are genuine or which \nreligious principle has priority for him. I think this moves \ndangerously close to the line of imposing a religious test on a \nnominee.\n  Oddly, to justify questions approaching this line, one Judiciary \nCommittee member suggested that is was perfectly appropriate to inquire \nwhether a Quaker could faithfully discharge the office of Secretary of \nDefense. I am not sure we should be so blithely assured that it is \nappropriate to inquire about a nominee's religious beliefs and then \njudge that nominee based on what we think their religion requires of \nthem. That robs the individual conscience of its freedom and robs the \nexecutive of the choice of cabinet team based on a Senator's own \nprojection of what a nominee's religious code ought to be. Perhaps we \ncan ask a nominee the general question whether there is anything that \nwould keep them from fulfilling their duties, but I do not think it \nappropriate to assume that someone is unfit for a job because we have \npreconceptions about what their sect believes and then criticize them \nif their answers do not fit our preconceptions of what they should \nbelieve. We need to tread very carefully here. We would do well in such \nmatters to give the benefit of the doubt to the nominee. We have \ncertainly given the benefit of the doubt to the last president when we \nhad qualms about the quality or credentials of some of his nominees, or \ntheir policy positions. But we owe a special duty to resolve doubts in \nfavor of a nominee when questions stem from our assumptions about a \nnominee's religious beliefs, especially in the face of\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nthe nominee's contradiction of our assumptions.\n  Mr. President, I think we would all do well to remember what we know \nabout John Ashcroft, and not be influenced by a caricature painted by \nthose extreme groups whose distortions of this honorable man are driven \nlargely by their own narrow political interests. We know him to be a \nman of integrity, a man of his word. A man who reveres American \nconstitutionalism, democracy, pluralism, and equality before the law. \nWe know John Ashcroft is the sort of person whose word is his bond. And \nif his religion is relevant, it speaks for him as a person who will \ndischarge the office of Attorney General with honor and dignity, with \nimpartiality, according to the law established by the constitutional \nprocess he reveres.\n  I think if we examine our hearts, we will find nothing that \ndisqualifies him to be Attorney General. And we cannot, in good \nconscience, say that all those Americans who believe as he does are \noutside the mainstream of American opinion. No, they are solidly within \nthe history of American pluralism and freedom, including religious \nfreedom. We know John Ashcroft will faithfully discharge his duties and \nhonor his oath of office, sworn as he points out ``so help [him] God.'' \nAnd we know this no matter what the liberal pressure groups assert. I \nhope we will similarly honor our oaths, rejecting what has become in \nessence a religious test for this nominee, and vote to confirm this \nhonorable man to the post of Attorney General.\n  My colleague Senator Kennedy suggests that to oppose court-ordered \nbusing makes a person against integration. But nothing could be farther \nfrom the truth. I think most people highly abhor racial segregation. \nHowever, the remedy for such segregation is extremely controversial. \nMr. Bob Woodson testified that a significant majority of African-\nAmericans opposes busing for integration. And it is no wonder, given \nthat many of these programs have been a dismal failure. They may have \nmoved some children out of city schools, but they have done little to \nimprove inner-city schools.\n  I would like to address several allegations that continue to be made \nrelating to Senator Ashcroft's involvement with school desegregation \ncases in Missouri. First, let me say that I do not in the least condone \nsegregation in St. Louis or Kansas City or anywhere else. It is a \nshameful legacy that must be dealt with appropriately.\n  Second, while the costs of the desegregation program were exorbitant, \nthis is not the only criticism to be made of the plans. The primary \nargument repeatedly made by Senator Ashcroft is that the State was \nnever found liable for an inter-district violation.\n  Senator Kennedy has referred to an 8th Circuit decision that he \nargues found the State of Missouri guilty of an inter-district \nviolation. But a circuit court cannot make such a factual finding. \nRather, this is a finding that must be made only by a trial court.\n  The fact that the State was never found liable for an inter-district \nviolation is shown by the fact that throughout 1981 and 1982, the \nparties were preparing for trial on the very question of inter-district \nliability.\n  So again, I emphasize that it is true and correct to say that the \nState was never found liable for an inter-district violation.\n  Although the State was not found liable for an inter-district \nviolation, it was required by the district court to pay for a \nsettlement reached by the suburbs and the City of St. Louis. This order \nby the district court was likely unconstitutional under the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Milliken.\n  Opposing these court orders for a plan that was constitutionally \nsuspect, expensive, and ineffective, does not make Senator Ashcroft an \nopponent of desegregation.\n  Indeed, the plan as implemented has been a dismal failure. Test \nscores actually declined from 1990 to 1995. Scores on the standard \nachievement test went from 36.5 to 31.1 at a time when the national \nmean was 50. And the graduation rate has remained at a dismal 30 \npercent.\n  To question Senator Ashcroft's integrity over such a complicated and \ncontroversial issue is to seriously distort his record and disbelieve \nhis sworn testimony.\n  Senator Ashcroft acted with great probity as a representative of the \nState of Missouri. He supports integration and deplores racism.\n  As one who feels very strongly about drug issues, I am pleased to say \nI have been working with Senator Leahy on legislation dealing with drug \ntreatment and prevention, and we are going to get that done this year.\n  I feel compelled to respond to some of the criticism launched at \nSenator Ashcroft yesterday regarding his stance on drug treatment. Some \nhave questioned Senator Ashcroft's dedication to investing in drug \nprevention and treatment programs in the battle against drug abuse and \naddiction.\n  Indeed, yesterday when giving a statement in opposition to Senator \nAshcroft, one Senator suggested that Senator Ashcroft opposed investing \nin drug treatment. That simply is not true. Senator Ashcroft's record \nin the Senate proves that he placed a lot of faith in drug prevention \nand treatment.\n  He has always believed, as do many of us, that America's drug \nproblems can only be conquered through a comprehensive, balanced \napproach consisting of interdiction and law enforcement efforts as well \nas prevention and treatment.\n  It is true that in 1998, Senator Ashcroft called on the Clinton \nadministration to continue the ban on federal funding for clean-needle \nprograms, stating ``the nation's leaders have a fundamental \nresponsibility to call Americans to their highest and best.'' Providing \nclean needles to drug addicts, Senator Ashcroft reasoned, was analogous \nto ``giving bullet proof vests to bank robbers.'' He argued that such a \npolicy would ``hurt kids, tear apart families, and damage the \nculture.'' Senator Ashcroft went on to state that providing needles to \naddicts ``is accommodating us at our lowest and least.'' In light of \nthe fact that heroin use among eighth graders had doubled and that \nmarijuana use was up 99 percent at the time when the Clinton \nadministration was considering lifting the ban on federal funding for \nneedle exchange programs, Senator Ashcroft concluded that ``America \ndeserve[d] better,'' and that its leaders needed to set ``a higher \nstandard than providing clean needles for drug users.''\n  Some have mischaracterized Senator Ashcroft's record on drug \ntreatment. I have complete confidence in saying that the majority of \nAmericans agree with Senator Ashcroft. Providing drug addicts with \nclean needles is not the most effective drug prevention or treatment.\n  Just last session, Senator Ashcroft authored and introduced S. 486, a \ncomprehensive bill that attacked the methamphetamine problem on several \nfronts, including the prevention and treatment fronts. S 486 was a \nbalanced drug bill that contained significant and innovative prevention \nand treatment provisions. For example, the bill: (1) Expanded the \nNational Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network which conducts \nresearch and clinical trials with treatment centers relating to drug \nabuse and addiction and other biomedical, behavioral and social issues \nrelated to drug abuse and addiction; (2) authorized $10 million in \ngrants to States for treatment of methamphetamine and amphetamine \naddiction; (3) authorized $15 million to fund grants to public and \nnonprofit private entities to carry out school-based and community-\nbased programs concerning the dangers of abuse of and addiction to \nmethamphetamine and other illicit drugs; and (4) required HHS to \nconduct a study on the development of medications for the treatment of \naddiction to amphetamine and methamphetamine.\n  Another important treatment provision, included in S. 486, offered an \ninnovative approach to how drug addicted patients could seek and obtain \ntreatment by creating a decentralized system of treating heroin addicts \nwith a new generation of antiaddiction medications. This provision, \nwhich was added to S. 486 and was fully supported by Senator Ashcroft, \nwas taken from a bill introduced by myself and Senators Levin and \nBiden. I am sure Senator Levin would agree that Senator Ashcroft's \nsponsorship and support for this very provision, not to mention the \ncountless other provisions included in the bill, demonstrate this \ncommitment to utilizing and funding effective prevention and treatment \nprograms in the fight against illicit drug abuse and addiction. Senator \nAshcroft's record\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nproves he believes in prevention and treatment programs and his views \non one particular, and I must say controversial, form of a treatment \nprogram.\n  There are so many things I could bring up that have been distortions, \nmisrepresentations, and downright falsehoods stated on this floor and \nin our committee about Senator Ashcroft--especially by outside groups. \nThe sheer volume is mind-boggling to me.\n  I recall the Golden Rule of ``do unto others as you would have them \ndo unto you.''\n  I wonder how many people would like to be treated like Senator \nAshcroft has been treated by some of our colleagues here and some of \nthese outside groups, distorting his record, trying to make him look \nbad--all in the good name of politics. I think it is wrong. Buddhists \nsay it another way. Buddhists say, ``Do as you would be done by.'' It \nis very similar. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\n  How many of us would like to be treated like this? Here is a man who \nwas elected attorney general of his State, who did his best to do that \njob, who enforced laws he didn't agree with. And he has a record that \ncan be shown. He was selected by his peers--the other 49 attorneys \ngeneral of the United States of America--to head the National Attorneys \nGeneral Association. And we have people here saying he should not be \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  You don't get elected by 49 other state attorneys general--Democrats \nand Republicans--unless you are a quality person. What is more, he \nbecame Governor of the great State of Missouri for 8 years. As Governor \nof the State of Missouri, he also became the head of the National \nGovernors' Association elected by the other 49 Governors. I submit that \nyou don't get elected chairman of the National Governors' Association \nunless you are a quality individual, of great substance, fair \nand decent, and you surely would not get elected if you were against \ndesegregation. There is no way.\n\n  Then he served 6 years in this Senate and I have never heard one \nperson in this body say that he is not a man of integrity, decency, and \nhonor.\n  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\n  I have never seen treatment like this of a worthy colleague. I have \nnever seen treatment like this of somebody who has spent a lifetime \nliving his beliefs and doing what is right.\n  Of the 69 Attorneys General of the United States, John Ashcroft has \nmore qualifications than all but a handful; some say more \nqualifications than any one who has been Attorneys General. I will not \ngo that far. But there is only a handful that have at least some of the \nqualifications that John Ashcroft has.\n  Think of what Senator Ashcroft's critics are doing to the State of \nMissouri in the arguments that have been made here. Why, you would all \nhave to imply that the people of Missouri just have no brains to elect \nsomebody as vicious, as violent, and as awful as John Ashcroft, when it \nis completely the other way. I commend the people of Missouri for \nhaving the brains to have somebody of that quality serve them as \nattorney general, Governor, and Senator.\n  Look at the way he handled his defeat--with decency; much more than \nhas been shown to him--consideration, and kindness. And we are happy to \nwelcome our new colleague from Missouri because of John Ashcroft's \ngracious concession and because she is a great person to boot. But \nSenator Ashcroft could have contested the election. The loss of a \nSenate race has to be personal. There are other legal aspects as well, \nit could be argued. But he didn't. He did not do what others are doing \nto him.\n  When I see these outside groups, I welcome them because it is the \nfirst time we have seen them in 8 years. Isn't that interesting? They \nseem to react and get into action only when there is a Republican \nPresident. I wonder why that is the case.\n  I respect their right to advocate. I respect their point of view even \nthough I don't agree with many of them. I respect their right to come \nin and state that point of view.\n  But I resent the way they have done it. I resent the way they have \npicked on John Ashcroft. I resent the unfair tactics. I resent the \ndistortions of his record. Boy, it has been distorted. I think we all \nresent it.\n  Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\n  Isn't it amazing that only during Republican Presidencies we have all \nthese groups coming out of the woodwork? I guess they can say it is \nbecause Republicans don't agree with them.\n  That is what makes this country great. We don't all have to agree.\n  Let me put it bluntly. Is it getting to the point where only pro-\nchoice people can serve in as Attorney General of the United States? Do \nwe have a litmus test that says that we have to reject highly qualified \nindividuals who believe otherwise, but who will enforce the law as it \nexists? Is that where we are going in this country? Or are we going to \ncontinue to distort his record on guns? John Ashcroft has a sterling \nrecord on getting tough with criminals who use guns. That is the way to \nend the misuse of guns in this society--get tough on those who misuse \nthem. There would be a lot less crime. But no, if we don't agree with \ncertain anti-gun groups and we just ignore the history of the second \namendment completely, we are not worthy of being Attorney General.\n\n  To have his record distorted when he has been a forthright, strong \nproponent of tough anticrime laws against those who misuse guns, it is \na disgrace.\n  Desegregation: Sometimes in the law we can differ and have a good \ncase and we might lose. But that doesn't mean the case wasn't good. If \nyou look at the record of court-ordered desegregation in St. Louis and \nKansas City, it didn't work. The people hurt the worst were the people \nin the inner cities of St. Louis and Kansas City. It cost $1.8 billion, \nwhich John thought was a raid on the State treasury. The State was \nnever found liable for interdistrict segregation. Those are important \npoints.\n  I want Members to think about it. Why would anybody in this body say \nsome of the things that have been said about John Ashcroft? Is it \nbecause they want to make John Ashcroft the new Newt Gingrich so they \ncan raise funds for reelection? I certainly hope not. But there are \nsome who believe that. I am not sure it is not true. Is it because they \nare sending a message that no conservative who believes in the right to \nlife should ever be Attorney General? Or even more, should never be on \nthe circuit courts or supreme court of this land? Is that what we are \ndoing? I believe some are doing it for that reason. I know some of the \noutside groups are doing it for that reason. I know they are trying to \nget as many votes against John Ashcroft so they can claim a victory, \neven though John Ashcroft is going to be the next Attorney General of \nthe United States. I guess they want to undermine him from day 1. They \ngot the wrong guy.\n  This is a fellow who will do what he thinks is right, and by and \nlarge will be right. Everybody in this body admits he would be a great \nlaw enforcement Attorney General.\n  The fact is, they know he is tough on crime. After all, that is one \nof the things we are all worried about. People are scared to death in \nthis land today because we have allowed drugs to pervade the land. We \nhave allowed criminality to pervade the land. We haven't been as tough \nas we should be. We have illicit use of guns in this land because we \nare not enforcing the laws. Instead of going after those who misuse the \nguns, they have been complaining about guns themselves. I would rather \nattack the problem in a responsible and intelligent way. Let he who has \nnot sinned cast the first stone. Do unto others as you would have them \ndo unto you.\n  I hope we don't have another nominee that goes through this, a person \nof decency and honor. I hope whether he or she is a Democrat or \nRepublican, they will have a little more class than we have had \ndisplayed in this matter. I hope my colleagues on the other side will \nvote for John Ashcroft because it is the right thing to do. We should \nnever get into these name-calling contests and distort people's \nrecords, especially someone of the quality of John Ashcroft, and a \ncolleague at that.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of President \nBush's nominee for Attorney General, our former colleague, John \nAshcroft. Senator Ashcroft will be one of the most qualified Attorney \nGenerals in our history. Unfortunately, he has also been\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\nthe target of one of the most vicious and unrelenting smear campaigns \nin our history, and it is with that in mind that I feel compelled to \nset the record straight and describe at length, the real facts and the \nreal qualifications of someone I think this country will be very \nfortunate to have serve as our Attorney General.\n  Mr. President, much of the debate over the nomination of John \nAshcroft has focused on issues tangential to the core mission of the \nDepartment of Justice. The Senate would be well-served to consider the \nAshcroft nomination in light of the duties of the Attorney General. \nWhen this debate is placed in the proper perspective, it becomes even \nmore obvious how qualified Senator Ashcroft is to be the next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  The Department of Justice was established by Congress in 1870. It is \nthe largest law firm in the United States, with 123,000 employees and \nan annual budget of approximately $21 billion. Through its thousands of \nlawyers, agents, and investigators, the Justice Department plays a \nvital role in fighting violent crime and drug trafficking, ensuring \nbusiness competition in the marketplace, enforcing immigration and \nnaturalization laws, and protecting our environment. Consider the \nfollowing major components of the Justice Department in light of the \nqualifications of Senator Ashcroft:\n  The Civil Rights Division was established in 1957 to secure the \neffective enforcement of civil rights for all Americans. Attorneys in \nthe Civil Rights Division enforce federal statutes that prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability, religion, and \nnational origin. In order to enforce these landmark laws, the Civil \nRights Division engages in a variety of litigation to fight \ndiscrimination in employment, housing and immigration. In particular, \nthe litigation brought by the Civil Rights Division under the Voting \nRights Act has had a profound influence on the electoral landscape in \nthe last three decades. As Senator Ashcroft emphatically stated at his \nconfirmation hearing: ``No part of the Department of Justice is more \nimportant than the Civil Rights Division.''\n  Senator Ashcroft's record proves that he believes in the mission of \nthe Civil Rights Division. He vigorously enforced civil rights laws as \nthe Attorney General and Governor of Missouri. He signed Missouri's \nfirst hate crimes statute. Not content to wait for the legislature to \nact, John Ashcroft made Missouri one of the first States to recognize \nMartin Luther King Day by issuing an executive order. He also led the \nfight to save Lincoln University, the Missouri university founded by \nAfrican-American Civil War veterans.\n  Furthermore, as the Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Ashcroft held the first hearing on \nracial profiling in the history of Congress. When asked at his \nconfirmation hearing about his priorities for the Justice Department, \nSenator Ashcroft cited the abolition of racial profiling as one of his \ntop two priorities.\n  I ask my colleagues to look to Senator Ashcroft's record and ignore \nthe propaganda generated by extremist lobbying groups. Under attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft, the Civil Rights Division will be in good hands.\n  Senator Ashcroft stated at his confirmation hearing that the \nparamount civil right is personal safety. The Attorney General is \nAmerica's chief law enforcement officer, and managing the Criminal \nDivision is the most important aspect of the Attorney General's duties. \nThe Criminal Division oversees thousands of federal agents and is \ncharged with, among other things, investigating and prosecuting drug \ndealers, illegal gun traffickers, bank robbers, child pornographers, \ncomputer hackers, and terrorists. The Criminal Division has a visible \nand tangible effect on the lives of all Americans.\n  I have no doubt that, given his extensive experience as a public \nservant, Senator Ashcroft understands and appreciates the mission of \nthe Criminal Division. Throughout his long career as Missouri Attorney \nGeneral, Missouri Governor, and United States Senator, Senator Ashcroft \nhas been a strong advocate of tough and effective criminal law \nenforcement.\n  Perhaps the greatest threat facing our nation today is the scourge of \nillegal drugs. For years, Senator Ashcroft has been a leader in the \nfight against illegal drugs. In 1996, Senator Ashcroft helped enact the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, which increased penalties \nfor the manufacture and trafficking of methamphetamine. Senator \nAshcroft also helped enact federal laws that increased mandatory \nminimum sentences for methamphetamine offenses and authorized courts to \norder persons convicted of methamphetamine offenses to pay for the \ncosts of laboratory cleanup. Last year, Senator Ashcroft authored \nlegislation to target additional resources to local law enforcement \nagencies to fight methamphetamine.\n  Senator Ashcroft also understands that drug treatment and prevention \nare vital components of an effective drug strategy. In last year's \nmethamphetamine legislation, Senator Ashcroft included funding for drug \neducation and prevention programs, including resources for school-based \nanti-methamphetamine initiatives. As Attorney General and Governor of \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft increased funding for anti-drug programs by \nalmost 40%, the vast majority of which was for education, prevention \nand treatment.\n  Senator Ashcroft has also made clear that prosecuting gun crimes will \nbe a top priority of the Ashcroft Justice Department. Unfortunately, \ngun prosecutions have not always been a priority for the Department of \nJustice. For example, between 1992 and 1998, prosecutions of defendants \nwho use a firearm in the commission of a felony dropped nearly 50 \npercent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800. In the Senate, John \nAshcroft was one of the leaders in fighting gun crimes. To reverse the \ndecline in gun prosecutions by the Justice Department, Senator Ashcroft \nsponsored legislation to authorize $50 million to hire additional \nfederal prosecutors and agents to increase the federal prosecution of \ncriminals who use guns.\n  In addition, Senator Ashcroft authored legislation to prohibit \njuveniles from possessing assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition \nclips. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Ashcroft juvenile assault \nweapons ban in May of 1999.\n  Senator Ashcroft voted for legislation that prohibits any person \nconvicted of even misdemeanor acts of domestic violence from possessing \na firearm, and he voted for legislation to extend the Brady Act to \nprohibit persons who commit violent crimes as juveniles from possessing \nfirearms. In order to close the so-called ``gun show loophole,'' \nSenator Ashcroft voted for legislation, which I authored, to require \nmandatory instant background checks for all firearm purchases at gun \nshows.\n  In order to maintain tough federal penalties, Senator Ashcroft \nsponsored legislation to require a five-year mandatory minimum prison \nsentence for federal gun crimes and for legislation to encourage \nschools to expel students who bring guns to school. Senator Ashcroft \nvoted for the ``Gun-Free Schools Zone Act'' that prohibits the \npossession of a firearm in a school zone, and he voted for legislation \nto require gun dealers to offer child safety locks and other gun safety \ndevices for sale. I have no doubt that with John Ashcroft as Attorney \nGeneral, the Justice Department will target and prosecute gun crimes \nwith unprecedented zeal.\n  To his credit, Senator Ashcroft understands that the vast majority of \ncriminal law enforcement takes place at the state and local level. \nGiven his tenure as Missouri Attorney General and Governor, Senator \nAshcroft appreciates the important role that the federal government can \nplay in supporting state and local authorities by providing resources \nand training. He also understands that the Justice Department should \nprovide such support without intruding into traditional areas of state \nsovereignty.\n  In the Senate, Senator Ashcroft steadfastly supported state and local \nlaw enforcement. He won enactment of a bill that extends higher \neducation financial assistance to spouses and dependent children of law \nenforcement officers killed in the line of duty. He was the principal \nproponent of the ``Care for Police Survivors Act,'' a measure that \nincreases benefits to the survivors of public safety officers killed in \nthe line of duty. Along with Senator Biden, Senator Ashcroft co-\nsponsored legislation to reauthorize the COPS program.\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\n  In addition, Senator Ashcroft cosponsored the ``Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 1995.'' This act allocated $1 billion to state and \nlocal law enforcement to update and computerize criminal records, \nautomated fingerprint systems, and DNA identification operations. John \nAshcroft also cosponsored the ``21st Century Justice Act'' which \nincluded Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing \nIncentive Grants. These grants have provided federal resources to \nStates to build prisons to incarcerate violent and repeat offenders. \nGiven his record, it is no surprise that law enforcement groups such as \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District \nAttorneys Association, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations are united in their support for Senator Ashcroft's \nnomination.\n  The Civil Division represents the United States government, including \nexecutive departments and agencies, in civil litigation. First and \nforemost, the Civil Division defends the constitutionality of federal \nstatutes, regulations, and executive orders. The Civil Division also \nlitigates complex commercial cases. This litigation is especially \nimportant for property rights because the Civil Division represents the \nfederal government against claims that private property was taken for \npublic use without just compensation. In addition, the Civil Division \nrepresents the federal government in consumer litigation under various \nconsumer protection and public health statutes.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's experience as the Attorney General of Missouri \nprepared him well to oversee the Civil Division. John Ashcroft \nestablished the Consumer Affairs Division in the Missouri Attorney \nGeneral's office. He brought many consumer protection actions, \nincluding odometer tampering cases and financial pyramid schemes. In \nIllinois v. Abbott & Associates, Inc., Attorney General Ashcroft filed \na brief in the United States Supreme Court supporting the right of \nstate attorneys general to conduct antitrust investigations. In the \nSenate, John Ashcroft helped enact legislation to combat telemarketing \nscams against senior citizens.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft defended the \nconstitutionality of state laws. In 1993, he personally argued a case \nbefore the United States Supreme Court in defense of the \nconstitutionality of a Missouri statute. Few nominees for Attorney \nGeneral have been so qualified to oversee the Civil Division.\n  Created in 1909, the Environment and Natural Resources Division is \nthe Nation's chief environmental lawyer. It is responsible for \nlitigating cases ranging from the protection of endangered species to \nthe clean-up of hazardous waste sites. In addition to prosecuting \nenvironmental crimes, the Environment and Natural Resources Division \nensures that federal environmental laws are implemented in a fair and \nconsistent manner.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft aggressively enforced \nthat state's environmental protection laws. To cite but a few examples, \nAttorney General Ashcroft brought suit to prevent an electric company \nfrom causing oxygen levels in downstream waters to harm fish. He also \nsought to recover damages from the electric company.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft brought a successful action against the \nowner of an apartment complex for violations of the Missouri Clean \nWater Law relating to treatment of waste water, and he sued the owner \nof a trailer park for violations of the Missouri Clean Water Law.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft also filed numerous \nbriefs in the United States Supreme Court that advanced environmental \nprotections. For example:\n  In Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation \n& Development Commission, Attorney General Ashcroft filed a brief \nsupporting a California law that conditioned the construction of \nnuclear power plants on findings that adequate storage and disposal \nfacilities are available.\n  In Sporhase v. Nebraska, Attorney General Ashcroft endorsed the State \nof Nebraska's effort to stop defendants from transporting Nebraska \ngroundwater into Colorado without a permit.\n  In Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, \nInc., Attorney General Ashcroft filed a brief supporting the Natural \nResources Defense Council's position on tougher environmental \nregulations relating to storage of nuclear wastes.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft issued numerous legal \nopinions that furthered the enforcement of environmental laws. I would \nlike to describe a few of these formal opinions. In Attorney General \nOpinion No. 123-84, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an opinion that \nunderground injection wells constitute pollution of the waters of the \nstate and are subject to regulation by the Missouri Department of \nNatural Resources under the state's Clean Water Act. Attorney General \nAshcroft also opined that it would be unlawful to build or operate such \na well unless a permit had been obtained from the Clean Water \nCommission.\n  In Attorney General Opinion No. 67, Attorney General Ashcroft issued \nan opinion that operators of surface mines must obtain a permit for \neach year that the mine was un-reclaimed. In reaching this opinion, \nAttorney General Ashcroft determined that the operator of the mine must \nhave a permit continuously from the time mining operations begin until \nreclamation of the site is complete. Attorney General Ashcroft \nconcluded that the continuous permit requirement facilitated Missouri's \nintention ``to protect and promote the health, safety and general \nwelfare of the people of this state, and to protect the natural \nresources of the state from environmental harm.''\n  In Attorney General Opinion No. 189, Attorney General Ashcroft issued \nan opinion that Missouri's cities and counties had the authority to \nrequire that all solid waste be disposed of at approved solid waste \nrecovery facilities, rather than be buried in landfills. In rendering \nhis opinion, Attorney General Ashcroft gave credence to the arguments \nthat ``recycling of solid wastes results in fewer health hazards and \npollution problems than does disposal of the same types of wastes in \nlandfills'' and that ``public welfare is better served by burning solid \nwastes for generation of electricity, thus conserving scarce natural \nresources.'' To those who have irresponsibly charged that Senator \nAshcroft will not enforce our environmental laws, I say this: Look at \nhis record.\n  Mr. President, there are other offices in the Justice Department that \nare also very important. In the interest of time, however, I have \nfocused on a select few. My point today is a simple one--when this \nnomination is considered in light of the mission of the Department of \nJustice, it becomes apparent how well-qualified John Ashcroft is to be \nAttorney General.\n  In addition to placing in the record Senator Ashcroft's eminent \nqualifications, I would also like to correct the record surrounding a \nnumber of issues that have been raised by his critics. As Senator \nSessions has said, Senator Ashcroft has been called ``divisive'', but \nthat has been a result of a caricature created by extremist lobbying \ngroups who have spared nothing to demonize him. Webster includes in its \ndefinition of ``caricature'', ``a likeness or imitation that is that is \nso distorted or inferior as to seem ludicrous.'' The portrait of John \nAshcroft that has been painted by the People For the American Way and \nother like-motivated people and organizations is ludicrous. They \ndescribe a man that I do not recognize as John Ashcroft. Unlike their \ndemonization, the real John Ashcroft has the character and the \nintelligence to be a great Attorney General.\n  Before addressing some of the unfair attacks leveled against Senator \nAshcroft, I should say a word or two on standards. We have heard much \ndiscussion about the appropriate standard of ``advise and consent'' \nthat we should apply to the President's Cabinet nominees. \nUnfortunately, many people, knowing that opposing Senator Ashcroft on \nideological grounds would be unprecedented, appear to be manipulating \nthis standard so as to mask their true reasons for opposing this \nnomination. And those reasons, I must say, are purely ideological. \nProdded, and perhaps in some cases even threatened, by assorted left-\nwing extremist groups, those on the other side appear to oppose Senator \nAshcroft simply because he is a conservative.\n  The standard we should use is that which was applied to Attorney \nGeneral\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\nJanet Reno in 1993, and that standard has three parts. First, by \nlongstanding tradition in the Senate, we must afford the President a \nsignificant degree of deference to shape his Cabinet as he sees fit. \nThe election is over, President Bush won, and nothing will change that \nfact. Some have suggested that because the election was close and \ndivisive, we should be less deferential with respect to Cabinet \nnominees. Yet, I do not recall hearing that suggestion in 1993 after \nPresident Clinton won an extremely close and hard-fought election, an \nelection in which he failed to garner a majority of the popular vote. \nDespite that close election, every Republican in this body deferred to \nPresident Clinton and voted for Attorney General Reno.\n  The second prong of our standard focuses on the experience and \nqualifications of the nominee. No one can seriously contend that \nSenator Ashcroft lacks the experience and qualifications to serve as \nAttorney General. Indeed, few in our nation's history have come to the \npost of Attorney General with the qualifications and experience that \nSenator Ashcroft brings. In almost thirty years of public service, he \nhas served as a state attorney general, state governor, and United \nStates Senator. While Missouri Attorney General, he was elected by the \nother state attorneys general to head the National Association of \nAttorneys General, while Governor of Missouri, his fellow governors \nelected him chairman of the National Governors' Association, and while \na United States Senator, he served four years on the Judiciary \nCommittee. By comparison, Attorney General Reno came to the post as a \ncounty prosecutor. Yet, despite concerns about her qualifications, \nevery Republican in this body voted to confirm her.\n  The final prong of our standard requires us to ensure that the \nnominee possesses the necessary integrity and ethics to serve the \nAmerican people. Here, Senator Ashcroft is above reproach. He is, by \nall accounts, a man of absolute honesty and deep religious conviction. \nI know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that I knew \nPresident Bush had found the right person to enforce the laws of this \nnation when Senator Ashcroft raised his right hand and said, ``As a man \nof faith, I take my word and my integrity seriously. . . . when I swear \nto uphold the law, I will keep my oath, so help me God.''\n  Mr. President, as the senior senator from Vermont succinctly stated, \nalbeit when the president was a member of his own party, ``The \npresident should get to pick his own team. Unless the nominee is \nincompetent or some other major ethical or investigative problem arises \n. . . then the president gets the benefit of the doubt. There is no \ndoubt about this nominee's qualifications or integrity.'' That is the \nstandard that this Senate has always applied to Cabinet nominees. As \nothers have noted, over the entire history of the Senate, this body has \nvoted to reject only 9 nominations to the President's Cabinet, and only \n3 in the 20th Century. In 1993, Republicans applied that traditional \nstandard when we unanimously voted to confirm an attorney general \nnominee whose views on the death penalty, the Second Amendment, and \nabortion stood in stark contrast to our own. Unless those on the other \nside wish to engage in rank hypocrisy, this is the standard we should \napply to Senator Ashcroft today.\n\n  Opponents of Senator Ashcroft have accused him of being unable to set \naside his opinions on certain laws sufficiently in order to enforce \nthose laws. What's being proposed is to disqualify from high office \nanyone who has previously taken a side on a legislative proposal.\n  It is simply not true that a legislator is so tainted by efforts to \nchange laws that thereafter he or she cannot perform the duties of \nattorney general. Outside this Chamber, and outside of the offices of \nthe left-wing liberal group's offices, Americans understand that people \ncan take on different roles and responsibilities when they are given \ndifferent positions. Americans know that lawyers can become judges, \nwelders can become foremen, engineers can become managers, and school \nteachers can become school board leaders. And Americans know that a \nSenator, whose job is to propose and vote on new laws, can become an \nAttorney General, whose job is to enforce those laws that are duly \npassed.\n  There aren't many people who know as much about the different roles \nin government as John Ashcroft. He has been in the executive branch as \nMissouri Attorney General for 8 years. He has been chief executive as \nMissouri's Governor for 8 years. And he has been in the legislative \nbranch as a United States Senator for 6 years. Each of these positions \nhave required an understanding of the differing roles assumed by the \nthree branches of government.\n  It is in this context that John Ashcroft told us what he will do as \nAttorney General. He said he will enforce the laws as written, and \nuphold the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court. This is a \nconcise yet profound statement about the proper role of the Attorney \nGeneral. And it is more than just a statement, because it is backed up \nby the unquestioned integrity of John Ashcroft, a man who will do what \nhe says. He will enforce the law as it is written, even in those \ninstances where he would have written it differently.\n  Still, some members of this body are unconvinced. They apparently \nthink that John Ashcroft will not do what he said. Of course they would \nnot call him a liar at least not explicitly, anyway. They are saying \nthat, try as he might, he simply cannot enforce the law because he \nwants so badly for the law to say something other than what it actually \nsays.\n  Some who have adopted this view are accusing John Ashcroft of \nchanging his views. They accuse him of having a ``confirmation \nconversion.'' By this they mean that people who take off their \nlegislator's cap, and put on an attorney general's hat, cannot adapt \nfrom the role of law writer to law enforcer without being insincere. \nThis is a ludicrous proposition. John Ashcroft has not undergone a \nconfirmation conversion; he has been the victim of an interest group \ndistortion.\n  Members of this body know something that the public may not: There is \nan unspoken rule that a nominee does not answer questions in public \nbetween their nomination and their confirmation hearing. This is done \nout of respect for the Senate--whose job it is, after all, to listen to \nthe nominee rather than the media. But savvy special interest groups \ntake advantage of this interim time to wage a war of words against \nnominees they dislike. Many of those words are exaggerated or \nunsubstantiated attacks. The result can be the fabrication of a false \npublic record.\n  Mr. President, I am asking my fellow Senators to resist the \ntemptation to label it a ``conversion'' when a nominee simply corrects \nthe misperceptions created by special interest groups. I am asking my \ncolleagues to look at John Ashcroft's real record, and at his own words \nin his confirmation hearings, and in his answers to the voluminous \nwritten questions--rather than relying on the press releases of issue \nadvocates.\n  John Ashcroft is committed to enforcing the civil rights of all \nAmericans. He has stated that the Civil Rights Division is the most \nimportant division of the Justice Department and that he will make \nenforcement of civil rights a priority during his tenure as Attorney \nGeneral. Contrary to the attacks of his critics, Senator Ashcroft has \ndemonstrated his commitment to equality under the law throughout his \ncareer. For example, as Governor, he signed Missouri's first hate \ncrimes statute into law. He signed Missouri's Martin Luther King \nHoliday into law and also signed the law establishing Scott Joplin's \nhouse as Missouri's first and only historic site honoring an African-\nAmerican. John Ashcroft led the fight to save an independent Lincoln \nUniversity, founded by African-American soldiers. He also established \nan award emphasizing academic excellence in the name of George \nWashington Carver, a wonderful intellectual role model for all Missouri \nstudents. As Governor, John Ashcroft was presented with 9 panels for \njudicial appointment that contained minority candidates. In 8 of the 9 \ninstances, Ashcroft appointed a minority candidate to fill the post, \nand he appointed both of the minority candidates on the 9th panel to \njudicial positions at a later date. He appointed many African-Americans \nto Missouri's courts, including David Mason, Jimmy Edwards, Charles \nShaw and Michael Calvin, in St. Louis. He also appointed\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\nthe first African-American judge on the Western Missouri Court of \nAppeals in Kansas City, Missouri's second highest court. This jurist, \nFerdinand Gaitan, now serves on the U.S. District Court for Western \nMissouri.\n  He continued this leadership in the Senate where he convened the only \nSenate hearing on Racial Profiling (March 30, 2000) with Senator \nFeingold. During that hearing, Senator Ashcroft spoke out strongly on \nthe issue stating that ``[U]sing race broadly as profiler in lieu of \nindividualized suspicion is, I believe, an unconstitutional practice.'' \nHe has supported efforts to study the issue and during his hearing \ntestified that as Attorney General, he would continue the studies \nalready underway to examine racial and geographical disparities in \ndeath penalty cases. In short, John Ashcroft's record demonstrates his \nability to lead a Justice Department of which we can all be proud.\n  John Ashcroft will be committed to enforcing the civil rights laws \nprotecting every American's right to vote and participate in the \npolitical process. He has done so throughout his career. Some who \noppose Senator Ashcroft have charged that as Governor, John Ashcroft \nessentially blocked two bills that would have required the City of St. \nLouis Board of Election Commissioners to deputize private voter \nregistration volunteers. These bills were opposed by both democrats and \nrepublicans in St. Louis. It was opposed by the bipartisan St. Louis \nCounty Board of Election Commissioners, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen \nPresident Tom Villa, and St. Louis circuit attorney George Peach. Tom \nVilla was a noted Democratic leader, and St. Louis circuit attorney \nGeorge Peach was a Democrat who was the prosecutor in the St. Louis \narea. All of these people opposed the legislation. The recommendations \nof these officials was one of the reasons that John Ashcroft vetoed the \nbills.\n  It was insinuated during the hearings that these actions were taken \nout of some kind of partisan or racial motivation, because the City of \nSt. Louis is predominantly black and democratic. But this implication \nis seriously discredited by the history of voter registration in St. \nLouis and earlier federal court cases.\n  The city board has a long history of refusing to deputize private \nvoter registration deputies, long before John Ashcroft appointed anyone \nto that board. Indeed, in 1981 a lawsuit was filed against the members \nof the St. Louis board concerning the failure to deputize voter \nregistration deputies. The Federal District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri explicitly rejected charges of racial animus. The \ncourt found that the board properly refused to deputize volunteers to \nprevent fraud and ensure impartiality and administrative efficiency. \nMoreover, these conclusions were sustained by the 8th Circuit, in an \nopinion by Judge McMillan, a prominent African-American jurist.\n  Some have also claimed that then-Governor Ashcroft refused to appoint \na diverse group of commissioners to the Election Board. This is simply \nuntrue. Mr. Jerry Hunter, the former labor secretary of Missouri, \ntestified that Senator Ashcroft worked hard to increase black \nrepresentation on the St. Louis City Election Board, but his efforts \nwere stalled by state senators.\n  Mr. Hunter testified that, ``Governor Ashcroft's first black nominee \nfor the St. Louis City Election Board was rejected by the black state \nsenator, because that person did not come out of his organization.'' \nWhen then-Governor Ashcroft came up with a second black attorney, this \ncandidate was also rejected by two black state senators. As Mr. Hunter \nstated, ``[F]rom the beginning, any efforts to make changes in the St. \nLouis City Election Board were forestalled because the state senators \nwanted people from their own organization.'' Apparently for these state \nsenators the political spoils system was more important than the voters \nof St. Louis.\n  Finally, some have implied that these voter registration issues will \nmake Senator Ashcroft less able to deal with allegations of voting \nimproprieties resulting from the Florida vote in the presidential \nelection. Yet Senator Ashcroft has repeatedly testified, ``I will \ninvestigate any alleged voting rights violation that has credible \nevidence. . . . I have no reason not to go forward, and would not \nrefuse go forward for any reason other than a conclusion that there \nwasn't credible evidence to pursue the case.'' Objective people should \nhave no doubt that Senator Ashcroft will be vigorous in his enforcement \nof the Voting Rights Act and related statutes.\n  Critics of Senator Ashcroft have also unfairly criticized his \ntestimony about his involvement with the desegregation cases in St. \nLouis and Kansas City. Senator Ashcroft gave complete and responsive \nanswers to questions about these cases. Any assertions to the contrary \ndistort Senator Ashcroft's responses to a flurry of questions about \ndifficult and complicated cases in which he was involved over a decade \nago.\n\n  The Missouri school desegregation cases are extremely complex and \ninvolve a variety of different factual and constitutional issues. \nPerhaps Senator Ashcroft made some preliminary statements that were \nincomplete, or not fully clear, but when questioned further, he \nclarified his answers in an accurate and fair manner. Moreover, in an \nextended response to a written question, he fully detailed Missouri's \nliability and involvement with the case. Far from being misleading, \nSenator Ashcroft's answers get to the heart of the distinctions in the \ncase between inter- and intra-district liability for segregation.\n  Some complain that Senator Ashcroft denied that the state was a party \nto the lawsuit, however, the initial suit was filed in 1972 and did not \nmake the State a party. Eventually the State was made party to the \nlawsuit in 1977 and Senator Ashcroft acknowledged this repeatedly in \nhis answers.\n  Second, Senator Ashcroft's critics argue that Senator Ashcroft denied \nthe State's liability. The State was found liable for school \nsegregation in St. Louis, but only for intra-district segregation \nwithin the City of St. Louis. The remedy that the district court \nordered was inter-district, between St. Louis and its suburbs. The \nState was never found liable for the inter-district segregation that \nwould justify such a far-ranging remedy involving the suburbs. Then-\nAttorney General Ashcroft was battling against this inter-district \nremedy, and it is fully accurate to say that the State was never found \nliable for inter-district segregation.\n  Third, opponents of Senator Ashcroft unfairly charge that Senator \nAshcroft misleadingly stated that he followed all court orders in the \ndesegregation cases. Of course, these opponents cannot say that John \nAshcroft did not follow the orders, and must admit that John Ashcroft \ncomplied with the terms of the orders. They can only criticize ``his \nvigorous and repeated appeals.'' These appeals were undertaken in his \nrole as attorney general--as the legal representative of the State John \nAshcroft had to consider the State's best interests and raise all \nreasonable legal appeals, which he did. To make a legal appeal is not \nto disobey a court order. In fact many court orders were complied with \nwhile the appeals were pending.\n  Fourth, the criticisms of Senator Ashcroft's actions strongly and \nunfairly imply that he was indifferent to the problems of segregation. \nNothing could be further from the truth. Senator Ashcroft testified \nthat ``I have always opposed segregation. I have never opposed \nintegration. I believe that segregation is inconsistent with the 14th \nAmendment's guaranteeing of equal protection. I supported integrating \nthe schools.'' What Senator Ashcroft opposed was court-ordered remedies \nthat we now know to have been wildly expensive and ineffective. Test \nresults have declined, graduation rates have remained at a dismal 30 \npercent, and the percentage of black students has remained about the \nsame in St. Louis schools. All of this for the price-tag of $1.7 \nbillion. It is hard to see how a person who opposed this plan can be \nconsidered against educational equality. The result of court-ordered \ndesegregation in St. Louis is just one example of why, as Bob Woodson \ntestified, a significant majority of African-Americans are against \nforced busing for integration.\n  John Ashcroft will stand behind the commitments he made during his \nconfirmation and be a staunch defender of the civil rights of all \nAmericans. Senator Ashcroft has demonstrated his commitment to equality \nthrough his\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\nrecord as Attorney General, Governor and Senator. Contrary to his \ncritics who have distorted his record on hiring, John Ashcroft has been \ndeeply committed to promoting equal access to government positions \nduring his tenure as both Attorney General and Governor of Missouri. \nWitnesses testifying at the hearing made this commitment clear.\n  Mr. Jerry Hunter, former labor secretary of Missouri, testified that, \n``Like President-elect George W. Bush, Senator Ashcroft followed a \npolicy of affirmative access and inclusiveness during his service to \nthe state of Missouri as attorney general, his two terms as governor, \nand his one term in the United States Senate. During the eight years \nthat Senator Ashcroft was attorney general for the state of Missouri, \nhe recruited and hired minority lawyers. During his tenure as governor, \nhe appointed blacks to numerous boards and commissions . . . [B]ut I \nwould say to you on a personal note, Senator Ashcroft went out of his \nway to find African-Americans to consider for appointments.''\n  Mr. Hunter further elaborated that, ``When Governor Ashcroft's term \nended in January of 1993, he had appointed more African-Americans to \nstate court judgeships than any previous governor in the history of the \nstate of Missouri. Governor Ashcroft was also bipartisan in his \nappointment of state court judges. He appointed Republicans, Democrats \nand independents. One of Governor Ashcroft's black appointees in St. \nLouis was appointed, notwithstanding the fact that he was not a \nRepublican and that he was on a panel with a well-known white \nRepublican. Of the nine panels of nominees for state court judgeships, \nwhich included at least one African-American, Governor Ashcroft \nappointed eight black judges from those panels.''\n  Judge David Mason, who worked with Ashcroft in the Missouri Attorney \nGeneral's office stated, ``[A]s time went on, I begin to get a real \nfeel for this man and where his heart is. When the subject of Martin \nLuther King Day came up, I was there. And I recall that he issued the \nexecutive order to establish the first King Day, rather than wait for \nthe legislature to do it. Because, as you may recall, some of you, when \nthe Congress passed the holiday, they passed it at a time when the \nMissouri legislature may not have been able to have the first holiday \ncontemporaneously with it. So he passed a King holiday by executive \norder. He said, in doing so, he wanted his children to grow up in a \nstate that observed someone like Martin Luther King.''\n  Bob Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise uses \nfaith-based organizations to help troubled young people turn their \nlives around. Mr. Woodson testified: ``Senator John Ashcroft is the \nonly person who, from the time he came into this body, reached out to \nus. He's on the board of Teen Challenge. He's raised money for them. He \nsponsored a charitable choice legislation that will stop the government \nfrom trying to close them down because they don't have trained \nprofessionals as drug counselors. We have an 80 percent success rate of \nthese faith-based organizations with a $60-a-day cost, when the \nconventional, therapeutically secular program cost $600 a day with a 6 \nto 10 percent success rate. Senator Ashcroft has gone with us. He has \nfought with us. And this legislation would help us.'' Mr. Woodsen \nfurther stated that ``As a consequence, day before yesterday, 150 black \nand Hispanic transformed drug addicts got on buses from all over this \nnation and came here to support him. Fifty of them came from Victory \nTemple throughout the state of Texas, spent two days on a Greyhound bus \nat their own expense to come here to voice strong support for Senator \nAshcroft.''\n  Congressman J.C. Watts also testified: ``I've worked with [John \nAshcroft] on legislation concerning poor communities, under-served \ncommunities. I have always found John Ashcroft to have nothing but the \nutmost respect and dignity for one's skin color. I heard John say \nyesterday in some of his testimony that his faith requires him to \nrespect one's skin color. And I think that's the way it should be. [I]n \nmy dealings with John, I have had nothing but the utmost respect for \nhim when it comes to his dealings with people of different skin \ncolor.''\n  These testimonials and Senator Ashcroft's record of hiring and \nappointments as Missouri Attorney General and Governor demonstrate \nbeyond any reasonable doubt that he will be committed to equal \nopportunity as Attorney General of the United States.\n  Many have expressed concerns about Senator Ashcroft's actions with \nregard to conducting a telephone interview with a magazine called \nSouthern Partisan. Their concern is what message that interview might \nhave sent to the country. It is clear, however, that Senator Ashcroft \nhas forthrightly and forcefully condemned racism and discrimination, \nand he has left no doubt or ambiguity regarding his views on that \nmatter.\n  During his confirmation hearings, Senator Ashcroft said, ``Let me \nmake something as plain as I can make it. Discrimination is wrong. \nSlavery was abhorrent. Fundamental to my belief in freedom and liberty \nis that these are God-given rights.'' And in his responses to written \nquestions, he said, ``I reject racism in all its forms. I find racial \ndiscrimination abhorrent, and against everything that I believe in.'' \nIt is clear to me that John Ashcroft believes in equal treatment under \nthe law for everyone. He believes in it, and he has committed to fight \nto make it a reality for all Americans.\n  Now, as to the magazine itself, Senator Ashcroft contritely admitted \nthat he does not know very much about it. He confessed that he should \nhave done more research about it before talking to them. And he said \nthat he did not intend his telephone interview--or any other interview \nhe has participated in during his career--as an automatic endorsement \nof the editorial positions of those publications. John Ashcroft went \neven further than that. He said, ``I condemn those things which are \ncondemnable'' about Southern Partisan magazine. This was a strong \nstatement against any unacceptable ideas discussed in that publication. \nAnd it was the strongest statement possible from someone who did not \npersonally know the facts.\n  Despite Senator Ashcroft's contriteness and strong words, some \nSenators and interest groups have demanded that Senator Ashcroft go out \non a limb and add his derision based upon an acceptance at face value \nof all the negative allegations concerning that magazine. In my \nopinion, Mr. President, this led to one of the most profound moments of \nthe confirmation hearings. A member of the Committee pushed Senator \nAshcroft to label the Southern Partisan Magazine as ``racist''--even \nafter Senator Ashcroft explained that he did not know whether that was \ntrue. The profound part was John Ashcroft's response. He said, ``I know \nthey've been accused of being racist. I have to say this, Senator: I \nwould rather be falsely accused of being a racist than to falsely \naccuse someone else of being a racist.'' This exchange tells volumes \nabout John's moral character, deep sense of fairness, and his fitness \nfor the office of Attorney General. It would have been a lot easier for \nhim just to say Yes, I agree with anyone who uses that term about \nsomeone else. Doing so would have saved him from further bashing by the \nCommittee and the press. It would have been politically expedient. But \nJohn Ashcroft choose to take the high road, not to heap disdain onto \nsomething he didn't know about just because it would have suited his \ninterests to do so. This was a vivid example of good judgment and good \ncharacter.\n\n  This is not to say that John Ashcroft defended anything about the \nmagazine. Clearly he did not. In fact, when Senator Biden asked him \nwhether the magazine was condemnable because it sells T-shirts that \nimply that Lincoln's assassin did a good thing, he answered: ``If they \ndo that, I condemn'' it. And he clarified that ``Abraham Lincoln is my \nfavorite political figure in the history of this country.'' What John \nAshcroft did was state his absolute intolerance for racism and bigotry, \nand he did so honestly without creating a straw man, a scapegoat or a \nfall guy.\n  I think we need to ask anyone who is not satisfied with John \nAshcroft's answers what they really want. What do his accusers think \njustice is? I surely hope that no one in this body would say that \njustice means the knee-jerk condemnation of things they do not know \nabout, so long as that condemnation is politically expedient.\n  John Ashcroft's testimony on this issue demonstrates that he will be \na\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nfair and principled Attorney General. As he told the Judiciary \nCommittee, ``I believe racism is wrong. I repudiate it. I repudiate \nracist organizations. I'm not a member of any of them. I don't \nsubscribe to them. And I reject them.'' These are straightforward words \nfrom an honest man. I look forward to having such a man running our \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The anti-Ashcroft groups also took advantage of a controversy \nconcerning Bob Jones University in order to wage a ``guilt by \nassociation'' attack on John Ashcroft. John Ashcroft's visit to the \nschool was not controversial when it occurred in May 1999. In fact, \npoliticians of both parties had spoken there prior to Senator Ashcroft. \nEarly in 2000, however, approximately eight months after John \nAshcroft's visit, Bob Jones University became a flash point during the \nprimary election because opponents of then-Governor George W. Bush \naccused Bush of associating with an anti-Catholic statement that \nappeared on the University's Internet site.\n  Following the flap over Bush's visit, John Ashcroft said, ``I didn't \nreally know they had these positions,'' and ``[f]rankly, I reject the \nanti-Catholic position of Bob Jones University categorically.'' Despite \nhaving repudiated the offending statement, John Ashcroft faced a new \nround of criticism for his appearance after he was nominated to be \nAttorney General. The special interest groups aligned against him \nattempted to associate John Ashcroft with every form of bigotry and \nintolerance they could.\n  Any controversy over John Ashcroft's speech at Bob Jones University \nshould have been put to rest by John Ashcroft's testimony at his \nconfirmation hearings. That's when we finally got the chance to ask \nSenator Ashcroft what he thought. And Senator Ashcroft made it clear \nthat he ``reject[s] any racial intolerance or religious intolerance \nthat has been associated with[,] or is associated with[,]'' Bob Jones \nUniversity. He couldn't have been more firm.\n  Senator Ashcroft went on to explain that ``[he] want[s] to make it \nvery clear that [he] reject[s] racial and religious intolerance.'' He \nsaid he does not endorse any bigoted views by virtue of ``having made \nan appearance in any faith or any congregation.'' He said, for example, \nthat he has visited churches which do not ``allow women in certain \nroles,'' and that he does not endorse that view, either.\n  Apparently, Ashcroft's answer eliminated any doubt about his personal \nviews. As Senator Leahy told Senator Ashcroft during the hearing, ``I \nmade my position very clear yesterday on how I feel about you on any \nquestions of racial or religious bias. I stated that neither I nor \nanybody on this committee would make that claim about you.'' Even \nCatholic groups were satisfied. A spokesperson for the Catholic League \nsaid, ``In short, the controversy over Ashcroft is much ado about \nnothing as far as the Catholic League is concerned.''\n  Some outside groups had questioned the meaning of the speech that \nSenator Ashcroft gave during his visit to Bob Jones University. Senator \nAshcroft explained during the confirmation hearing that the phrase ``We \nhave no king but Jesus,'' was a representation of what colonists were \nsaying at the time of the American Revolution. He said that the point \nof his speech was ``the idea that the ultimate authority of the \nultimate idea of freedom in America is not governmentally derived.'' I \ndon't think anyone in the Senate would take issue with that. It is an \nunderstatement to say that this idea is well-documented in the \nFounders' writings.\n  Lacking any basis to criticize John Ashcroft's May 1999 appearance, \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee went in search of controversy by \nasking Senator Ashcroft if he would go to Bob Jones University again if \ninvited as Attorney General. He said he would ``speak at places where \n[he] believe[s] [he] can unite people and move them in the right \ndirection.'' In saying that, he contritely explained that his \nconfirmation hearings--``and the prelude to th[o]se hearings''--taught \nhim to be ``sensitive at a higher level now than [he] was before, that \nthe attorney general in particular needs to be careful about what he or \nshe does.'' Senator Ashcroft said that, if confirmed, he ``would be \nsensitive to accepting invitations so as to not allow a presumption to \nbe made that I was endorsing things that would divide people instead of \nunite them.'' This answer apparently did not satisfy some on the \nCommittee who have since argued that he should have pledged never to \nreturn to the University.\n  But as Senator Ashcroft explained at his hearing, it is shortsighted \nto make a pledge not to go somewhere just because you disagree with \nthem. John Ashcroft pointed out that Bob Jones University has \n``abandoned the policy on interracial dating which was offensive'' \nafter that policy became a focus of attention last year. I think John \nAshcroft was contrite about what he learned and correct not to rule out \nvisiting places where he thinks his presence could be a force for \npositive change.\n  There has been much talk during the nominations process and in the \npress about the ``Ashcroft Standard.'' This is a catch-phrase invented \nby opponents of Senator Ashcroft who wish to create the impression that \nthere is something unseemly about a senator vigorously exercising his \nconstitutional duty to advise and give consent to executive branch \nnominees. But the Ashcroft Standard is strawman--created only so that \nit might be criticized.\n  It is telling that this so-called Ashcroft Standard has been left \nundefined by those who invoke it. Its very hollowness is meant to evoke \nsomething inappropriate and suspect a way of evaluating far outside of \nthe mainstream. Apparently this Standard is to be feared, because my \ncolleagues repeatedly stated during the hearings that they would be \nmagnanimous in not applying the Ashcroft Standard to John Ashcroft \nhimself. But I suspect that John Ashcroft would pass the Ashcroft \nstandard with flying colors.\n  In fact the criteria that Senator Ashcroft used to evaluate executive \nbranch nominees are entirely appropriate and in keeping with the \nSenate's duty to give ``advice and consent'' to the President.\n  For instance, John Ashcroft applied his ``Standard'' to confirm all \nbut 15 of President Clinton's 1,636 nominees. He voted to approve every \nCabinet nomination made by President Clinton. Of President Clinton's \n230 judicial nominees, Senator Ashcroft voted to confirm 218. There is \nalso an underlying insinuation that the Ashcroft Standard is tinged \nwith racial bias--and yet Senator Ashcroft voted to confirm 26 of 28 \nAfrican-American judicial nominees.\n  With so many of President Clinton's nominees getting past the \nAshcroft Standard, some might argue that it's far too lenient, but that \nis the nature of the Senate's role. The President is thought to have \nsignificant leeway in choosing executive branch officials. The Senate \ngives advice and consent, but with great deference to the president's \nchoice. As Hamilton wrote in the Federalist number 76,\n\n       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the \n     Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence \n     would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \n     operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  The advice and consent role of the Senate must be exercised with an \neye to the moral character of the nominee and his suitability for the \noffice to which he is nominated. But it is a role that must be \nexercised with some natural deference to the prerogatives of the \nPresident. Indeed, this is a deference that has not been shown to \nPresident Bush during Senator Ashcroft's four days of hearings followed \nby more than 350 written questions.\n  The crux of the Senate's confirmation role is to not to quibble with \nthe policy preferences of the President's nominees, but rather to \nevaluate the character and moral fitness of the nominee. Indeed, I ask \nmyself when presented with a nominee whether this person will \nfaithfully execute the office to which they have been appointed, \nupholding the laws of the United States in the given position. I \nbelieve that Senator Ashcroft has applied similar criterion when \nevaluating nominees. This is not a sinister standard, but rather a \nmostly ordinary one.\n  When this question is asked about Senator Ashcroft the answer is \nincredibly clear. As attorney general of Missouri John Ashcroft showed \ntime and\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\nagain that he was willing to uphold law with which he disagreed. John \nAshcroft testified, ``I understand that being attorney general means \nenforcing the laws as they are written, not enforcing my own personal \npreference; it means advancing the national interest, not advocating my \npersonal interest.''\n  For instance, in 1979 John Ashcroft issued an attorney general's \nopinion stating that under the state constitution and the law of \nMissouri, a local school board of education had no legal authority to \ngrant permission for the distribution of religious publications to the \nstudent body on school grounds. In another situation, against the \ndemands of pro-life advocates, then-attorney general Ashcroft directed \nthe State of Missouri to maintain the confidentiality of abortion \nrecords because a fair reading of the law required it.\n  Senator Ashcroft has not only testified that he will follow laws with \nwhich he disagrees, he has repeatedly shown that he does follow such \nlaws. He has exhibited probity in office as attorney general, governor \nand senator. It is hard to imagine that he will not execute the office \nof United States Attorney General with equal integrity and commitment. \nIndeed, I am certain that Senator Ashcroft passes the much maligned \nAshcroft Standard.\n  So what is the Ashcroft Standard anyway? I admit that I am not quite \nsure. Is it a careful review of the nominee's written record? A \njudgment about how the nominee will enforce the law? A healthy dose of \ndeference to the executive prerogative? An appreciation for diversity? \nThese are the standards that I saw applied by Senator Ashcroft.\n  The opponents of Senator Ashcroft have placed considerable emphasis \non several specific nominations which I will discuss in turn.\n  John Ashcroft's opponents have mischaracterized his actions with \nrespect to the James Hormel nomination, and have fabricated innuendo \naimed at tarnishing John Ashcroft's 30-year record of fairness with \nrespect to employment of people without regard to sexual orientation.\n  I supported James Hormel's nomination as Ambassador to Luxembourg. I \nthought he was qualified for that post. At the same time, however, I \nrespected the fact that others in this body, including Senator \nAshcroft, did not share my opinion. I cannot conclude--as some people \nhave--that because Senator Ashcroft and I disagreed, that Senator \nAshcroft's views, which were based on the totality of the record, were \nnot valid. I have been in public service long enough to understand that \nthoughtful people can have honest differences of opinion on such \nmatters without holding unsupportable or fundamentally biased points of \nview.\n  Now, there has been a great deal of confusion about Senator \nAshcroft's role in the Hormel nomination. Outside special interest \ngroups--which are trying to derail Senator Ashcroft's nomination have \naccused him of singlehandedly blocking or stopping James Hormel's \nnomination simply because of Hormel's sexual orientation. These charges \nare simply false. Although, as John Ashcroft told the Judiciary \nCommittee, he voted against the nomination when it came to a vote in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, he did nothing to stop that \nnomination. John Ashcroft did not block a Senate vote on Mr. Hormel's \nnomination. In fact, Senator Ashcroft did not do anything to keep James \nHormel's nomination from progressing. It was Senator Hutchinson who put \na hold on the vote. In a letter dated January 24, 2001, Senator \nHutchinson told Ashcroft that ``I feel it is important to set the \nrecord straight that you were in no way involved in the effort to delay \nMr. Hormel's consideration by the full Senate.''\n  So let's look beyond the smokescreen of unsupported innuendo to \nexamine what we really know about John Ashcroft. During the \nconfirmation hearings, Senator Leahy asked John Ashcroft directly about \nhis motives with respect to the James Hormel nomination. Senator Leahy \nasked, ``Did you block his nomination from coming to a vote because he \nis gay?'' And Senator Ashcroft said, ``I did not.'' He could not have \nbeen more clear. And when a man of John Ashcroft's integrity makes such \na clear statement, we can take him at his word.\n  Of course, opponents of John Ashcroft do not want to take him as his \nword. Some outside special interest groups are trying to use his Hormel \nnomination vote to paint a false portrait of a man who acts in a biased \nway against homosexuals. But there is absolutely no evidence in the \nrecord to support that accusation. Senator Ashcroft made it very clear, \nboth during his hearing and in his responses to numerous written \nquestions, that ``sexual orientation has never been something that I've \nused in hiring in any of the jobs, in any of the offices I've held.''\n  In an effort to cloud this crystal-clear statement, the forces \nopposing Ashcroft presented to the media--not to the Judiciary \nCommittee--a man named Paul Offner, who claimed that John Ashcroft \nasked him about sexual orientation 16 years ago in an interview. Mr. \nOffner's accusations have been entirely rebutted by two eyewitnesses \npresent during that interview, both of whom have said that John \nAshcroft never asked Mr. Offner--or any of the many other people he \ninterviewed for jobs--about sexual preference. Carl Koupal, who sat in \non numerous interviews with John Ashcroft as head of Ashcroft's \ngubernatorial transition team, said, ``I can say John Ashcroft did not \nask that question of him or any other candidate we spoke to.'' Another \nAshcroft aide, Duncan Kincheloe, said, ``It's inconceivable to me, and \nI'm certain I would remember if it had been asked. I've never heard him \nask about that, and I've sat through dozens and dozens of interviews \nwith him.'' This evidence should lay to rest any questions about John \nAshcroft's past record of fairness with respect to sexual orientation.\n  In addition to that past record, we also have Senator Ashcroft's \nclear pledge for the future. He told the Judiciary Committee in no \nuncertain terms that he ``will enforce the law equally without regard \nto sexual orientation if appointed and confirmed as attorney general.'' \nHe also promised that sexual preference ``will not be a consideration \nin hiring at the Department of Justice'' if he is confirmed. And this \nstatement reflects more than his promise to uphold current policy; it \nreflects John Ashcroft's own judgment. He said, ``Even if the executive \norder [barring the consideration of sexual orientation as relevant to \nhiring] would be repealed, I would still not consider sexual \norientation in hiring at the Department of Justice because I don't \nbelieve it relevant to the responsibilities.'' Now, that is a very \nstrong statement, Mr. President. Especially because it comes from a \nperson of unquestioned integrity.\n  The facts described above convince me completely that John Ashcroft \nwill always act fairly in his law enforcement decisions and hiring \ndecisions to people regardless of sexual orientation.\n  While reasonable minds can differ and come to different judgments on \nthe matter, there were many legitimate reasons to vote against \nconfirmation for Judge White. In fact, every Republican thought it was \nappropriate to do so. Several of my colleagues have argued that Senator \nAshcroft distorted Judge White's record and wrongly painted him as pro-\ncriminal and anti-law enforcement, but many of us have reviewed Judge \nWhite's record and were greatly troubled by his dissenting opinions in \nseveral death penalty cases. In these cases Judge White displayed a \nreal inclination to overturn death sentences, even when they were \ncalled for by law.\n  For instance in the Johnson case, the defendant was convicted on four \ncounts of first-degree murder for killing three officers and the wife \nof the sheriff. Johnson was sentenced to death on all counts. On \nappeal, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the decision, but Judge White \ndissented arguing for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of \ncounsel. Judge White thought that Johnson deserved further opportunity \nto present a defense based on post-traumatic stress disorder. But the \nmajority showed that there was no credible evidence that Johnson \nsuffered from this disorder. Rather, it was clear that defense counsel \nhad fabricated a story that was quickly disproved at trial. For \ninstance, defense counsel stated that Johnson had placed a perimeter of \ncans and strings and had deflated the tires of his car. At trial, \ntestimony revealed that police officers had taken these actions, not \nthe defendant.\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\n  Further, Congressman Kenneth Hulshof, the prosecutor in the Johnson \ncase testified at Senator Ashcroft's hearings that it was almost \nimpossible to make out an argument for ineffective assistance of \ncounsel because the defendant ``hired counsel of his own choosing. He \npicked from our area in mid-Missouri what . . . I referred to as a \ndream team.''\n  Judge White has every right to pen a dissent in Johnson and other \ncases involving the death penalty. Similarly, every senator has the \nduty to evaluate these opinions as part of Judge White's judicial \nrecord. And that's just what Senator Ashcroft did. At no time did \nSenator Ashcroft derogate Judge White's background.\n  I consider Judge White to be a decent man with an impressive personal \nbackground. He has accomplished a great deal and come up from humble \nbeginnings. But his record of dissenting in death penalty cases \ntroubled me enough to vote against his confirmation.\n  Many of my colleagues have impugned Senator Ashcroft's motives for \nvoting against Judge White. But Judge White's nomination was strongly \nopposed by many of Senator Ashcroft's constituents and also by major \nlaw enforcement groups, including the National Sheriffs' Association \nand the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs.\n  Sheriff Kenny Jones, whose wife and colleagues were killed by \nJohnson, testified, ``I opposed Judge White's nomination to the federal \nbench, and I asked Senator Ashcroft to join me because of Judge White's \nopinion on a death penalty case . . . In his opinion, Judge White urged \nthat Johnson be given a second chance at freedom. I cannot understand \nhis reasoning. I know that the four people killed were not given a \nsecond chance.''\n  Since his nomination for a federal judgship was defeated, Judge White \nhas continued to dissent in criminal cases. For example, in Missouri v. \nJohns, 2000 WL 1779262, Dec. 5, 2000, a jury sentenced the defendant \nJohns to death for a murder in which he shot the victim seven times, \nincluding a fatal shot to the head. Following this murder, Johns evaded \ncapture for six months, during which time he committed two more murders \nand several robberies. When finally located by authorities, Johns took \na hostage, placed a gun to her head, and threaten to kill her.\n  Johns confessed to the initial killing, but claimed that he did so in \nself-defense, despite the fact that he shot the victim seven times. In \naddition, Johns confessed to the robbery and murder of the two other \nvictims during his flight from justice.\n  During the trial, Johns tried to introduce evidence that the victim \nhad a violent reputation, but the trial court excluded the proffered \nevidence on the grounds of relevancy. On appeal, Johns argued that the \ninability to admit evidence of the victim's reputation harmed his \ntheory of self-defense.\n  In the Missouri Supreme Court, a 5-2 majority ruled that the trial \ncourt did not commit reversible error and upheld the verdict and \nsentence. Judge White, however, joined a dissent with only one other \njudge which argued that ``Johns was deprived of a fair trial with \nrespect to his self-defense theory.''\n\n  Like the defendant in Missouri v. Johnson, the defendant in Missouri \nv. Johns murdered several people and confessed to the killings. There \nwas no doubt about the defendant's guilt in either case, yet Judge \nWhite dissented and would have granted a new trial to both defendants.\n  I bring up the recent case of Missouri v. Johns not to criticize \nJudge White or reargue his nomination. Instead, I mention this decision \nonly to show that there was a legitimate basis for Senator Ashcroft's \nconcerns about Judge White in death penalty cases. Senator Ashcroft has \nmade the very valid point that if Judge White had been confirmed as a \nfederal district judge, he would have had enormous power to reverse \nstate criminal convictions, including death penalty sentences, \nunilaterally because of the federal writ of habeas corpus.\n  Finally, many of my colleagues have alleged that Senator Ashcroft's \nopposition to Judge White was underhanded and done with stealth. Well, \nSenator Ashcroft voted against Judge White's nomination in Committee. \nHe expressed his disapproval at that time. If he had held up the \nnomination in Committee without allowing it to proceed to the floor he \nwould have been criticized for delay.\n  Indeed, Senator Boxer pleaded during a debate about several judges \nincluding Ronnie White, ``I beg of you, in the name of fairness and \njustice and all things that are good in our country, give people a \nchance. If you do not think they are good, if you have a problem with \nsomething they said or did, bring it down to the floor. We can debate \nit. But please do not hold up these nominees. It is wrong. You would \nnot do it to a friend.'' (Cong. Rec. S. 11871, Oct. 4, 1999). Other \nSenators have repeatedly suggested that the Senate has ``subtle'' means \nof holding up nominees. But at the same time senators are rebuked for \nplacing holds on nominees. Thus, Senator Ashcroft was between a rock \nand a hard place as to how to raise his legitimate concerns about Judge \nWhite.\n  Senator Ashcroft is a man of tremendous integrity, one of the most \nqualified nominees for Attorney General that we have ever seen. His \nopposition to Judge White was principled and in keeping with the proper \nexercise of the advice and consent duty of a senator. I regret that we \nhave needed to revisit this issue at such great length.\n  Senator Ashcroft has also been unfairly criticized for opposing the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division of the \nJustice Department. Mr. Lee had a noted record of promoting and \npreserving race-conscious policies of questionable constitutionality. \nOpposition to Mr. Lee was not limited to Senator Ashcroft--nine \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee opposed this nominee, including \nmyself.\n  I have the highest personal regard for Mr. Lee and the difficult \ncircumstances in which his family came to this country, worked hard, \nand realized the American dream. Despite this high personal regard, I \nwas deeply concerned about Mr. Lee's nomination because much of his \ncareer was devoted to preserving constitutionally suspect race-\nconscious public policies that ultimately sort and divide citizens by \nrace. At the time of his hearings, it was clear that he would have us \ncontinue down the road of racial spoils, a road on which Americans are \nseen principally through the looking glass of race.\n  Senator Ashcroft did not distort Mr. Lee's testimony. When Mr. Lee \nstated the test of Adarand he said that the Supreme Court considered \nracial preference programs permissible if ``conducted in a limited and \nmeasured manner.'' While this might be correct in a narrow sense, it \npurposefully misses the main point of the Court's fundamental holding \nthat such race-conscious programs are presumptively unconstitutional. \nMr. Lee might have stated that strict scrutiny was the standard \narticulated in Adarand; however, when he described the content of this \nstandard it was far looser than what the Supreme Court delineated. Mr. \nLee's misleading description can properly be assailed as a fundamental \nmischaracterization of the law.\n  Senator Ashcroft has stated that he opposed Mr. Lee because of his \nrecord of advocacy and his mischaracterization of Supreme Court \nprecedent. The failure to recognize the established legal standard \nestablished by the Supreme Court would have serious effects on Mr. \nLee's ability to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \nSenator Ashcroft's reasons for opposing Mr. Lee are amply supported by \nthe record.\n  Another area in which Senator Ashcroft has been unfairly attacked is \nhis ability to enforce the law in areas related to abortion. Many of \nthose opposing Senator Ashcroft have taken great pains to state that \nthey do not oppose him because of his ideology, but then go on to say \nthey cannot support him because of his positions on abortion issues. \nIsn't that ideology?\n  Make no mistake about it, Senator Ashcroft has a consistent pro-life \nrecord. Contrary to what his opponents would have you believe, that is \nnot extremist or ``out of the mainstream.'' Millions of Americans share \nthe same view. In the end, what is important is Senator Ashcroft's \ncommitment to enforce the law as its been interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt--and not the policy positions he advocated as a legislator.\n  While Senator Ashcroft's critics have spared nothing in their \nattempts to\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\ndistort his record and create fear, Senator Ashcroft's record over 25 \nyears as a public servant, and his testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee during his confirmation hearing, demonstrate his lifelong \ncommitment to the rule of law and his respect for the uniquely \ndifferent roles of a legislator and a law enforcer. Senator Ashcroft \nhas proven that he can objectively interpret and enforce the law even \nwhere the law may diverge from his personal views on policy. His record \nand character demonstrate that he can be, as he has pledged, ``law \noriented and not results oriented.''\n  Contrary to the fear-mongering of his critics, Senator Ashcroft will \nenforce the law protecting a woman's right to an abortion. He was very \nstraightforward in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee when he \nstated that, in his view, Roe v. Wade is settled law and that the \nSupreme Court's decisions upholding Roe ``have been multiple, they have \nbeen recent and they have been emphatic.'' He said he would enforce the \nlaw as interpreted by the Supreme Court.\n  When asked whether he would seek to change the Supreme Court's \ninterpretation of the law, Senator Ashcroft stated that ``it is not the \nagenda of the President-elect to seek an opportunity to overturn Roe. \nAnd as his Attorney General, I don't think it could be my agenda to \nseek an opportunity to overturn Roe.'' He also stated that as Attorney \nGeneral, it wouldn't be his job to ``try and alter the position of the \nadministration.''\n  Senator Ashcroft clearly recognized the importance of not devaluing \n``the currency'' of the Solicitor General's Office by taking matters to \nthe Supreme Court on a basis the Court has already stated it does not \nwant to entertain. He noted that in this way, ``accepting Roe and Casey \nas settled law is important, not just to this arena, but important in \nterms of the credibility of the Department.'' He said he would give \nadvice based upon sound legal analysis, not ideology or personal \nbeliefs. He made a commitment that ``if the law provides something that \nis contrary to my ideological belief, I will provide them with that \nsame best judgment of the law.''\n  From Senator Ashcroft, those are not just words. Throughout his \ncareer, he has demonstrated that he can do just that. For example, as \nMissouri Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft did not let his personal \nopinion on abortion cloud his legal analysis. He protected the \nconfidentiality of abortion records maintained by the Missouri \nDepartment of Health even when they were requested by pro-life groups.\n  Likewise, when asked to determine whether a death certificate was \nrequired for all abortions, regardless of the age of the fetus, \nAttorney General Ashcroft--despite his personal view that life begins \nat conception issued an opinion that Missouri law did not require any \ntype of certificate if the fetus was 20 weeks old or less. His legal \nanalysis was fair and objective and unaffected by what his policy views \nmay have been. There has also been, what I consider, unfounded \nskepticism over whether Senator Ashcroft would vigorously enforce \nclinic access and anti-violence statutes. Being pro-life is not \ninconsistent with opposing violence at clinics. The primary focus of \nthe opposition has been the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act \nor ``FACE''. Senator Ashcroft supports the FACE law, and always has.\n  Senator Ashcroft testified specifically on how he would enforce FACE \nand other clinic access and anti-violence laws. He stated clearly that \nhe would enforce these laws ``vigorously'', that he would investigate \nallegations ``thoroughly'' and that he would devote resources to these \ncases on a ``priority basis.'' He further stated that he would maintain \nthe appropriate Task Forces which have been created to facilitate \nenforcement of clinic access and anti-violence statutes. These \nstatements are totally consistent with Senator Ashcroft's long record \nof speaking out against violence and his belief that the First \nAmendment does not give anyone the right to ``violate the person, \nsafety and security'' of another.\n  Senator Ashcroft has always spoken out against clinic violence and \nother forms of domestic terrorism. He has written to constituents about \nhis strong opposition to violence and his belief that, regardless of \nhis personal views on abortion, people should be able to enter abortion \nclinics safely. He voted for Senator Schumer's amendment to the \nBankruptcy bill that made debts incurred as a result of abortion clinic \nviolence non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  Senator Ashcroft has always condemned criminal violence at abortion \nclinics--or anywhere for that matter--and believes people who commit \nthese acts of violence and intimidation should be punished to the \nfullest extent of the law. As Attorney General he'll do just that.\n  Access to contraceptives is another area that I think Senator \nAshcroft has been unfairly criticized. His critics make dire \npredictions about the future that are totally unsupported by Senator \nAshcroft's testimony. Senator Ashcroft could not have testified any \nmore clearly on the issue of contraception. He stated that: ``I think \nindividuals who want to use contraceptives have every right to do so . \n. . [and] I think that right is guaranteed by the Constitution of the \nUnited States.'' He also testified that he would defend current laws \nshould they be attacked. What more can he say? Is there anything a pro-\nlife nominee could say to please the pro-abortion interest groups?\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's opponents argue that someone who has been active \nin advocating a particular policy position cannot set that aside and \nenforce the law fairly. I don't believe they can be serious. Does this \nmean that a person of character and integrity who had been active in \nthe pro-choice movement could never be Attorney General? And what about \nthe death penalty? Could we have no future Attorney General, regardless \nof how honest and well-qualified, who opposed the death penalty? Of \ncourse not. In fact, Republicans voted to confirm Janet Reno, despite \nher personal opposition to the death penalty, because she said she \ncould still enforce the law even though she disagreed with it.\n  If this is not about ideology, then we should get to the business of \nconfirming Senator Ashcroft. He has given strong and specific \nassurances to the Senate on abortion questions. These assurances are \nbacked up by his proven record as Missouri Attorney General and \nGovernor. Most importantly, they are backed up by Senator Ashcroft's \npersonal integrity and decency characteristics known personally by \nalmost every member of this body.\n  I was quite surprised to hear Senator Ashcroft's opponents criticize \nhis work on behalf of faith-based organizations that everyone \nrecognizes do remarkable good works in every community across this \nnation. Senator Ashcroft has participated in and encouraged these \nprograms at both a personal and policy level.\n  I think we should be proud of Senator Ashcroft's efforts to assist \nthe disadvantaged. Senator Ashcroft was the author of the charitable \nchoice provision in the landmark Welfare Reform Act of 1996. That \nprovision encourages faith-based organizations to participate in the \nwelfare reform effort on the same basis as secular organizations. As a \nresult, faith-based groups can now, for example, conduct drug-treatment \nand job placement programs for the poor. These programs and other \nsimilar faith-based programs have proved remarkably successful. As the \nnoted civil rights activist Robert Woodson testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Ashcroft's charitable choice legislation \n``may do more to help blacks solve the real problems in their own \ncommunities than anything else government has done.''\n  Some critics claim that Senator Ashcroft's charitable choice \nprovision violates the separation of church and state embodied in the \nFirst Amendment. These criticisms, however, are misplaced. The \ncharitable choice law states that no federal funds ``shall be expended \nfor sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.'' Moreover, the \ncharitable choice law relies on Supreme Court precedents to clarify \nwhat is constitutionally permissible when state and local governments \ncooperate with religious and charitable organizations. The charitable \nchoice law also allows beneficiaries who object to the religious \ncharacter of the organization to receive assistance from an alternative \nprovider.\n  During last year's Presidential campaign of 2000, both President \nGeorge W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore supported the charitable \nchoice law as a\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\nmeans to empower faith-based charities. As President Bush recently \nsaid: ``A compassionate society is one which recognizes the great power \nof faith. We in government must not fear faith-based programs, we must \nwelcome faith-based programs.''\n  Thanks in large part to Senator Ashcroft's leadership, President Bush \nwill be able to expand the role of faith-based charities in fighting \npoverty, addiction and other social ills. Based on the charitable \nchoice law, President Bush created an Office of Faith-Based and \nCommunity Initiatives in the White House last week. This office will be \nled by the prominent University of Pennsylvania professor John DiIulio. \nIn short, the charitable choice law was one of Senator Ashcroft's most \nimportant legislative accomplishments and something that should weigh \nin favor of his nomination, not against it.\n  The criticism leveled against Senator Ashcroft on Charitable Choice \nsuggests the possibility of an even more dangerous problem, religious \nintolerance. Article VI of our Constitution, while requiring that \nOfficers of the government swear to support the constitution, assures \nus that ``no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification \nto any Office or public Trust under the United States.'' I fear that in \nconsidering the nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of \nthe United States, some are coming very close to violating the spirit, \nif not the letter of that assurance.\n  In response to a question I posed to Senator Ashcroft about the wide \ndisparity of treatment accorded him as a person of faith and that \naccorded to Senator Lieberman when he was running for Vice-President, \nand whether anything in his faith background would interfere with his \nability to apply the law as critics had charged, Senator Ashcroft said:\n\n       In examining my understanding and my commitment and my \n     faith heritage, I'd have to say that my faith heritage \n     compels me to enforce the law and abide by the law rather \n     than to violate the law. And if in some measure somehow I \n     were to encounter a situation where the two came into \n     conflict so that I could not respond to this faith heritage \n     which requires me to enforce the law, then I would have to \n     resign.\n\n  Those looking for reassurance that Senator Ashcroft will enforce the \nlaw as written need look no further than this brief paragraph. Senator \nAshcroft's critics and supporters alike uniformly agree that he is a \nman who takes his faith seriously. If he says his faith compels him to \nabide by the law, I think his promise carries great weight. As he said \nin his opening statement, he takes his oath of office seriously, it \nbeing a sacred and solemn obligation. Nevertheless, he has been \nattacked as a dangerous zealot by many of his opponents, who suggest \nthat his faith will require him to violate the law, or as a liar who \ncannot be trusted because he says he will swear to uphold the law. \nWell, his critics cannot have it both ways. Apparently, his critics do \nnot understand either a faith that transcends politics and grasping \nafter power or the distinction between being an advocate for change in \nthe law and being an impartial magistrate to apply the law.\n  The Attorney General is perhaps the most important position in the \nPresident's cabinet. The Department of Justice has a long and storied \nhistory. It represents all Americans in the pursuit of justice. As \nsuch, the Department of Justice demands an Attorney General with \ngreat ability, integrity, and judgment. John Ashcroft has all these \nqualities.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's abilities are demonstrated by the fact he was \nelected to statewide office five times in Missouri, a classic swing \nstate in America's political landscape. As Attorney General and \nGovernor of Missouri, John Ashcroft served with distinction and built a \nrecord of public service and devotion to the rule of law. He continued \nthat proud service representing Missouri in the United States Senate. \nHis leadership and integrity has been recognized by people in both \npolitical parties throughout his career. He was elected President of \nthe National Association of Attorneys General by his fellow state \nattorneys general. As Governor of Missouri, John Ashcroft was elected \nChairman of the National Governors Association by his fellow governors. \nEach time John Ashcroft was elected to these prestigious positions, the \nmajority of state attorneys general and governors were Democrats. The \nfact that he was chosen to lead these organizations while in the \nminority party is a testament to his integrity and ability. Mr. \nPresident, John Ashcroft is the most qualified nominee for Attorney \nGeneral in history. We are fortunate to have him as a nominee. I look \nforward to his stewardship of the Department of Justice.\n  Mr. President, much of the debate over the nomination of John \nAshcroft has focused only on a few important issues, but those are not \nthe only important issues central to the core mission of the Department \nof Justice. I believe the Senate would be well-served to consider the \nAshcroft nomination in light of all of the important duties of the \nAttorney General. When this debate is placed in the proper perspective, \nit becomes even more obvious how qualified Senator Ashcroft is to be \nthe next Attorney General of the United States.\n  The Department of Justice was established by Congress in 1870. It is \nthe largest law firm in the United States with 123,000 employees and an \nannual budget of approximately $21 billion. Through its thousands of \nlawyers, agents, and investigators, the Justice Department plays a \nvital role in fighting violent crime and drug trafficking, ensuring \nbusiness competition in the marketplace, and enforcing immigration and \nnaturalization laws. Consider the following major components of the \nJustice Department in light of the qualifications of Senator Ashcroft:\n  The Civil Rights Division was established in 1957 to secure the \neffective enforcement of civil rights for all Americans. The Civil \nRights Division is responsible for enforcing federal statutes that \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability, \nreligion, and national origin. In order to enforce these landmark laws, \nthe Civil Rights Division engages in a variety of litigation to fight \ndiscrimination in employment, housing and immigration. In particular, \nthe litigation brought by the Civil Rights Division under the Voting \nRights Act has had a profound influence on the electoral landscape in \nthe last three decades.\n  As Senator Ashcroft stated at his confirmation hearing: ``No part of \nthe Department of Justice is more important than the Civil Rights \nDivision.'' John Ashcroft vigorously enforced civil rights laws as the \nAttorney General and Governor of Missouri. He signed Missouri's first \nhate crimes statute. Not content to wait for the legislature to act, \nJohn Ashcroft made Missouri one of the first States to recognize Martin \nLuther King Day by issuing an executive order. He also led the fight to \nsave Lincoln University, the university in Missouri founded by African-\nAmerican Civil War veterans.\n  As the Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Ashcroft held the first hearing on racial \nprofiling in the history of Congress. When asked at his confirmation \nhearing about his priorities for the Justice Department, Senator \nAshcroft cited the abolition of racial profiling as one of his top two \npriorities.\n  Senator Ashcroft stated at his confirmation hearing that the \nparamount civil right is personal safety. The Attorney General is \nAmerica's chief law enforcement officer, and managing the Criminal \nDivision is the most important aspect of the Attorney General's duties. \nThe Criminal Division oversees thousands of federal agents and is \ncharged with, among other things, investigating and prosecuting drug \ndealers, illegal gun traffickers, bank robbers, child pornographers, \ncomputer hackers, and terrorists. The Criminal Division has a visible \nand tangible effect on the lives of all Americans.\n  I have no doubt that, given his vast experience as a public servant, \nSenator Ashcroft understands and appreciates the mission of the \nCriminal Division. Throughout his long career as Missouri Attorney \nGeneral, Missouri Governor, and United States Senator, Senator Ashcroft \nhas been a strong advocate of tough and effective criminal law \nenforcement.\n  Perhaps the greatest threat facing our nation today is the scourge of \nillegal drugs. For years, Senator Ashcroft has been a leader in the \nfight against illegal drugs. In 1996, Senator Ashcroft helped me enact \nthe Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, which increased \npenalties for the manufacture and trafficking of methamphetamine. \nSenator Ashcroft also helped\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nenact federal laws that increased mandatory minimum sentences for \nmethamphetamine offenses and authorized courts to order persons \nconvicted of methamphetamine offenses to pay for the costs of \nlaboratory cleanup. Last year, Senator Ashcroft authored legislation to \ntarget additional resources to local law enforcement agencies to fight \nmethamphetamine.\n  Senator Ashcroft also understands that drug treatment and prevention \nare vital components of an effective drug strategy. In last year's \nmethamphetamine legislation, Senator Ashcroft included funding for drug \neducation and prevention programs, including resources for school-based \nanti-methamphetamine initiatives. As Attorney General and Governor of \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft increased funding for anti-drug programs by \nalmost 40%, the vast majority of which was for education, prevention \nand treatment.\n  During his confirmation hearing, Senator Ashcroft has also made clear \nthat prosecuting gun crimes will be a top priority of the Ashcroft \nJustice Department. Unfortunately, gun prosecutions have not always \nbeen a priority for the Department of Justice. For example, between \n1992 and 1998, prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in the \ncommission of a felony dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to \napproximately 3,800. In the Senate, John Ashcroft was one of the \nleaders in fighting gun crimes. To reverse the decline in gun \nprosecutions by the Justice Department, Senator Ashcroft sponsored \nlegislation to authorize $50 million to hire additional federal \nprosecutors and agents to increase the federal prosecution of criminals \nwho use guns.\n  In addition, Senator Ashcroft authored legislation to prohibit \njuveniles from possessing assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition \nclips. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Ashcroft juvenile assault \nweapons ban in May of 1999.\n  Senator Ashcroft voted for legislation that prohibits any person \nconvicted of even misdemeanor acts of domestic violence from possessing \na firearm, and he voted for legislation to extend the Brady Act to \nprohibit persons who commit violent crimes as juveniles from possessing \nfirearms. In order to close the so-called ``gun show loophole,'' \nSenator Ashcroft voted for legislation, which I authored, to require \nmandatory instant background checks for all firearm purchases at gun \nshows.\n  In order to maintain tough federal penalties, Senator Ashcroft \nsponsored legislation to require a five-year mandatory minimum prison \nsentence for federal gun crimes and for legislation to encourage \nschools to expel students who bring guns to school. Senator Ashcroft \nvoted for the ``Gun-Free Schools Zone Act'' that prohibits the \npossession of a firearm in a school zone, and he voted for legislation \nto require gun dealers to offer child safety locks and other gun safety \ndevices for sale. I have no doubt that with John Ashcroft as Attorney \nGeneral, the Justice Department will target and prosecute gun crimes \nwith unprecedented zeal.\n  To his credit, Senator Ashcroft understands that the vast majority of \ncriminal law enforcement takes place at the state and local level. \nGiven his tenure as Missouri Attorney General and Governor, Senator \nAshcroft appreciates the important role that the federal government can \nplay in supporting state and local authorities by providing resources \nand training. He also understands that the Justice Department should \nprovide such support without intruding into traditional areas of state \nsovereignty.\n  In the Senate, Senator Ashcroft steadfastly supported state and local \nlaw enforcement. He won enactment of a bill that extends higher \neducation financial assistance to spouses and dependent children of law \nenforcement officers killed in the line of duty. He was the principal \nproponent of the ``Care for Police Survivors Act,'' a measure that \nincreases benefits to the survivors of public safety officers killed in \nthe line of duty. Along with Senator Biden, Senator Ashcroft co-\nsponsored legislation to reauthorize the COPS program.\n  In addition, Senator Ashcroft cosponsored the ``Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 1995.'' This act allocated $1 billion to state and \nlocal law enforcement to update and computerize criminal records, \nautomated fingerprint systems, and DNA identification operations. John \nAshcroft also cosponsored the ``21st Century Justice Act'' which \nincluded Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing \nIncentive Grants. These grants have provided federal resources to \nStates to build prisons to incarcerate violent and repeat offenders. \nGiven his record, it is no surprise that law enforcement groups such as \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District \nAttorneys Association, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations are united in their support for Senator Ashcroft's \nnomination.\n  The Civil Division represents the United States government, including \nexecutive departments and agencies, in civil litigation. First and \nforemost, the Civil Division defends the constitutionality of federal \nstatutes, regulations, and executive orders. The Civil Division also \nlitigates complex commercial cases. This litigation is especially \nimportant for property rights because the Civil Division represents the \nfederal government against claims that private property was taken for \npublic use without just compensation. In addition, the Civil Division \nrepresents the federal government in consumer litigation under various \nconsumer protection and public health statutes.\n  Senator Ashcroft's experience as the Attorney General of Missouri \nprepared him well to oversee the Civil Division. John Ashcroft \nestablished the Consumer Affairs Division in the Missouri Attorney \nGeneral's office. He brought many consumer protection actions, \nincluding odometer tampering cases and financial pyramid schemes. In \nIllinois v. Abbott & Associates, Inc., Attorney General Ashcroft filed \na brief in the United States Supreme Court supporting the right of \nstate attorneys general to conduct antitrust investigations. In the \nSenate, John Ashcroft helped enact legislation to combat telemarketing \nscams against senior citizens.\n  Created in 1909, the Environment and Natural Resources Division is \nthe Nation's chief environmental lawyer. It is responsible for \nlitigating cases ranging from the protection of endangered species to \nthe cleanup of hazardous waste sites. In addition to prosecuting \nenvironmental crimes, the Environment and Natural Resources Division \nensures that federal environmental laws are implemented in a fair and \nconsistent manner.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft aggressively enforced \nthat state's environmental protection laws. To cite but a few examples, \nAttorney General Ashcroft brought suit to prevent an electric company \nfrom causing oxygen levels in downstream waters to harm fish. He also \nsought to recover damages from the electric company.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft brought a successful action against the \nowner of an apartment complex for violations of the Missouri Clean \nWater Law relating to treatment of waste water, and he sued the owner \nof a trailer park for violations of the Missouri Clean Water Law.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft also filed numerous \nbriefs in the United States Supreme Court that advanced environmental \nprotections. For example:\n  In Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation \n& Development Commission, Attorney General Ashcroft filed a brief \nsupporting a California law that conditioned the construction of \nnuclear power plants on findings that adequate storage and disposal \nfacilities are available.\n  In Sporhase v. Nebraska, Attorney General Ashcroft endorsed the State \nof Nebraska's effort to stop defendants from transporting Nebraska \ngroundwater into Colorado without a permit.\n  In Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, \nInc., Attorney General Ashcroft filed a brief supporting the Natural \nResources Defense Council's position on tougher environmental \nregulations relating to storage of nuclear wastes.\n  As Missouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft issued numerous legal \nopinions that furthered the enforcement of environmental laws. I would \nlike to describe a few of these formal opinions. In Attorney General \nOpinion No. 123-84, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an opinion that \nunderground injection\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nwells constitute pollution of the waters of the state and are subject \nto regulation by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources under the \nstate's Clean Water Act. Attorney General Ashcroft also opined that it \nwould be unlawful to build or operate such a well unless a permit had \nbeen obtained from the Clean Water Commission.\n  In Attorney General Opinion No. 67, Attorney General Ashcroft issued \nan opinion that operators of surface mines must obtain a permit for \neach year that the mine was un-reclaimed. In reaching this opinion, \nAttorney General Ashcroft determined that the operator of the mine must \nhave a permit continuously from the time mining operations begin until \nreclamation of the site is complete. Attorney General Ashcroft \nconcluded that the continuous permit requirement facilitated Missouri's \nintention ``to protect and promote the health, safety and general \nwelfare of the people of this state, and to protect the natural \nresources of the state from environmental harm.''\n  In Attorney General Opinion No. 189, Attorney General Ashcroft issued \nan opinion that Missouri's cities and counties had the authority to \nrequire that all solid waste be disposed of at approved solid waste \nrecovery facilities, rather than be buried in landfills. In rendering \nhis opinion, Attorney General Ashcroft gave credence to the arguments \nthat ``recycling of solid wastes results in fewer health hazards and \npollution problems than does disposal of the same types of wastes in \nlandfills'' and that ``public welfare is better served by burning solid \nwastes for generation of electricity, thus conserving scarce natural \nresources.'' To those who have irresponsibly charged that Senator \nAshcroft will not enforce our environmental laws, I say this: Look at \nhis record.\n  In conclusion, there are other offices in the Justice Department that \nare also very important. In the interest of time, however, I have \nfocused on a select few. My point today is a simple one when this \nnomination is considered in light of the mission of the Department of \nJustice, it becomes apparent how well-qualified John Ashcroft is to be \nAttorney General. I look forward to his stewardship of the Department \nof Justice.\n  Mr. President, I rise to respond to mischaracterizations about John \nAshcroft's role in the James Hormel nomination, and about John \nAshcroft's public record of fairness with respect to employment of \npeople.\n  Let me say at the outset that I supported James Hormel's nomination \nas Ambassador to Luxembourg. I thought he was qualified for that post. \nAt the same time, however, I respected the fact that others in this \nbody, including Senator Ashcroft, did not share my opinion. I cannot \nconclude--as some people have--that because Senator Ashcroft and I \ndisagreed, that Senator Ashcroft's views, which were based on the \ntotality of the record, were not valid. I have been in public service \nlong enough to understand that thoughtful people can have honest \ndifferences of opinion on such matters without holding unsupportable or \nfundamentally biased points of view.\n  Now, there has been a great deal of confusion about Senator John \nAshcroft's role in the Hormel nomination. Outside special interest \ngroups--which are trying to derail Senator Ashcroft's nomination--have \naccused him of singlehandedly blocking or stopping James Hormel's \nnomination simply because of Hormel's sexual orientation. These charges \nare false. Although, as John Ashcroft told the Judiciary Committee, he \nvoted against the nomination when it came to a vote in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, he did nothing to stop that nomination. John \nAshcroft did not block a Senate vote on Mr. Hormel's nomination, and he \ndid not vote against that nomination on the floor because it never came \nto the floor.\n  So let's look beyond the smokescreen of unsupported innuendo to \nexamine what we really know about John Ashcroft. during the \nconfirmation hearings, Senator Leahy and John Ashcroft directly about \nhis motives with respect to the James Hormel nomination. Senator Leahy \nasked, ``Did you block his nomination from coming to a vote because he \nis gay?'' And Senator Ashcroft said, ``I did not.'' He could not have \nbeen more clear. And when a man of John Ashcroft's integrity makes such \na clear statement, we should take him at his word. Still, however, \nseveral Senators have repeated the unsupported allegation that \nAshcroft's sole reason for voting against Hormel is that Hormel is gay.\n  Some opponents of John Ashcroft are taking the position of using his \nHormel nomination vote to paint a false portrait of a man who acts in a \nbiased way towards homosexuals. But there is absolutely no evidence in \nthe record to support that accusation. Senator Ashcroft made it very \nclear, both during his hearing and in his responses to numerous written \nquestions, that ``sexual orientation has never been something that I've \nused in hiring in any of the jobs, in any of the offices I've held.''\n  In an effort to cloud this crystal-clear statement, the forces \nopposing Ashcroft presented to the media a man named Paul Offner, who \nclaimed that John Ashcroft asked him about sexual orientation 16 years \nago in an interview. Mr. Offner's accusations have been entirely \nrebutted not only by Senator Ashcroft but also by two eyewitnesses \npresent during that interview, both of whom have said that John \nAshcroft never asked Mr. Offner--or any of the many other people he \ninterviewed for jobs--about sexual preference. Carl Koupal, who sat in \non numerous interviews with John Ashcroft as head of Ashcroft's \ngubernatorial transition team, said, ``I can say John Ashcroft did not \nask that question of him or any other candidate we spoke to.'' Another \nAshcroft aide, Duncan Kincheloe, said, ``It's inconceivable to me, and \nI'm certain I would remember if it had been asked. I've never heard him \nask about that, and I've sat through dozens and dozens of interviews \nwith him.'' This evidence should lay to rest questions related to the \nuncorroborated charges of Mr. Offner.\n  At least one Senator, however, continues to ignore the facts and draw \nout the innuendo. That Senator said that Mr. Offner's allegations--even \nif untrue--would not have had any resonance if it were not for a \nhistory of unfairness. But that Senator has presented absolutely not \nevidence of any such history. Not a single person has come forward with \na credible story of unfairness in John Ashcroft's 30-year public life, \nduring which he conducted hundreds if not thousands of interviews and \nmeetings, and made many hiring and firing decisions. Given all the \npublic attention to this issue, and all of the league of special \ninterest powerful lobbyists who are working hard to find just one \nwitness against John Ashcroft, the absence of such a witness speaks \nloudly and clearly.\n  In addition to his 30-year record of fairness, we also have Senator \nAshcroft's clear pledge for the future. He told the Judiciary Committee \nin no uncertain terms that he ``will enforce the law equally without \nregard to sexual orientation if appointed and confirmed as attorney \ngeneral.'' He also promised that sexual preference ``will not be a \nconsideration in hiring at the Department of Justice'' if he is \nconfirmed. And this statement reflects more than his promise to uphold \ncurrent policy; it reflects John Ashcroft's own judgment. He said, \n``even if the executive order [barring the consideration of sexual \norientation as relevant to hiring] would be repealed, I would still not \nconsider sexual orientation in hiring at the Department of Justice \nbecause I don't believe it relevant to the responsibilities.'' Now, \nthat is a very strong statement, Mr. President. Especially because it \ncomes from a person of unquestioned integrity.\n  The facts that I have just described convince me completely that John \nAshcroft, once confirmed, will always act fairly in his law enforcement \ndecisions and hiring decisions to people regardless of sexual \norientation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print an op-ed from the \nWall Street Journal from today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 1, 2001]\n\n                          The Hormel Democrats\n\n       With Bill Clinton having split for Chappaqua with the \n     Spielberg china, Democrats have a chance to present a new \n     image to the public. Yet by opposing John Ashcroft for \n     Attorney General, Senate Democrats seem intent on reminding \n     Middle America why it voted against Al Gore.\n       Some of our readers may already have seen the nearby map of \n     America breaking down\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\n     the vote in the last election. Mr. Gore won the two left \n     coasts, the latte towns and tonier suburbs, and remnants of \n     the progressive upper Midwest. President Bush won everything \n     else. The map reflects a country divided by culture, with the \n     traditionalist middle rejecting the anything-goes mores of \n     the Clinton years.\n       Well, here we go again, with the same culturally liberal \n     interests groups who ordered around Mr. Gore now making the \n     Ashcroft vote a litmus test for Senate Democrats. NARAL, NOW, \n     People for the American Way and the rest know they can't \n     defeat him. But they're twisting arms behind the scenes to \n     get as large a negative vote as possible, as a way to show \n     their muscle and to warn Mr. Bush not to name any \n     conservatives to the Supreme Court.\n       The problem for many Democrats, however, is that voters may \n     notice the company they're keeping. Barbara Boxer, the super-\n     liberal from California, was the first Senate Democrat to \n     declare against Mr. Ashcroft. Ted Kennedy followed close \n     behind, this week joined by Pat Leahy from the Swedish \n     Republic of Vermont and the noted moderate from the great \n     state of New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton. This may all be \n     thrilling news in Hollywood and Manhattan. But we wonder how \n     this brand of Democratic leadership is going to look in, say, \n     Georgia, Montana or South Dakota.\n       Especially because this time the liberal Borking strategy \n     has been a bust. First the interest groups played the race \n     card, but not even rejected judicial nominee Ronnie White \n     would say that Mr. Ashcroft was racially motivated. The \n     debate over Judge White had been about crime, specifically \n     the death penalty, and Democrats sure didn't want to be soft \n     on that. Then the opposition tried the gender/abortion card, \n     but Mr. Ashcroft defused that one by pledging to enforce even \n     laws he dislikes.\n       The latest attack line has been to suggest that Mr. \n     Ashcroft is a relentless gay basher. Democrats went to the \n     unusual lengths of calling in the recently returned U.S. \n     ambassador to Luxembourg, James Hormel, to allege that in \n     opposing his nomination to be ambassador Mr. Ashcroft had \n     shown himself to be intolerant. In fact, fellow Republican \n     Tim Hutchinson admitted that he (and not Mr. Ashcroft) was \n     the Senator who had placed a hold on Mr. Hormel, who also \n     helped to found the Human Rights Campaign, the gay lobby that \n     has tried to stigmatize the Boy Scouts.\n       If nothing else, the Hormel matter certainly is instructive \n     about our current cultural divide. Liberals want to make \n     homosexuality not just a matter of tolerance but essentially \n     a qualification for office: Oppose a gay nominee and you're \n     automatically a bigot.\n       Never mind that Mr. Hormel was also opposed by the U.S. \n     Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights because he had \n     pronounced himself amused at the public mockery of the \n     Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a notorious anti-Catholic \n     gay group. ``When Senator Tim Hutchinson gave James Hormel \n     the opportunity to denounce anti-Catholicism, Hormel refused \n     to do so,'' wrote William Donohue of the Catholic League in \n     1998. Luxembourg is more than 90% Catholic.\n       Mr. Hormel claims he was misrepresented, and maybe he was. \n     But the politics of ``tolerance'' cuts both ways, and there's \n     no denying that the modern gay-rights agenda has moved beyond \n     mere peaceful co-existence to mock and stigmatize traditional \n     religion. Catholics have been a special target because of the \n     Pope's refusal to bend the church's centuries-old belief that \n     homosexual acts are sinful. Mr. Hormel's critics were merely \n     using the kind of identity politics that liberals have used \n     for years.\n       The news is that so many Senators are nonetheless lining up \n     to be Hormel Democrats. It's no accident that both North \n     Dakota Democrats, the usually hyper-partisan Byron Dorgan and \n     Kent Conrad, came out early for Mr. Ashcroft. George Bush won \n     their state by two-to-one. But all of the potential \n     Democratic presidential candidates seem to be falling into \n     opposition line: Hillary of course, and even Indiana's Evan \n     Bayh. Joe Lieberman is still pondering from Mt. Olympus.\n       Mr. Lieberman might reflect that following the liberal line \n     didn't help him or his running mate last year. Democrats lost \n     the White House, despite peace and prosperity, because Middle \n     America didn't share their cultural values. Lining up against \n     John Ashcroft won't help win them back.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to respond to an unfair and untrue \nstatement made on the floor of the Senate about John Ashcroft's work to \ncombat the practice of racial profiling.\n  Senator Ashcroft has a good record on the issue of racial profiling. \nIt was Senator Ashcroft's decision to hold the first-ever congressional \nhearing on the topic, a decision that Senator Feingold, who is an \nexpert on the issue in his own right, appropriately acknowledged during \nthe confirmation hearings. Senator Feingold reported that Senator \nAshcroft and his staff ``not only permitted, but assisted in a \nsignificant and powerful hearing on racial profiling in the \nConstitution subcommittee.''\n  Those who attempt to downgrade the importance of that hearing have \nfailed to understand that Senator Ashcroft's motives are genuine. \nSenator Ashcroft opposes injustice of all kinds. As he explained in his \nopening statement to the Judiciary Committee, ``[f]rom racial profiling \nto news of unwarranted strip searches, the list of injustice in America \ntoday is still long. Injustice in America against any individual must \nnot stand; this is the special charge of the U.S. Department of \nJustice.''\n  Senator Ashcroft made clear that his efforts to combat racial \nprofiling will continue if he is confirmed as Attorney General. In \nresponse to Senator Feingold's direct question ``will you make racial \nprofiling a priority of yours?'', John Ashcroft pledged, ``I will make \nracial profiling a priority of mine.'' He could not have been more \nclear. And he was equally lucid when describing the basis for his \nviews. He said, ``I think racial profiling is wrong. I think it's \nunconstitutional. I think it violates the 14th Amendment.'' These are \npowerful words when spoken by a man such as John Ashcroft who is \ncommitted to enforcing the rule of law.\n  Senator Ashcroft's views on racial profiling are part of his larger \nconception of the role of the Department of Justice on racial issues. \nSenator Ashcroft has pledged that, if confirmed, ``I would do my best \nnever to allow a person to suffer solely on the basis of a person's \nrace.'' He went on to say that ``it is important that the federal \ngovernment be leading when it comes to respecting the rights of \nindividuals and the Constitution. I will do everything I can to make \nsure that we lead properly in that respect.'' These are firm assurances \nfrom a man of integrity.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, it is not only unfair but also \ninaccurate to portray Senator Ashcroft as insensitive to the issue of \nracial profiling. I hope my comments help to set the record straight.\n  Mr. President, I would like to correct some misstatements that were \nmade on the floor of the Senate concerning John Ashcroft's speech at \nBob Jones University. There has been a real attempt here to wage a \n``guilt by association'' attack on Senator Ashcroft, and I want to set \nthe record straight.\n  John Ashcroft's visit to the school was not controversial when it \noccurred in May 1999. But early in 2000--approximately eight months \nafter John Ashcroft's visit--Bob Jones University became a flash point \nduring the primary election because opponents of then-Governor George \nW. Bush accused Governor Bush of associating with an anti-Catholic \nstatement that appeared on the University's Internet site.\n\n  Following the flap over Bush's visit, John Ashcroft said, ``I didn't \nreally know they had these positions,'' and ``[f]rankly, I reject the \nanti-Catholic position of Bob Jones University categorically.''\n  Despite having repudiated the offending statement, John Ashcroft \nfaced a new round of criticism for his appearance after he was \nnominated to be Attorney General. The special interest groups aligned \nagainst him attempted to associate John Ashcroft with every form of \nbigotry and intolerance they could.\n  But any controversy over John Ashcroft's speech at Bob Jones \nUniversity should have been put to rest by John Ashcroft's testimony at \nthis confirmation hearings. That's when we finally got the chance to \nask Senator Ashcroft what he thought. And Senator Ashcroft made it \nclear that he ``reject[s] any racial intolerance or religious \nintolerance that has been associated with[,] or is associated with[,]'' \nBob Jones University.\n  Senator Ashcroft went on to explain that ``[he] want[s] to make it \nvery clear that [he] reject[s] racial and religious intolerance.'' He \nsaid he does not endorse any bigoted views by virtue of ``having made \nan appearance in any faith or any congregation.'' He said, for example, \nthat he has visited churches which do not ``allow women in certain \nroles,'' and that he does not endorse that view either.\n  Apparently, Ashcroft's answer eliminated any doubt about his personal \nviews. As Senator Leahy told Senator Ashcroft during the hearing, ``I \nmade my position very clear yesterday on how I feel about you on any \nquestions of racial or religious bias. I stated that neither I nor \nanybody on this committee would make that claim about you.'' Even \nCatholic groups were satisfied. A spokesperson for the Catholic\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nLeague said, ``In short, the controversy over Ashcroft is much ado \nabout nothing as far as the Catholic League is concerned.''\n  Some outside groups had questioned the meaning of the speech that \nSenator Ashcroft gave during his visit to Bob Jones University. Senator \nAshcroft explained during the confirmation hearing that ``the phrase, \n`We have no king but Jesus,' was a representation of what colonists \nwere saying at the time of the American Revolution.'' He said that the \npoint of his speech was ``the idea that the ultimate authority of the \nultimate idea of freedom in America is not governmentally derived.'' I \ndon't think anyone in the Senate would take issue with that. It is an \nunderstatement to say that this idea is well-documented in the \nFounders' writings.\n  Some went in search of controversy by asking Senator Ashcroft if he \nwould go to Bob Jones University again if invited as Attorney General. \nHe said he would ``speak at places where [he] believes[s] [he] can \nunite people and move them in the right direction.'' In saying that, he \ncontritely explained that his confirmation hearings--``and the prelude \nto th[o]se hearings''--taught him to be ``sensitive at a higher level \nnow than [he] was before, that the attorney general in particular needs \nto be careful about what he or she does.'' Senator Ashcroft said that, \nif confirmed, he ``would be sensitive to accepting invitations so as to \nnot allow a presumption to be made that I was endorsing things that \nwould divide people instead of unite them.'' This answer apparently did \nnot satisfy some of the committee who have since argued that he should \nhave pledged never to return to the University.\n  But as Senator Ashcroft explained at his hearing, it is shortsighted \nto make a pledge not to go somewhere just because you disagree with \nthem. John Ashcroft pointed out that the Bob Jones University has \n``abandoned the policy on interracial dating which was offensive'' \nafter that policy became a focus of attention last year. I think John \nAshcroft was contrite about what he learned and correct not to rule out \nvisiting places where he thinks his presence could be a force for \npositive change.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to correct the misimpressions about \nthis issue that were unfortunately created on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I feel compelled to address some of the misperceptions \nI fear may have been created by my colleagues in their comments about \nseveral aspects of Senator Ashcroft's record with regard to his role in \nantitrust litigation against politically-motivated boycotts and \nabortion when he was an elected official in Missouri.\n  First, several of my colleagues have unfairly criticized Senator \nAshcroft for the lawsuit Senator Ashcroft filed against the National \nOrganization of Women (NOW) when he was Attorney General of Missouri. \nIn response to Missouri's decision not to ratify the Equal Rights \nAmendment (``ERA''), NOW organized a boycott against Missouri (as well \nas other states that failed to ratify the ERA). Pursuant to that \nboycott, NOW urged organizations not to hold conventions in Missouri. \nIn 1978, Missouri, through then-Attorney General Ashcroft, sued NOW in \nfederal court, alleging that the boycott violated the antitrust laws. \nAs Senator Ashcroft testified during his confirmation, he filed the \nlawsuit because the boycott was hurting the people of Missouri, and he \nbelieved it to be in violation of the antitrust laws. Senator Ashcroft \ntestified that the lawsuit had nothing to do with the ERA or with \npolitical differences that Senator Ashcroft might have held with NOW. \nThe decision to file it was purely a legal and economic one. The \nboycott hurt Missouri and, in his view, was illegal, and it was his \nduty to act on behalf of Missouri and its citizens.\n  While some have charged this was settled law because a case cited in \nan opinion was more than a decade old, the fact that a case is cited in \na decision is no indicator of whether the law of the particular case is \nsettled. In fact, the legal question at issue--whether the Sherman Act \ncovers boycotts engaged in with political rather than economic aims--\nwas acknowledged by all the judges on the 8th Circuit panel to be one \nof first impression. With all appellate judges acknowledging the \nnovelty of the case, I do not know how the argument that the law was \nsettled can be maintained. The language of the Sherman Act on its face \ncovered the conduct at issue, and it was well established that it \ngenerally covered boycotts. The court eventually ruled 2 judges to 1 \nagainst General Ashcroft, but obviously it was an unanswered question \nin the law and could have gone either way. The law is clear now, but it \nwasn't then. An Attorney General for a state represents that state, and \nlike any lawyer, is to zealously defend the rights of those he \nrepresents. So, naturally appeals were made. Not to make an appeal from \nan adverse ruling--especially in a case of first impression--would have \ndeparted from normal practice and may have violated his duty to his \nclient, the people of Missouri. And the fact that the Supreme Court \ndenied review means little in this case. The Supreme Court often denies \nreview on cases of first impression to allow the lower courts to \ndevelop the law before it reviews and settles a question to get the \nbenefit of broader thinking than a single court. It seems odd to \ncriticize an Attorney General for trying to serve his client's \ninterest, but I guess the point of John Ashcroft's critics is that \nresults are what is important, and if your clients' opponent is a group \nfavored by liberal politicians, serving their needs is more important \nthan serving your constituents and clients, in this case, citizens of \nMissouri, no matter what your normal duty would be. That cannot be what \nwe expect of either a state or our federal Attorney General.\n\n  I would also like to respond to the number of comments that have been \nmade about Senator Ashcroft's actions in Sermchief v. Gonzales, 660 \nS.W.2d 683 (Mo. 1983). This case was a declaratory action brought by \nnurses working at family planning clinics to permit them to prescribe \ncontraceptives and other reproductive health materials according to the \nsame protocols dictated by physicians under the Nursing Practice Act of \n1975. The nurses also challenged the constitutionality of the statute. \nAttorney General Ashcroft's office was served with the lawsuit as \nrequired by law when any party challenges the constitutionality of a \nstatute. Attorney General Ashcroft fulfilled his duty to defend the \nconstitutionality of the statute. The brief his office filed did not \naddress the proper scope of nursing practices as some have claimed.\n  The Attorney General's Office also represented the State Board of \nNursing, who was not a party to the case, and filed an amicus brief on \nbehalf on their behalf urging an interpretation of the statute \nconsistent with the position taken by the nurses. This is the view that \nprevailed in the Missouri Supreme Court. In other words, both of the \nAttorney General's briefs supported the constitutionality of the \nstatute. It was proper for the Attorney General to file briefs on \nbehalf of parties on either side of the litigation because the \npositions taken were not in conflict insofar as they supported \nconstitutionality of statute. Even if they had been in conflict, the \nlaw recognizes that an Attorney General may take conflicting positions \nbecause he or she is the only lawyer the government has--even when \ndifferent government entities cannot agree.\n  The nurses were concerned about the Nursing Practice Act of 1975, and \nwhether the term ``professional nursing'' expanded the scope of \nauthorized nursing practices. The Board of Healing Arts threatened to \norder the nurses to show cause why the nurses should not be found \nguilty of the unauthorized practice of medicine, and physicians guilty \nof ``aiding and abetting.'' The Board of Healing won this argument at \ntrial. The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the trial court and \ndetermined that the services complained of by the Board of Registration \nfor the Healing Arts did indeed fall within the legislative standard of \n``professional nursing'' and there were permissible.\n  The nurses in question were performing services including breast and \npelvic examinations, laboratory testing of PAP smears, gonorrhea \ncultures, and blood serology and providing information about \ncontraceptives. The trial court, in ruling in favor of the Board, \nfound, among other things, that the findings derived from pelvic \nexaminations which the nurses performed to attempt to diagnose the \nexistence or nonexistence of contraindications to the\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\nuse of contraceptives ``require an individual to draw upon education, \njudgment and skill based upon knowledge and application of principles \nin addition to and beyond biological, physical, social, and nursing \nsciences.'' Sermchief, 660 S.W.2d at 686.\n  It was not unreasonable for the Board to argue that services that \nwere generally performed by physicians and required the ``education, \njudgment and skill'' beyond ``nursing sciences.'' In fact, at trial, \nmany prominent physicians testified as such. The Supreme Court, \nhowever, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, based upon the legislative \nstandard that was set at the time. The court relied on the nurses' \nprofessional status to know what their limits were. The Board, in \nbringing the case originally, simply didn't feel comfortable relying on \nthe knowledge of an individual nurse as to what his or her limits were.\n\n  Any characterization of Senator Ashcroft's actions as Missouri \nAttorney General as an effort to deny health services to rural or low \nincome patients, is at war with the facts. He was the Attorney General, \nand he had an obligation to defend the constitutionality of the \nstatute. That is what he did, and it was perfectly appropriate.\n  Finally, I would like to respond to some criticism leveled at Senator \nAshcroft for his support of pro-life legislation while Governor of \nMissouri. Even ardent supporters of Roe v. Wade must admit that the \ndecision is not the model of clarity. Moreover, it did not, contrary to \nwhat many special interest groups claim, authorize abortion on demand. \nThe decision, while establishing a constitutional right to abortion, \nset up a scheme that, in the words of Justice White, left the Supreme \nCourt to serve as the country's ``ex officio medical board with powers \nto approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards \nthroughout the United States.'' Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. \nDanforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976). Thus, even after the Roe decision, \nthere remained many unanswered questions about the contours of this new \nconstitutional right. These questions included, for example, issues \nabout parental consent for minors, minimal standards for abortion \nclinics, and whether public facilities or employees can be used to \nperform abortions. Many state legislatures--not just Missouri's--sought \nto answer these questions left unanswered by Roe.\n  The statute passed by the Missouri legislature and signed by then-\nGovernor Ashcroft in 1986 was one of these attempts to define the \nparameters of the right to an abortion. Many abortions-rights \nextremists forget that the Supreme Court, in its abortion cases, has \nconsistently held that states have an interest in protecting the health \nand safety of its citizens and in reducing the incidence of abortions. \nThe 1986 Missouri statute sought to do just that, with 20 provisions \ncovering various issues left unresolved by the Roe decision. The \nSupreme Court, in its Webster decision, agreed that many of these \nprovisions did not infringe on a woman's constitutional right to an \nabortion. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, et al., 492 U.S. \n490, 522 (1989). Throughout this legislative and judicial process, the \nState of Missouri--not simply Governor John Ashcroft--followed \nestablished legal rules and procedures in their good faith effort to \nbalance the right to an abortion with the state's interest in \nprotecting the health and safety of its citizens. While it may have \nasserted its rights to appeal, the State of Missouri and then-Governor \nAshcroft always respected the opinions and orders of the court and the \nrules governing litigation. The good faith use of the courts to decide \nlegal issues is no basis on which to criticize Senator Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT.

In fact, I will add to that: In doing so, that it not \nimpinge on the time reserved for the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we get to the end of this debate, I \nthink it is wise if we look at some of the facts of the debate and not \njust the rhetoric.\n  We debated this matter virtually nonstop from 10:30 yesterday morning \nuntil 8:10 yesterday evening. We did it without intervening business. I \ndo not think we had as much as 5 minutes expended in quorum calls. For \nour side, this was certainly not a dilatory debate but a substantive \none. It was not the politics of personal destruction, but the Senate \nexercising its constitutional responsibility to examine one of the most \nimportant nominations that this President or any President could send \nto the Senate.\n  Let's go over the facts. The Senate received the President's \nnomination on Monday afternoon of this week. The Judiciary Committee \ndebated this nomination on Tuesday afternoon the following day, and \nvoted on it that evening. We began the Senate debate yesterday morning, \nless than 48 hours after receiving the nomination. We are concluding it \nin less than 14 and one half hours of Senate debate. We are voting up \nor down on this nomination this afternoon.\n  I mention this because I have heard those who point to the nomination \nof the last Attorney General, Janet Reno, as some sort of model of \nspeedy confirmation. She was nominated after an earlier nomination had \nhearings and was withdrawn. Her nomination was not voted upon for a \nmonth after she was nominated. By comparison, we are voting on John \nAshcroft when his nomination has been before us for only less than \nthree days. That was not a controversial nomination. Republicans, as \nwell as Democrats, came to the floor to praise her record, but she was \nstill not sworn in until mid-March.\n  A better comparison would be to find the last controversial \nnomination; that was that of Attorney General Meese. He was first \nnominated in January 1984 by President Reagan. He was finally \nconsidered by the Republican-controlled Senate in February 1985, 13 \nmonths after being nominated. Five weeks ensued between his nomination \nand his initial hearing.\n  The nomination underwent 7 days of hearings, involved nearly 50 \nwitnesses, under a Republican-controlled Senate, when he was Republican \nnominee by a popular Republican President. He was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee, a Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, by a \n12-6 vote, not the lesser margin of 10-8 by which the Ashcroft \nnomination was reported.\n  The Senate, with a Republican majority leader, allowed 2 weeks \nbetween the committee vote and Senate consideration--2 weeks, not the \n17 hours we had on the Ashcroft nomination. The Senate debated the \nMeese nomination over 4 days, on February 19, 20, 21, and 23--not the \nday and a half devoted to the Ashcroft nomination. Then, the \nRepublican-controlled Senate voted 63-31 to confirm Attorney General \nMeese.\n  I believe those 31 negative votes were the most ever against an \nAttorney General. Even as the very popular President Reagan was \npreparing to begin his second term, the nomination of his Attorney \nGeneral resulted in 7 days of Senate hearings, 4 days of Senate debate, \nand 31 votes in opposition. I mention this because there was some \nsuggestion that maybe some on this side held this up. This nomination \nwas handled a lot more rapidly done than at the time of Attorney \nGeneral Meese.\n  The Senate is soon going to vote on the nomination of John Ashcroft \nto be Attorney General. I think it is safe to say that all of us in \nthis body would like to be able to vote in favor of the next Attorney \nGeneral. Those of us who are going to vote no on this nomination take \nno pleasure in doing so. Frankly, I have heard many say--and I feel \nthis myself--we wish the President had sent a different nomination for \nthis critical job. We wish, if he wished to have our colleague, Senator \nAshcroft in the Cabinet, that he had nominated him for a different \nposition. We wish the President had adhered to the standard he set \nforth in his own inaugural address and that he had sent us a nominee \nwho would unite the country and have the utmost credibility with the \ndisaffected, dispossessed, and disenfranchised.\n\n  We knew the nomination of Senator Ashcroft had become a ``done deal'' \nweeks ago. The Republican leadership reported that all 50 Republican \nSenators would be voting in favor of this nomination, and, of course, \nwith the Vice President they would be able to win.\n  This decision was made before any hearing, before the nominee \nanswered any question, written or oral, before any background check or \nreview of his record was ever begun, let alone completed. That is why \nsome members of the Judiciary Committee on the other side went so far \nas to argue that the committee need not hear testimony from the public \nat all, and need not review the nominees's required financial \ndisclosures, papers required of every nominee.\n  Most Democratic Senators, I am happy to say, declined to prejudge the \nmatter. As chairman during the 17 days of the Judiciary Committee \nhearing, I expedited a balanced hearing to review the nominee's record \nand to hear people from Missouri and others, pro and con, on this \nimportant nomination. We had virtually an equal number for Senator \nAshcroft as against him--I think actually one more for. But I believe \nthat all Senators can be proud that our hearings focused on issues, not \non the nominee's personal life. We can also be proud of the tone set \nduring this debate on the Senate floor.\n  But there is one big exception. I take strong exception--in fact, the \nstrongest terms I can think of in my 26 years in the Senate--to the \ncharacterization we have heard about the issue of religion and this \nnomination. The Senate was told that opponents of this nomination have \nimplied that Christians have no place in public life.\n  If that charge was not on its face so absolutely preposterous in this \nbody, it would have invited several hours of discussion to set the \nrecord straight. It is such an untrue and inflammatory assertion.\n  Needless to say, if that was the debate, it would be fair to \nspeculate that many, probably most of President Bush's nominees are \nChristians and confirmed by this body. All of his nominees are \nconfirmed. I know of none planned, or who have been announced by the \ndistinguished leader as ready for votes, who are not going to be \nconfirmed. If their religion has been mentioned at all, it has been \nmentioned to their credit.\n  Is it really necessary to point out that men and women of Christian \nfaiths are plentiful in both parties in these very Halls of Congress? \nMore to the point, there are good people, who are Christians, on both \nsides of the Ashcroft nomination, just as there are good people, who \nare not Christians, on both sides of the Ashcroft nomination. In fact, \nthe reason religion has come up during these confirmation proceedings \nis not because of John Ashcroft's religious beliefs, but because of \nconcern about the level of tolerance he may show towards those with \ndifferent religious beliefs. That is why his visit to and acceptance of \nan honorary degree from, and comments made during the hearings about \nBob Jones University, have been a legitimate concern to many.\n  The relevance of Senator Ashcroft's association with Bob Jones \nUniversity\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\nis not about his own religious beliefs. It is about what it says about \nSenator Ashcroft's sensitivity and tolerance towards those whom that \ninstitution regards in such negative ways, and treats so differently. \nThe policies of that institution have been to bar African Americans, to \nbar interracial dating, and to derogate Mormons and Catholics as \nbelonging to cults.\n\n  That John Ashcroft does not seem to fully understand the concern that \nthis causes to many Americans is itself troubling to so many. We have \nheard from some the term they have seemed to coin: ``religious \nprofiling.'' I will say it once again as clearly as I can. No Senator \non either side of the aisle during these proceedings has sought to \napply any religious test to John Ashcroft. No Senator has sought to tar \nthe nominee as a racist. Senator Ashcroft's religious beliefs have not \nbeen a source of inquiry or concern for any member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Notwithstanding, ironically enough, what Bob Jones University has \nsaid about Catholics and Mormons--with the two leaders of this \ncommittee being one a Catholic and the other a Mormon--both Senator \nHatch and I have said we have never once heard Senator Ashcroft take \nthe position that Bob Jones University has towards us or anybody of our \nreligions.\n  This confirmation debate has not been about religious profiling. If \nanything, this is a nomination struggle about issue profiling, and \nthose issues include the nominee's record on civil rights and women's \nrights, the rights of gay Americans, and voter registration.\n  Those supporting this nomination argue that he should be confirmed \nbecause his religious devotion represents a special, unimpeachable \nlevel of integrity, and that his religion makes him more likely to \nabide by his oath of office. My view is that religion is neither a \nqualification nor disqualification for public office. I hold deep \nreligious beliefs. But as I told someone as I left church this Sunday, \nthis past Sunday: I would not expect anybody to vote either for or \nagainst me because of my religious beliefs.\n  I would expect them to vote for or against me because of my political \nbeliefs.\n  Indeed, article VI of the Constitution prohibits any religious test \nas a qualification for public office. I hope Senator Ashcroft's \nsupporters are not urging any form of such unconstitutional test.\n  The issue is his public record, not his religious faith. I and \nseveral others have said how much we admire his commitment to his \nfamily and his religion. I consider those two of the most admirable \nqualities in our former colleague. The issue, though, is how he has \nfulfilled his public duties.\n  Senator Byrd posed the question yesterday whether any man's past can \nwithstand scrutiny. Confirmation hearings should not be held to dissect \na nominee's personal life--and this one did not--but they are to \nexamine his past record and actions, to hear from the nominee about how \nhe views his prior positions and actions within the perspective and \nwisdom that time should bring.\n  What I observed of this nominee at his hearings can be summed up in \ntwo words: No regrets.\n  He had no regrets about the aggressive manner in which he litigated \nin opposition to a voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, or about \nthe missed opportunity to resolve that divisive matter, about his use \nor his involvement for political gain, or about the misleading \ntestimony he initially gave the committee about whether the State of \nMissouri was a party to the litigation and had been found liable.\n  He had no regrets about vetoing two bills designed to ensure equal \nvoting rights for African American voters in St. Louis.\n  He had no regrets about appearing at Bob Jones University, and he \neven testified that he might return there after being confirmed as \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  He certainly passed up the opportunity, as has been suggested, now \nthat he knows so much about Bob Jones University, to take the honorary \ndegree, put it in an envelope, and send it back. He had no regrets \nabout granting an interview to the Southern Partisan and praising this \nneo-Confederate magazine and appearing to embrace its point of view.\n  One of the things that bothered me greatly is that he had no regrets \nabout his treatment of Judge Ronnie White, Ambassador James Hormel, \nBill Lann Lee, Judge Margaret Morrow, or any of the other Presidential \nnominees he opposed.\n  Each of us has a duty to determine how we exercise our constitutional \nduty of advise and consent. As I said at the outset of this debate, \nstrangely enough--or perhaps not so strangely--the Constitution is \nsilent on the standard we should use in deciding how to fulfill our \nadvise and consent duty.\n  I have thought about this over the years, and I have come to the \nconclusion that it is testament to the wisdom of the framers because, \nin the end, those who elect us have the final say in whether they \napprove of how we conducted ourselves and, if they approve, of how we \nexercised our constitutional responsibilities.\n  Some have argued that the issues that have arisen during this \nconfirmation process have been generated out of thin air by advocacy \ngroups or by Senators who oppose this nomination. In fact, these are \nthe same issues upon which the voters of Missouri based their verdict \non election day last November, an election Senator Ashcroft lost.\n  John Ashcroft's actions toward Judge Ronnie White and his association \nwith Southern Partisan magazine and Bob Jones University were hotly \ndebated in Missouri. They were issues in his unsuccessful reelection \ncampaign.\n\n  The Kansas City Star noted in November 1999:\n\n       A lot of Missourians are still struggling to understand why \n     Sen. John Ashcroft took out Ronnie White.\n\n  Rallies for Judge White were held in downtown St. Louis. Local groups \ncirculated petitions calling for Senator Ashcroft to ``publicly \nretract'' his comments in Southern Partisan. At least one Missouri \nmunicipality passed a resolution asking Senator Ashcroft to ``cease the \npromotion of Jefferson Davis'' and other Confederate leaders in \nSouthern Partisan, and they criticized his actions with respect to \nJudge White.\n  Another Missouri city council passed a resolution asking Senator \nAshcroft to apologize to Missouri residents for his comments in \nSouthern Partisan.\n  Yesterday, an old friend, a Republican, contacted me to share a quote \nfrom Reinhold Niebuhr:\n\n       Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but \n     man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.\n\n  In this regard, I note that we heard often about John Ashcroft's past \nelection victories in Missouri. What has gone unmentioned is the fact \nthat the voters of Missouri registered a negative judgment on the \npolitics, policies, and practices of John Ashcroft just last November. \nNot surprisingly, they are the same issues that have arisen during his \nconfirmation debate. We heard during our hearings how African American \nvoters of Missouri had voted overwhelmingly against him.\n  John Ashcroft's stubborn defense of his past record and the fact he \nhas no regrets over incidents that concern many of his Missouri \nconstituents and that now concern many Americans does not instill \nconfidence. On the contrary, to many it is a troubling signal. He lacks \nthe sensitivities and balance we need in the Attorney General. We need \nan Attorney General who has the trust and confidence of the American \npeople and who is dedicated to protecting the rights of all of us.\n  Remember, the Attorney General is not the President's lawyer. He has \na White House counsel. The White House counsel is not required to come \nto the Senate for confirmation. The Attorney General is there for all \nof us--black, white, rich, poor, Democrat, Republican, no matter who we \nare.\n  The American people are entitled to an Attorney General who is more \nthan just a friend to many of us in the Senate, as John Ashcroft is a \nfriend, and who promises more than just the bare minimum, that he will \nenforce the law. All Americans, whether they are part of the 100 \nMembers of a Senate club, no matter what they may be, all Americans, \nthe 280 million other Americans who do not serve here, are entitled to \nsomeone who will uphold the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt, who will respect the Congress\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\nand the courts, who will abide by decisions with which he disagrees, \nand enforce the law for all people regardless of politics. They are \nentitled to someone whose past record demonstrates that he or she knows \nhow to exercise good judgment in wielding the enormous discretionary \npower of the Attorney General.\n  I said before that we cannot judge John Ashcroft's heart, nor should \nwe be able to, but we can examine his record. And running through that \nrecord are disturbing recurrent themes: Disrespect for Supreme Court \nprecedents with which he disagrees; grossly intemperate criticism of \njudges with whom he disagrees--the ``ruffians in robes'' comment--\ninsensitivity and bad judgment on racial issues; and the use of \ndistortions, secret holds, and ambushes to harm the careers of those \nwhom he opposes or for political gain.\n  I engaged in a colloquy yesterday with the senior Senator from \nVirginia during this confirmation process. Senator Warner is a dear and \nvalued friend. We have been friends for decades. He observed that he \nthought the hearings and consideration by the Senate will result in \nJohn Ashcroft being a stronger, more deeply committed public servant.\n  It is my fervent hope that John Ashcroft has come to understand the \nreasons that many of us are troubled by his record and troubled by the \nmanner in which he responded to our concerns at the nomination hearing.\n  I hope Senator Ashcroft better appreciates the concerns of the \nsignificant number of Americans who oppose this nomination. Public \nopinion polls show there are as many people opposed to the nomination \nas support it. For those who doubt the promise of American justice--\nand, unfortunately, there are those in this country who do, for \nwhatever reason--this nomination has not inspired confidence in the man \nnominated to head the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  If John Ashcroft is to be confirmed, then he is going to have a lot \nof work to do to prove that the President's choice was a wise one, and \nthat he will be the people's lawyer and defender of their rights--all \nthe people.\n  The country is sharply divided about this nomination, but so is the \nSenate. I wish the President had sent the Senate a nominee who would \nunite us and not divide us, but that did not happen.\n  I hope the President knows--after this debate, and after this \ndivisive election--the task of bringing the Nation together still lies \nahead of us. I hope all of us will be able to help in that uniting.\n  I think nothing I will ever do in my life will mean as much to me as \nserving in the Senate. I have served with 280 or so Senators, who have \nall been people I have admired and respected. I hope that after this \nnomination, and after this battle--however the vote comes out; I expect \nI know how it will come out--then the Senate will work together, on \nboth sides of the aisle, with the new President, and with all members \nof his Cabinet, and with the new Attorney General, to start healing \nthese wounds, to not just talk about bringing us together, but to \nactually do it.\n  There are deep, deep concerns in the country about this nomination. I \nwould suggest that every one of us--Republican and Democrat--have a \nlong road ahead of us to bring those sides together, but on that long \nroad we also have the responsibility to take that trip.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record some materials that I believe will be relevant to the \nconsideration of this nomination: a letter from the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation; a letter from the Missouri Sheriffs' Association; a \nwritten statement of Sheriff Kenny Jones before the Committee on the \nJudiciary; and testimony of U.S. Representative Kenny Hulshof before \nthe U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 4, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: I am writing to ask you to join the \n     National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) in opposing the \n     nomination of Mr. Ronnie White to the Federal Judiciary. NSA \n     strongly urges the United States Senate to defeat this \n     appointment.\n       As you know, Judge White is a controversial judge in \n     Missouri while serving in the Missouri Supreme Court. He \n     issued many opinions that are offensive to law enforcement; \n     one on drug interdiction and one involving the death penalty. \n     Judge White feels that drug interdiction is not a proper \n     function of law enforcement. He wrongly reasons that drug \n     abuse is a private matter that causes no public harm, and \n     drug abusers should not be inconvenienced by interdiction \n     efforts. We strongly disagree. Drug interdiction is a \n     cornerstone in the fight against crime, and this reckless \n     opinion undermines the rule of law.\n       Additionally, Judge White wrote an outrageous dissenting \n     opinion in a death penalty case. In 1991 Pam Jones, the wife \n     of Sheriff Kenny Jones of Moniteau, Missouri, was gunned down \n     while hosting a church service at home. The assailant, who \n     was targeting the Sheriff, was tried and convicted of murder \n     in the first degree. He was subsequently sentenced to death \n     for Mrs. Jones' murder. During the appeals process, the case \n     came before the Missouri Supreme Court where six of the seven \n     judges affirmed the conviction and the sentence. Judge White \n     was the court's lone dissenter saying the assailant had a \n     tough childhood and was therefore not accountable for the \n     heinous crime he committed. In our view, this opinion alone \n     disqualifies Judge White from service in the Federal courts. \n     He is irresponsible in his thinking, and his views against \n     law enforcement are dangerous.\n       We urge you in the strongest possible terms to actively \n     oppose the nomination of Judge White. He is clearly an \n     opponent of law enforcement and does not deserve an \n     appointment to the Federal Judiciary. His views and opinions \n     are highly insulting to law enforcement, and we look forward \n     to working with you to defeat this nomination.\n           Respectfully,\n                                         Patrick J. Sullivan, Jr.,\n                                                          Sheriff.\n\n\n                               Missouri Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                           Jefferson City, MO, September 27, 1999.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Attached please find a copy of the \n     dissenting opinion rendered by Missouri Supreme Court Judge \n     Ronnie White in the case State of Missouri, Respondent, v. \n     James R. Johnson, Appellant.\n       Also, please find attached a copy of a petition signed by \n     92 law enforcement officers in Missouri, including 77 \n     Missouri sheriffs.\n       In December 1991, James Johnson murdered Pam Jones, wife of \n     Moniteau County Sheriff Kenny Jones. He shot Pam by ambush, \n     firing through the window of her home during a church \n     function she was hosting. Johnson also killed Sheriff Charles \n     Smith of Cooper County, Deputy Les Roark of Moniteau County \n     and Deputy Sandra Wilson of Miller County. He was convicted \n     and sentenced to death. When the case was appealed and \n     reached the Missouri Supreme Court, Judge White voted to \n     overturn the death sentence of this man who murdered Mrs. \n     Jones and three good law officers.\n       As per attached, the Missouri sheriffs strongly encourage \n     you to consider this dissenting opinion in the nomination of \n     Judge Ronnie White to be a U.S. District Court judge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              James L. Vermeersch,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Written Statement of Sheriff Kenny Jones Before the Committee on the \n   Judiciary, Confirmation Hearings of John Ashcroft, U.S. Attorney \n                    General Designate, January 2001\n\n       Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, Members of the Judiciary \n     Committee, I am honored and a little overwhelmed to be here \n     today to testify on the nomination of John Ashcroft to be \n     Attorney General of the United States.\n       Mr. Chairman, my name is Kenny Jones and I am the elected \n     Sheriff of Moniteau County, Missouri, an office I have been \n     privileged to hold for the last sixteen years. For those who \n     may not know, Moniteau County is a very small unusually quiet \n     county in mid-Missouri with a population of approximately \n     13,000. We are a strong tight knit community in the heartland \n     of America. We believe in traditional values and we have a \n     deep faith. We are small town America at its best.\n       As you know, much has been said about John Ashcroft and his \n     fitness for this office. I for one support his nomination and \n     urge this Committee to support him as well. Last year, \n     Senator Ashcroft was unjustly labeled for his opposition to \n     the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to federal district \n     court. This one event has wrongly called into question his \n     honor and integrity. Be assured that Senator Ashcroft had no \n     other reason that I know about, to oppose Judge White except \n     that I asked him too. I opposed Judge White's nomination to \n     the federal bench and I asked Senator Ashcroft to join me \n     because of Judge White's opinion on a death penalty case.\n       In December 1991, James Johnson changed the lives of many \n     families in our small rural community. He held an elderly \n     woman hostage, killed four people, and seriously\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\n     wounded another. Johnson murdered in cold blood, the sheriff \n     from a neighboring county, two deputy sheriffs, and my wife, \n     Pam Jones. For this, he was tried by a jury, convicted of \n     four counts of first degree murder, and sentenced to death.\n       To understand just how horrid this event is and to \n     comprehend the devastating impact this crime has on my \n     county, you need to understand the facts of that December \n     night. It is easy to talk about dissenting opinions and legal \n     maneuvering in this case and take the human tragedy out of \n     it. But, that is a mistake. This case is entirely about human \n     tragedy and justice. Not a day goes by that I don't think \n     about what James Johnson did to my family and my community. \n     Can you even imagine how it forever changed life in a small \n     Missouri community?\n       On the evening of December 9th, Deputy Leslie Roark, was \n     dispatched to the residence of James Johnson on a domestic \n     disturbance call. After arriving on the scene and speaking \n     with Johnson, his wife and his stepdaughter, Deputy Roark \n     apparently ascertained they were all fine. He could not have \n     been more wrong. As Deputy Roark turned to leave, Johnson \n     pulled a gun and shot him in the back. My deputy fell face \n     down, rolled over, and struggled to defend himself. Johnson \n     then shot Les in the forehead at point-blank range. After \n     shooting Leslie Roark, Johnson armed himself with more \n     weapons and drove to my house in rural Moniteau County \n     looking for me. I was not home. I had taken my two sons to \n     their 4-H Club meeting. My wife, Pam, and our two daughter \n     were home, however. They were hosting a Christmas party for a \n     group of local churchwomen and their children. Upon arriving \n     at my house, Johnson opened fire on completely innocent \n     people. He fired several shots through a bay window, hitting \n     my wife who was sitting with my daughter on a bench in front \n     of the window. After the assault on my home, Johnson went to \n     the home of Deputy Russell Borts and shot him, also through a \n     window, as he was talking on the telephone. Russ lives today \n     with several injuries inflicted by Johnson.\n       During the attack on my family and Deputy Borts, a call for \n     help went out and many officers from surrounding counties \n     responded to my office. Sheriff Charles Smith, from Cooper \n     County personally responded to the call for help. What he did \n     not know was that Johnson had moved down the block from the \n     Borts residence and was laying-in-wait at my office. As \n     Sheriff Smith was getting in his car, Johnson gunned him down \n     in front of the Moniteau County Sheriff's Office. Just \n     moments later, Johnson shot and killed Officer Sandra Wilson \n     who had driven in from Miller County responding to the call \n     for help. It is important to note that this coward never once \n     confronted his victims fact to face. Every single person he \n     shot and killed was shot in the back.\n       Before Johnson was apprehended, he held an elderly woman \n     hostage until for some unknown reason, he released her. She \n     escaped and told the authorities where Johnson was hiding. A \n     team of negotiators finally convinced Johnson to surrender \n     and he was taken into custody.\n       After dropping off my boys at 4-H, I found out that Les \n     Roark had been shot. I went to be with him while we waited \n     for the Life Flight helicopter. While there, I received the \n     call that would change my life forever. I was told of an \n     emergency at my own house. I raced home. There I saw an \n     ambulance in the driveway and shocked people standing around. \n     My secretary, Helen Gross, told me that Pam had been shot and \n     our daughters had been taken to a neighbor's home. Pam was \n     flown by helicopter to the University of Missouri Hospital. I \n     gathered my four children and went to Pam's side. She died \n     just a short time later.\n       James Johnson was tried, convicted and sentenced to death \n     by a jury in February 1993. Every one of his appeals, \n     including his appeal before the Missouri Supreme Court, was \n     denied. In the Missouri Supreme Court, all but one of the \n     judges affirmed the decision of the lower court. The only \n     dissent was from Judge Ronnie White. In his opinion, Judge \n     White urged that Johnson be given a second chance at freedom. \n     I cannot understand his reasoning. I know that the four \n     people Johnson killed were not given a second chance.\n       When I learned that Judge White was picked by President \n     Clinton to sit on the federal bench, I was outraged. Because \n     of Judge White's dissenting opinion in the Johnson case, I \n     felt he was unsuitable to be appointed for life to such an \n     important and powerful position. During the Missouri \n     Sheriffs' Association Annual Conference in 1999, I started a \n     petition drive among the sheriffs to oppose the nomination. \n     The petition simply requested that consideration be given to \n     Judge White's dissenting opinion in the Johnson case as a \n     factor in his appointment to the federal bench. Seventy-seven \n     Missouri sheriffs, both Democrats and Republicans, signed the \n     petition and it was available to anyone who asked. I have the \n     petition with me and respectfully ask that it be made a part \n     of the record of this hearing. A copy was forwarded to both \n     Senator Bond and Senator Ashcroft. I also asked that the \n     National Sheriffs' Association support us in opposing Judge \n     White's nomination. They willingly did so and I am grateful \n     that they joined us and wrote a strong letter opposing Judge \n     White's nomination.\n       While some would have you believe otherwise, this is the \n     only reason sheriffs opposed the nomination of Judge White. \n     We contacted Senator Ashcroft and urged him to oppose this \n     nomination as well. He agreed with our position, but \n     unfortunately, his view on Judge White's nomination was \n     misrepresented in the press and misrepresented to other \n     members of the Senate. People alleged all sorts of reasons \n     for the eventual defeat of Judge White's nomination. I can \n     only speak for myself and can only testify to what I know to \n     be true. I opposed Judge White's elevation to the federal \n     bench solely because of his opinion in the Johnson case. \n     Johnson murdered my wife in cold blood. He killed three close \n     friends and colleagues and seriously wounded a fourth. \n     Offering him a second chance as Judge White would do, is \n     something that I will never understand. I asked Senator \n     Ashcroft to oppose the nomination based on what I have shared \n     with you here during this hearing. By opposing the nomination \n     of Judge White, Senator Ashcroft did nothing more than \n     properly exercise Constitutional authority based on the \n     information he had available. I hope this information will \n     correct the record and prove that John Ashcroft did not act \n     with an unseemly intent.\n       To deny John Ashcroft and reject his nomination to be \n     Attorney General based solely on his opposition to Judge \n     White would be wrong and a terrible loss for the country. I \n     hope my testimony today provides the information you seek to \n     make a truly informed decision on John Ashcroft. In my view, \n     he will make a fine Attorney General and I hope that he will \n     be confirmed. Thank you Mr. Chairman and I stand ready to \n     answer your questions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Testimony of U.S. Representative Kenny Hulshof Before the U.S. Senate \n                Committee on Judiciary, January 18, 2001\n\n       I would like to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \n     Hatch for the opportunity to testify before this committee.\n       I fully support President-elect Bush's decision to nominate \n     Senator John Ashcroft to the position of Attorney General. \n     His past service to the people of my home state of Missouri \n     as Attorney General, Governor and Senator give him the \n     experience and knowledge to be an effective agent of justice \n     for all Americans.\n       I am not here today as a U.S. Representative from \n     Missouri's Ninth District. My appearance here is to share \n     with you my unique knowledge of the case of State of Missouri \n     vs. James Johnson.\n       From February of 1989 until January of 1996, I served as a \n     Special Prosecutor for the Missouri Attorney General's \n     Office. In this capacity, my duties included the prosecution \n     of politically sensitive or difficult murder cases across the \n     State of Missouri. I handled cases in 53 Missouri counties \n     and have tried and convicted violent criminals in more than \n     60 felony jury trials. In January, 1992, I was assigned as \n     co-counsel in the prosecution of the Johnson case.\n       As you know, the Johnson case has taken on national \n     prominence, but not because it involves a convicted cop \n     killer. It has become a focal point in this process due to \n     the strong disagreement that John Ashcroft and some law \n     enforcement groups had with Missouri Supreme Court Judge \n     Ronnie White's sole dissent on the appeal of this case.\n       You are measuring John Ashcroft's ability to be the \n     nation's Attorney General by examining his record. In the \n     same manner, John Ashcroft measured Ronnie White's ability to \n     be a federal jurist by scrutinizing his record and published \n     opinions--not his race as some have charged. John Ashcroft \n     has testified that he had serious reservations about Judge \n     White's opinions regarding law enforcement.\n       Let me share with you the facts of the Johnson case:\n       In December of 1991, Moniteau County Deputy Sheriff Les \n     Roark responded to a domestic disturbance call at the home of \n     James Johnson in rural Missouri. After assuring himself the \n     domestic quarrel had ended, Deputy Roark turned to return to \n     his waiting patrol car. James Johnson whipped a .38 caliber \n     pistol from his waistband of his pants and fired twice at the \n     retreating officer. Johnson, realizing that Roark was \n     clinking valiantly to life, walked over to the fallen officer \n     and shot him again execution-style.\n       He next negotiated the dozen or so miles to the home of \n     Moniteau County Sheriff Kenny Jones. Peering through the \n     window, he saw Pam Jones, the sheriff's wife. She was leading \n     her church women's group in their monthly prayer meeting in \n     her family's living room, her children at her knee. Using a \n     .22 caliber rifle, Johnson fired multiple times through the \n     window, hitting her five times. She was gunned down in cold \n     blood in front of her family.\n       I wish I could tell you that the carnage soon ended. \n     Instead, James Johnson proceeded to the home of Deputy \n     Sheriff Russell Borts. Displaying the methodical demeanor of \n     a calculating killer, Johnson shot Deputy Borts four times \n     through a window as Borts was being summoned for duty via \n     telephone. Miraculously, Borts survived. Cooper County \n     Sheriff Charles Smith and Miller County Deputy Sandra Wilson \n     were not so fortunate. They died in a hail of bullets when \n     Johnson ambushed them outside the sheriff's office.\n       As a result of Johnson's rampage, three dedicated law \n     enforcement officials were dead, one was severely injured and \n     Pam Jones, a loving wife and mother, had been slaughtered.\n       Mr. Chairman, I wish to clarify a few of the points raised \n     during yesterday's hearing regarding the quality of James \n     Johnson's representation at trial. Mr. Johnson hired counsel \n     of his own choosing. He chose a team of\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\n     three experienced defense attorneys who possessed substantial \n     experience in litigation and criminal law. The three \n     litigants had tried a previous capital case together.\n       The record conclusively establishes that counsel launched a \n     wide-ranging investigation in an effort to locate veterans \n     who had served with the accused in Vietnam. Counsel hired and \n     presented three nationally-renowned mental health experts on \n     the relevant issue of posttraumatic stress disorder.\n       The evidence of guilt, however, was unassailable. Based on \n     the strength of a detailed confession by the accused to law \n     enforcement officers, incriminating statements to lay \n     witnesses, eyewitness accounts to one of the murders and \n     circumstantial evidence, including firearms identification, \n     James Johnson was convicted by a jury of four counts of \n     murder in the first degree. The jury later unanimously \n     recommended a sentence of death on each of the four counts.\n       After a lengthy post-conviction hearing on the adequacy of \n     counsel, Circuit Judge James A. Franklin, Jr. found that \n     Johnson's attorneys devoted a significant period of time and \n     expense to his case, including a substantial attempt to \n     develop and present a mental defense. The court found as a \n     matter of law that James Johnson received skilled \n     representation throughout his trial. The case was then \n     automatically appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, where \n     the convictions and sentences were upheld 4-1. Judge White's \n     lone dissent focused on inadequate assistance of counsel at \n     trial. As I have stated and the record indicates, this is \n     clearly not the case.\n       I have been deeply troubled during these confirmation \n     proceedings by statements insinuating, overtly or otherwise, \n     that John Ashcroft is a racist. More to the point, there have \n     been allegations made that John Ashcroft's rejection of Judge \n     Ronnie White's nomination to the federal district court was \n     racially motivated. As a Missourian, I am offended by these \n     baseless claims.\n       It is my belief that members of this distinguished panel \n     and members of the entire Senate take the constitutional role \n     of ``advice and consent'' very seriously. It is an integral \n     part of our system of checks and balances.\n       It is my humble opinion that no individual took that \n     responsibility more seriously than your former colleague, \n     John Ashcroft. As evidence of that fact, I cite to you the \n     October 5, 1999, Congressional Record:\n       ``[Mr. Ashcroft] Confirming judges is serious business. \n     People we put into these Federal judgeships are there for \n     life, removed only with great difficulty, as evidenced by the \n     fact that removals have been extremely rare. There is \n     enormous power on the Federal bench. Most of us have seen \n     things happen through judges that could never have gotten \n     through the House and Senate. Alexander Hamilton, in \n     Federalist Paper No. 78, put it this way:\n       `` `If [judges] should be disposed to exercise will instead \n     of judgement, the consequence would equally be the \n     substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative \n     body.'\n       ``Alexander Hamilton, at the beginning of this Nation, knew \n     just how important it was for us to look carefully at those \n     who would be nominated for and confirmed to serve as \n     judges.''\n       Former Senator Ashcroft then elaborated on the dissenting \n     opinions by Judge White in a series of criminal cases, \n     including State of Missouri v. James Johnson. He acknowledged \n     an outpouring of criticism levied against Judge White's \n     nomination by respectable law enforcement groups. His \n     ultimate rejection of Judge White's nomination was based on \n     his judgement and legal reasoning. As you know, a majority of \n     the Senate voted to reject the nominee.\n       Reasonable minds can differ on John Ashcroft's conclusion \n     regarding Judge White's fitness as a federal jurist. These \n     differences should be vigorously debated and considered. That \n     is the hallmark of our republic. But branding a good man who \n     has devoted his professional life to one of public service \n     with the ugly slur of ``racist without justification or cause \n     is intolerable.\n       I know John Ashcroft. He is an honorable man of high \n     integrity and morals. His commitment to his family, his state \n     and his country are beyond compare. His experience and public \n     service make him very qualified to be the next Attorney \n     General of the United States. You have his assurance that he \n     will faithfully execute the law in a way consistent with the \n     will of Congress, in accordance with the rulings of our \n     judicial system and in a manner that protects the liberties \n     of all Americans.\n       Again, I would like to thank Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member \n     Hatch and this distinguished panel for allowing me to \n     testify.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, 28 years ago, I had the responsibility to \nappoint a State auditor for Missouri. Based upon what I saw to be the \npromise in John Ashcroft--his character, intelligence, and commitment \nto public service--I selected him.\n  For the past 28 years, I have had the honor and privilege to work \nwith him as he handled his duties in the best and highest tradition of \nMissouri and of this country. Many of my colleagues have also seen him \nduring the last 6 years, when he served with distinction in the Senate.\n  I know this man. Most of you in this body know this man. He is a good \nman, whose service reflects well on his friends, his family, our State \nof Missouri, and on this great body.\n  Everything about John Ashcroft's record of public service and his \npersonal integrity and character tells us that he will be faithful to \nthe law. Everything about John's career also tells us that he \nunderstands one thing above all else: The promise contained in this \nNation of laws can only be realized when all the laws are properly \nenforced.\n  Two weeks ago, I went before the Judiciary Committee to ask that they \njudge John Ashcroft's nomination to be Attorney General on the content \nof his character, and reject the slime campaign then underway against \nhim.\n  Today I must say I stand here profoundly disappointed so many failed \nto push away those whose only goal is to tear down and destroy.\n  However, let me add my sincere appreciation of the fact that some of \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to support \nthis nomination, despite the strong political winds blowing against \nthem, including clear-cut threats of retaliation at the polls for any \nvote in favor of John Ashcroft.\n  Senator Russ Feingold was courageous in casting the lone Democratic \nvote in favor of the nominee in committee. My friends, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Dodd, and others, have announced on the floor they intend to \nsupport the nominee for reasons they gave. I commend them and thank \nthem for that.\n  I note that others of my colleagues appear to have given the \nnomination full consideration and concluded, for their own substantive \nreasons, not to support this nomination. While I disagree with their \nfinal decision, I certainly cannot condemn their actions. But I am \ndeeply disturbed and disappointed in some of the things done and said \nin the Judiciary Committee and some of the remarks made on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Over the past month, we have seen self-described spokesmen of various \nactivist groups--groups that preach tolerance, diversity and religious \nfreedom--systematically display their intolerance, narrowness, and \ndogmatic views, as they try to smear the record of the man who has been \nnominated to be the Attorney General of the United States.\n  In fact, I think the words on this chart tell us all we need to \nknow--this is from the special interest groups of what they are doing--\n``by any means necessary.'' ``We're going to spend whatever it takes.'' \nThese are the words of the extreme liberal groups that are out to \nsabotage John Ashcroft and, incidentally, his nomination. The purpose--\nsearch and destroy.\n  Like millions of Americans, I watched the Senate confirmation hearing \nto see both how my friend would do in answering questions defending his \nrecord but also to see how potential opponents would handle their \nresponsibilities.\n  I, too, hoped for full and fair hearings.\n  Two weeks ago, the American people did not see a confirmation \nhearing. They did not see the Senate Judiciary Committee acquit itself \nin the best and highest traditions of this fine body. They did not see \nfull and fair hearings. What they saw--pure and simple--was an exercise \nin political theater of the worst kind.\n  I cannot begin to express my profound disappointment in how some of \nmy colleagues handled their few days in the majority--mishandled their \ndays to rise above the rancor. In the Ashcroft hearing, there was an \nopportunity to set an example for us to follow for the rest of this \nsession. Instead of rising to the occasion, too many sank to the level \nof the interest groups, where only the shrillest survive.\n  What we heard was a campaign designed to create a caricature, and to \nfan the grotesque charges of racism, bigotry, and so-called political \nopportunism--a campaign so out of control that 2 days of questions were \nnot enough. An extra day of attack witnesses, and hundreds of \nadditional questions--often asking the same questions over and over \nagain--were then submitted for the record. They even went so far as to \nask for a ``complete discussion'' of all conversations that then-\nSenator Ashcroft had with Senate leaders about any of the 1,600 \nPresidential nominations considered by the Senate during his term.\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\n  That is an impossible task. Nobody can recall those. The reaction was \nthat the answers were incomplete, when they did not report all those \nconversations. Who of us could have done that unless we had carried a \ntape recorder in our pocket at all times.\n  To the special interest groups who invented the term ``Borking,'' I \nhad little expectation they could or would understand or embrace the \nterms of civility and respect. So I expected that false charges would \nbe leveled--repeated and repeated--in hopes that something would stick. \nBut I had hopes that colleagues would resist those charges. Too often, \nthey did not.\n  What are those false charges? One of the false charges thrown against \nJohn Ashcroft was that he could not be entrusted to enforce laws with \nwhich he personally disagrees. Now, Janet Reno opposed the death \npenalty, yet she was trusted to follow the law. Now, 8 years later, why \nis it that with John Ashcroft, a conservative and committed Christian, \ndoubts are aired--and given credence--about his ability to enforce the \nlaw?\n  Some activists who claim to embrace and promote religious diversity \nand tolerance seem unable to extend their beliefs to a conservative \nChristian. I thought we broke that barrier when John F. Kennedy became \nPresident and we saw the obvious that he did not put his Catholic \nbeliefs above the law of the land. And what of our colleague Joe \nLieberman, whose candidacy for Vice President and his public religious \nutterances tore down even more barriers? Should religious diversity and \ntolerance be extended only to some religions and not others? What we \nsee in this part of the smear campaign against John Ashcroft is nothing \nless than religious bigotry.\n  Second, we have seen the absolutely reckless charge that John \nAshcroft opposed desegregation. Several Members have attempted to use \nthe long, tortured and controversial school desegregation cases in the \nState of Missouri to color further their caricature of John Ashcroft as \ninsensitive and an extremist. To do so, however, they have to ignore \nthe facts of the case, the various tortured rulings, the victory in the \nKansas City case, the fiduciary duty of the Attorney General and the \nwidespread opposition to the court-ordered desegregation plan by the \npublic and elected officials alike.\n  The truth of the matter is that the desegregation cases were filed in \nSt. Louis and Kansas City in 1972, with Kansas City being litigated \nuntil 1995 and the St. Louis case being litigated until 1999. The \nlawsuits and the various court orders have been opposed by Democratic \nand Republican Governors, Attorneys General and State Treasurers and \nthe overwhelming majority of Missourians for nearly three decades. To \nsingle out John Ashcroft and to say his positions on the case and his \nwork was that of an extremist insensitive to the needs of Missouri \nschool children is one of the more misleading positions ever staked out \non this floor.\n  Since I cannot imagine that colleagues and critics would have one set \nof standards for John Ashcroft, and another for those in their own \nparty, it is only fitting that we review the whole record of the day.\n  In September of 1981, in response to the controversial Eighth Circuit \ndecision, the current Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, \nRichard Gephardt, introduced a constitutional amendment to ban court \nordered busing to achieve racial integration. Congressman Gephardt was \nalso a sponsor of legislation to bar federal courts from mandating \nbusing as a remedy for segregated schools. In explaining his \nlegislation, the esteemed minority leader called busing for \ndesegregation ``a total failure'' and called the court-ordered busing \nprogram in the St. Louis schools ``an obscenity and a crime against the \nyouth of St. Louis.'' About the same time, again while Senator Ashcroft \nwas Missouri Attorney General, Missouri Senator Tom Eagleton, my \npredecessor, stated publicly that he ``personally opposes court ordered \nbusing'' and did not believe the St. Louis plan would work. While in \nthe Senate he fought the Department of Health, Education and Welfare \npractice of denying funding to school districts that do not have a \nschool desegregation plan in place.\n  Beyond that, both Missouri State Treasurers who served while John \nAshcroft was Attorney General, both of whom were Democrats, opposed the \ncourt ordered desegregation. In fact, the second of those Treasurers, \nthe late Mel Carnahan, was highly critical of both Attorney General \nAshcroft and me for the handling for the desegregation case. He was not \ncritical of anyone opposing the plan, rather he felt the Attorney \nGeneral was not being aggressive enough in the fight. In 1981, he told \nUPI, ``In my opinion, they have not staffed up and produced in this \ncase and that's the reason we're where we are today on desegregation.''\n  And in 1983, as he was gearing up to run for Governor, Treasurer \nCarnahan even took the unusual action of requesting a state \nappropriation so that the Treasurer's office could join the case, \ninitiating new litigation against the federal court order desegregating \nthe St. Louis schools. The Treasurer said the desegregation payments \nrepresented ``burdensome demands on the taxpayers of the state.'' He \nfurther stated ``my staff and I have been intensely studying the \nfinancial problems created for the State of Missouri by the court \norders in the St. Louis desegregation case. It is my intention to file \nadditional actions or motions directed to testing the issues of state \nliability for payments . . . I plan to use outside counsel for a \nseparate additional effort to supplement and complement the efforts of \nthe Attorney General to reverse or modify the orders as to state \nfinancial liability.''\n  As Governor, I refused to support the appropriation because it was \nthe job of the Attorney General to handle legal matters that impact the \nstate. But that statement by the state Treasurer, a Democrat and future \nGovernor, shows that John Ashcroft was clearly in the mainstream and \nrepresenting the people of the state in a complicated and controversial \nlegal matter. Unless of course Mel Carnahan was an extremist too. The \nstrong democratic opposition did not stop in the eighties but continued \nright on through the '98 election cycle. In fact, the current Missouri \nAttorney General, Democrat Jay Nixon, made opposition to state \ninvolvement in school desegregation a platform of his first campaign \nfor Attorney General, calling busing ``a failed social experiment'' \nthat must end in the State of Missouri. And he criticized Ashcroft and \nWebster, the two previous Attorneys Generals by stating ``The \nrepublican team hasn't been fighting the battle against unfair \ndesegregation payments; they've been losing it.'' ``We need new and \nbetter lawyers to win the case.''\n\n  Upon taking office, Nixon filed suit to end state involvement in the \nSt. Louis desegregation case and filed suit to overturn a court \ndecision in Kansas City. Shortly after that he appealed and fought the \nKansas City plan all the way to the United States Supreme Court. In St. \nLouis, he criticized the appointment of a well respected St. Louisan \nappointed to negotiate a settlement. He even filed suit on the eve of \nthe beginning of the school year to bar student participation in a St. \nLouis city-county transfer program.\n  Former Congressman Bill Clay, in a letter to President Clinton, \nsharply criticized the Democratic Attorney General as ``waging \nunremitting warfare'' against the court orders which ``provided \neducational opportunity for many thousands of students in St. Louis''. \nNixon was also repeatedly criticized by the St. Louis chapter of the \nNAACP for his efforts. In 1995, the group said those efforts ``will \nwipe out the gains made by desegregation and deprive city parents of \nopportunities they now have to better their children's education''. The \nKansas City Star said this Attorney General ``climbed over the backs of \nAfrican Americans'' to advance his career.\n  Yet when this man wanted again to advance his political career, was \nthe Senator from Massachusetts condemning his actions? Quite to the \ncontrary, the Senator from Massachusetts was actively promoting his \npolitical career, even headlining a fund raiser for him here in \nWashington. Nor can I imagine the Senator labeling the positions of \nCongressman Gephardt, former Senator Eagleton, and the late Governor \nCarnahan, whose campaign the Senator from Massachusetts supported, as \nextreme. The hypocrisy could not be clearer. And leads us back to those \nguiding principles of this entire effort against John Ashcroft--by\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\nany means necessary, and spend whatever it takes.\n  The third charge centers around his handling of the nomination of \nJudge Ronnie White. Much has been said about this, but let me simply \nsay that the emotional power and pain of the Johnson case remains as \nstrong today as it was 10 years ago when the brutal murders tore apart \nthe lives of 4 families and their communities.\n  For all my colleagues who agreed with Judge White's reasoning that \nwould have tossed out the conviction and granted a new trial to the \ntriple cop-killer who also killed the sheriff's wife right in front of \nher 8 year old daughter; for those who agreed with his lone dissent \nthat Johnson's lawyers didn't do a good enough job so he deserves a new \ntrial--I would hope they would channel their strong views and weigh in \nwith Missouri's Governor in seeking a commutation of his death \nsentence. Johnson's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court has been denied \nand he now sits on death row. I can certainly provide any of you the \ncorrect address of the Governor in Jefferson City.\n  Finally the latest attempt to smear--so weak that's it more of a \nsmudge--was made by a democrat activist who claimed that 16 years ago \nJohn Ashcroft asked a legal but inappropriate question during a job \ninterview. Quickly refuted by others present in the interview this \nattempted smear fades from view, but again takes time and energy to \nrespond to. And when all one's energy is spent knocking down false \ncharges it is hard to find the time to talk about what you believe can \nbe accomplished at the Justice Department--which of course is what the \npeople of America are really interested in. How will you do the job? \nWhat are your plans to improve the lives and opportunities for all \nAmericans?\n  So where does all this leave us? Back where we started.\n  A conservative, pro-life, Christian simply isn't fit to serve \naccording to the litmus test of a bunch of left-wing groups. And rather \nthan admit it, the smokescreen of false charges must be used to justify \ntheir own intolerance. It is a sad day that we have come to this. But \nthrough it all John Ashcroft has stayed firm. Firm in his belief that \nin America our sense of fairness will outweigh short term political \ngain. Firm in his belief that while his attackers have been shameless \nand unrelenting, that he should not, and will not respond in kind.\n  I am so proud of John Ashcroft. I am proud of his service to Missouri \nand the nation over the last 28 years. At each level of responsibility, \nhe not only acquitted himself as a gentleman and good American, but he \ndid great work on behalf of so many citizens. That is true of his terms \nas Missouri Attorney General. As Governor. And United States Senator. \nHe is a fine man. He is a gentleman. A good man of deep conviction who \nwill do great service on behalf of all Americans as our next Attorney \nGeneral. So I am also very proud that a fellow Missourian will become \nthe next Attorney General of the United States of America. But perhaps \nmost of all, I am proud to be able to call John Ashcroft my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I will vote to confirm \nformer Senator John Ashcroft as Attorney General of the United States. \nThe President of the United States has the constitutional authority to \nnominate those individuals he thinks will most ably advise him; \ntherefore, I give President Bush latitude in choosing the members of \nhis Cabinet. My role in this process, as defined by the Constitution, \nis to give my advice and consent to the President on his nominees for \nCabinet positions. In keeping with that duty, I want to present a clear \nexplanation as to why I will vote to confirm the President's choice for \nAttorney General.\n  I have known John Ashcroft for well over 10 years. We both have had \nthe honor to serve as the Chief Executive for our respective States. We \nwere even colleagues for 2 years when our terms as Governor overlapped. \nI am familiar with his philosophy and his viewpoints and though we do \nnot see eye-to-eye on every issue I respect him as a person and \nconsider him a friend.\n  But before my statement is dismissed as a rubber stamp approval, let \nme be clear: My vote to confirm Senator Ashcroft is not without some \nconcerns. I am disappointed with his decision to accept an honorary \ndegree from Bob Jones University, an institution that has become a \nnational symbol for racial and religious intolerance, without any \nacknowledgement or discussion let alone repudiation of that school's \npolicies that were egregious. And secondly, his handling of the Judge \nWhite nomination was considered by many of his former colleagues to \nhave been unfair.\n  But these two instances, while troubling, are not disqualifying. For \nme this vote today is an affirmative vote as a prologue to the future \nrather than a reaction to the past. This is supported by his pledge he \nmade at his confirmation hearing to serve as Attorney General for ``all \nthe people.''\n  I take Senator Ashcroft at his word when he says, and I quote, ``I \nunderstand that being Attorney General means enforcing the laws as they \nare written, not enforcing my own personal preferences. It means \nadvancing the national interest, not advocating my personal interest.'' \nThroughout his confirmation hearing, Senator Ashcroft was unequivocal \nand unwavering with respect to the manner in which he would serve, if \nelected, as Attorney General.\n  Additionally, yesterday I spoke to Senator Ashcroft and expressed my \nreservations and concerns. In that conversation, he reiterated his \ncommitment to lead a professional and nonpartisan Justice Department, \nand assured me of his intention to honor his pledge.\n  For me, this affirmative vote is not about politics; it is about \npotential and opportunity. If Senator Ashcroft is a man of integrity--\nwhich he says he is and which I believe him to be--then he will uphold \nhis constitutional duty, prove his nay-sayers wrong, and work \ntirelessly to help ensure justice for all. Indeed, the stakes are high, \nbut that is exactly where Senator Ashcroft has put them. I look forward \nto working with him and to helping him keep his unequivocal promise to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft has \nreceived broad bipartisan support from a number of organizations.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nJohn Ashcroft to be Attorney General.\n  I have given a great deal of thought to this nomination and have \nconsidered it very seriously. As a new Senator, I did not serve with \nSenator Ashcroft, so I do not know him personally. However, I \npersonally attended the nomination hearings and listened carefully to \nthe testimony. I also reviewed many of the statements prepared by \nsupporters and opponents of the nomination, and heard from a large \nnumber of my constituents in New Jersey.\n  After considering all the facts, I concluded that Senator Ashcroft, \nwhile in many ways a very fine and distinguished public servant, simply \nis not the right person for the job. Let me take a few moments to \nexplain my thinking.\n  In general, I believe that a President's choice for a Cabinet \nposition deserves deference. However, the position of Attorney General \ndeserves special scrutiny. As head of the Justice Department, the \nAttorney General has the unique responsibility to interpret the law on \nbehalf of the executive branch, to investigate and prosecute suspected \ncriminals, to uphold our civil rights laws, to represent the government \nbefore the Supreme Court through the Office of the Solicitor General, \nand to manage immigration, among many other critically important \nresponsibilities. In addition, the Attorney General, while serving the \nPresident, also must maintain a degree of independence from politics, \nso that he or she can pursue wrongdoing within the government. The \nAttorney General is the people's lawyer. For all these reasons, it is \nimperative that the Attorney General be an individual not only of \nunquestioned personal integrity, but someone who will be broadly \nperceived as administering justice and enforcing the law fairly and \nimpartially for all people.\n  Unfortunately, after examining Senator Ashcroft's record, I have \nserious\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\nconcerns about whether as Attorney General he would be able to set \naside his long-standing and strongly held views and perform his duties \nin a fully objective, fair and impartial manner.\n  I base this conclusion on several prior instances in which Senator \nAshcroft's view of the law and the facts seem to have been heavily \nbiased and colored by his ideology. Perhaps most importantly, in 1997, \nhe led the opposition to Judge White of the Missouri Supreme Court by \nmaking a series of accusations that were inaccurate. For example, he \nclaimed that Judge White opposed the death penalty and believed that \n``it apparently is unimportant . . . how clear the evidence of guilt.'' \nThis was very unfair, as Judge White voted to affirm death sentences in \nthe vast majority of cases that had come before him, and had \nunequivocally assured the Judiciary Committee that he was prepared to \nimpose the death penalty. In fact, in the case that Senator Ashcroft \nused to criticize Judge White, the Judge's decision was based not on \nopposition to the death penalty, but on a reasoned analysis of serious \nconstitutional problems that he believed had prevented the defendant \nfrom receiving a fair trial. This was a clear example of Senator \nAshcroft's ideology coloring his interpretation of the facts.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's strong ideological approach also seemed to skew \nhis views in the case of Bill Lann Lee, a nominee to head the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice. Senator Ashcroft said he \nvoted again Lee because of ``serious concerns about his willingness to \nenforce'' a Supreme Court decision limiting preferences for minority \ncompanies in awarding government contracts, and the Senator adopted a \nhighly restrictive interpretation of that decision, challenging Mr. \nLee's interpretations of the Court's instructions and guidance. \nHowever, this challenge appears to have been based on Senator \nAshcroft's own ideological opposition to affirmative action, not the \nlaw or the Court's direction.\n  In another case, when he served as attorney general of Missouri, \nSenator Ashcroft sought to invalidate a State law that authorized \nnurses to engage in various practices, including the dispensing of \ncontraceptives. Senator Ashcroft, a strong opponent of abortion, argued \nthat this was unconstitutional. Yet there was no constitutional \nauthority for this position, and it was rejected by the Missouri \nSupreme Court on a unanimous vote. Again, Senator Ashcroft's strongly \nheld ideological views had skewed his views of the law and led to a \nhighly subjective and biased conclusion with little objective merit.\n  These are just a few of many examples in which Senator Ashcroft \ndemonstrated an inability to move beyond his own views and reach a \nfair, objective and balanced conclusion about the merits of a legal \nposition. If history is any guide, his enforcement of the law will be \nseriously biased by his ideological views. This, in my view, \ndisqualifies him for a position as Attorney General, for which \nfairness, objectivity and balance are perhaps the most important \nqualities. In a period in our nation's history in which we need to come \ntogether after a divisive election, I believe it would be a mistake to \nselect an Attorney General whose tendency to view the law ideologically \ncould aggravate our nation's divisions.\n  For all these reasons, I oppose this nomination.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing editorial that appeared last week in the Arkansas Democrat-\nGazette regarding the nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be the \nnext Attorney General appear in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Jan. 23, 2001]\n\n               Ted Kennedy's America--The New McCarthyism\n\n       Is anybody surprised that the senator who made Bork a verb \n     is looking for ways to derail John Ashcroft's confirmation as \n     attorney general? And Ted Kennedy knows just how to do it: \n     Talk it to death. He says he may lead a filibuster against \n     the nominee. It'd be an historic first--and an historic low.\n       Ted Kennedy has a way of being first, and low. The first to \n     get to a party, the first to abandon a car submerged under \n     water with a young lady still in it, the first to leave the \n     scene of an accident. Some of us remember another of Mr. \n     Kennedy's firsts: His classic War of the Worlds performance \n     during the Senate's hearing on Robert Bork's nomination to \n     the Supreme Court. In the 1930s Orson Welles reported an \n     invasion from Mars; Ted Kennedy imagines an invasion from the \n     neolithic Right.\n       Speaking in the well of the Senate, he envisioned Robert \n     Bork's America as one where ``Women would be forced into \n     back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch \n     counters, rogue police would break down citizens' doors in \n     midnight raids.'' It all made 1984 look kind of warm and \n     homey.\n       The intensity of the fight over Robert Bork's confirmation, \n     and the acrimony it sparked, didn't come without warning. It \n     was billed in advance as a battle of virgin ideologies--the \n     far, far left versus the far, far right, each side too pure \n     to give quarter to the other. It hardly surprised that ultra-\n     liberal Ted Kennedy would come out swinging against ultra-\n     conservative Robert Bork. What surprised--and appalled--was \n     the senator's neo-McCarthyisms.\n       In Ted Kennedy's America, you no longer ruin people's \n     character by calling them Communists. You call them racists. \n     Or just imply it. Robert Bork was morphed from a respected, \n     if very conservative, judge to a kind of American Nazi. Ted \n     Kennedy and hysterical company had no more evidence of Judge \n     Bork's racism than Joe McCarthy had the goods on George \n     Marshall. But that's the strategy of the witch-hunter: Indict \n     first, then the other guy has to prove he's not guilty--that \n     he's stopped beating his wife. It's called shifting the \n     burden of proof.\n       Ted Kennedy isn't waving a list of Communists in the State \n     Department, la Machine Gunner Joe, but a list of racists in \n     the next Cabinet. At the top is one John Ashcroft, former \n     attorney general, governor, and United States senator from \n     Missouri. And seg, if you can believe Ted Kennedy.\n       During last week's hearing, Senator Kennedy accused John \n     Ashcroft of fighting desegregation and voter registration. \n     Even for the U.S. Senate, the message wasn't subtle: John \n     Ashcroft's America would also be one of segregated lunch \n     counters. This is the same John Ashcroft who appointed more \n     African American judges than any other governor in Missouri. \n     The same John Ashcroft who signed the Martin Luther King \n     holiday into law. The same John Ashcroft who appointed the \n     first black judge to that state's court of appeals. And the \n     same John Ashcroft who signed the first Missouri hate-crimes \n     law as governor, and then voted for 26 out of 28 African \n     American judicial nominees as a U.S. Senator.\n       John Ashcroft seems to have failed at being a racist as \n     completely as Ted Kennedy has at being a civil leader of the \n     opposition. To quote a former Democratic senator, Bob Kerry: \n     ``I think John Ashcroft is colorblind. That's one of the good \n     things that comes from his religious belief.'' But being \n     colorblind is the worst things you can be in Ted Kennedy's \n     America. If you dare embrace Martin Luther King's dream--that \n     one day all Americans will be judged not by the color of \n     their skin but by the content of their character--you're a \n     racist.\n       John Ashcroft learned this the hard way after he opposed \n     His Honor Ronnie White's appointment to the federal bench in \n     1999. He made the mistake of judging the nominee's record \n     without considering the color of his skin. He felt Judge \n     White had dissented from one too many death sentences. It was \n     a clash of philosophy, not a racial preference.\n       But in Ted Kennedy's America, race is a philosophy. His is \n     a country where Colin Powell is tarred as an Uncle Tom, and \n     Bill Clinton is hailed as Our First Black President. ``In \n     my view,'' Ted Kennedy declared, ``what happened to you is \n     the ugliest thing that's happened to any nominee in all my \n     years in the United States Senate.'' He wasn't addressing \n     Robert Bork, but Ronnie White.\n       There are times when the irony is so thick in Washington, \n     it becomes farce. Please note that Ted Kennedy voted against \n     Clarence Thomas, a conservative who still managed to become a \n     justice of Supreme Court of the United States. Nobody \n     insinuated that Senator Kennedy based his vote on Clarence \n     Thomas' race, which happens to be African American. He voted \n     against Justice Thomas because he opposed the conservative \n     jurist's philosophy, which he had every right to do. But he \n     won't recognize the same good faith in John Ashcroft.\n       For all the talk of the New Civility in Washington, we're \n     back to the old incivilities. The politics of personal \n     destruction? We have sunk even lower--to the politics of \n     national division. It wouldn't be the first time: Joe \n     McCarthy, like Ted Kennedy, was an aimless demagogue who \n     drank a lot.\n       What was disturbing was not the man but the -ism. It \n     allowed Joe McCarthy to be seen as the representative of the \n     American way, rather than a freakish exception. The junior \n     senator for Wisconsin was a political accident who never had \n     the sense of purpose to be really dangerous. In the end, the \n     clumsy oaf sabotaged the Right, not the Left. He made anti-\n     communism, not communism, suspect.\n       Now the McCarthyites of the Left was poised to do the same \n     dubious service for their political persuasion. The more \n     hysterical they sound, and the more outlandish their \n     accusations, the more credibility they will lose. John \n     Ashcroft's case is not the exception, but part of the trend. \n     Remember the campaign ads that tried to associate George W. \n     Bush with the lynching of James Byrd? The Democratic Party \n     has found its Red Scare. Or white scare.\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n       The party of Abraham Lincoln was to be re-cast as the party \n     of George Wallace and Orval Faubus (who happened to be \n     Democrats, but never mind). And Ted Kenndy now emerges as the \n     new Joe McCarthy, sniffing out any opportunity to paint a \n     political opponent as a racist. His victims, like John \n     Ashcroft, are left to prove that they aren't.\n       Where are the Margaret Chase Smiths and Dwight Eisenhowers \n     of the Democratic Party? The kind of people who will put \n     country above party, and distance themselves from the \n     demagogues? Don't look for any before 2002.\n       The Democrats are on the verge of taking back Congress--if \n     they can just scare enough people. Joe McCarthy would \n     understand.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, encircling the Great Seal of the State \nof Missouri are the words ``United We Stand; Divided We Fall.'' It is a \nmotto that has guided our people well over the last 180 years.\n  In that same spirit, President Bush, at the onset of this new \ncentury, has declared that he wants to be ``uniter not a divider.''\n  I am deeply encouraged, for I want to join with him and the Congress \nto reach across the chasm of our political differences to do some hard \nwork for the American people.\n  Within the Senate, we have already reached out in a spirit of bi-\npartisanship in structuring our committees. So far I have had the \nopportunity to vote in favor of all of the President's Cabinet \nnominees.\n  This was the beginning of a conciliatory course--a fragile alliance--\nbut, nonetheless, one that I believe must mark any real progress in the \n107th Congress.\n  But I do not believe that the nomination of John Ashcroft furthers \nthe conciliatory tone that President Bush has set.\n  Senator Ashcroft has a long record of public service--a record that I \nbrought to the attention of the Judiciary Committee when I introduced \nhim. But in the end, I must determine if that record makes him suitable \nto be the United States Attorney General.\n  Had Senator Ashcroft been nominated for any other Cabinet post, I \ncould have easily supported him. His credentials or faith are not in \ndispute here, nor should they ever be. Rather, it is the conflict that \nhis words and deeds have generated throughout his public career.\n  Given the sweeping discretionary power of this position, I do not \nbelieve that the office of Attorney General of the United States is the \nright job for Senator Ashcroft.\n  When asked by my colleagues about this nomination, I urged them to \nignore their personal relationships and political considerations. \nInstead, I called on them to vote their conscience. I must do the same.\n  Regrettably, I am unable to provide my consent for this nomination.\n  I am compelled by principles and beliefs I shared with my husband for \nover forty years in public life, including the belief that we should do \nall in our power to bring people together rather than drive them apart.\n  The call of conscience must supersede all others. It is the only \nreliable anchor in the tempestuous sea of public life.\n  In casting this vote, I do so knowing that John Ashcroft will likely \nbe confirmed. I wish him every success. I hope he will take these votes \nof dissent as they are intended: not as acts of spite or recrimination, \nbut as pleas for healing and harmony.\n  While I must withhold my vote on his confirmation, I pledge my \nsupport on all matters that he and the President pursue in the interest \nof a more just and peaceful nation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the confirmation \nof my friend and former colleague, Senator John Ashcroft, to be \nAttorney General of the United States. As a man of the highest \nintegrity, experience, and ability, Senator Ashcroft is uniquely \nqualified to serve as our nation's premier law enforcement officer and \nthe administrator of one of the federal government's largest agencies.\n  Senator Ashcroft's qualifications for the position of Attorney \nGeneral have been well documented on the floor and I only need mention \nthem in passing: law professor, State auditor, two-term Attorney \nGeneral, two-term Governor, and United States Senator from the State of \nMissouri. Such a record of public service spanning such a period of \nyears demonstrates the great trust and admiration the people of \nMissouri have placed in Senator Ashcroft over nearly 30 years.\n  What has impressed me about Senator John Ashcroft's record is not \nonly the length of public service, but the breadth of this experience \nas well. There is no doubt that the ideal candidate for the position of \nattorney general is someone who has a good grasp of the law and a true \ndedication to enforce that law. However, the job entails a great deal \nmore than that. In fact, the attorney general needs to be a good \nmanager to oversee the 125,000 employees of the Department of Justice \nin departments as diverse as the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons. Senator Ashcroft's sixteen years as an executive in Missouri, \nfirst as State attorney general and then as Governor, have made him \nuniquely qualified to manage one of the largest federal agencies. \nMoreover, his service with us in the United States Senate and his \ninvolvement on the Senate Judiciary Committee have prepared him to work \nclosely with Congress in enforcement and development of Federal law.\n  In addition to Senator Ashcroft's remarkable credentials to serve as \nUnited States Attorney General for all Americans, I would like to \nremark on his particular interest and experience in the crime issues \nfacing rural communities. As many of my colleagues know, in the past \nseveral years rural America has witnessed an explosion in illegal \nmethamphetamine use, especially among our nation's youth. Nationwide, \nmeth use increased 60% between 1992 and 1999 among America's high \nschool seniors. Unfortunately, the story is much bleaker in our rural \ncommunities. In my own State of Wyoming, methamphetamine investigations \nincreased 600% between 1992 and 1998. Like all illegal drug abuse, meth \nabuse tears at the very fabric of society by destroying families, \nincreasing violent crime, and dashing the dreams and promise of all too \nmany of our nation's youth.\n  While the battle against meth use and trafficking is primarily a \nState responsibility, there is a role for the federal government by \nsupplying resources for law enforcement training, meth lab cleanup, and \neducation and prevention programs to help parents and teachers teach \nchildren the dangers of meth. Senator Ashcroft was a true leader in \nrecognizing and furthering a limited, focused role for the Federal \nGovernment in the battle against methamphetamine use and trafficking. \nIn 1999, Senator Ashcroft introduced legislation to combat this \nproblem. While I knew that Missouri had faced many of the same problems \nfaced in Wyoming, I was truly impressed with Senator Ashcroft's \nunderstanding of the meth problem and willingness to listen to the \nproblems facing law enforcement in other states. Before introducing his \nlegislation, Senator Ashcroft and his staff made a particular effort to \nunderstand the problems facing law enforcement personnel in Wyoming and \nincorporated our suggestions in Senator Ashcroft's legislation to help \naddress these problems. I have to say that Senator Ashcroft's deep \nunderstanding of the greatest crime issue facing our State of Wyoming \nand his experience as a problem solver both as Governor of Missouri and \nUnited States Senator give me great encouragement that he will work \nwith the Congress to address the needs of all states, not just those \nwith large urban areas.\n  I must say that Senator Ashcroft's understanding and appreciation for \nthe issues involved in the area of rural crime stands in stark contrast \nwith my experience with the previous Administration. Law enforcement \nofficials in my State have all too often been given the run around by \nthe Department of Justice and the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy when they have attempted to pursue additional funding programs \nor when they have attempted to include additional Wyoming counties to \nthe list of High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. In fact, in one \nconversation, an employee at the ONDCP told a top law enforcement \nofficer in Wyoming that they didn't have anyone at the department that \ncould approve new HIDTAs! I found that somewhat astonishing given that \nis one of the very purposes of the office of the Drug Czar. Given his \ntrack record in the State of Missouri and in the United States Senate, \nI have every confidence\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nthat a Justice Department headed by John Ashcroft will pursue a \ncoordinated approach with the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nand other agencies to help eliminate the red tape and ensure that our \nlaw enforcement personnel in rural states are receiving the resources \nthey need to keep our communities safe and drug free.\n\n  We have heard a great deal of acrimony from some of the far-left \ninterest groups over the nomination of Senator Ashcroft. Evidently \nthese groups are intent in destroying Senator Ashcroft's reputation \neven if they are unsuccessful in derailing his confirmation. The \nattacks by these organizations are entirely unfounded and seem more \ndesigned to raise funds for the particular interest groups than to find \nthe truth about our former colleague.\n  I must say that one of the charges that has been most disturbing to \nme is the insinuation that Senator Ashcroft will not faithfully enforce \nthe laws of the United States because he is a devoted Christian. Not \nonly are such charges entirely unfounded, but they smack of a religious \nbigotry of the most dangerous Kind. Such bigotry is nothing new, but is \nshould be condemned in any age in which it raises its ugly head. One no \nless than George Washington warned against the efforts in his own day \nto banish religion from the public square. In his farewell address of \nSeptember 29, 1796, President Washington remarked:\n\n       Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \n     prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports. \n     In vain would that man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who \n     should labor to subvert these great Pillars of human \n     happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and \n     citizens.\n\n  We should pay heed to the words of our first president and disavow \nany effort to banish Senator Ashcroft, or any other public servant, \nfrom public life because of his or her religious beliefs.\n  The founders were well aware of the dangers inherent in applying \nreligious tests to the holding of public office. That is why they \nincluded a specific prohibition to any such practice in Article six of \nthe Constitution where they said ``no religious Test shall ever be \nrequired as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the \nUnited States''. Rather than ask that Senators apply an explicit test \nsuch as that prohibited in Article six, the far-left special interest \ngroups that oppose Senator Ashcroft's nomination have turned instead to \nrumor and innuendo to imply that anyone who has strong religious \nbeliefs such as those held by Senator Ashcroft is incapable of \nenforcing federal laws with which he might not be in total agreement.\n  Nor surprisingly, these groups have not brought forth any specific \nexamples where Senator Ashcroft failed to enforce the laws when he \nserved as attorney general or governor of the State of Missouri. \nInstead, all the evidence seems to point to the contrary. Not only did \nthe people of Missouri continue to elect John Ashcroft to positions of \npublic trust, but his fellow State attorneys general and his fellow \ngovernors elected him in turn president of their respective \norganizations. Keep in mind that these organizations are bi-partisan \nand represent members from a wide spectrum of political and \nphilosophical views. The fact that the State attorneys general and the \nState governors would choose John Ashcroft to head their organizations \nis evidence of the trust and respect that his colleagues had for his \nintegrity, his ability, and his willingness to fairly and faithfully \nenforce the laws as he found them. This record stands in stark contrast \nto the revisionist history that has been spread in the media by groups \nopposed to Senator Ashcroft's nomination.\n  I have known Senator Ashcroft both as a colleague and a friend. He is \na thoughtful and honorable public servant who has served the people of \nMissouri and the United States with distinction for nearly thirty \nyears. He is dedicated to consistently and fairly upholding and \nenforcing the Constitution and laws of the United States. I have every \nconfidence that Senator Ashcroft will bring dignity and integrity to \nthe office of the Attorney General as he has to the numerous positions \nof public trust he has filled in the past. I urge my colleagues to join \nmy voting to confirm Senator Ashcroft as Attorney General.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, if there is one thing I have learned \nabout working in Washington is that we must learn to respect and \nrecognize our differences. I certainly expect a new President to select \nCabinet nominees who share his basic beliefs and ideology. I have thus \nfar voted to confirm every nominee that President Bush has submitted to \nthe Senate since he took office--even those who hold positions on \nimportant issues that are different from my own. In fact, it is fair to \nsay that I have been generally pleased with the talented and dedicated \npublic servants President Bush has chosen to lead this Administration.\n  While the President retains the Constitutional authority to appoint \nhis Cabinet, I also take very seriously my Constitutional \nresponsibility as a Senator to provide advice and consent on his \nappointments. Our role in the confirmation process isn't to afix a \nrubber stamp on presumptive nominees, especially for a position as \nimportant as this. Unlike other Cabinet posts, Mr. President, the \nAttorney General is responsible for representing and defending the \nrights and constitutional freedoms of every American. I believe this \nposition requires someone who understands and appreciates that not \nevery American is born with equal access to the opportunities and \nblessings that make our nation great.\n  In my opinion, to fulfill the duties with which the Attorney General \nis entrusted, the nominee must be pro-active in his pursuit against \ndiscrimination and injustice as the law demands. Successfully defending \nthe rights of every citizen ultimately depends upon the wide discretion \nan Attorney General exercises to initiate investigations, establish \nTask Forces and prosecute wrongdoers.\n  After reading Senator Ashcroft's response to the questions I \nsubmitted together with his testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I am reasonably confident he is prepared to react to crime \nand injustice when it occurs. I am not convinced, however, that he is \nprepared to do any more when called upon to enforce a law with which he \npassionately disagrees. His convictions are deeply held and he has \nfought stubbornly for them in the past. I truly doubt that he can set \nthem aside so easily now.\n  I must tell you that I am deeply moved by the constitutional role I \nam called upon to perform today. Passing judgement on a former \ncolleague is extremely difficult and not a part of our normal \nresponsibilities. I respect Senator Ashcroft as a former colleague and \nsomeone I know to be deeply committed to his religious teachings and \nthe causes he champions. Also, I would like to add that I would gladly \nsupport his confirmation to any other Cabinet post.\n  In the end, though, I have concluded it is his deeply held beliefs \nover issues that fall directly under the jurisdiction of the Justice \nDepartment that will impede his ability to do this job--to enforce the \nlaw without bias or favor toward anyone; to vigorously fight \ndiscrimination and its painful legacy and to defend the constitutional \nrights he has fought so zealously to overturn in the past. Ironically, \nhis passionate advocacy that inspires respect in me and others is what, \nin my opinion, makes Senator Ashcroft the wrong man for this job.\n  For the benefit of my constituents who hold passionate views on both \nsides of this issue and for my colleagues listening today, I would like \nto take a few moments to highlight some of the factors I considered \nwhen making my decision.\n  I must confess, Mr. President, when I reviewed the history of Senator \nAshcroft's involvement in an effort to desegregate public schools in \nSt. Louis, I was surprised and troubled by what I read. According to \ntestimony presented at his confirmation hearing, Senator Ashcroft, in \nhis capacity as Attorney General of Missouri, engaged in an \nextraordinary legal campaign that spanned several years to block \nimplementation of a voluntary school integration plan in St. Louis. \nDuring the course of this litigation, Senator Ashcroft initiated \nnumerous challenges and appeals that were firmly and repeatedly \nrejected by the courts. Instead of accepting the decisions rendered, he \npursued a course of action that drew judicial criticism and, in one \ninstance, a threat of contempt for failure to comply with a court \norder.\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\n  I believe it is one thing to vigorously assert your legal rights in a \ncourt of law. Its something else, however, for a state's top law \nenforcement official to display such a cavalier attitude toward the \njudicial branch of government. I know the issue of racial integration \nin public education can ignite powerful emotions. I was a young \nelementary school student when Helena public schools in Arkansas were \nintegrated. This was not an easy transition at the time and it \ncertainly left a powerful and positive impression on me that I shall \nnever forget. So I know that honest people can disagree passionately \nabout this issue and I don't question the personal views Senator \nAshcroft may have on this matter generally. I do, however, question the \njudgement he exercised as a public official in this case.\n  As a Senator from a state that experiences difficulty in recruiting \nphysicians and other qualified medical professionals to work in rural \ncommunities, I was also concerned by actions Senator Ashcroft took as \nAttorney General to restrict access to medical care in under served \ncommunities. According to the record, Senator Ashcroft issued an \nopinion as Attorney General of Missouri and later intervened in a court \ncase to prohibit qualified nurses with advanced training from providing \nnecessary and routine gynecological services to underprivileged female \npatients at clinics in Missouri. The medical services at issue included \nconducting breast and pelvic examinations, performing PAP smears and \nproviding information about effective contraceptive practices. \nFurthermore, the health clinics involved were located in counties in \nwhich there was not a single physician who would accept Medicaid \neligible patients for pre-natal care or childbirth.\n  Senator Ashcroft put the weight of his office behind an effort to \ndeclare the gynecological services at issue in this case outside the \nscope of practice for professional nurses in Missouri. Thankfully, for \nthe female patients who depend on qualified medical professionals who \naren't physicians to deliver necessary care, that claim was rejected in \na unanimous ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  I am concerned about access to care because, after growing up in East \nArkansas, I am well aware of the obstacles women face in obtaining the \nspecialized medical care they need. While I respect the right of each \nstate to establish their own standards of medical practice, I think \nthat by going to court against the nurses of his state, Senator \nAshcroft displayed a relevant degree of insensitivity on a critical \nissue to the persons most affected in this case.\n  I must tell you I'm still deeply disappointed by the way this body \ntreated Judge Ronnie White. In my opinion, Judge White is a decent, \nhonorable man who deserved much better. Even though I believe Senator \nAshcroft is sincere in his belief that Judge White should not sit on \nthe federal bench, I seriously question the manner in which he acted to \ndefeat his nomination. Now that we have all had time to review a more \ncomplete and balanced report of Judge White's record, I am confident \nthe Senate would not make the same mistake again. In fact, Senator \nAshcroft has received the same kind of deference and fair treatment \nthat I wish he had shown Judge White.\n  I was taught at an early age that public service is a high calling \nand a noble profession. In accordance with that belief, it is essential \nthat we in the Senate discharge our responsibility to consider \nnominations in a manner that encourages the most talented and qualified \nindividuals to seek employment in the public sector. I am confident \nthat the Senate fell short of that standard in this case.\n  Taken together--the battle waged over desegregation in St. Louis, the \nattempts to stop nurses from providing basic medical services to \nunderserved patients and the decision to defeat the nomination of a \nqualified nominee who deserved better--these instances and other facts \nin the record lead me to conclude that Senator Ashcroft will further \ndivide our country on these sensitive issues.\n  I encourage the President to consider another nominee who will help \nhim heal these wounds, not open them anew. In the alternative, I hope \nour new President will work to heal the wounds inflicted by this \nnomination on the Senate, the Presidency and our nation so that we can \nmove forward to address the problems of all Americans in a bipartisan \nway.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of \nJohn Ashcroft to be the U.S. Attorney General.\n  Senator Ashcroft has superb legal qualifications. He was educated at \nYale and the prestigious University of Chicago law school. While in the \nU.S. Senate, he served on the Judiciary Committee and chaired its \nSubcommittee on the Constitution.\n  Senator Ashcroft is also the most experienced nominee for U.S. \nAttorney General in American history. He served as Missouri's attorney \ngeneral, its governor, and, of course, one of its U.S. Senators. Since \nthe founding of the nation, none of the previous 66 Attorneys General \nhad his level of experience.\n  Opponents have offered a number of reasons for their opposition. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to respond.\n  First, what should the standard for confirmation be? The general rule \nfor confirmation of Justice Department nominees was well-stated by \nSenator Leahy in connection with President Clinton's nomination of \nWalter Dellinger to be head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the \nDepartment of Justice:\n\n       The Senate has a responsibility to advise and consent on \n     Department of Justice and other executive branch nominations. \n     And we must always take our advice and consent \n     responsibilities seriously because they are among the most \n     sacred. But I think most Senators will agree that the \n     standard we apply in the case of executive branch \n     appointments is not as stringent as that for judicial \n     nominees. The President should get to pick his own team. \n     Unless the nominee is incompetent or some other major ethical \n     or investigative problem arises in the course of our carrying \n     out our duties, then the President gets the benefit of the \n     doubt. There is no doubt about this nominee's qualifications \n     or integrity. This is not a lifetime appointment to the \n     judicial branch of government. President Clinton should be \n     given latitude in naming executive branch appointees, people \n     to whom he will turn for advice. I should also note that his \n     nomination went through the Judiciary Committee--by no means \n     a rubberstamp--unanimously.\n       The recent debate over Walter Dellinger is another instance \n     of people putting politics over substance. Yes, he has \n     advised and spoken out about high-profile constitutional \n     issues of the day. I would hope that an accomplished legal \n     scholar would not shrink away from public positions on \n     controversial issues, as it appears his opponents would \n     prefer. One can question Professor Dellinger's positions and \n     beliefs, but not his competence and legal abilities.\n\n  This is the standard that is traditionally applied and it is the \nproper standard. While acknowledging that presidents are ordinarily \nentitled to deference in the selections for their cabinet, in the \nnomination of John Ashcroft critics argue that they are justified in \napplying a tougher standard for confirmation because of the standard \nthat Senator Ashcroft allegedly used in evaluating Bill Lann Lee to \nhead the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. In \nconsidering Bill Lann Lee, Senator Ashcroft had said that Lee was ``an \nadvocate who is willing to pursue an objective and to carry it with the \nkind of intensity that belongs to advocacy, but not with the kind of \nbalance that belongs to administration . . .  his pursuit of specific \nobjectives that are important to him limit his capacity to have the \nbalanced view of making the judgments that will be necessary for the \nperson who runs [the Civil Rights] Division.''\n  Some Democrats say that because John Ashcroft applied this \n``standard'' to Bill Lann Lee, they are justified in applying the same \nstandard to John Ashcroft. First, this is not a standard, but a \nconclusion about Lee based upon his record and testimony. Second, what \nSenator Ashcroft did on the Lee nomination was justified. Senator \nAshcroft's concerns with Bill Lann Lee were based on Lee's long record \nof activism as a public interest lawyer. Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee opposed Lee's nomination because they were justly concerned \nabout his willingness to enforce the law as stated in Justice \nO'Connor's opinion for the Supreme Court in Adarand. In Adarand, the \nSupreme Court held that all governmental racial classifications were \nsubject to strict scrutiny--that is, they must be narrowly tailored to \nserve a compelling government interest. Mr. Lee repeatedly stated the \nstandard for\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\nracial preferences in less strict terms. He also found that only one of \nthe 150 current federal programs involving racial classifications would \nbe invalid under Adarand.\n  Senator Ashcroft explained why he opposed Bill Lann Lee's \nnomination--he was concerned that Mr. Lee would not enforce the law. \nSenator Ashcroft testified: ``I joined with eight other Republicans on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in opposing Bill Lee's nomination to be \nassistant attorney general because I had serious concerns about his \nwillingness to enforce the Adarand decision . . . [Mr. Lee] was an \nexcellent litigant, but I had concerns that he viewed the Adarand \ndecision as an obstacle rather than as a way in which the law was \ndefined. Adarand held that government programs that establish racial \npreferences based on race are subject to strict scrutiny, that is the \nhighest level of scrutiny under the Supreme Court's equal protection \nclause. Adarand was a landmark decision, it was substantial, it was \nimportant. Mr. Lee did not indicate a clear willingness to enforce the \nlaw based on that decision.''\n  Senator Ashcroft's concerns about Bill Lann Lee proved to be well-\nfounded. For example, in 1998, a federal judge, a Carter-appointee, \nassessed an unprecedented $1.8 million attorney fee award against the \nCivil Rights Division for a lawsuit against the City of Torrance, \nCalifornia. The judge found the suit ``frivolous, unreasonable and \nwithout foundation.'' The Division then turned around and filed a \nsimilar suit in Texas defending the constitutionality of contracting \npreferences on the basis of race and sex. Mr. Lee also continued to \nunlawfully coerce state and local governments to adopt race and sex \npreferences by threatening costly lawsuits based on dubious employment \nstatistics.\n  Moreover, under Mr. Lee, the Civil Rights Division continued the \nlegal challenge to Proposition 209, a measure that prohibited \ngovernment discrimination of Californians on the basis of race, gender, \nor national origin. These suits continued despite the fact that \nProposition 209 has repeatedly been upheld by federal courts.\n  It is also important to note that Bill Lann Lee had never held an \nexecutive position--or any position--in the government, whereas Senator \nAshcroft served as attorney general of Missouri for eight years and as \ngovernor for eight years. He had distinguished tenures in both offices. \nIn fact, he served as President of the National Association of \nAttorneys General and as Chairman of the National Governors Association \nand Chairman of the Education Commission of the States.\n  In sum, Senator Ashcroft had serious reasons for concern with the Lee \nnomination, and his concern was borne out. In contrast, Senator \nAshcroft has not waffled, redefined, or otherwise given reason to \nbelieve that he would not apply the law as it is. While Lee continued \nto aggressively litigate, John Ashcroft has shown no sign that he will \ncontinue to legislate. He did not do so as Missouri Attorney General, \nand he would not do so as U.S. Attorney General. In fact, John Ashcroft \nhas repeatedly stated that he will enforce the law--yet this \nreassurance has failed to satisfy his critics. It's a Catch-22. He has, \nlike every nominee, said he will uphold the law; and no one has ever \nquestioned his integrity. But when John Ashcroft pledges to uphold the \nlaw, critics say that this is a ``new'' John Ashcroft, that he has \nflipped and is not credible. What they are saying is that he cannot \nsatisfy them whatever he says. John Ashcroft knows the difference \nbetween being a legislator and being an executive. He is a man of \nintegrity. He should be taken at his word. He cannot prove a negative--\nthat he won't fail to do his job. To hold him to that standard is to \nask of him the impossible. Senators have the right to vote on any \ngrounds they like; but they should not shroud their vote in a sham \nstandard.\n  An example of setting up an impossible standard is the view by some \nthat, because Senator Ashcroft opposes abortion he cannot by definition \nenforce laws such as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances law--the \nfederal criminal statute that punishes those who commit acts of \ncriminal intimidation or violence at abortion clinics. There is no \nlogic to this position. Senator Ashcroft's opposition to abortion does \nnot mean that he supports violations of the law prohibiting violence at \nclinics. Indeed, Senator Ashcroft supports the freedom of access to \nclinic entrances law and stated in his written answers that he ``will \nfully enforce FACE.'' This reinforces the view that he has previously \nexpressed. For example, long before he had any idea he would ever be \nnominated for attorney general, Senator Ashcroft wrote that, regardless \nof his personal views on abortion, people should be able to enter \nabortion clinics safely: ``I believe people should be able to enter \nlegal abortion clinics safely. I oppose unlawfully barricading or \notherwise curtailing access to legal abortion clinics. I condemn \nviolence regarding this issue by individuals either in favor of or \nagainst abortion.'' Quoted from a May 15, 1996 letter to George \nSorenson of St. Clair Shores, MI.\n  Senator Ashcroft opposes criminal violence at abortion clinics and \nbelieves people who commit these acts of violence and intimidation \nshould be punished. As Attorney General he'll do just that. It is \nirrational for critics to vote against him in the belief that merely \nbecause he opposes abortion the won't enforce the freedom of access to \nclinic entrances law.\n  While he cannot prove a negative, he can point to past situations \nthat belie the assertion that he won't properly apply the law. As \nMissouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft did not let his personal \nopinion on abortion cloud his legal analysis. For example, in Attorney \nGeneral Opinion No. 5, issued on October 22, 1982, 1981 WL 154492, Mo. \nA.G., John Ashcroft opined that the Missouri Division of Health should \nnot release to the public information from reports it maintains on the \nnumber of abortions performed by particular hospitals. He stated that \nthe legislature made clear its intent that such reports ``shall be \nconfidential and shall be used only for statistical purposes'' and even \nmade failure to maintain confidentiality a misdemeanor. John Ashcroft \nopined that, for these reasons, and to protect the patient-physician \nprivilege as recognized by Missouri law, access to the health data \nmaintained by the Division was subject to review only by local, state \nor national public health officers.\n  Additionally, in Attorney General Opinion No. 127, issued on \nSeptember 23, 1980, 1980 WL 115450 Mo. A.G., John Ashcroft was asked to \nopine on whether a death certificate was required for all abortions, \nregardless of the age of the fetus. Despite his personal view that life \nbegins at conception, he stated that Missouri statutes did not require \nany type of certificate if the fetus was 20 weeks or less. After 20 \nweeks Missouri statutes specifically require a ``certificate of \nstillbirth'' regardless of whether death was by natural causes such as \na miscarriage or an intentional act such as an abortion.\n  It is also worth noting that Senator Ashcroft voted for Senator \nSchumer's amendment to the bankruptcy bill that made debts incurred as \na result of abortion clinic violence non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  Finally, it is important to note that Senator Ashcroft has a strong \nrecord on women's issues, contrary to what some have charged. As \ngovernor, he signed a rape shield law that made inadmissible evidence \nof the victim's past sexual conduct. He also signed a law recognizing \nbattered woman's syndrome as a defense in criminal cases. As Missouri \nattorney general, he took a broad view on allowing domestic violence \nfunds to be used by non-profits to establish a network of ``safe \nhomes.'' As Senator, John Ashcroft co-sponsored the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Third, opponents express concern that Senator Ashcroft does not favor \nstricter gun control and previously opposed some measures that are now \nlaw. As a result, they conclude he will not enforce the gun control \nlaws. Some people may be so pinched in their opinions that they could \nnot distinguish between these two circumstances. Not John Ashcroft.\n  As a former state attorney general and president of the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, Senator Ashcroft knows how important \nit is to enforce gun laws vigorously. Unfortunately, the Clinton \nJustice Department has failed to make gun prosecutions a priority. \nBetween 1992 and 1998, prosecutions of criminals who use a gun to \ncommit a felony dropped nearly 50 percent from 7,045 to 3,765. Senator\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\nAshcroft was one of the leaders in the Senate in directing the Justice \nDepartment to increase the prosecution of gun crimes. He sponsored \nlegislation to authorize $50 million to hire additional federal \nprosecutors and law enforcement officers to increase the federal \nprosecution of criminals who use guns. Additionally, Senator Ashcroft \nsponsored legislation to require a five-year mandatory minimum prison \nsentence for federal gun crimes and for legislation to encourage \nschools to expel students who bring guns to school.\n  Moreover, in the Senate, John Ashcroft had a strong record in \nfighting gun crimes. Last Congress, for example, Senator Ashcroft \nauthored legislation to prohibit juveniles from possessing assault \nweapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. The Senate overwhelmingly \npassed the Ashcroft legislation in May 1999.\n  Senator Ashcroft voted for legislation that prohibits any person \nconvicted of even misdemeanor acts of domestic violence from possessing \na firearm, for legislation to extend the Brady Act to prohibit persons \nwho commit violent crimes as juveniles from possessing firearms, for \nthe ``Gun-Free Schools Zone Act'' that prohibits the possession of a \nfirearm in a school zone, and for legislation to require gun dealers to \noffer child safety locks and other gun safety devices for sale. Senator \nAshcroft also voted for legislation to close the so-called ``gun show \nloophole.'' This bill required mandatory instant background checks for \nall firearm purchases at gun shows.\n  Senator Ashcroft will uphold the nation's laws on firearms.\n  Fourth, critics question Senator Ashcroft's record or civil rights. \nThey often begin by raising the issue of desegregation litigation in \nMissouri. Senator Ashcroft did defend the state of Missouri as state \nattorney general in a long-running school-desegregation case. Every \nMissouri attorney general since 1980, including Jay Nixon, John \nAshcroft's Democratic successor, backed the state's (and Ashcroft's) \nposition. According to an article in National Review, the attorneys \ngeneral in Missouri,\n\n       fought the orders because they were unjust, saddling \n     innocent parties with exorbitant costs. They fought the \n     orders because they were unpopular, not only with their \n     victims, but with their beneficiaries. A leitmotif of the \n     desegregation was the persistent splintering of minority \n     groups from the ``class action'' litigants, whose one-size-\n     fits-all remedies ran roughshod over the aspirations of \n     parents for their children. . . . In Missouri, 400 other \n     public-school districts suffered cutbacks so that a handful \n     of attorneys for civil-rights groups and teachers unions \n     could run uncontrolled clinical trials on a generation of \n     urban school kids, Indeed, non-urban school officials were \n     among the most persistent and vociferous foes of the \n     desegregation orders.\n\n  The article continues: ``Twenty years of forced bussing, which \nAshcroft opposed, left the Kansas City school district slightly less \nintegrated than it was before. Twenty years of forced bussing, plus $3 \nbillion, left Kansas City and St. Louis with schools that consistently \nrate among the poorest in the nation in reading and math skills.'' To \noppose a particular court order is not, as some critics have said, to \n``relentlessly oppose school desegregation.'' That characterization is \nunfair, even slanderous.\n  Another point that critics often raise is the fact that Senator \nAshcroft spoke at Bob Jones University. The controversy over the Bob \nJones University speech has been put to rest. At his confirmation \nhearings, Senator Ashcroft made it clear that he ``reject[s] any racial \nintolerance or religious intolerance that has been associated with[,] \nor is associated with[,]'' Bob Jones University. Senator Ashcroft \nexplained that ``[he] want[s] to make it very clear that [he] reject[s] \nracial and religious intolerance.'' He said he does not endorse any \nbigoted views by virtue of ``having made an appearance in any faith or \nany congregation.'' He said, for example, that he has visited churches \nwhich do not ``allow women in certain roles,'' and that he does not \nendorse that view, either.\n  In the matter of the role faith plays in our public life, there \nappears to be a double standard. Senator Lieberman made numerous \nspeeches connecting God to American government when he was running for \nVice President last year. In fact, during a campaign speech in a church \nin Detroit, he said he hoped his candidacy ``will enable all people . . \n. to talk about their faith and about their religion, and I hope it \nwill reinforce a belief that I feel as strongly as anything else--that \nthere must be a place for faith in American public life.'' [Newsweek 9/\n11/00] I share in that hope. Sadly, critics of John Ashcroft, who \nalmost universally supported Senator Lieberman, apply a different \nstandard on this issue to John Ashcroft.\n  During his career, Senator Ashcroft has compiled an outstanding \nrecord of protecting the rights of all people. As governor, Fortune \nnamed him one of the top 10 education governors in the nation. John \nAshcroft was an inclusive governor, signing into law Missouri's first \nhate-crimes statute and state holiday that recognizes Dr. Martin Luther \nKing's birthday. He nominated the first woman to the Missouri Supreme \nCourt.\n  John Ashcroft's work on behalf of minorities earned him a \ncommendation from the Mound City Association, an African-American Bar \nAssociation of St. Louis, and a campaign endorsement from the Limelight \nNewspaper, the largest African-American newspaper in St. Louis.\n  In the U.S. Senate, John Ashcroft convened the first and only Senate \nhearing on racial profiling. He secured more funding to combat violence \nagainst women, voted to prohibit those who have been convicted of \ndomestic violence from owning a gun, and supported the crime victims' \nrights amendment and Violence Against Women Act.\n  John Ashcroft has been deeply committed to promoting equal access to \ngovernment positions during his tenure as both Attorney General and \nGovernor of Missouri. Witnesses testifying at the hearing made this \ncommitment clear.\n  Mr. Jerry Hunter, former labor secretary of Missouri, testified that, \n``Like President-elect George W. Bush, Senator Ashcroft followed a \npolicy of affirmative access and inclusiveness during his service to \nthe state of Missouri as attorney general, his two terms as governor, \nand his one term in the United States Senate. During the eight years \nthat Senator Ashcroft was attorney general for the state of Missouri, \nhe recruited and hired minority lawyers. During his tenure as governor, \nhe appointed blacks to numerous boards and commissions . . . [B]ut I \nwould say to you on a personal note, Senator Ashcroft went out of his \nway to find African-Americans to consider for appointments.''\n  Mr. Hunter further elaborated that,\n\n       When Governor Ashcroft's term ended in January of 1993, he \n     had appointed more African-Americans to state court \n     judgeships than any previous governor in the history of the \n     state of Missouri. Governor Ashcroft was also bipartisan in \n     his appointment of state court judges. He appointed \n     Republicans, Democrats and independents. One of Governor \n     Ashcroft's black appointees in St. Louis was appointed, \n     notwithstanding the fact that he was not a Republican and \n     that he was on a panel with a well-known white Republican. Of \n     the nine panels of nominees for state court judgeships, which \n     included at least one African-American, Governor Ashcroft \n     appointed eight black judges from those panels.\n\n  Congressman J.C. Watts testified:\n\n       I've worked with [John Ashcroft] on legislation concerning \n     poor communities, under-served communities. I have always \n     found John Ashcroft to have nothing but the utmost respect \n     and dignity for one's skin color. I heard John say yesterday \n     in some of his testimony that his faith requires him to \n     respect one's skin color. And I think that's the way it \n     should be . . . [I]n my dealings with John, I have had \n     nothing but the utmost respect for him when it comes to his \n     dealings with people of different skin color.\n\n  Judge David Mason, who worked with Ashcroft in the Missouri Attorney \nGeneral's office stated,\n\n       As time went on, I begin to get a real feel for this man \n     and where his heart is. When the subject of Martin Luther \n     King Day came up, I was there. And I recall that he issued \n     the executive order to establish the first King Day, rather \n     than wait for the legislature to do it. Because, as you may \n     recall, some of you, when Congress passed the holiday, they \n     passed it at a time when the Missouri legislature may not \n     have been able to have the first holiday contemporaneously \n     with it. So he passed a King holiday by executive order. He \n     said, in doing so, he wanted his children to grow up in a \n     state that observed someone like Martin Luther King.\n\n  Bob Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise uses \nfaith-based organizations to help troubled young people turn their \nlives around. Mr. Woodson testified:\n\n       Senator John Ashcroft is the only person who, from the time \n     he came into this body, reached out to us. He's on the board \n     of Teen\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\n     Challenge. He's raised money for them. He sponsored a \n     charitable choice legislation that will stop the government \n     from trying to close them down because they don't have \n     trained professionals as drug counselors. We have an 80 \n     percent success rate of these faith-based organizations with \n     a $60-a-day cost, when the conventional, therapeutically \n     secular program cost $600 a day with a 6 to 10 percent \n     success rate. Senator Ashcroft has gone with us. He has \n     fought with us. And this legislation would help us. As a \n     consequence, day before yesterday, 150 black and Hispanic \n     transformed drug addicts got on buses from all over this \n     nation and came here to support him. Fifty of them came from \n     Victory Temple throughout the state of Texas, spent two days \n     on a Greyhound bus at their own expense to come here to voice \n     strong support for Senator Ashcroft.\n\n  Kay James of the Heritage Foundation testified:\n\n       The system our founders designed, of course, is famous for \n     its many checks and balances from which no public official is \n     immune. Nevertheless, the charge is still made that these are \n     insufficient to deal with a man of religious conviction. As \n     such, a person cannot be trusted to faithfully execute the \n     laws, especially those which may conflict with his deeply \n     held belief. I reject such religious profiling. On this \n     matter, let me attempt to reassure John Ashcroft's \n     opponents by enlisting the very thing they profess to fear \n     most: his religious faith.\n\n  Fifth, opponents claim that Senator Ashcroft has a poor record on the \nnominations of President Clinton's nominations to the federal bench. \nThis somehow justifies voting against Ashcroft under a standard of \n``what's good for the goose is good for the gander.''\n  Apart from the intellectual contradiction in such a position, Senator \nAshcroft's record contradicts this assertion. He supported 218 out of \n230 Clinton judicial nominees, or, put another way, Senator Ashcroft \nsupported more than 94 percent of President Clinton's nominees, many of \nwhom were women and minorities. This is hardly a record of obstruction. \nIndeed, Senator Ashcroft supported 26 of the 27 African-American judges \nnominated by President Clinton and considered by the Senate. All other \nRepublican senators also opposed the only one Ashcroft opposed.\n  That nominee was Ronnie White--nominated to the federal district \ncourt bench. Senator Ashcroft, along with the majority of the U.S. \nSenate, had grave concerns about White's record in Missouri death-\npenalty cases. White wasn't just the state's leading dissenter in \ndeath-penalty cases, he even went so far as to try (unsuccessfully) to \noverturn the conviction of a man who confessed to brutally murdering \nfour people. White was the only dissenter in that case, which caused \nhis nomination to be opposed by numerous law-enforcement groups and \nofficers, including the National Sheriff's Association, the Missouri \nFederation of Police Chiefs, the Mercer County Prosecuting Attorney's \noffice, and numerous individual Missouri sheriffs and police \ndepartments.\n  Senator Ashcroft took very seriously his duty to evaluate Judge \nWhite's record. He reluctantly concluded White had a propensity to work \nagainst the imposition of the death penalty even when called for by \nlaw. As Senator Ashcroft testified,\n\n       Judges at the federal level are appointed for life. They \n     frequently have power that literally would allow them to \n     overrule the entire Supreme Court of the state of Missouri. \n     If a person has been convicted in the state of Missouri, but \n     on habeas corpus files a petition with a U.S. district court, \n     it's within the power of that single U.S. district court \n     judge to set aside the judgment of the entire Supreme Court \n     of the State of Missouri. So that my seriousness with which I \n     addressed these issues is substantial. I did characterize \n     Judge White's record as being pro-criminal. I did not \n     derogate his background.\n\n  Judge White argued in dissent in the Johnson case, where the \ndefendant was convicted of killing three law enforcement officers and \nthe wife of a sheriff, that the defendant received ineffective \nassistance of counsel. Congressman Hulshof, the prosecutor in that \ncase, rebutted that argument quite effectively. Congressman Hulshof \ntestified, ``The points I'd like to raise briefly about the quality of \nJames Johnson's representation is this: He hired counsel of his own \nchoosing. He picked from our area in mid-Missouri what we've referred \nto as--as I referred to as a dream team.'' And the court later ruled \nthat the counsel was effective.\n\n  Sheriff Kenny Jones, whose wife and colleagues were killed by \nJohnson, testified,\n\n       Be assured that Senator Ashcroft had no other reason that I \n     know about to oppose Judge White except that I asked him to. \n     I opposed Judge White's nomination to the federal bench, and \n     I asked Senator Ashcroft to join me because of Judge White's \n     opinion on a death penalty case . . . . In his opinion, Judge \n     White urged that Johnson be given a second chance at freedom. \n     I cannot understand his reasoning. I know that the four \n     people Johnson killed were not given a second chance.\n\n  Some Democrats claim that Ronnie White was treated shabbily. They say \nthe treatment was shabby because it was embarrassing for White to be \nsuffer defeat on the Senate floor and because of alleged misstatements \nby Senator Ashcroft about White's record. In response to the first \npoint, it must be said that throughout the last Congress, Democrats \nconstantly stressed that they wanted their nominees brought to the \nfloor for a vote. In fact, on June 29, 1999, more than three months \nbefore the nomination came to the floor, Senator Leahy took to the \nfloor to say that Ronnie White ``should be allowed a vote, up or \ndown.'' He continued: ``Senators can stand up and say they will vote \nfor or against him, but let this man have a vote.'' Well, this is what \ncan happen when a nominee is brought to the floor--the nomination can \nbe defeated. If Democrats are concerned that a nominee will be \nembarrassed if the nominee loses, then Democrats must be careful when \nthey clamor for a vote. I personally expressed to Judge White my regret \nthat his nomination was considered by the full Senate in a way that \nended in defeat.\n  A second point: when Democrats complain that there were misstatements \nabout Ronnie White's record, why didn't they correct the record? Every \nsenator, of course, has the right to set the record straight if there \nis an error. Further, on this matter there have been misstatements not \nby Senator Ashcroft but about Senator Ashcroft's floor statement. I \nwant to make one point very clear: Senator Ashcroft did not accuse \nRonnie White of being pro-criminal, rather he said that ``Judge White's \nopinions have been, and, if confirmed, his opinions on the Federal \nbench will continue to be pro-criminal and activist, with a slant \ntoward criminals and defendants against prosecutors and the culture in \nterms of maintaining order . . .'' This statement is in no way a smear \nof Ronnie White. It is a reasonable conclusion after reviewing Ronnie \nWhite's dissents in a number of cases, most notably the Johnson case in \nwhich, as the lone dissenter, Ronnie White would have let a confessed \nmurderer go free for three reasons. First, Judge White's dissent \nconcluded that, as noted above, the defendant had ineffective \nassistance of counsel--yet the case was so overwhelming that Clarence \nDarrow could not have saved the defendant. Second, White's dissent \ndisplayed a pro-criminal bent in stating that the defendant's \n``previously law-abiding life'' could warrant reducing the sentence of \nthis quadruple murderer to life imprisonment. Third, White's dissent \ndemonstrated a willingness to disregard the law, specifically, as the \ndefinition of legal insanity. White wrote: ``While Mr. Johnson may not, \nas the jury found, have met the legal definition of insanity, whatever \ndrove Mr. Johnson to go from being a law-abiding citizen to being a \nmultiple killer was certainly something akin to madness.'' A judge must \nenforce the law, not make new law by the seat of his pants.\n\n  As I stated above--and it merits repeating because Senator Ashcroft's \ncritics have distorted his record--Senator Ashcroft supported 218 out \nof 230 Clinton judicial nominees. Put another way, Senator Ashcroft \nsupported more than 94 percent of President Clinton's nominees, many of \nwhom were women and minorities. Indeed, Senator Ashcroft supported 26 \nof the 27 African-American judges nominated by President Clinton and \nconsidered by the Senate. This is hardly a record of obstruction.\n  Like many people who watched the recent confirmation hearings of John \nAshcroft for U.S. Attorney General, I too failed to recognize the man \nas characterized by his opponents. I've known John Ashcroft for six \nyears in the Senate.\n  As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, Senator John Ashcroft is \na man who knows the law. He was educated at Yale and the prestigious \nUniversity of Chicago law school. While in the U.S.\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\nSenate, he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and chaired its \nSubcommittee on the Constitution. Furthermore, Senator Ashcroft is the \nmost experienced candidate for U.S. Attorney General in American \nhistory. He served as Missouri's attorney general, its governor, and \none of its U.S. senators.\n  During his career, Senator Ashcroft has compiled an outstanding \nrecord of protecting the rights of all people. He will continue to do \nso as the United States Attorney General. I strongly support his \nnomination and encourage all my colleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have always believed that Presidents \nare entitled to a degree of deference in their cabinet nominees. And \nso, while this made it difficult I have nonetheless informed the \nadministration that I cannot support Senator John Ashcroft's nomination \nto be attorney general.\n  Senator Ashcroft has been a dedicated public servant and I say that \neven though we have not found common ground on the issues. The range of \nissues we have disagreed on has been broad and they have centered on \nsome of the most important laws of our land. No person should be forced \nto choose between their fundamental beliefs and values and enforcing \nour Nation's laws. For those who cherish civil rights laws, the freedom \nof choice and handgun control the stakes are simply too high to expect \na cabinet secretary to choose between passionately held beliefs and \nenforcing not only the letter but the spirit of the law.\n  I also have specific concerns about New Jersey. It is not enough just \nto be opposed to racial profiling. The scars this issue has left on my \nstate are too deep and require the strongest possible commitment if we \nare ever to heal. Further, it will take a concerted effort to enforce a \nrange of civil rights laws from hate crimes to tolerance. It requires \nthe will of the Attorney General, the full force of that office.\n  I said some very positive things about John Ashcroft at the time he \nwas nominated. I continue to hope that it is possible to disagree and \nto disagree strongly without demonizing. I also hope he will always \nreflect on the concerns raised during the confirmation process.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to voice my \nsupport for the nomination of John Ashcroft, of Missouri, to be U.S. \nAttorney General.\n  I think it is important to focus on the standard for a Cabinet \nnomination, which is fundamentally different from a judicial \nappointment, which is a lifetime appointment, and focus on the latitude \nwhich is customarily accorded the President of the United States in \nmaking a selection on a Cabinet nominee.\n  I do support former Senator Ashcroft for attorney general. And I do \nso, in substantial measure, because of the record he has compiled as an \nelected official in Missouri and because of my personal knowledge of \nhim. He was twice elected attorney general of Missouri, he was twice \nelected governor of Missouri, he was elected Senator of Missouri. And \nMissouri is a moderate state, I think very much like my own state, \nPennsylvania: two big cities, a lot of farmland. The characteristics of \nthe electorate in Missouri, who have elected him five times to major \noffices, I think, speaks well of Senator Ashcroft in rejecting the \nnotion that he is an extremist.\n  The John Ashcroft whom I have known for six years in the United \nStates Senate is not an extremist. He sat a couple of seats down from \nme on the Judiciary Committee. Although we did not agree on many items, \nI always felt he was exercising his honest judgement.\n  He was a candidate for President, and it may be that in the course of \nthat candidacy, expressed some views, as candidates sometimes do, which \ntry to appeal to a constituency. But from what I have seen, on this \ncommittee and in the Senate, he is not an extremist.\n  He and I had a very sharp disagreement on a judicial nominee, \nPhiladelphia Common Please Judge Massiah-Jackson. And she was, in \neffect, rejected by the committee, and withdrew her nomination. She was \nchallenged as being soft on crime because of her record on sentences. \nAt the end of a very long, difficult and contentious proceeding, \nincluding a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, as I say, she did \nwithdraw. But at the end of the process, it was my view that John \nAshcroft had expressed his own judgement about it which differed from \nmine. I bring in the Judge Massiah-Jackson case because of some \nsimilarities which it has to the case involving Missouri Supreme Court \nJustice White.\n  I said in the hearing that I thought that we did not accord Judge \nWhite the kind of consideration that should have been accorded, because \nour practices are to rely principally on staff, the ABA recommendation, \nthe FBI investigation, without individual Senators paying as much \nattention to the district court nominees as we might. I intend on \nproposing a rule change that in the event someone is going to speak \nadversely about a nominee, that there be an opportunity for the nominee \nto respond, and the committee should focus specifically on any charges \nwhich are brought.\n  But I do think that, at the conclusion, Senator Ashcroft expressed \nhis own honest views. I think it is important to note that when Judge \nWhite appeared before the committee, he did not ask that Senator \nAshcroft be rejected, he raised the question as to whether Senator \nAshcroft had the qualities to be an attorney general and left it up to \nthe committee to decide.\n  Senator Ashcroft made a number of important commitments to the \ncommittee. We questioned him at great length on the difference between \na legislator and a member of the executive branch who enforces the law. \nHe said categorically that he would not choose to change Roe v. Wade \nbut would be bound to enforce the law as it stood. He spoke \nemphatically about his commitment to enforce access to abortion \nclinics. And it was worth noting that, while in the Senate, on a vote \non whether someone who had a judgment against them for damaging an \nabortion clinic and there was one case where there was an enormous \njudgment in excess of $100 million that the individuals' debt ought not \nto be dischargeable in bankruptcy, which I think is an indication as to \nhis sentiments on that important subject.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft also made very firm commitments on recognizing the \ndistinction between church and state and committed that, to the extent \nhe was involved, there would be no litmus test on the selection of \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  There were challenges made to what Senator Ashcroft had done as \nattorney general on the segregation cases. Former Senator Danforth \nappeared during the nomination hearing and spoke about his evaluation \nof John Ashcroft being a vigorous advocate.\n  There was a question raised as to whether as state attorney general \nof Missouri Senator Ashcroft used the litigation process \ninappropriately. He was not held in contempt. He was not sanctioned \nunder the federal rules, which he could have been. So on the basis of \nthat issue and the other objections which have been raised, it seems to \nme that this is a nomination and a nominee where we ought to accord the \ntraditional latitude to the President of the United States. I intend to \nvote for Senator Ashcroft's nomination to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to respond to a letter my \ncolleague Senator Sessions inserted into the Record last evening from \nthe editor of Southern Partisan magazine. In that letter, the editor \nclaims that his magazine did not sell a t-shirt celebrating the \nassassination of President Abraham Lincoln. In my floor remarks \nyesterday, I stated that the magazine did in fact sell this offensive \nshirt, and showed my colleagues a reproduction of the actual shirt.\n  In particular, the editor stated that this ``tasteless item has never \nbeen advertised or sold on the pages of our magazine.'' The editor goes \non to say that a part-time staff member complied a catalog of southern \nitems, including the offensive Lincoln t-shirt, and that the brochure \nadvertising those items were mailed ``without careful review by our \neditors.''\n  I would like to insert into the Record a copy of a 1995 letter from \nSouthern Partisan, which is on the Southern Partisan magazine editor-\nin-chief's letterhead, which clearly indicates that the magazine did in \nfact sell this offensive shirt. This letter states\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\nin relevant part: ``Due to the surprising demand for our anti-Lincoln \nT-shirt, our stock has been reduced to odd sizes. If the enclosed shirt \nwill not suffice, we will be glad to refund your money or immediately \nship you another equally militant shirt from our catalog [emphasis \nadded].''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Southern Partisan,\n\n                                   Columbia, SC, December 3, 1995.\n\n       Dear Friend: Due to a surprising demand for our anti-\n     Lincoln T-shirt, our stock has been reduced to odd sizes. If \n     the enclosed shirt will not suffice, we will be glad to \n     refund your money or immediately ship you another equally \n     militant shirt from our catalog.\n           Thank you,\n                                  Southern Partisan General Store.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, America is indeed fortunate to have a \ndistinguished public servant of the caliber of John Ashcroft who is \nwilling to serve his country again, this time as Attorney General of \nthe United States. John is certainly the most qualified Attorney \nGeneral nominee of this century and perhaps in the Republic's history. \nJohn has impressive academic credentials and a unique blend of legal, \nexecutive, and legislative experience. I am confident that his \nqualifications, combined with his keen sense of duty and unshakeable \nintegrity, will enable Senator Ashcroft to be one of the finest \nAttorneys General in the nation's history and to restore luster to a \ntarnished agency.\n  John is an honors graduate of Yale University. He received his law \ndegree from the University of Chicago, one of the country's outstanding \nlaw schools. After graduating from law school, John returned home to \nMissouri where he practiced law and joined the faculty of what is now \nSouthwest Missouri State University, teaching business law for five \nyears. Following that, our colleague, then-Missouri Governor Kit Bond, \nappointed John to serve the citizens of Missouri as State Auditor.\n  John continued his legal career as an assistant Attorney General on \nthe staff of our former colleague, then-Missouri Attorney General John \nDanforth. In this capacity, John Ashcroft gained invaluable first-hand \nknowledge of the day-to-day operation of an Attorney General's \nDepartment. This knowledge would serve him well when he became \nMissouri's Attorney General in 1976. John, in fact, served two terms as \nMissouri's highest law enforcement officer, and as a result of his \neight year tenure in that office, obtained the managerial and executive \nexperience needed to effectively run an Attorney General's Office. \nUnder John's leadership, the Missouri Attorney General's Office earned \na reputation for strictly enforcing the law, including laws with which \nAttorney General Ashcroft disagreed. John Ashcroft understood well his \nrole as Missouri's Attorney General; he was acutely aware that \nMissourians twice-elected him to enforce the laws, and as his \nconfirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee clearly showed, \nJohn assiduously did so.\n  Because of his success as Attorney General, Missourians elected John \ntheir Governor in 1984 and again in 1988. To illustrate the utter \nridiculousness of one of the most scurrilous charges leveled at John--\nthat of being ``racially insensitive,'' as some are euphemistically \nsaying--it must be noted that as Governor, John repeatedly reached out \nto black Americans. For example, he appointed the first black woman to \nthe Western Missouri Court of Appeals; he established the state's first \nand only historic site honoring a black American, composer Scott \nJoplin; he led the fight to save Lincoln College, founded by black \nsoldiers; and last month Missourians celebrated the birthday of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. because John Ashcroft signed that proposed \nholiday law. John also helped enact Missouri's first hate crimes \nlegislation. In short, if John Ashcroft is ``racially insensitive,'' he \ncertainly has a strange way of showing it.\n  After completing his second term as Governor, John began a career of \nnational public service as Missouri's junior Senator in the United \nStates Senate. As a member of this body, John broadened his legal \nexperience by serving on the Judiciary Committee and by chairing its \nSubcommittee on the Constitution. He also continued to fight for the \nrights of all Americans, and was dedicated to the principle of equal \ntreatment under the law. For example, John sponsored legislation \nproviding equal protection for victims of crime, and he convened the \nfirst hearing on racial profiling, in which he stated for the record \nthat racial profiling is unconstitutional. And as he did as Missouri \nGovernor, John continued to support black judicial nominees, voting for \n26 of 27 African-American nominees to the federal bench.\n\n  As impressive as John's qualifications are, what may be most \nimpressive about him is his honor and integrity. I had the opportunity \nto witness first-hand a test of his character in my capacity as \nChairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Chairman \nof the Committee on Rules and Administration, which would have had \njurisdiction over an election contest. As we all know, John lost a \nheartbreakingly close reelection bid last fall under unorthodox, and \nsome would say, unlawful circumstances. After the election, my office \nwas flooded with phone calls and petitions urging John to challenge the \nelection, and lawyers lined-up to offer their services. Some argued \nthat John should bring a constitutional challenge on the ground that it \nwas patently unconstitutional to elect a deceased person to the United \nStates Senate. Others wanted him to bring an election contest because \nof improprieties in the voting itself, such as the fact that heavily-\nDemocrat precincts remained open after hours.\n  Either of these challenges may very well have proved successful, and \nJohn might still be a member of this body. But at a minimum, a \nchallenge would have put Missourians--and the entire Senate--through a \ndivisive ordeal, and it might well have left the good people of \nMissouri without full representation in the United States Senate. \nAlways the public servant, this is something that John Ashcroft would \nnot do. As particularly painful as this loss was, John never once \nconsidered challenging the election; he would not put his fellow \nMissourians through what the nation had to endure in Florida for \nthirty-five days. Moreover, he made it abundantly clear, both in public \nand in private, that he did not want others to do so either. Rather \nthan cling to power in the hope of an eventual victory, John graciously \nconceded the election and wished our new colleague well.\n  This selfless action was that of a statesman, and it reminds me of \nthe famous words of another statesman, Henry Clay, who said: ``I had \nrather be right than be President.'' John Ashcroft's response to this \ntruly unique and difficult loss in November was essentially: ``I had \nrather be right than be Senator.'' And it is because of principled \nactions such as this that John is one of the most respected former \nmembers of this body. And because Democratic members know of John's \ncharacter and integrity, they speak with confidence about the \noutstanding job he would do as Attorney General. For example, our \nformer colleague, Senator Moynihan, stated that John ``will be a superb \nAttorney General.'' And our current colleague, Senator Torricelli, who \nknew of John's skill and character from their service together on the \nJudiciary Committee, stated that ``While I have obvious philosophical \ndifferences with John, his ability and integrity simply can't be \nquestioned.''\n  Now despite John's experience and dedication to duty, I have heard a \nlot of people say that he is unfit to be Attorney General because of: \n(1) his strong and abiding faith in God; (2) his firm belief in law and \norder; and (3) his commitment to the Constitution, even when that \ncommitment is at odds with those unbiased ``legal scholars'' on the \neditorial board of the New York Times. Far from disqualifying him from \npublic service, however, these qualities only reinforce my belief that \nhe will ably serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. The \nSenate would serve the nation by confirming him as Attorney General, \nand I urge it to do so.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support the confirmation of \nPresident Bush's nominee for Attorney General of the United States, \nformer Senator John Ashcroft.\n  After serving in this body with John Ashcroft for the last six years, \nI know him as a man of integrity and compassion. That is not to say we \nalways agree--we have sparred passionately on\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\nissues--not the least of which was abortion rights. Clearly, though, \nJohn is a well-qualified nominee, as evidenced by the fact that of the \n67 persons who have served as United States Attorney General in our \nhistory, only John Ashcroft has served as state attorney general, \ngovernor, and U.S. Senator serving on the Judiciary Committee.\n  In fact, John Ashcroft was State Attorney General and Governor for \ntwo terms each. He was the head of the National Association of \nAttorneys General and head of the National Governors' Association. In \nthese roles, John has a solid record of working with and protecting the \nrights of all people.\n  That John and I hold differing views is certainly not unusual in this \nbody of one hundred individuals--all with strongly held beliefs, all \nwith disparate backgrounds, and all representing different \nconstituencies with distinct concerns and varying priorities. I \nrespected his right to hold his beliefs, just as he has always \nrespected my right to the beliefs that I have often expressed in this \nvery chamber. That is the nature of our representative democracy, and \ncertainly the nature of the Senate as the embodiment of the union of \nstates.\n  Likewise, President Bush, as the duly-elected Chief Executive of the \nUnited States, is accorded the privilege of nominating those men and \nwomen he deems most fit to administer the policies and duties with \nwhich he has been entrusted by the people of this Nation.\n  I did not agree with all of the personal viewpoints of President \nClinton's various nominees--far from it. Instead, I attempted to judge \nthe fitness of each nominee based on their individual record, \nexperience, testimony, and integrity. Recognizing that President \nClinton's nominees would not surprisingly hold different beliefs than \nmy own in some instances, I asked myself whether or not those beliefs \nwould, in and of themselves, preclude the nominee from executing his or \nher duties to the extent that they would be unfit to serve.\n  That is the same question I ask myself concerning the nomination of \nSenator Ashcroft, keeping in mind that I do not believe that a \nnominee's ideological philosophy should be a determining factor in \ntheir ability to serve. As the Portland Press Herald noted in their \nJanuary 17 editorial ``Senators have the power of ``advice and \nconsent'' over such nominees, and they have the power to make judgments \nbased on whatever criteria they choose. Still, failing to pass an \nideological litmus test is not a sufficient reason to decline to \nnominate someone to an appointive post, barring hard evidence of \nunsuitability or criminal misconduct. . .''\n  And what about the power of ``advice and consent'' given to the \nSenate under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution? Alexander \nHamilton in summing up this power noted ``To what purpose then require \nthe co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their \nconcurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \noperation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism \nin the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of \nunfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from \npersonal attachment, or from a view to popularity.''\n  And if you review history you will find that this ``check'' as it \nwere has been used judiciously. The fact is that since 1789--212 \nyears--only 19 cabinet nominees have failed to be confirmed. Clearly \nthe Senate must have differed with the President on his nominees more \nthan 19 times over the past 212 years, yet with very few exceptions has \ndeferred to the President, who will ultimately be held responsible for \nhis choice.\n  In short, our use of the ``advice and consent'' power must achieve a \ncareful balance between our responsibility to check presidential abuse \nat one end of the scale, and a respect for the president's \nconstitutional prerogative on the other. It is a question of degrees \nand a matter of judgement left to us to weigh with due diligence and \ncare.\n  In the case of John Ashcroft's nomination to be Attorney General, I \nwould argue that John Ashcroft deserves to be taken at his word with \nregard to what he has said at his confirmation hearings. He has said, \nclearly and unequivocally, that he will uphold the laws of the United \nStates of America.\n  During the confirmation hearings, John Ashcroft was \ncharacteristically straightforward when he said, ``I understand that \nbeing attorney general means enforcing the laws as they are written, \nnot enforcing my personal preferences. It means advancing the national \ninterest, not advocating my personal interest.''\n  During a private meeting in my office, John echoed that pledge and \npersonally assured me that he would carry out this and other laws on \nbehalf of every American. That includes Roe v. Wade. That includes \nensuring access to abortion clinics. And I take John Ashcroft at his \nword.\n  He also stated during the hearings that, ``The attorney general must \nrecognize this: The language of justice is not the reality of justice \nfor all Americans . . . No American should have the door to employment \nor educational opportunity slammed shut because of gender or race. No \nAmerican should fear being threatened or coerced in seeking \nconstitutionally protected health services.'' I commend him for this \nsentiment and, again, I take John Ashcroft at his word.\n  Importantly, John has carried himself with distinction in carrying \nout the laws in other elected positions, notably during his terms as \ngovernor and Attorney General of Missouri. As he told the Judiciary \nCommittee, ``I take pride in my record of having vigorously enforced \nthe civil rights laws as attorney general and governor,'' and I take \nJohn Ashcroft at his word.\n  Moreover, not only John's words but his deeds support his strong \ncommitment to civil rights. As Governor, John signed Missouri's first \nhate crimes statute and legislation creating the Martin Luther King \nHoliday. He established Missouri's first and only historic site \nhonoring an African-American, and led the fight to save an independent \nLincoln University, founded by African-American soldiers. Last year, he \nconvened the only Senate hearing on the subject of racial profiling, \nand opened the hearing by unequivocally condemning racial profiling, \ncalling it ``an unconstitutional practice.''\n  As Missouri Attorney General, John Ashcroft enforced laws that \ndiffered from his own beliefs in a number of areas, including abortion \nand, more specifically, the confidentiality of hospital records on the \nnumber of abortions performed; and church and state issues, such as the \navailability of funds for private and religious schools and the \ndistribution of religious materials in public schools.\n  As Governor, John was presented on nine occasions with three-\ncandidate panels for judicial appointments that contained one or more \nminority candidates. As he told the Committee in his nomination \nhearing, ``I took special care to expand racial and gender diversity in \nMissouri's courts,'' and the facts bear that out.\n  In every instance, he either appointed a minority to the post or \nappointed the minority candidates on the panel to judicial positions at \na later date. He appointed more African-American judges to the bench \nthan any governor in Missouri history.\n  He appointed the first African-American on the Western District Court \nof Appeals. He appointed the first African-American woman to the St. \nLouis County Circuit Court.\n  He appointed the first two women to the Missouri Courts of Appeals. \nAnd he appointed the first woman to the Missouri Supreme Court--the \nonly woman ever to have been appointed to that court.\n  Similarly, in the Senate, John supported every single African \nAmerican judicial nominee confirmed by the Senate--26 separate \nnominations in all. But despite this overwhelming record of supporting \nminority judicial candidates, he has been attacked for opposing the \nnomination of one African American Judge, Ronnie White--a nominee who \nwas opposed by 54 members of the Senate, including me.\n  Judge White's nomination was rejected by the Senate not because of \nhis race, but because of his opinions in some death penalty cases. It \nbears noting that not only was Judge White vigorously opposed by the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the Missouri Federation of Police \nChiefs, and numerous other Missouri and national law enforcement \ngroups, but he also stood as\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\nthe lone dissenter in a death penalty case involving the brutal slaying \nof three law enforcement officers in Missouri and the wife of a sheriff \nwho was killed after she was shot five times, in the family's own home, \nas she was holding a church function.\n  It is critical to note that in 1998, using similar criteria, I \nopposed the nomination of Judge Ann Aiken to the federal bench because \nof her decision to give probation instead of jail time to a man who \nraped a five-year-old child.\n  And what has Judge White said about John Ashcroft's motivations? He \nhas said, and I quote, ``. . . let me say, I don't think Senator \nAshcroft is a racist, and I wouldn't attempt to comment on what's in \nhis mind or what's in his heart.''\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that there were a number of critical \npolicy areas on which Senator Ashcroft and I did agree during our \ntenure together in the Senate. They deserve mention considering the \ncriticism that has been leveled against this nominee, and the relevance \nof the issues to the post of Attorney General.\n  John co-sponsored the benchmark Violence Against Women Act, and \nhelped author the provisions to prevent Internet stalking included in \nthe legislation. He supported minimum hospital stays for women who give \nbirth, and a measure to permit breast and cervical cancer coverage by \nMedicaid for low-income women.\n  He supported a provision urging that the ``Attorney General should \nfully enforce the law and protect persons seeking to provide or obtain, \nor assist in providing or obtaining, reproductive health services from \nviolent attack,'' and voted to make civil judgments for those who \ncommit violent acts at abortion clinics non-dischargeable in \nbankruptcy--an amendment that I cosponsored.\n  This is the John Ashcroft I know--a man of ability, remarkable \nexperience in public service, proven integrity, and unimpeachable \nprofessionalism. As Attorney General, he will be charged not with \nwriting new laws--as he ably did as a Senator--or interpreting laws--as \na judge would do. Instead, he will be given responsibility as our \nnation's top law enforcement official for executing the laws of the \nUnited States on behalf of President Bush and the American people. I am \nconfident he will enforce the laws to protect all Americans equally, \nregardless of his personal views, and I will vote to confirm John \nAshcroft as Attorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I shall vote to \nconfirm Senator Ashcroft. I discussed the reasons for my doing so in my \nstatement before the Judiciary Committee. At that meeting, I said:\n\n       My colleagues, when we vote today, I'm going to do what I \n     sincerely believe to be the right thing to do: vote for \n     confirmation of John Ashcroft as Attorney General of the \n     United States. For many of my colleagues, friends, \n     supporters, and constituents, this is not easy to understand. \n     And some see it as terribly wrong. After all, my voting \n     record and that of John Ashcroft could hardly be more \n     different, and there is no question that the opposition has \n     raised significant and serious concerns about the \n     appropriateness of this nomination.\n       Let me begin by noting a few positive aspects of former \n     Senator John Ashcroft's positions and responses to questions \n     at his hearing on two issues I care deeply about.\n       On racial profiling, as I said at the outset of the hearing \n     on Sen. Ashcroft's nomination, during the last Congress I \n     found him more receptive to my concerns about the issue than \n     virtually anyone on the Republican side of the aisle. He and \n     his staff not only permitted but assisted in a significant \n     and powerful hearing on racial profiling in the Constitution \n     Subcommittee. Although he did not ultimately cosponsor our \n     traffic stop statistics bill, he made constructive \n     suggestions about the bill, and his interest in addressing \n     this terrible problem I believe was sincere.\n       And that sincerity was underlined in recent testimony \n     before this Committee. He stated that he believes racial \n     profiling is an unconstitutional practice and that he will \n     make it a priority of the civil rights division of the \n     Department to eradicate it. I believe him and I look forward \n     to working with him on this if he is confirmed.\n       I have also expressed great concern that whoever assumes \n     the role of Attorney General of the United States needs to \n     understand and appreciate a need for fairness in the \n     administration of the severest punishment our Federal \n     government can mete out, the death penalty. I understand that \n     both President Bush and Senator Ashcroft support the use of \n     capital punishment. But I was relatively pleased with Senator \n     Ashcroft's responses to my questions, both at the hearing and \n     in written form, concerning the federal death penalty system. \n     I was particularly pleased to hear his commitment to \n     continuing the Justice Department review of racial and \n     regional disparities in the federal system, a review that was \n     ordered by President Clinton and is only in its initial \n     stages. I plan to hold him to his pledge and urge him \n     carefully to consider the results of this review and address \n     the disparities before proceeding with any federal \n     executions.\n       Having noted at least those areas where I'm hopeful about \n     working together with John Ashcroft, this process has, \n     nevertheless, brought forth extremely serious information \n     that could lead any reasonable person to conclude that this \n     nomination should not go forward.\n       The interview with Southern Partisan and his acceptance of \n     an honorary degree at Bob Jones University raise significant \n     questions about his sensitivity to the concerns of the \n     African American community in this country. Even worse, his \n     failure to fully disavow these actions is troubling. It \n     seemed almost as if he was playing it safe, trying not to \n     antagonize certain conservative constituencies rather than \n     admitting his mistakes and recognizing the need to take \n     concrete steps to disavow the racist attitudes that both of \n     those institutions represent to many Americans. He will need \n     to do much more if he is confirmed to reassure African-\n     Americans that he will faithfully enforce and apply the civil \n     rights laws of this country.\n       On another issue, Senator Ashcroft and the Republican \n     majority's treatment of Judge Ronnie White was just plain \n     unfair, and that is why I joined Senator Durbin in \n     apologizing to him when he appeared before the Committee. \n     Senator Ashcroft led opposition to Judge White, misleading \n     our colleagues as to his record and attacking him in harsh \n     and unfair language without giving him an opportunity to \n     respond. There was no excuse for this behavior, and it \n     represents for me an extremely sorry chapter in Senator \n     Ashcroft's public record. Our Republican colleagues on this \n     Committee and in the Senate share the responsibility for what \n     happened. They should not have followed their colleague and \n     allowed this to become a partisan issue on the floor of the \n     Senate.\n       I agree with David Broder, who in a column in which he \n     stated a number of reasons for supporting John Ashcroft for \n     Attorney General said that in the end, the Ronnie White \n     episode could alone justify voting against him. He said that \n     Ronnie White deserves more than an apology, he deserves an \n     appointment to the federal bench. I agree and I hope that \n     Senator Ashcroft and President Bush will give this idea \n     serious consideration.\n       And they need to go farther. The White nomination debacle \n     raised the issue of race on the Senate floor in an \n     unprecedented and almost tragic manner. The President and his \n     advisors need to take major steps to right that wrong, and \n     they can start by urging the Senate promptly to approve the \n     nomination of Judge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals. I would note that Judge Gregory has received the \n     endorsement of his home state Senators, Senators Warner and \n     Allen, both of whom come from the President's party.\n       Another troubling area is Senator Ashcroft's handling of a \n     St. Louis desegregation case during his time as Attorney \n     General of Missouri. I was impressed with the strong \n     testimony of respected civil rights lawyer Bill Taylor. Mr. \n     Taylor's testimony and the entire record of this case make it \n     clear that at best Senator Ashcroft did not ``get'' the role \n     of the courts in the case and the urgency of resolving the \n     issue in the best interests of the children in the city. At \n     worst, he exploited the case for political purposes, which is \n     very troubling indeed.\n       Then there is the case of James Hormel, our current \n     ambassador to Luxembourg, whom Senator Ashcroft strongly \n     opposed when his nomination was under consideration by the \n     Senate. This was an extreme example of a pattern of \n     unwarranted opposition to nominees pursued by Senator \n     Ashcroft. I am frankly mystified by the notion that in the \n     21st century a nomination of a distinguished American \n     would be blocked because of his sexual orientation. This \n     is another sorry chapter in Senator Ashcroft's record, and \n     frankly, his responses to written questions from members \n     of this Committee about his position on this nomination \n     were unsatisfactory and raise even more questions about \n     his testimony than they answer. Ambassador Hormel is right \n     to be outraged by those answers and the insinuations they \n     contain.\n       On a related topic, we have the accusations by former \n     Wisconsin state Senator Paul Offner that Sen. Ashcroft \n     questioned him about his sexual orientation in a job \n     interview in 1985. I have worked with both of these people, \n     and based on information I've seen, I find it hard to \n     disbelieve either one. But the Offner account does bother me \n     and while I will vote for Senator Ashcroft in committee \n     today, I reserve the right to review any further information \n     in this area that may come forward prior to the final \n     confirmation vote on the floor. After all, Senator Ashcroft \n     in sworn testimony told me that he had never used such an \n     approach in hiring.\n       In the end, however, this record has to be put in the \n     context of the standard that I believe should be used when \n     voting on the confirmation of a cabinet position. And, by the \n     way, I do find somewhat persuasive the argument that the \n     position of Attorney General\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\n     is particularly significant, although it does not rise to the \n     level of a high lifetime judicial appointment.\n       As a matter of practice, the Senate has, for the most part, \n     avoided rejecting the President's Cabinet nominations because \n     of their ideology alone. The Senate may examine, and has \n     examined, whether the extremity of nominees' views might \n     prevent them from carrying out the duties of the office they \n     seek to occupy. But the Senate has nearly uniformly sought to \n     avoid disapproving nominations because of their philosophy \n     alone. I believe that we should not begin to do so now.\n       As my colleagues know, in the practices and precedents of \n     the Senate, the Senate considers and approves the \n     overwhelming majority of nominations as a matter of routine. \n     Over the history of the Senate, the Senate has considered and \n     approved literally millions of nominations.\n       The Senate's voting to reject a nominee has been an \n     exceedingly rare event. Of the 1.7 million nominees received \n     by the Senate in the last 30 years, the Senate has voted to \n     reject just 4, or one in every 425,000. Of course, Presidents \n     often withdraw without a vote the nominations of those who \n     likely face defeat.\n       The Senate's voting to reject a nominee to the Cabinet has \n     been an exceedingly rare event. Over the entire history of \n     the Senate, the Senate has voted to reject only 9 nominations \n     to the President's Cabinet. The Senate rejected six in the \n     19th Century, and three in the 20th Century.\n       Four of the nine Cabinet nominees rejected were during the \n     Presidency of President Tyler alone. Several other rejections \n     may be said to have flowed from larger battles between the \n     Senate and the President, as when the Senate rejected \n     President Jackson's nominee to be Secretary of the Treasury \n     in the wake of the dispute over the Bank of the United \n     States. Similarly, bad feelings after the impeachment of \n     President Andrew Johnson led to the Senate's rejection of \n     President Johnson nominations of his counsel in the \n     impeachment trial to be Attorney General.\n       In the 20th Century, the Senate rejected half as many \n     Cabinet nominees as it did in the 19th Century. In the wake \n     of the Teapot Dome scandal, the Senate voted down President \n     Coolidge's nomination of Charles Warren because of his ties \n     to trusts. Most recently in 1989, the Senate rejected the \n     nomination of Senator John Tower, an event which many on this \n     Committee will recall from their own memory.\n       This examination of the history demonstrates that it has \n     been a nearly continuous custom of the Senate to confirm a \n     President's nominees to the Cabinet in all but the very \n     rarest of circumstances. These practices and precedents thus \n     support the principle that the Senate owes the President \n     substantial deference in the selection of the Cabinet.\n       I should also note, as some members of the committee have \n     done that all of President Clinton's cabinet appointments \n     were confirmed overwhelmingly, and usually unanimously, \n     despite the fact that many Republicans strongly disagreed \n     with their views. This included the view of Attorney General \n     Janet Reno in opposition to the death penalty, a view I \n     strongly share with her but which has enlisted the support of \n     few of my colleagues.\n       Now, a number of opponents of this nomination for whom I \n     have very high regard have sought to go beyond the \n     traditional standards for cabinet nominations. I think the \n     most interesting approach that the opponents have laid out, \n     especially in light of the serious problems with Senator \n     Ashcroft's record that I have already identified, is the \n     question of whether Senator Ashcroft will actually enforce \n     the law. I think my colleague Senator Schumer set up the \n     question well when he said words to this effect: ``Given \n     Senator Ashcroft's entire record of passionate advocacy for \n     very conservative causes: Can he switch it off?'' I think \n     this is a useful standard but it must be applied with \n     caution. All of us have observed many talented people taking \n     very different roles in their careers, sometimes having to \n     oppose either people or groups for whom they used to \n     advocate.\n       Now in my own career, I've certainly been called \n     unreasonable, unyielding and too persistent on occasion. But \n     I remember being a defense attorney for large corporations at \n     a law firm and then subsequently when I went to the Wisconsin \n     State Senate, voting against those interests every time. I \n     went into the State Senate representing a largely rural \n     district and I remember constantly speaking of the need for \n     rural property tax relief and not letting the City of \n     Milwaukee run off with the entire budget. Yet, when I became \n     a United States Senator, I understood my role to have changed \n     and that I needed to advocate zealously for the very real \n     needs for the people of our largest city.\n       So, it seems to me that I've been asked to switch it off on \n     several occasions. I feel I have done so and that this is \n     fairly common in the careers of those public men and women.\n       I think we were all struck by the strength of John \n     Ashcroft's commitments and answers to our tough questions \n     which were given under oath. His specific commitments to \n     enforce the law in several areas were certainly not tepid. \n     This was especially true with regard to his responses on \n     choice and abortion-related matters--an area where, as a \n     policy and constitutional matter I disagree with him \n     virtually completely. Given Senator Ashcroft's strident \n     record in this area it is completely understandable to me \n     that critics would regard this as a ``confirmation \n     conversion'' and that some would even see this as cynical \n     with carefully chosen words with regard to Roe v. Wade, \n     leaving the door open for a very different reality in the new \n     Attorney General's office. I, for one, will not stand by and \n     allow a departure from the clear impression that Senator \n     Ashcroft offered as an assurance. In fact, one area I will \n     closely scrutinize is his choices for top level positions in \n     the Department of Justice. He will have direct responsibility \n     for carrying out the promises he made to this Committee and \n     the country.\n       But I do take some umbrage at the notion that giving John \n     Ashcroft's sworn testimony the benefit of the doubt is \n     somehow because of Senate collegiality. No, it is because it \n     is sworn testimony.\n       But I do understand the very strong skepticism on this \n     point in light of the incidents I've already reviewed \n     especially as they relate to the blocking of nominations, a \n     process in which John Ashcroft too often participated. I \n     cannot question anyone for opposing this nomination, anyone \n     for coming to an opposite conclusion of this record. It \n     simply depends on one's view of the cabinet nomination \n     process. It is a judgement call. I feel obligated under the \n     traditional understanding of how cabinet appointments are \n     handled to not put the worst possible interpretation on these \n     facts. And I specifically cannot justify constructing the \n     worst case scenario solely because Senator Ashcroft seemed to \n     do the same for a number of very worthy nominees. It is \n     certainly tempting to do so, but I am afraid it looks too \n     much like political ``payback,'' a lesson that would not be \n     lost in future cabinet confirmation considerations, including \n     those involving the choices of a Democratic President. I \n     don't want to be a part of taking the United States Senate \n     and this country further down the road that John Ashcroft and \n     others in his party paved during the Clinton years.\n       Having said that, I want to hasten to add that I'm not at \n     all sure that this kind of deference be given anymore on \n     lifetime federal judicial appointments given what appears to \n     be an open assault in recent years by the U.S. Senate on the \n     federal judiciary. As I said in my opening statement at the \n     confirmation hearing, although Democrats are being asked to \n     follow the political golden rule on this nomination, I \n     certainly agree that the line must be drawn at some point \n     concerning the politicization of appointments. My judgment is \n     that this is not the place--not this nomination or this \n     office, as terribly important as it is.\n       And yes, I firmly believe that as a progressive, this is \n     about our future credibility and ability to move our agenda \n     in a future administration that better reflects on voting \n     records and beliefs, which in most cases are just the \n     opposite of a John Ashcroft's.\n       I know that some see this as futile or naive in light of \n     the unbending ``other side.'' They may be right. But I \n     believe the American people desperately want us to conduct \n     ourselves, where possible, in a bipartisan manner: with \n     civility, with give and take, and act as if those terms have \n     real meaning and are not just empty rhetoric.\n       So when I vote for John Ashcroft in committee, I am \n     reaching out to the new Administration and to my Republican \n     colleagues and especially those on the opposite side of this \n     committee. I believe we share mutual respect. So I am \n     extending to you at the beginning of this new Republican \n     Administration an olive branch, but it is not a white flag I \n     assure you. This is about the Department of Justice and it is \n     justice I want to see for the wrong done to Judge Ronnie \n     White. And it is justice I want to see done in the 4th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals where the largest African American \n     population lives and has never had an African American judge \n     until the recess appointment of Roger Gregory. It is justice \n     I want for numerous other circuit court nominees who \n     languished in this committee for years and never even \n     received a hearing. And it is justice I want for the future \n     James Hormels and Bill Lann Lees who were most assuredly \n     treated unfairly. And it is justice I want for the the \n     victims of racial profiling in America. And I will press this \n     Administration, the Attorney General, and this committee to \n     prevent it from happening to others in the future.\n       So I am genuinely appealing to you to show in concrete ways \n     in the near future that you are concerned about the obviously \n     heartfelt and legitimate feelings of many Americans that the \n     Senate's role in the nominations process has been abused and \n     overly politicized. There are real fault lines emerging in \n     our culture and in our political system and repairs must be \n     made. And some who have been harmed can and must be made \n     whole.\n       In fact, one of the most eloquent statements to this effect \n     came just this month in President George W. Bush's Inaugural \n     Address: ``Sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we \n     share a continent, but not a country.'' I think he's right \n     and I think this committee is the place to begin to repair \n     the breach. That means for me the very difficult decision to \n     vote to confirm John Ashcroft, but it also means immediate \n     concrete efforts by the President and his party to mend the \n     wounds that led to such fierce opposition to the Ashcroft \n     nomination. It, of course, also means that the new Attorney \n     General must vigorously enforce the law and be the Attorney \n     General of all the people, regardless of race, religion, \n     gender or sexual\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\n     orientation. If he does that, he will earn the support of the \n     American people. If he does not, I will be the first to call \n     him on it and demand that he be held accountable.\n\n  That was my statement in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I rise today to speak more generally on the Senate's role of advice \nand consent in the President's nomination of individuals to the \nCabinet. I rise also to speak a bit about the appointment process in \ngeneral, apart from the discussion of any particular nomination. This \nanalysis governs my consideration of both Senator Ashcroft's and Ms. \nNorton's nominations.\n  John Adams wrote that we seek ``[a] government of laws, and not of \nmen.'' He and other Founders sought a government based on principles, \nnot on personalities. If we, as Senators, wish to serve that end in the \nnomination process, we must measure Cabinet nominations according to \nprinciple, with a look at the past and a view to the future.\n\n  The first principle that I think should govern Cabinet nominations is \nwhat one might call the political Golden Rule. We, as Democrats, \nshould, if at all possible, do unto the Republicans as we would have \nthe Republicans do unto us. A Democratic President ought to be able to \nappoint to the Cabinet principled people of strong progressive \nideology. And a Republican President ought to be able to appoint to the \nCabinet principled people of strong conservative ideology.\n  Now, some of our Republican colleagues have certainly failed too \noften in recent years to follow that Golden Rule, and I understand the \ndesire to repay them in kind. To some degree, I share that desire. But \nI am determined to resist it for the good of the country, the health of \nthe nomination process, and ultimately, to advance the prospects of \nfuture nominees who share the unabashedly progressive convictions that \nI hold dear.\n  This principle means that, except in the rarest of cases, voting \nrecords and conservative ideology alone should not be a sufficient \nbasis to reject at least a Cabinet nominee. I say this as a progressive \nDemocrat from Wisconsin who hopes that future Presidents may appoint \nthe William O. Douglasses and Ramsey Clarks of their times, and that \nfuture Senates will not reject them for Cabinet positions on the basis \nof their ideology alone.\n  It should not be a requirement for a Cabinet position that the \nnominee travel solely in the middle of the road. There will come great \nleaders on the left and on the right.\n  If we seek the great minds of our times, they may on occasion blow \nhot or cold. We should not require all the leaders of our country to \nrun a tepid lukewarm.\n  Now, whether nominating a staunch conservative is good politics or, \nmore importantly, whether it is wise, in light of a promise to unify \nthe nation after a very close election, is an important issue for a \nsustained national debate. But that question is not at the core of our \nresponsibility in this body to advise and consent on Cabinet \nnominations.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote of the dangers of partisanship in the \nnomination process in Federalist number 76. He cited the partisanship \nof legislatures as one of the reasons why the Constitution did well to \nvest the power to nominate in the President, rather than in the \nCongress. Considering what would happen if the Constitution had given \nthe Congress the power to nominate, Hamilton wrote:\n\n       The choice which may at any time happen to be made under \n     such circumstances, will of course be the result either of a \n     victory gained by one party over the other, or of a \n     compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic \n     merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the \n     first, the qualifications best adapted to uniting the \n     suffrages of the party, will be more considered than those \n     which fit the person for the station. In the last, the \n     coalition will commonly turn upon some interested equivalent: \n     ``Give us the man we wish for this office, and you shall have \n     the one you wish for that.'' This will be the usual condition \n     of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the \n     advancement of the public service will be the primary object \n     either of party victories or of party negotiations.\n\n  So Hamilton wrote in Federalist 76. Thus we honor Hamilton's \ncautionary warning, and we advance the public service, by avoiding \npartisanship in the confirmation process.\n  As a matter of practice, the Senate has, for the most part, limited \nits consideration of the President's Cabinet nominees to an inquiry \ninto the nominees' fitness for office. The Senate must examine, and has \nexamined, the qualifications of nominees. William Blackstone wrote in \nhis Commentaries on the Laws of England, a work well known among the \nFounders, that ``[a]ll offices . . . carry in the eye of the law an \nhonour along with them; because they imply a superiority of . . . \nabilities, being supposed to be always filled with those that are most \nable to execute them.'' The Senate has thus nearly uniformly sought to \ntest the ability of nominees to execute the office that they seek to \noccupy.\n  But as a matter of practice, the Senate has, for the most part, \navoided rejecting the President's Cabinet nominations because of their \nideology alone. The Senate may examine, and has examined, whether the \nextremity of nominees' views might prevent them from carrying out the \nduties of the office they seek to occupy. But the Senate has nearly \nuniformly sought to avoid disapproving nominations because of their \nphilosophy alone. I believe that we should not begin to do so now.\n  Mr. President, the second principle that I think should govern \nnominations is that the Senate owes the President substantial deference \nin the selection of the Cabinet. The Constitution vests the appointment \npower primarily in the President. This choice of the Founders, in turn, \nflows from the Constitution's imposing on the President the duty \nfaithfully to execute the laws of our Nation.\n  Article 2, section 1 of the Constitution begins: ``The executive \npower shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.'' \nThat section ends by requiring the President-elect to take the oath \n``that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United \nStates, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.'' And article 2, section \n3 provides that the President ``shall take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  To carry out that duty, the President needs policy-makers in the \nexecutive branch, particularly in the Cabinet and subcabinet, who will \nsupport the President's program, as well as carry out the law. The \nSupreme Court in Myers v. United States explained:\n\n       Our conclusion . . . is that Article II grants to the \n     President the executive power of the Government, i.e., the \n     general administrative control of those executing the \n     laws, including the power of appointment and removal of \n     executive officers--a conclusion confirmed by his \n     obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully \n     executed; . . . and . . . that to hold otherwise would \n     make it impossible for the President, in case of political \n     or other differences with the Senate or Congress, to take \n     care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n\n  Thus article 2, section 2 of the Constitution confers the appointment \npower in the following language:\n\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, \n     other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme \n     Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose \n     appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which \n     shall be established by law: but the Congress may by law vest \n     the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think \n     proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in \n     the heads of departments.\n\n  Let me begin my discussion of this language with an analysis of its \nhistory.\n  With this language, the Constitutional Convention made a change from \nthe Articles of Confederation. Article 9 of the Articles of \nConfederation vested appointment powers in the Congress or a committee \nof Congress. That article provides, in relevant part:\n\n       The United States in Congress assembled, shall have the \n     sole and exclusive right and power of . . . appointing courts \n     for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high \n     seas. . . .\n       The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the \n     sole and exclusive right and power of . . . appointing all \n     officers of the land forces, in the service of the United \n     States, excepting regimental officers--appointing all the \n     officers of the naval forces, and commissioning all officers \n     whatever in the service of the United States. . . .\n       The United States in Congress assembled shall have \n     authority . . . to appoint such other . . . civil officers as \n     may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the \n     United States under their direction. . . .\n\n  And finally:\n\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\n\n       The United States in Congress assembled shall never . . . \n     appoint a commander in chief of the army or navy, unless nine \n     States assent to the same. . . .\n\n  Recall that one of the prime reasons for the Constitutional \nConvention that wrote our current Constitution was that the Articles of \nConfederation provided a government that proved less than workable. The \nFounders thus sought consciously to depart from this legislative \ngovernment in favor of a stronger executive.\n  When the Constitutional Convention began to debate the Constitution, \nits working draft initially provided for the Congress to choose the \nnational judiciary. Many of the Framers found fault with this proposal. \nPennsylvania's James Wilson argued that appointment by a group with \nnumerous members would necessarily lead to ``[i]ntrigue, partiality, \nand concealment.'' He argued: ``A principal reason for unity in the \nExecutive was that officers might be appointed by a single, responsible \nperson.''\n  Virginia's James Madison agreed, saying, ``Besides the danger of \nintrigue and partiality, many of the members were not judges of the \nrequisite qualifications. The Legislative talents . . . were very \ndifferent from those of a Judge. . . .''\n  Massachusetts's Nathaniel Gorham, who in the Convention was an early \nproponent of the structure finally adopted in the Constitution, also \nemphasized the value of focusing responsibility on the President. \nMadison's notes report him saying:\n\n       The Executive would certainly be more answerable for a good \n     appointment, as the whole blame of a bad one would fall on \n     him alone. . . . [N]ot . . . that he would be answerable \n     under any other penalty than that of public censure, which \n     with honorable minds was a sufficient one.\n\n  Pennsylvania's Gouverneur Morris argued that the President would need \nto deal with every part of the United States, and would thus be best \ninformed about the character of potential nominees. Madison's notes \nreport:\n\n       Mr. Gouverneur Morris argued against the appointment of \n     officers by the Senate. He considered the body as too \n     numerous for the purpose; as subject to cabal; and as devoid \n     of responsibility.--If Judges are to be tried by the Senate . \n     . . it was particularly wrong to let the Senate have the \n     filling of vacancies which its own decrees were to create.\n\n  Gouverneur Morris later summed up: ``[A]s the President was to \nnominate, there would be responsibility, and as the Senate was to \nconcur, there would be security.''\n  When they reported home to their Governor, Connecticut's Roger \nSherman and Oliver Ellsworth cited the protection of the rights of \nsmaller states, writing: ``The equal representation of the States in \nthe Senate and the voice of that branch in the appointment to offices \nwill secure the rights of the lesser as well as of the greater \nStates.'' The Supreme Court in Myers v. United States cited this as a \nmajor purpose for the creation of the Senate's power of advice and \nconsent, saying:\n\n       The history of the clause by which the Senate was given a \n     check upon the President's power of appointment makes it \n     clear that it was not prompted by any desire to limit \n     removals. . . . [T]he important purpose of those who brought \n     about the restriction was to lodge in the Senate, where the \n     small States had equal representation with the larger States, \n     power to prevent the President from making too many \n     appointments from the larger States.\n\n  After the Convention settled on the language now in the Constitution, \nproponents and opponents of executive power alike agreed that the \nPresident received the paramount role.\n  New York's Alexander Hamilton, who wanted a strong Presidency, wrote \nin Federalist number 76:\n\n       [I]t is easy to show, that every advantage to be expected . \n     . . would, in substance, be derived from the power of \n     nomination . . . . In the act of nomination, his judgment \n     alone would be exercised; and as it would be his sole duty to \n     point out the man who, with the approbation of the Senate, \n     should fill an office, his responsibility would be as \n     complete as if he were to make the final appointment. There \n     can, in this view, be no difference between nominating and \n     appointing.\n\n  Similarly, Maryland's Luther Martin, who feared too strong a \nPresidency, wrote in the Genuine Information:\n\n       To that part of this article . . . which gives the \n     President a right to nominate, and with the consent of the \n     Senate to appoint all the officers, civil and military, of \n     the United States, there were considerable opposition--it was \n     said that the person who nominates, will always in reality \n     appoint . . . .\n\n  In the ratification debates, insofar as they addressed the nomination \nprocess, Hamilton's two Federalist Papers, numbers 76 and 77, stand \nmost prominently. In Federalist number 76, Hamilton picked up the theme \nof the value of focusing responsibility on the President, writing:\n\n       The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will \n     naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact \n     regard to reputation. He will, on this account, feel himself \n     under stronger obligations, and more interested to \n     investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations \n     to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who \n     may have the fairest pretensions to them. He will have fewer \n     personal attachments to gratify, than a body of men who may \n     each be supposed to have an equal number; and will be so much \n     the less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship \n     and of affection. A single well-directed man, by a single \n     understanding, cannot be distracted and warped by that \n     diversity of views, feelings, and interests, which frequently \n     distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body.\n\n  Hamilton also wrote of responsibility in Federalist number 77, where \nhe wrote:\n\n       The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the President \n     singly and absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one \n     would lie entirely at the door of the Senate; aggravated by \n     the consideration of their having counteracted the good \n     intentions of the Executive. If an ill appointment should be \n     made, the Executive for nominating, and the Senate for \n     approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in \n     the opprobrium and disgrace.\n\n  In the discussion among the Founders that touches most closely on the \nSenate's role in the nomination process, Hamilton wrote that he \nexpected the Senate to reject nominees rather infrequently, but that \nthe potential of such rejections would provide a useful check. Hamilton \nwrote:\n\n       But might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it \n     might, yet this could only be to make place for another \n     nomination by himself. The person ultimately appointed must \n     be the object of his preference, though perhaps not in the \n     first degree. It is also not very probable that his \n     nomination would often be overruled. The Senate could not be \n     tempted, by the preference they might feel to another, to \n     reject the one proposed; because they could not assure \n     themselves, that the person they might wish would be brought \n     forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They \n     could not even be certain, that a future nomination would \n     present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; \n     and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the \n     individual rejected, and might have the appearance of a \n     reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate, it is \n     not likely that their sanction would often be refused, where \n     there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal.\n\n  Hamilton concluded:\n\n       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the \n     Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence \n     would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \n     operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  The first Congress, which included among its Members several of the \nFounders, had occasion to discuss the appointment power. Georgia's \nAbraham Baldwin, for one, had been a delegate to the Constitutional \nConvention, and then became a Congressman. In arguing against extending \nthe Senate's advice and consent power to removals from office, he said:\n       I am well authorized to say that the mingling of the powers \n     of the President and Senate was strongly opposed in the \n     Convention which had the honor to submit to the consideration \n     of the United States and the different States the present \n     system for the government of the Union. Some gentlemen \n     opposed it to the last, and finally it was the principal \n     ground on which they refused to give it their signature and \n     assent. One gentleman called it a monstrous and unnatural \n     connection and did not hesitate to affirm it would bring on \n     convulsions in the government. This objection was not \n     confined to the walls of the Convention; it has been subject \n     of newspaper declamation and perhaps justly so. Ought we not, \n     therefore, to be careful not to extend this unchaste \n     connection any further?\n\n  Similarly, James Madison became a Congressman in the first Congress, \nwhere he said:\n\n       Perhaps there was no argument urged with more success or \n     more plausibly grounded against the Constitution under which \n     we are now deliberating than that founded on the mingling of \n     the executive and legislative branches of the Government in \n     one body. It has been objected that the Senate have too much \n     of the executive power even, by having control over the \n     President in the appointment to office. Now shall we extend \n     this connexion between the legislative and executive \n     departments which will strengthen the\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\n     objection and diminish the responsibility we have in the head \n     of the Executive?\n\n  The Supreme Court in Myers v. United States concluded from this \nhistory that it should read narrowly the Senate's power of advice and \nconsent, saying: ``Our conclusion . . . is . . . that the provisions of \nthe second section of Article II, which blend action by the legislative \nbranch, or by part of it, in the work of the executive, are limitations \nto be strictly construed and not to be extended by implication . . . \n.''\n  Let me turn now briefly to the history of the process of advice and \nconsent in the Senate. Many of my Colleagues will have read the \nexcellent discussion of that history in volume 2, chapter 2, of Senator \nByrd's history of the Senate. For those who have not, I recommend it.\n  As my Colleagues know, in the practices and precedents of the Senate, \nthe Senate considers and approves the overwhelming majority of \nnominations as a matter of routine. Over the history of the Senate, the \nSenate has considered and approved literally millions of nominations.\n  The Senate Executive Journal began totaling the number of nominations \nreceived and confirmed beginning in 1929. From then until now, the \nSenate has received more than 2.9 million nominations and confirmed \nmore than 2.8 million. Over that period, the Senate has confirmed 97.9 \npercent of the nominations that it received. Among those not confirmed, \nmany simply remained unconfirmed at the end of a Congress.\n  The Senate's voting to reject a nominee has been an exceedingly rare \nevent. Of the 1.7 million nominees received by the Senate in the last \n30 years, the Senate has voted to reject just 4, or one in every \n425,000. Of course, Presidents often withdraw without a vote the \nnominations of those who likely face defeat.\n  The Senate's voting to reject a nominee to the Cabinet has been an \neven more exceedingly rare event. Over the entire history of the \nSenate, the Senate has voted to reject only 9 nominations to the \nPresident's Cabinet. The Senate rejected 6 in the 19th Century, and 3 \nin the 20th Century.\n  Four of the 9 Cabinet nominees rejected were during the Presidency of \nPresident Tyler alone. Several other rejections may be said to have \nflowed from larger battles between the Senate and the President, as \nwhen the Senate rejected President Jackson's nominee to be Secretary of \nthe Treasury in the wake of the dispute over the Bank of the United \nStates. Similarly, bad feelings after the impeachment of President \nAndrew Johnson led to the Senate's rejection of President Johnson's \nnomination of his counsel in the impeachment trial to be Attorney \nGeneral.\n  In the 20th Century, the Senate rejected half as many Cabinet \nnominees as it did in the 19th Century. In the wake of the Teapot Dome \nscandal, the Senate voted down President Coolidge's nomination of \nCharles Warren because of his ties to trusts. The Senate voted down \nPresident Eisenhower's nomination of Lewis Strauss, some say because of \nAdmiral Strauss's lack of tack. Most recently, in 1989, the Senate \nrejected the nomination of Senator John Tower, an event which many in \nthe Senate will recall from their own memory.\n  This examination of the history demonstrates that it has been a \nnearly continuous custom of the Senate to confirm a President's \nnominees to the Cabinet in all but the very rarest of circumstances. \nThese practices and precedents thus support the principle that the \nSenate owes the President substantial deference in the selection of the \nCabinet.\n  Bearing in mind this history and Hamilton's admonition that the \nSenate's ``dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual \nrejected, and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the \njudgment of the chief magistrate,'' what then should be, in Hamilton's \nwords, the ``special and strong reasons for the refusal'' that should \nprompt the Senate to reject a nominee to the Cabinet?\n  It is in the nature of the Constitution's grant of powers to the \nSenate that each Senator must make his or her own decision how to vote \non nominees whom the Senate considers. It thus follows that each \ndecision must to some extent be subjective. But we do injury to the \nreputation of the Senate when we cannot articulate our reasons for \nrejecting a nominee as the expression of rules that could have \nuniversal application.\n  It is the nature of justice that different persons of similar \ncircumstances should receive similar treatment. Let us do justice when \nthe Senate exercises its role of advice and consent.\n  Let us examine nominees to see that they have, in Blackstone's words, \n``superiority of . . . abilities''; let us see that they are ``most \nable to execute'' the offices for which they are nominated.\n  Let us thoroughly investigate nominees' competence and experience. \nLet us question whether they have taken actions that would lead us to \ndoubt their ability fully and fairly to execute their offices.\n  Let us explore nominees' integrity and ensure that they have the \nproper ethical bearing to administer the high trusts to which they are \nnominated.\n  And yes, let us guard against approving the nomination of an \nindividual who stands so far at variance with the core values of this \nNation--values of freedom, democracy, and equality--that we cannot \nrealistically imagine the nominee's being able to carry out the duties \nof an office in our American government. That will necessarily be a \nsubjective judgment, but plainly a legitimate one.\n  But let us conduct our investigation in matters such as these that \ninvolve the lives and reputations of other people--people almost \nuniformly highly regarded in the community--with civility. Let us take \npains to avoid casting the kind of personal ``stigma'' that Hamilton \nfeared. And let us, when we hold the honor and careers of people in our \nhands, do what we can to diffuse the bitter viciousness that has seized \nso much of official Washington.\n  I propose that we govern ourselves by principle, as a Democrat at the \noutset of a new Republican Presidency, in the hope that we may rise \nabove that which has come before. For I cannot help but express my \nobjection to the attitude and approach that the Republican majority in \nthe Senate took toward the nominees of the Democratic President since \nthe Republicans took control of the majority in 1994.\n  In some respects, the Republican majority seemed not even to accept \nthe legitimacy of President Clinton's electoral victories in 1992 and \n1996. Elections must have consequences.\n  Instead, it appeared to me that they unfairly blocked very \nlegitimate, qualified appointees such as Bill Lann Lee, Ronnie White, \nand James Hormel.\n  I think this was wrong. But I propose that we Democrats not return \nthe favor, escalating a never-ending harshening of our discourse. \nRather, I propose that we treat this new Republican President the way \nthat we would want a Republican majority to treat a Democratic \nPresident in the future.\n  It is not easy for me to tell those who fought so hard for President \nClinton and then for Vice-President Gore that we should follow the \nGolden Rule, and that we should treat President Bush better than the \nRepublican majority treated President Clinton. And should the new \nPresident abuse the Senate's deference, there may come a point when we \nhave to draw a line and say, ``No more,'' given the Republican \nmajority's refusal to accord a Democratic President the very deference \nthat Republicans now seek.\n  I want to make clear the manner in which I have evaluated both of the \ncontroversial nominees before this body, the nominee we consider today, \nformer Senator Ashcroft, and the nominee who was confirmed Tuesday, Ms. \nNorton. I am no more comfortable with these votes and appointments than \nanyone else of my personal ideological viewpoint.\n  I fully understand and have heard the pain expressed by my \nconstituents who have strongly criticized these nominations and who \ndevote their time and thought to building broader public support for an \nend to all forms of discrimination or for reproductive rights or for an \nenvironmentally sound energy policy or for wildlands protection. I must \nwork hard every day on issues affecting the public interest and public \nwelfare, and, in order to move a progressive agenda forward I must sit \nand listen and talk with those who deeply and profoundly disagree with \nme. These nominees and I do not agree on a number of issues. But the \nquestion that this\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nbody faces, and that I face as a member of it, is broader than whether \nor not we are having a referendum on the ideological views expressed by \nthese nominees.\n  I have reflected and given thought to the deeper historical and \nphilosophical roots of the process of the Senate giving ``advice and \nconsent'' to Cabinet nominees. In this history of the Senate's \ntreatment of Cabinet nominations, deference is an important principle. \nLack of that deference on nominees can result in a confirmation process \nthat is undignified for the country, unlikely to produce outstanding \npublic servants, and unable to advance the debate on matters of public \npolicy.\n  I am attempting by these votes to assist in restoring the Senate's \ncredibility and trust, and I will use the powers of my office to make \ncertain these nominees live up to the views they have expressed to this \nbody under oath.\n  And let me underscore that I have risen today to address nominations \nto the Cabinet, who will serve for a term of years, and whom we should \nconsider under a far looser standard than that we should apply to \njudges and certainly justices, who will serve for life.\n  But I fear that in the process of giving its advice and consent with \nregard to nominations to the President's Cabinet, the Senate is \npositioning itself to head down a road to a dangerous place. Let us \ndecide not to go down that road.\n  Let us not go down the road to where those who seek public office \nmust all their life avoid any forceful public utterance.\n  Let us not go down the road to where young people--college students \nand graduate students--will fear to experiment with new ideas.\n  Let us not go down the road to where expression is squelched and \nthoughts are stifled.\n  Let us not go down the road to that arid place where public discourse \nis barren because no public leaders dare write articles declaring their \nviews.\n\n  Let us not go down the road to where Senators fear to take a \nposition, make a statement, or cosponsor a bill on a controversial \nissue, like the death penalty--one way or the other--just to avoid a \nconfirmation fight.\n  Let us not go down the road to that frozen place where the Senate's \nnomination process imposes a deep chill over political discourse among \nall who would someday hold office.\n  And let us not go down a road to where in order to serve our Country, \none must become like milk toast, like Pablum.\n  Rather, let us work together in this government, working with \nvigorous minds who may sometimes have vigorous opinions.\n  The American People expect this Senate and this government, divided \nas it is, to govern. We owe them no less than to try to do so.\n  Now is not too soon to start. I extend to President Bush the hand of \ncooperation as he begins his administration. I will cast my votes on \nnominations he proposes according to these principles, and hope that \nthe President and the majority will return the favor, and work together \nwith us in a truly bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the United States Constitution \nexpressly grants to the Senate the prerogative, responsibility, and \nduty to determine its ``advice and consent'' to the nominations of all \nPresidents. This is an important, even awesome mandate, and one no \nSenator takes lightly. While the Senate's constitutional role is \nplainly much more than a mere rubber stamp, the President also should \nbe given wide latitude in the people he chooses to run our government \nwith him.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have voted to approve all but one of \nPresident Bush's cabinet nominations. I have done so because, on the \nwhole, I believe his nominees are an impressive, diverse, and well-\nqualified group who reflect the broad spectrum of America's \nphilosophical and cultural backgrounds.\n  Of course, without exception, they appear to represent the views of \nthe new President who nominated them. Beyond their fundamental ability \nto do the job, their views and ideologies have been of little \nconsequence to my decisions. Instead, an important additional \ncharacteristic I have looked for, particularly at this time in our \nnation's history, is a proven ability to bring people together. I seek \nnominees who will welcome diverse points of view and ideas and who will \nlead in building consensus. In that vein, I have given my full support \nto 18 of the cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by President Bush \nthis year.\n  The nominee before us today, however, is not one I can support.\n  The United States Attorney General has a particularly compelling and \nimportant role, as evidenced by this vigorous debate. The Attorney \nGeneral is known as the President's legal advisor and the people's \nlawyer. He or she is charged with leading our nation in interpreting, \nenforcing, and upholding our laws. He must be a person who embodies \nbalance and evenhandedness, so that all of our citizens feel fully and \nfairly represented by his actions. He must be able to contribute in a \nmeaningful way to the great challenge of uniting our nation. That is my \ntest for this nomination.\n  Former Senator John Ashcroft is a man that I have come to know here \nin the United States Senate. I have served with him on the Senate \nCommerce Committee and spent many hours observing and participating \nwith him in debate. Throughout his service here, and earlier as \nGovernor and Attorney General in the State of Missouri, he has shown a \nstrong moral compass and passionately held views about what he wants \nfor our country and its citizens.\n  As Senate colleagues, we have sometimes agreed, and more often \ndisagreed on policy and legislation. In many cases, his legislative \nagenda was not one that I thought helped or protected West Virginia's \nworking families, seniors and children. But, again, my test for \nAttorney General is not whether I share John Ashcroft's views on any \nparticular issue or matter.\n  I have great respect for John Ashcroft as a person of deeply held \nreligious beliefs, and his particular faith is of no consequence for me \nin this decision. In fact, I have been personally offended by a few who \nsuggest that someone's religion might be a consideration in this or any \nother decision I make. I unequivocally reject that type of thinking and \nbelieve my own long record proves otherwise.\n  John Ashcroft has been honest in his convictions and his principles, \nand he has fashioned his public life working to advance his firmly held \nbeliefs. He is a man of strong, unbending ideology--so unbending, in \nfact, that this is what makes him the wrong choice for Attorney \nGeneral. I have plainly seen in John Ashcroft a basic inability to \ncompromise or to reach out to those with opposing or different points \nof view.\n  The problem is not John Ashcroft's ideology. It is the fact that he \nnever seems able to look beyond that ideology to respect and encompass \nothers' equally strong beliefs and convictions. There is nothing in his \nlong history of public service to suggest he can rise to the challenge \nof being a uniter, someone who can compromise when necessary to bring \nus all together.\n  Furthermore, I have heard John Ashcroft's promise to uphold and \nenforce our laws, and I take him at his word. But the question of his \nnomination and the role of Attorney General are not that simple. If \nthey were, then every person nominated to a position charged with \nupholding the law would be approved--every judge, every U.S. Attorney, \nevery Cabinet Secretary. Reasonable people have honest disagreements \nabout what the law says and how to apply it in different situations. \nThe law is not always precise, and the path to justice is not always \nclearly marked.\n  The Attorney General instead has a great deal of discretion, and he \nmust bring to that discretion his own standards, experiences and \nbeliefs. Deciding which cases to defend and which to prosecute, which \njudges and proposed changes in the law to support and which to oppose, \nwhere to dedicate limited resources and where to cut back all are tasks \nthat call for objectivity, balance, and leadership.\n  Mr. President, after carefully reviewing all of the facts and \ncircumstances, and after lengthy personal reflection, I am not \nconvinced that John Ashcroft can do the job of Attorney General without \nreturning to his life-long rejection of moderation and conciliation.\n  John Ashcroft proudly judges issues and people on the basis of his \nown strong ideology. Time and again I have seen John Ashcroft show \nhostility and\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\ninsensitivity toward those who disagree with him or who hold ideals and \nvalues that differ from his. He has never hesitated to use his views as \na test to judge others. This uncompromising approach is not what I \nthink our country wants and expects from its leaders.\n  I do not stand in judgment of my former Senate colleague, but I must \nreject his nomination for Attorney General.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I had every intention to once again, as I \nhave done in the past, support the President's choice of Cabinet \nmembers. The President was elected, he selected his team, and his \nchoices should be respected. In the case of former Senator John \nAshcroft's nomination as the U.S. Attorney General, the President's \nchoice will be respected by a majority vote of the Senate. However, if \nI supported the nomination of Senator Ashcroft, my vote may be \nmisunderstood not only by my supporters and constituents, but by many \nothers.\n  It should also be noted that the Constitution reserves to the Senate \nthe power of advice and consent as to the President's nominations. I \nhope that my opposition, together with the opposition of several of my \ncolleagues, will advise the President of our concerns as to his \nnomination of Senator Ashcroft.\n  As a person, my experience in serving with Senator Ashcroft has been \na positive one, but I have found myself on most occasions casting my \nvote in disagreement with Senator Ashcroft. For example, he is for the \ndeath penalty; I am against the death penalty. He supports doing away \nwith abortion; I am for freedom of choice. I have also examined Senator \nAshcroft's record away from Capitol Hill, and I have found that his \nactions have been consistent with the views he held when we were \ncolleagues on the floor of the Senate.\n  Senator Ashcroft's actions in the area of civil rights raise \nquestions as to his commitment to preserving the civil rights of all \nAmericans. As the Governor of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft vetoed bills \ndesigned to ensure the equal treatment of African American voters. As \nthe Attorney General of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft actively obstructed \nthe voluntary desegregation plan for the City of St. Louis.\n  Similarly, Senator Ashcroft's record on reproductive rights causes me \nsome concern. Throughout his political life, Senator Ashcroft has \nbelieved that there is no constitutional right to abortion, and has \nworked to overturn Roe v. Wade by State and Federal legislation and by \nconstitutional amendment. Senator Ashcroft's persistent efforts to \nlimit reproductive rights as Missouri's attorney general and Governor, \nand as a U.S. Senator suggest the policies he might endorse as the U.S. \nAttorney General.\n  I realize that I may be in the minority in my opposition to the death \npenalty, but I have been against execution as a criminal punishment \nsince the start of my political career. For example, I coauthored the \nmeasure in the Territorial Legislature of Hawaii that abolished capital \npunishment, and from that time forward, no convicted criminal in Hawaii \nhas been put to death. Senator Ashcroft does not share my views on this \nsubject. Indeed, as Governor of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft took the \nposition that the death penalty was appropriate for teenagers, and \ndenied that there is any racial disparity in the application of the \ndeath penalty. I do not share these beliefs, and I think that Hawaii's \nexperience with the death penalty points to opposite conclusions.\n  Knowing these and the many other aspects of Senator Ashcroft's record \nthat have come to light in recent days, I have some difficulty seeing \nhim as the next U.S. Attorney General--so much difficulty that I \nbelieve I must exercise my Senatorial right of advice and consent and \ncast my vote in opposition to the nomination to make sure the record is \nclear.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I daresay that each of us has received an \nenormous amount of correspondence about the nomination of Senator John \nAshcroft to be Attorney General of the United States. The favorable \ncorrespondence tends to emphasize support for the Senator's policy \npriorities and appreciation of his reputation for honesty and \nintegrity. The unfavorable correspondence tends to emphasize concern \nabout the Senator's policy priorities and disapproval of the standards \nhe applied, as Senator, to the disposition of Presidential nominations.\n  We must begin by deliberating on the standard to be applied to \nconfirmation decisions. The Constitution merely states that the \nPresident shall appoint public ministers with the ``advice and \nconsent'' of the Senate. This is not a specific standard, nor even a \nmandate to review particular features of a nominee's background or \ncapabilities. Rather, we are enjoined to employ our judgment, a faculty \nwhich--however much we may lament it--focuses on different factors in \nconsidering nominees for different public offices and varies its \napproach in response to the needs of the times. Thus, when it comes to \nour duty to provide advice and consent on cabinet nominations, we are \nplainly in an area where reasonable minds can differ, not only about \nthe criteria, but even about the proper result given particular \ncriteria. No amount of pressure politics--and no slickly packaged \ntalking points--can alter this fundamental fact.\n  I do not subscribe to the view that, barring the taint of criminality \nor dishonesty, the President is entitled to have his nominations \nconfirmed. I do subscribe to the view that law enforcement officials of \ngood will and ability can separate their policy preferences from the \nperformance of their official duties.\n  There is a distinct difference between the role of a Senator as the \ndrafter of laws and the role of the Attorney General as the enforcer of \nlaws. Once Senator Ashcroft places his left hand on the Bible and \nswears to uphold the laws of the United States, he will be required to \nenforce even those laws about which he harbors serious reservations. \nNot only that, but given the fact that John Ashcroft is a deeply \nreligious man, that solemn vow, I am sure, will not be taken lightly by \nhim. Let me quote Senator Ashcroft's own words on that subject: ``As a \nman of faith, I take my word and my integrity seriously,'' he said. \n``So, when I swear to uphold the law, I will keep my oath, so help me \nGod.'' Further, during his confirmation hearings, he stated that he \nunderstands this obligation and fully intends to honor it. For example, \nhe indicated that he ``will vigorously enforce and defend the \nconstitutionality'' of the law barring harassment of patients entering \nabortion clinics, despite any misgivings he might have about that law.\n  I take him at his word. Although, I do not agree with all of Senator \nAshcroft's views, I have no cause to doubt Senator Ashcroft's word or \nhis sincerity regarding his fealty to an oath he will swear before God \nAlmighty. It would be an act of supreme arrogance on my part to doubt \nhis intention to honor such an oath. I will not prejudge him in such a \nmanner.\n  Given Senator Ashcroft's background, the position to which he has \nbeen nominated, and his assurances to the Senate that he will \nfaithfully uphold the laws of the United States, I believe he should be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we prepare to close debate on the \nnomination of our former colleague, Senator John Ashcroft to be the \nAttorney General for the United States, I want to first thank a few \npeople. First, let me thank Senator Leahy, the Ranking Democrat Member \non the Judiciary Committee. He faced a difficult task in organizing the \nhearing for this nomination and working for a fair process. I want to \nexpress my gratitude to him and commend his staff, including the \nMinority Chief Counsel, Bruce Cohen, Senator Leahy's General Counsel, \nBeryl Howell, Mary DeOreo, Natalie Carter, and others.\n  I would also like to thank the other members of the committee for \ntheir diligence regarding this matter. In particular let me thank \nSenator Kyl who has been a tremendous advocate in the effort supporting \nthis nomination, and let me also mention Senator Sessions for his hard \nwork in behalf of the nomination.\n  I also want to commend those Senators on the other side of the aisle, \nwho despite intense pressure from and relentless lobbying by a number \nof left-wing groups have stood up for what they believed was right and \nannounced their support for this nominee. I especially want to express \nto my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Feingold, how much \nmy respect for\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nhim has grown watching him speak in support of and cast his vote for \nJohn Ashcroft. I know that he has been targeted by petitions and email \ncampaigns orchestrated by People for the American Way and others to \npressure him, but he has not buckled, and I congratulate him for his \ncourage to take a principled stand.\n  I would also like to thank the Administration and Transition staff \nwho worked on this matter. And let me also thank my Committee staff who \nworked literally around the clock to assist me and my colleagues in \nmoving this nomination forward. I believe everyone on the committee \nstaff has worked tirelessly, but let me especially recognize the \nCommittee's Chief Counsel, Sharon Prost, the Committee's Staff \nDirector, Makan Delrahim, our fine and able counsels, Shawn Bentley, \nStephen Higgins, Ed Haden, Rhett DeHart, Gary Malphrus, Rita Lari, Lee \nOtis, Neomi Rao, Rene Augustine, Pat O'Brien, Larry Block, Alex Dahl, \nJeff Taylor, Leah Belaire, and John Kennedy, and our valued staff \nmembers, Amy Haywood, Kent Cook, Jessica Caseman, Swen Prior, and Jared \nGarner, and of course our most able press staff, who kept us informed \nof the smear campaigns, Jeanne Lopatto and Margarita Tapia. They \nall worked together as a team with numerous others, including Senator \nGramm's staff, Senator Bond's staff, as well as the able staff of the \nSenate Leadership, particularly Dave Hoppe and Robert Wilkie of Senator \nLott's staff and Stewart Verdery of Senator Nickles' staff.\n\n  Now let me turn to the nomination itself. Mr. President, I believe we \nare about to confirm one of the most qualified candidates for the \noffice of Attorney General that we have ever had. John Ashcroft has \nsuperb credentials, and he is well-prepared to be Attorney General. In \naddition to graduating from one of our finest law schools, here is a \nman who has almost 30 years of public service to this country--eight \nyears as attorney general of his state of Missouri, during which time \nhe was elected by his peers, the 50 state attorneys general, Democrats \nand Republicans, to become the president of the National Association of \nAttorneys General. Then he was twice elected governor of Missouri, and \nagain elected by his peers, the 50 state governors, to head the \nNational Governors Association. And then he was elected by Missourians \nto serve with us here in the United States Senate, where we all came to \nrespect him for his work ethic and his integrity.\n  As a matter of fact, I don't know of one Senator in the whole United \nStates Senate who would disagree with the statement that this is an \nhonorable man of integrity. When he says he'll do something, he'll do \nit. I don't know anybody, who, knowing his record and his life, who \nwould conclude that John Ashcroft is anything but one of the finest \npeople they've every met.\n  But during this process, I think that we have seen some attempts here \nto undermine a truly good man. Some things have been done throughout \nthis process that were outside the bounds of policy debate, beyond what \nis decent and right. In the zeal to take a political stand against this \nnominee for whatever reason, I believe there have been numerous \ncharges, innuendos, and distortions that were neither fair nor \naccurate. I have tried to help rebut these charges, but they ought not \nto have been made.\n  Despite these attacks, I do not believe this good man, this man of \ndeep faith and conviction, will take offense or hold grudges. I believe \nhe will do what he has promised to do. He will be inclusive, \nforthright, and he will follow the law. He will be an Attorney General \nfor all the people and be an Attorney General of whom we can all be \nproud. I know he will because I know John Ashcroft, as most of us do. I \nknow he is well-prepared. And I know when he promises to discharge his \nduties faithfully, to uphold the law and Constitution, enlisting the \nhelp and witness of God to do so, he means it, and he will do it.\n  I look forward to working with him to help make our nation safer, \nmore just, and more in line with our founding principles, embodied in \nour Constitution. His job is largely about making our nation more safe \nand free. I am glad we will have an Attorney General who will work \ntoward that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Have the yeas and \nnays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask for the yeas and nays on this vote after my closing \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. One other inquiry: Has all time been used except for the \ntime reserved for the majority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to begin by assuring all of my \ncolleagues that I will not use the entire 15 minutes, so we can begin \nthe vote hopefully 5 or 10 minutes early. Senators need to be aware of \nthat so they can come and begin the vote within the next 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this nomination has not been an easy one for the \nSenate Judiciary Committee or the Senate to deal with without some \ndifficulty. You can argue about why that is. But we have come to it, \nand now we are ready to vote.\n  Only nine times in our history has the Senate defeated one of the \nPresident's nominees for his Cabinet and only once since 1959. When I \nwas a new Senator in 1989, I observed what I thought was a terrible \nmiscarriage of justice against former Senator John Tower. John Tower \nshould have been Secretary of Defense. I was really disappointed in how \nhe was savaged and how some of his colleagues in this body treated him.\n  Only one time in 40 years have we not confirmed the President's \nnomination for a Cabinet position, and that, I am convinced, was a \nterrible mistake.\n  Today we will confirm former Senator John Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral. That is as it should be.\n  I have been disappointed by this nomination's process through the \nJudiciary Committee, and to a degree here, although less so on the \nfloor of the Senate. I thought the rhetoric got too hot. It did get \ninto the range of being unfair. But I don't think we should let that \npermanently alter the atmosphere we have tried to set in the Senate.\n  I have tried to get through some items that would allow us to move \nforward in a positive vein.\n  I think congratulations also would be in order, and certainly a word \nof appreciation for the leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle. \nSenator Daschle has tried to help get us through this nomination. He \nmade it clear that he would not participate in a filibuster. I do not \nrecall in the 30- something years I have been watching the Senate very \nclosely a Cabinet nomination being filibustered. It would be a terrible \nprecedent. He spoke out, saying he wouldn't do it, that he wouldn't \nsupport it. To those who said we shouldn't have a filibuster, I say \nthank you for that.\n  There will be those who will speak out about what this vote means, if \nit is not 60 votes, or if it is 69 over 61, or whatever it may be. I \nthink that will be a futile waste of time. I don't think we should read \nanything into it. This nominee is going to be confirmed, and he should \nbe. The President of the United States, George W. Bush, is entitled to \nhave his selection to be Attorney General.\n\n  I want to say also that I know John Ashcroft. I know him as a man. I \nknew him as a Senator. I knew him as a close personal friend, and I \nknew him as a member of the Singing Senators as we sang all across this \ncountry together. I have been in his home. I know his wife. I know his \nchildren. I know his constituents. I have been all over Missouri. He \nhas been in my home. He knows my friends, and we have been together in \nmany instances. I don't know this person who has been described in some \nof the debate; some of these allegations about things he did, or didn't \ndo, or whether or not he is a man of his word. I do not know that \nperson. I\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nknow John Ashcroft. I know the man who served in this Chamber. I know \nhis abilities, his education, and his qualifications. I don't think \nthere has ever been a more qualified person by background, education, \nand experience to be Attorney General than John Ashcroft.\n  I remember 8 years ago, when I voted to confirm the previous Attorney \nGeneral, thinking that this nominee was not qualified, and I think she \nproved it. But I voted for her because I thought President Clinton was \nentitled to his nominee at that point.\n  So we have a man who is qualified. But it is more than that. John \nAshcroft is a good man of high veracity and who will keep his word.\n  Senator Byrd said yesterday, I believe, in his speech that he has \nmade a commitment he is going to uphold the law. What more should we \nwant: A pound of flesh?\n  I realize this is all about other things. That is OK. But it is \nunfair to this man.\n  Maybe the ravens will be heard never more. But forevermore you can \nquote me on this and remind me on this. John Ashcroft will go on to be \none of the best Attorneys General we have ever had. He will be \nconscientious. He will show capability. He will be sensitive. He will \nbe honest. He will enforce the laws--some laws that have been ignored \nthe last 8 years--and maybe there are some people who are a little \nnervous about that. But, as we say in all kinds of different circles in \nAmerica, I am here to vouch for their man. I vouch for John Ashcroft. I \nwill stand by him. And you mark my words, he will go on to be a great \nand valuable Attorney General.\n  So let's move on. Let's work together, as I know we can do.\n  I accept the olive branch extended by Senator Russ Feingold. That is \nwhat he said. I extend the olive branch to show a willingness to work \ntogether and reach across the aisle and across all the other things \nthat could divide us. He showed courage. I will not forget it. In fact, \nI think I maybe didn't forget it in advance because we have already \nworked out an agreement on how we are going to bring up a bill about \nwhich he cares a lot.\n  But that was an important statement on his part. I accept it. We \naccept it. That is the way we should proceed.\n  This new President has changed the tone in this city. Absolutely, \npeople are astounded by his willingness to reach out and to listen and \nto be heard. He is meeting with everybody. He has even seen motion \npictures with them. So he is doing his part. Let us make sure the \nSenate does its part.\n  Vote for John Ashcroft. You won't regret it. Then let's move on to \nimportant legislation. Let's argue about ideas. Let's argue about how \nto make education better. Let's argue about how to give tax relief--\n``return to sender,'' as the Senator from Georgia said. That is what \nthe people want us to talk about. They want to get this vicious and \npartisan stuff behind us and deal with real issues. I don't think \ninsurmountable damage has been done. I believe we can build on the \nother things we have done in the last month.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Does the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of John Ashcroft of Missouri to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States?

Mr. President, today I want to speak about an important \nissue for the taxpayers of this\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\ncountry. The government's strongest and most effective tool against \nfraud is called the False Claims Act. In recent years, the False Claims \nAct has been under attack from industries targeted by the government's \nanti-fraud efforts. Since 1986, when Congress passed amendments that I \nsponsored to toughen the law than $4 billion has been recovered through \nthe False Claims Act. Hundreds of billions more in fraud have been \nsaved through the deterrent effect that this law has upon those who \nwould betray the public's interest.\n  In addition to the recovery of money and the deterrent effect of this \nlaw, the False Claims Act is important for another, perhaps, more \nimportant reason. The fact is that the False Claims Act is being used, \nday after day, by prosecutors to maintain the integrity of countless \nfederal programs funded by American taxpayers. For example, the False \nClaims Act is being used in the health care industry to ensure that \nnursing home residents receive quality care.\n  Included in the anti-fraud arsenal of the False Claims Act is a \nprovision called qui tam. Qui tam is a concept that dates back to \nfeudal times. It allows private citizens who know of fraud against the \ntaxpayers to bring a lawsuit against the perpetrators. In other words, \nthe citizen acts as a partner with the government. As an incentive, the \ncitizen shares in any monetary recovery to the U.S. Treasury. Over the \ndecades, the False Claims Act, and especially the qui tam provisions, \nproved to be effective, both in catching and deterring fraud.\n  In considering the nomination of my former colleague, Senator John \nAshcroft, for the position of Attorney General of the United States, I \nasked about his support for False Claims Act and the qui tam \nprovisions. Senator Ashcroft's January 31, 2001 letter assures me that \nhe will not support efforts to weaken the Act, and will support efforts \nto strengthen it. This pledge of support will ensure that the \nDepartment of Justice plays the critical and necessary role of \ntargeting government waste and abuse. Senator Ashcroft assures that he \nwill support ``vigorous enforcement of the law'' and ``will defend the \nconstitutionality of the Act.'' I appreciate Senator Ashcroft's support \nfor the False Claims Act. He is a man who is dedicated to enforcing the \nlaws of this country and understands the importance of the False Claims \nAct.\n  All in all the history of the assault on the False Claims Act sends \nus on a long and winding road. The False Claims Act is, and will \nremain, a target of those industries and accept billions and billions \nof taxpayer dollars annually and balk at strict accountability. I ask \nonly that we, as legislators, remember the historical and current \nassaults made upon the False Claims Act. I ask further that we agree to \nbe strong despite the strength of an industry, simply because it is the \n`right'' thing to do. Taxpayers deserve no less--and as legislators, we \nshould deliver no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the January 31, 2001 letter I received \nfrom Senator Ashcroft be considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter of January \n     30, 2001, concerning the qui tam provisions of the False \n     Claims Act. I believe that the False Claims Act and the qui \n     tam provision in particular are vital tools in combating \n     government fraud and abuse. I fully support vigorous \n     enforcement of the law.\n       Tackling government fraud and abuse through the False \n     Claims Act will be an important priority for the Justice \n     Department. Indeed, I expect that the sustained efforts of \n     the Justice Department will in some respects lessen the need \n     for (but not the importance of) private attorneys general \n     acting pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the Act. I can \n     also assure you that I will defend the constitutionality of \n     the Act, like all Acts of Congress, if it is challenged in \n     the courts.\n       Finally, I assure you that I will not support efforts to \n     weaken the Act, and indeed, will support efforts to \n     strengthen the Act and ensure that the Justice Department \n     plays a critical role in targeting government waste and \n     abuse.\n       I look forward to working with you on these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Ashcroft.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1009-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RETIREMENT OF HERSCHEL CUTLER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nretirement of Dr. Herschel Cutler from the Institute of Scrap Recycling \nIndustries, ISRI. Dr. Cutler, ISRI's former Executive Director, spent \nthe last 33 years of his life teaching the Nation, including the \nCongress, about the environmental and economic benefits of recycling. \nIn the course of his tenure, ISRI has become a highly respected trade \nassociation known for its dedication to both environmental protection \nand private sector entrepreneurialism. He had a wonderful knack for \nhiring extraordinary staff. And, by example, Herschel taught them to do \ntheir homework, acquire a deep understanding of their issues, keep \ntheir standards high, develop reasonable solutions to problems and, \nwith regard to public policy, to never overreach.\n  Herschel Cutler is not an Arkansan. But, shortly after my first \nelection to serve as a member of the other body, I met him over dinner \nthrough fellow Arkansans whose family recycling business was an ISRI \nmember company. During that dinner Herschel gave me a succinct but \nthorough description of a serious dilemma facing the scrap recycling \nindustry and its possible resolution. After listening to him discuss \nthe concerns facing the many families in the recycling industry, \nincluding many Arkansas families, it was easy for me, a farmer's \ndaughter, to identify with a key concern facing them. That is, certain \ngovernment policies were, inadvertently, having the effect of causing \nmany recycling families to wonder whether they should remain with their \nbusinesses.\n  That dinner was the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship \nbetween me, Dr. Cutler, and the entire scrap recycling industry. \nHerschel Cutler's earnest integrity convinced me that the recyclers' \ncause was worth fighting for. I began that fight in 1993. It ended in \n1999, after I teamed up with Senators Daschle and Lott, Baucus, and \nChafee to amend the Superfund law to correct a mistake directed at \nrecyclers that nobody had intended.\n  Dr. Herschel Cutler and I have been fast friends ever since. As he \nretires on January 31, 2001, I cannot thank him enough for his guidance \nand his counsel to me over the years since we first met. He is truly a \nmodest man of great wisdom, integrity and intellect. Upon his \nretirement the Washington association community is much the poorer. And \nwith his counsel absent from the daily give and take of public policy \ndiscussions in the Congress, so are all of his many friends in both \nhouses.\n  Herschel, I wish you the best fishing, reading, writing, and teaching \nin your retirement. I'm sure your legions of friends would agree, your \nfriendship has been a blessing to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1009-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1009-S1010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL TIMOTHY P. MALISHENKO, USAF\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMajor General Timothy P. Malishenko, USAF, upon his retirement from the \nUnited States Air Force after more than 32 years of distinguished and \ndedicated service to our Nation.\n  A son of Ohio, Tim Malishenko grew up not far from my Greene County \nneighborhood, where his mom and dad were customers of my family's seed, \ngrain, and lumber business. After graduating from Fairborn High School, \nhe went on to The Ohio State University, where he earned a degree in \nbusiness and honors as a distinguished ROTC graduate. This marked the \nbeginning of what developed into an extraordinary Air Force career, in \nwhich Tim rose to the pinnacle of the complex and demanding world of \nDefense acquisition.\n  As a young officer, Tim Malishenko served in a variety of contracting \nand contract-administration assignments related to major programs, \nincluding the Polaris and Poseidon missiles and the F-15 Radar. His \norganizational and crisis-management skills came to the fore during the \n1974 oil embargo, when, as a charter member of the Air Force Energy \nManagement Division, he\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nworked tirelessly to mitigate the effects of the supply disruption and \nsafeguard America's military readiness.\n  From there, Tim went on to work in classified space and satellite \nprograms. He graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College, and, with \nfamily in tow, headed for Brunssum, The Netherlands, where he was chief \nof contracting and acquisition for the NATO Airborne Early Warning and \nControl Programme Management Agency. In the NATO assignment, Tim \ndemonstrated remarkable tact and diplomacy in reconciling the diverse \nviews and priorities of 13 countries.\n  Returning stateside in 1982, Tim again served in a variety of \ncontracting and contract-administration positions, including high-level \nmanagement assignments at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and at \nAir Force headquarters in Washington, DC. Of particular note during \nthis period was his extensive involvement in the research-and-\ndevelopment contracting for the advanced tactical fighter, integrated \navionics, and high-speed integrated circuitry--programs that set the \nstage for the information technologies and advanced avionics we know \ntoday.\n  Four years ago, General Malishenko was named commander of the Defense \nContract Management Command, an organization of more than 14,000 people \nresponsible for the management of 375,000 contracts cumulatively valued \nat $100 billion. As commander, he was the standard bearer for a \nrevolution in business affairs that led to the conversion of more than \n300 business sectors to ISO 9000, to dramatic advances in paperless \ncontracting, and to the design and introduction of the DoD standard \nprocurement system.\n  The capstone of Tim's military career came on March 27, 2000, when he \nbecame the first director of the Defense Contract Management Agency \n(DCMA), the position he holds at the time of his retirement. In \nsuccessfully spearheading the establishment of DCMA, Major General \nMalishenko brought to fruition a recommendation put forth in 1963 by \nSecretary of Defense Robert McNamara's Project 60, which called for the \neventual creation of a separate Defense agency responsible for contract \nmanagement.\n  Under the general's direction, DCMA has emerged as a Combat Support \nAgency--one that has markedly transformed contractor battlefield \nsupport, as fully evidenced by DCMA's role in facilitating optimal \nsupport to our troops in Bosnia and Kosovo. He also left an indelible \nmark on DoD's continuing Revolution in Business Affairs, ushering DoD \ninto an era of paperless contracting and electronic business processes. \nThe inception of DCMA is a living testimonial to Tim Malishenko's \nexemplary leadership, professionalism, and unbounded energy.

On the occasion of his retirement from \nthe Air Force, I offer my congratulations and thanks to this esteemed \nson of the Buckeye state, and wish him and his wife, Jane, well in \ntheir future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1010-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF DEBRA L.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. \nDebra Ferland, who is being installed as the president of the Women's \nCouncil of the National Association of Home Builders on February 11, \n2001 in Atlanta, Georgia. I would like to thank her for her twenty-\nthree years of work, and honor her for her achievements within the \nhousing industry.\n  After graduating from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, \nDebra began her long and admirable career by working for several \nprominent national property management firms, including Picerne \nProperties, First Realty Management, and Diversified Properties. She \nhas been a Construction Manager at HUD approved rehabs, consulted for \nrent supplement and Section 8 programs, and is currently Director of \nSpecial Projects at the Ferland Corporation.\n  Debra has taken an active role in the industry on both a state and \nnational level by assuming numerous leadership roles, including local \nCouncil President, Membership Chair, and National Convention Chairman. \nShe has been appointed as a member of both the Labor Shortage Task \nForce and the National Association of Home Builders Capital Club, and \nis the Women's Council Life Director.\n  In addition to her tremendous career achievements, Debra has devoted \nherself to family, including her husband A.

MARTINEZ, COMMISSIONER OF THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to salute my fellow New \nMexican, Eluid L. Martinez, who has just finished a remarkable five-\nyear term as Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. As the \nfirst Commissioner to serve in two different centuries, Mr. Martinez \nassumed control over the nation's second largest wholesale water \nsupplier and hydroelectric producer in the country when he was \nappointed by the President in 1995.\n  A native of Cordova in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, Commissioner \nMartinez was the first member of his family to receive a college \ndegree. He holds an undergraduate degree in civil engineering from New \nMexico State University and is a licensed Professional Engineer and \nLand Surveyor.\n  During his tenure Commissioner Martinez has been recognized by many \nReclamation stakeholders for his evenhanded approach in addressing \nwestern water and power issues. He received the Statesman of the Year \naward by the National Water Resources Association in November, 2000, \nfor his diligence in helping solve the chronic water shortages in the \nwestern United States. He has been responsible for implementing the \nBureau of Reclamation transition to a water resources agency with \nresponsibilities for delivering project benefits while balancing the \nconflicting demands of Reclamation's constituencies.\n  Commissioner Martinez' professionalism and expertise in his field has \ngained him the respect of all members of Congress who have worked with \nhim.\n  Commissioner Martinez has been a leader in privatizing Reclamation \nprojects wherever possible, returning projects to the users who paid \nfor them. He has been an important factor in implementing legislatively \nmandated environmental requirements, and trying to stretch a finite \nsupply of water to an ever thirsty West. Commissioner Martinez has \nendeavored to create a more diverse workforce to ensure a future supply \nof capable individuals for the Federal government. In fact, preparing \nfor the future is one of Commissioner Martinez's hallmarks of \nachievement.\n  Before entering Federal service, Eluid Martinez retired as the State \nEngineer for New Mexico. He has served as Secretary of the New Mexico \nInterstate Stream Commission, as the New Mexico Commissioner to six \nInterstate Compact Commissions, and as a member of the New Mexico Water \nQuality Commission. He has held executive positions in 12 regional and \nnational water associations, but, as the parent of three children, took \nthe time to run for and serve as President of the City of Santa Fe \nSchool Board.\n  Filling many positions over a 27 year career in the State Engineer's \noffice, Eluid Martinez developed many skills that served him well as \nCommissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. His service in New Mexico \nstarted with the State Highway Department in 1968 and subsequently in \nthe State Engineer's Office included positions as Chief of the \nHydrographic Survey Section, Acting\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nChief of the Administrative Services Division, Acting Chief of the \nWater Use and Planning Section, Chief of the Technical Division, \nprincipal Hearing Examiner for the State Engineer, and ultimately State \nEngineer from 1990 to 1994.\n  I am proud to count as a friend such a hardworking fellow native of \nNew Mexico, who has made the most of his opportunities. Eluid Martinez \nhas performed a valuable service to the Nation and especially to the \npeople of the West in both his state and Federal positions.\n  In addition to his extensive administrative abilities Mr. Martinez \nhails from a rich heritage of nine generations of woodcarvers, or \nsanteros. He is the nephew of internationally famous Santero Woodcarver \nand sculptor George Lopez of Cordova.\n  Eluid himself is also a quite talented artist and I was very honored \nto have received several of his beautiful drawings. The fact that \nEluid's sculptures, lithographs, and prints reside in the permanent \ncollections of the Smithsonian Institution's American Art Museum, the \nColorado Springs Fine Arts Center, the Denver Art Museum and other \nmajor collections adds to and broadens his legacy to the United States \nand his home state of New Mexico.\n  Eluid will be a tough act to follow and I hope that his successor \nwill have an understanding of western water issues and will continue \nworking to achieve a balance between New Mexico's many competing \ninterests.\n  I know that as he leaves the demanding job of Commissioner, Eluid and \nhis wife, Suzanne, are looking forward to spending more time in our \nbeautiful home state of New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1011-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THOMAS C. RYAN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a \nman of true courage, a man of boundless compassion, and a man of great \ncharacter. Today, I rise to pay tribute to fellow Rutland, Vermont \nresident and friend to many, Tom Ryan.\n  Tom was born October 14, 1930, the son of Charles F. and Mary Ryan. \nHe graduated from Mt. St. Joseph Academy in 1948, from Georgetown \nUniversity, Magna Cum Laude, in 1952 and the Wharton School of Business \nMBA program in 1955.\n  Bound by a sense of duty and service to country, Tom courageously \nserved as a captain in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, and \nlater continued his service in the Reserves.\n  Tom was a skilled banker and a businessman, yet he was always more \nfocused on people than on profit. In his eloquent eulogy, Stephen K. \nRyan called his father, Tom a ``leader,'' and I can't think of a more \ndedicated community leader than Tom. He served on numerous boards, \nincluding: the Vermont Achievement Center; Vermont Children's Aid \nSociety; Small Business Investment Corp.; Economic Development Council \nfor Southwestern Vermont; Vermont Development Credit Corp.; Vermont \nBankers Association; Rotary Club; Rutland Downtown Development Corp.; \nRutland County Solid Waste; United Way; Paramount Theatre; Rutland West \nNeighborhood Housing; and College of St. Joseph. I worked together with \nTom in the effort to restore the Paramount Theatre to its original \ngrandeur, and I'm so glad he was able to witness the fruits of his \nlabor and the recent revitalization of our historic downtown.\n  Stephen mentioned that Tom was ``proudest of the twelve years he \nserved on the board of Rutland Hospital; bringing a better standard of \ncare to the Rutland Region.'' As Chairman of the Senate Health \nCommittee, I know that health care is one of the most important issues \nfacing our country today, and I have enormous respect for those \nindividuals working hard on the local level to improve the lives of \npatients and their families.\n  Stephen stated that Tom ``was involved in politics, but he was not \npolitical.'' He ran for lieutenant governor in 1982, state senate in \n1990, and was appointed to the state transportation board in 1991. In \nevery political endeavor, Tom was passionate but respectful, tough but \ncivil.\n  My wife, Liz, knew Tom's lovely wife, Mary, through their mutual \ninterest in quilting. Liz used to tell me how Tom was an avid gardener, \nconstantly improving the landscape surrounding their house and tending \nto his gardens. He loved his gardens so much, in fact, that family and \nfriends were known to give him rocks for his birthday!\n  But Liz and I both know that his greatest love was for Mary and their \nwonderful children, Stephen of Reston, Virginia, Kate Ryan Whittum of \nIntervale, New Hampshire, and Maura C. Ryan of Portland, Maine. He had \nhis priorities in line and was always there for his loved ones.\n  The editorial in the Rutland Daily Herald on December 18th, stated, \n``If any single word were appropriate for Tom Ryan, it would be \n'kindness.''' For me, it would be hard to describe Tom in one word, for \nhe exemplified so many qualities for so many people. You will be \ngreatly missed, Tom, but your legacy will live on in our hearts, our \nminds and your work that we will strive to continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1011-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO BERNARD R. DICK\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay \ntribute to Bernard R. Dick, a distinguished citizen of my hometown, \nRutland, Vermont, and a man who I have deeply respected and admired my \nentire life. I thought highly of Bernie's talent as a lawyer, respected \nimmensely his service to his country, and admired his devotion to \nfamily and community.\n  I ask that The Rutland Daily Herald editorial from January 8, 2001, \nbe included in the record as part of this tribute:\n\n       The death of Bernard R. Dick this past weekend marks the \n     end of another distinguished and longtime Rutland legal \n     career. Only recently came the deaths of two other local \n     attorneys of note--Bartley J. Costello and Thomas Ryan.\n       Bernie Dick, born in 1909 to a Rutland family, was a whiz \n     at baseball at Rutland High School, where he made his mark as \n     varsity catcher. It was a role he remembered long after he \n     reached adulthood, and for years he could be seen in the \n     audience when the RHS baseball team played home games.\n       His education was quite varied. After graduating from \n     Rutland High he went to the University of Alabama. After \n     college graduation in 1931 he studied law at New York \n     University. He was admitted to the bar in Vermont in 1937.\n       As with many young men of his time, Bernie Dick was swept \n     up in the swirl of World War II. Eventually, after Pearl \n     Harbor, he enlisted in the Army as a private in November \n     1942. Because of his law degree he was stationed in Hawaii, \n     where by 1946 he had reached the rank of captain.\n       In Hawaii he became chief of the claims division of the \n     central Pacific area, and for his work received the `Army \n     Commendation Ribbon.' The citation said, in part: `He \n     reviewed and made recommendations for the payment, \n     disallowance or collection of almost 1,000 claims. So expert \n     were his decisions that no claim reviewed by him and \n     subsequently appealed has been reversed. He demonstrated a \n     high degree of professional skill and efficiency.'\n       After his honorable discharge in 1946, Dick returned to \n     Rutland and resumed his practice in the law firm of Bove, \n     Billado and Dick. It was an active law firm in many fields, \n     including politics. The senior partner, Peter A. Bove, was an \n     active supporter of Gov. Ernest W. Gibson and U.S. Sen. \n     George D. Aiken. Francis Billado ultimately went to the \n     Legislature and was elected Vermont adjutant general, a post \n     he held until his death.\n       In legal practice Dick was the one who kept to the daily \n     grind, but the three partners shared ownership with some \n     Castleton people to run a popular summer dance hall at \n     Bomoseen and the Crystal Beach facility on Lake Bomoseen, \n     among several enterprises.\n       In 1947 Dick was named judge of the Rutland Municipal \n     Court, in line with the policy of Governor Gibson, himself a \n     veteran, to name veterans to public posts. The municipal \n     court system preceded the present system of district courts, \n     and there was political guessing as to who would be named by \n     the governor. His Army experience served him well, and Dick \n     served four years.\n       After the departure of Bove and Billado to other jobs, \n     Bernie Dick ran his own practice for a while, and in 1949 \n     formed a new legal association with Donald A. Hackel and \n     Richard A. Hull. It was the latest step in a long and varied \n     Rutland legal career.\n\n  Bernie, you will be sorely missed by all those who knew you, and by \nan entire community who benefitted from your knowledge, hard work and \nmany talents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1011-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1011-S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO BARTLEY J. COSTELLO\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise today to pay tribute to a great Vermonter \nand a native son from my hometown of Rutland, Bartley J. Costello.\n  Bart will be remembered by all who knew him for his commitment to\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nchurch and family, dedication to community and country, and generosity \nto his fellow man. A lifelong resident of Rutland, he gave much of \nhimself to our great city, through charities, community organizations \nand Christ the King Church.\n  Bart was educated at Holy Innocents Primary School, Mount St. Joseph \nAcademy, the University of Vermont and Albany Law School. His first job \nwas as a teacher at the Muddy Brook School in Williston. He returned to \nRutland to work at Howe Scale Co. and served as the assistant Rutland \nCity Treasurer before joining the U.S. Army Air Corps and serving his \ncountry in World War II. He reached the rank of Captain before being \ndischarged at the end of the war and returning home to Rutland.\n  A lawyer in Rutland for forty years with the firm of Webber and \nCostello, later Webber, Costello and Chapman, Bart was a distinguished \nmember of the Bar, deeply respected and admired by my father, Chief \nJustice of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n  Bart was an excellent trial lawyer and a match for the best. And he \nhad a wonderful sense of humor. Bart loved to tell the story of a jury \nselection when an aunt of his on the panel remained silent when the \nopposing attorney asked if any of the jurors knew Mr. Costello. Later, \nafter excusing his aunt for obvious reasons, Bart asked her why she had \nkept quiet. ``Well,'' she said, ``I felt you would need all the help \nyou could get.''\n  I also knew him as an avid golfer and consummate sportsman. He and \nhis lovely wife, Catherine, who survives him, were the perfect golfing \ncouple, courteous and competitive, fun-loving and intense.\n  Bart, as well as Catherine, were blessed with four outstanding sons, \nBartley III and Thomas, who are trial lawyers in Albany, NY and \nBrattleboro, Brian, an award winning school teacher in Rutland, and \nBarry, a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy, currently with the Pentagon \nstaff.\n  He served his community on many boards and organizations. He was a \npast Grand Knight at the Knights of Columbus, President of Vermont \nState Holy Name Society, Rutland Chamber of Commerce, Rutland Country \nClub and Rutland Regional Medical Center. He was elected to and served \non the board of directors of Marble Savings Bank and the Rutland City \nSchool Board.\n  The Rutland Daily Herald had high praise for Bart, stating that he, \n``. . . left lasting marks for good on [his] native city.'' He was a \nman who loved life and was loved by all who knew him. We won't forget \nyou, Bart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1012-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/01/senate-section/article/S1012-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-552.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe excise tax on telephone and other communications services; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Breaux \nand others, to introduce a bill to repeal the\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\ntelephone excise tax--the Help Eliminate the Levy on Locution Act known \nas the HELLO Act. The telephone excise tax is a tax that is outdated, \nunfair, and complex for both consumers to understand and for the phone \ncompanies to administer. It cannot be justified on any tax policy \ngrounds.\n  Mr. President, the federal government has had the American consumer \non ``hold'' for too long when it comes to this tax. The telephone \nexcise tax has been around for over 102 years. In fact, it was first \nimposed in 1898--just 22 years after the telephone itself was invented. \nSo quickly was it imposed that it almost seems that Uncle Sam was there \nto collect it before Alexander Graham Bell could put down the receiver \nfrom the first call. In fact, the tax is so old that Bell himself would \nhave paid it!\n  This tax on talking--as it is known--currently stands at 3 percent. \nToday, about 94 percent of all American families have telephone \nservice. This means that virtually every family in the United States \nmust tack an additional 3 percent on to their monthly phone bill. The \nfederal tax applies to local phone service; it applies to long distance \nservice; and it even applies in some cases to the extra amounts paid \nfor state and local taxes. It is estimated that this tax costs the \nAmerican public more than $5 billion per year.\n  The telephone excise tax is a classic story of a tax that has been \nsevered from its original justifications, but lives on solely to \ncollect money.\n  In truth, the Federal phone tax has had more legislative lives than a \ncat. When the tax was originally imposed, Teddy Roosevelt was leading \nthe Rough Riders up San Juan Hill. At that time, it was billed as a \nluxury tax, as only a small portion of the American public even had \ntelephones. The tax was repealed in the early 20th century, but then \nwas reinstated at the beginning of World War I. It was repealed and \nreinstated a few more times until 1941, when it was made permanent to \nraise money for World War II. In the mid-60s, Congress scheduled the \nelimination of the phone tax, which had reached levels of 10 and 25 \npercent. But once again, the demands of war intervened, as the \nelimination of the tax was delayed to help pay for Vietnam. In 1973, \nthe phone tax began to phase-out, but one year before it was about to \nbe eliminated, it rose up yet again--this time justified by the \nrationale of deficit reduction--and has remained with us ever since.\n  This tax is a perfect example of why we must stop needlessly \ncollecting the taxpayer's money--it does not pass any of the \ntraditional criteria used for evaluating tax policy. First, this phone \ntax is outmoded. Once upon a time, it could have been argued that \ntelephone service was a luxury item and that only the rich would be \naffected. As we all know, there is nothing further from the truth \ntoday.\n  Second, the federal phone tax is unfair. Because this tax is a flat 3 \npercent, it applies disproportionately to low and middle income people. \nFor example, studies show that an American family making less than \n$50,000 per year spends at least 2 percent of its income on telephone \nservice. A family earning less than $10,000 per year spendings over 9 \npercent of its income on telephone service. Imposing a tax on those \nfamilies for a service that is a necessity in a modern society is \nsimply not fair.\n  Third, the federal phone tax is complex. Once upon a time, phone \nservice was simple--there was one company who provided it. It was an \neasy tax to administer. Now, however, phone service is intertwined with \ndata services and Internet access, and it brings about a whole new set \nof complexities. For instance, a common way to provide high speed \nInternet access is through a digital subscriber line. This line allows \na user to have simultaneous access to the Internet and to telephone \ncommunications. How should it be taxed? Should the tax be apportioned? \nShould the whole line be tax free? And what will we do when cable, \nwireless, and satellite companies provide voice and data communications \nover the same system? The burdensome complexity of today will only \nbecome more difficult tomorrow.\n  As these questions are answered, we run the risk of distorting the \nmarket by favoring certain technologies. There are already numerous \nexceptions and carve-outs to the phone tax. For instance, private \ncommunications services are exempt from the tax. That allows large, \nsophisticated companies to establish communications networks and avoid \npaying any federal phone tax. It goes without saying that American \nfamilies do not have that same option.\n  Speaking of complexity, let me ask if anyone has taken a look at \ntheir most recent phone bill. It is a labyrinth of taxes and fees piled \none on top of another. We may not be able to figure out what all the \nfees are for; but we do know that they add a big chunk to our phone \nbill. According to a recent study, the mean tax rate across the country \non telecommunications is slightly over 18 percent. That is about a 6 \npercent rise in the last 10 years. I can't control the state and local \ntaxes that have been imposed, but I can do my part with respect to the \nfederal taxes. I seek to remove this burden from the citizens of my \nstate--and all Americans across the country.\n  As members of Congress, we need to make sure that our tax policies do \nnot stifle that economic expansion. We should not adhere to policies \nthat are a relic from a different time. In today's economy, the \narguments for repeal are even stronger.\n  Mr. President, it is time to end the federal phone tax. For too long \nwhile America has been listening to a dial tone, Washington has been \nhearing a dollar tone. This tax is outmoded. Why are we taxing a poor \nfamily's phone with a tax that was originally meant for luxury items. \nMr. President, it is time we hung up the phone tax once and for all. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting its repeal, and help all \nAmericans to say ``Hello.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \nfeasibility studies on water optimization in the Burnt River basin. \nMalheur River basin, Owyhee River basin, and Powder River Basin, \nOregon; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation that \nwill allow the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on \nways to improve water management in the Malheur, Owyhee, Powder and \nBurnt River basins in northeastern Oregon. An earlier study by the \nBureau identified a number of problems on these four Snake River \ntributaries, including high water temperatures and degraded habitat.\n  These types of problems are not unique to these rivers; in fact, many\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\nrivers in the Pacific Northwest are in a similar condition. However, \nOregon has a unique approach to solving these problems through the work \nof Watershed Councils. In these Councils, local farmers, ranchers and \nother stakeholders sit down together with the resource agencies to \ndevelop action plans to solve local problems.\n  The Council members have the local knowledge of the land and waters, \nbut they don't have technical expertise. The Bureau of Reclamation has \nthe expertise to collect the kinds of water flow and water quality data \nthat are needed to understand how the watershed works and how effective \ndifferent solutions might be.\n  One class of possible solutions includes small-scale construction \nprojects, such as upgrading of irrigation systems and creation of \nwetlands to act as pollutant filters. This legislation would allow the \nBureau of Reclamation to partner with the Watershed Councils in \ndetermining how such small-scale construction projects might benefit \nboth the environment and the local economy.\n  This bill authorizes a study; it does not authorize actual \nconstruction. It simply enables the Bureau to help find the most \nlogical solution to resource management issues.\n  Last Congress, the Senate passed the same bill I am introducing \ntoday. However, the other body did not act on the legislation before \nthe last Congress adjourned.\n  I look forward to prompt action to enact this bill in the current \nCongress. I welcome my colleague, Mr. Smith, as an original cosponsor \nof this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burnt, Malheur, Owyhee, and \n     Powder River Basin Water Optimization Feasibility Study Act \n     of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STUDY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may conduct feasibility \n     studies on water optimization in the Burnt River basin, \n     Malheur River basin, Owyhee River basin, and Powder River \n     basin, Oregon.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Dorgan, and \n        Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 239. A bill to improve access to the Cuban market for American \nagricultural producers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncorrect problems with a provision enacted last fall in the fiscal year \n2001 agriculture appropriations bill. I am pleased to be joined as \noriginal cosponsors by my distinguished colleagues, Senators Dodd, \nLugar, Roberts, and Dorgan.\n  The provision contained in the fiscal year 2001 agriculture \nappropriations bill was a revised version of legislation originally \nintroduced last Congress by former Senator Ashcroft and me, together \nwith Senators Dodd, Lugar, Roberts, and many others. The purpose of our \nbill was to lift all unilateral economic sanctions on the export of \nAmerican food and medicine. Passage of this provision acknowledges what \nmost Nebraska grain and livestock producers have always known--when the \nUnited States places unilateral sanctions on other nations, American \nproducers are hurt, not the sanctioned nation.\n  As the world leader in the development of pharmaceuticals and medical \ndevices, America plays a critical role in helping prolong and improve \nthe quality of people's lives. Ensuring that these products and \ntherapies are available to people all over the world not only benefits \nAmerican businesses and workers, but also reinforces America's image as \na country of both innovation and compassion.\n  The provision enacted in the fiscal year 2001 agriculture \nappropriations bill was changed, however, in the conference committee \nwith the House of Representatives. The final legislation blocked--only \nfor sales to Cuba--access to normal export financing in the U.S. \nprivate sector. Thus, while claiming to open up the Cuban market for \nthe export of American agricultural and medical products, it placed \nrestrictions making American exports uncompetitive. Finally, the \nprovision codified new restrictions on the ability of Americans to \ntravel to Cuba.\n  The Cuba Food and Medicine Access Act of 2001 would correct those \nmistakes by repealing the new travel restrictions and permitting normal \ncredit and financing support for food and medicine exports to Cuba.\n  As we rewrite the farm bill we should begin by delivering on a \npromise we made last year to end unilateral sanctions on our own \nfarmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers.\n  But this issue goes beyond increased commercial opportunity. The \nexport of American food and medicine is also a humanitarian \nundertaking. Blocking exports in these commodities harm the health and \nnutrition of the people of the sanctioned nation. It does nothing to \nharm governments and government leaders with which we disagree. Until \nlast year, food sales to Cuba were prohibited except to independent \nimporters, which did not exist. And while medical sales to Cuba were \ntheoretically possible, licensing procedures were so difficult and \ncomplicated that they had the effect of severely restricting such \nexports. Last year's bill went part of the way to clear away these \nimpediments. We should now finish the job.\n  I ask that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cuba Food and Medicine \n     Access Act of 2001''.\n                                TITLE I\n\n     SEC. 10. LIMITATION ON PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE \n                   WITH CUBA TO ALLOW FOR THE EXPORT OF FOOD AND \n                   MEDICINES TO CUBA.\n\n       Notwithstanding the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n     Enhancement Act of 2000 (Title IX of H.R. 5426 of the One \n     Hundred Sixth Congress, as enacted into law by Section 1(a) \n     of Public Law 106-387, and as contained in the appendix of \n     that Act) (except section 904 of such Act) or any other \n     provision of law (except section 11 of this Act), the \n     prohibition or restriction on trade or financial transactions \n     with Cuba shall not apply with respect to the export of any \n     agricultural commodities, medicines, or medical devices, or \n     with respect to travel incident to the sale or delivery of \n     agricultural commodities, medicines, or medical devices, to \n     Cuba.\n\n     SEC. 11. LIMITATION ON EXCEPTION TO ALLOW FOR THE EXPORT OF \n                   FOOD AND MEDICINE TO CUBA.\n\n       Section 10 of this Act shall not apply--\n       (1) with respect to restrictions imposed under section 5 of \n     the Export Administration Act of 1979 for goods containing \n     parts or components on which export controls are in effect \n     under that section; and\n       (2) with respect to section 203 of the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act, to the extent the authorities \n     under that section are exercised to deal with a threat to the \n     national security of the United States by virtue of the \n     technology incorporated in such goods.\n\n     SEC. 12.

REPEAL OF CODIFICATION OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS BY \n                   AMERICAN CITIZENS TO CUBA.\n\n       Section 910 of the Trade Sections Reform and Export \n     Enhancement Act of 2000 (Title IX of H.R. 5426 of the One \n     Hundred Sixth Congress, as enacted into law by Section 1(a) \n     of Public Law 106-387, and as contained in the appendix of \n     that Act) is hereby repealed.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today once again to introduce \nlegislation to enhance trade provisions from Title Nine of the fiscal \nyear 2001 agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The legislation that I join with my colleagues to introduce today, \nthe Cuba Food & Medicine Access Act of 2001, exempts, among other \nthings, the sale of agricultural commodities from the financing and \nlicensing restrictions of Title Nine of last year's agriculture \nappropriations bill, also known as the Trade Sanctions Reform & Export \nEnhancement Act.\n  Last week, Senator Dorgan and I introduced similar corrective \nlegislation. Title Nine of the fiscal year 2001 agriculture \nappropriations bill made significant progress toward ending the \nmisguided policy of using unilateral food sanctions to isolate or \npunish so-called ``countries of concern''. Title Nine holds that ``The \nPresident shall terminate any unilateral agricultural sanction or \nunilateral medical sanction that is in effect as of the date of \nenactment of this Act.'' That is indeed progress, Mr. President.\n  As I noted last week with my friend from North Dakota, however, Title \nNine prohibits basic facilitators to trade--financing and export \npromotion. The Trade Sanctions Reform & Export Enhancement Act \neffectively thwarts U.S. agricultural trade with Cuba.\n  It is that reality that prompts me to introduce and support as many \nlegislative vehicles as I can toward repealing the prohibitions in last \nyear's bill and opening the Cuban market to American agricultural \ncommodities.\n  There has been much talk about the importance of American tourist \ntravel to Cuba--this is true and I have stated it repeatedly. The Trade \nSanctions Reform & Export Enhancement Act's tourist travel ban stifles \nthe most powerful influence on Cuban society: American culture and \nperspective, both economic and political.\n  Consistent with the Dorgan-Roberts bill introduced last week, the \ncodification of tourist travel restrictions is repealed under the Cuba \nFood & Medicine Access Act of 2001 as are restrictions on the sale of \nmedicine and medical products. Further, the trade of both food and \nmedicine is enhanced by nullifying a provision of the Cuban Democracy \nAct of 1992, which prohibits ships entering ports in Cuba from visiting \nU.S. ports for at least 180 days without a special license.\n  Today, however, I want to place more emphasis on the agricultural \ntrade issue. The U.S. cannot afford to rule out any market for our \nagricultural commodities. Now more than ever, as new markets develop \nand our competitors seize those opportunities, it makes no sense to \npreclude the use of export promotion programs nor outlaw private U.S. \nfinancing. It is nonsense to isolate our farmers in this fashion.\n  Section 908 of the fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill \nreads ``no United States Government assistance, including United States \nforeign assistance, United States export assistance, and any United \nStates credit or guarantees shall be available for exports to Cuba.'' \nSection 908 goes on to state, incredibly, that ``no United States \nperson may provide payment or financing terms for sales of agricultural \ncommodities or products to Cuba or any person in Cuba.''\n  It's quite clear, Mr. President, the intent of this provision is to \nkeep the Cuban market cut off from America's farmers. This is \nunacceptable.\n  If it's not to keep the Cuban market cut off, then what is the \npolicy? What are our farmers supposed to do when faced with this kind \nof contradictory and politicized language: You are permitted to sell to \nCuba but don't bother trying? We are either going to encourage and \nfacilitate global agricultural trade or we are going to discourage and \ncomplicate global agricultural trade. You can't have it both ways.\n  Why is this significant in regards to Cuba? Let us sample some recent \nstatistics provided by the U.S.-Cuba Trade & Economic Council, based in \nNew York City: Wheat exports from Canada to Cuba in 1999 and 2000--\n730,000 tons; corn exports from China to Cuba in 2000--26,101 tons; and \nrice exports from China to Cuba in 2000--225,510 tons.\n  No, Cuba is not the largest market, Mr. President, but the point is, \nour farmers should be able to compete for that business. It's our \nobligation to at least permit such an opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 240. a bill to authorize studies on water supply management and \ndevelopment; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Water Resource Study \nAct of 2001. The purpose of this bill is to ensure an adequate supply \nof fresh water for Tennessee's future.\n  Currently, Tennessee is one of the fastest growing states in the \ncountry. We rank 9th out of the 50 states in projected population \ngrowth over the next 25 years. Though we welcome this growth, it is \nbeginning to place a strain on our water supply. For example, public \nwater use increased from 380 million gallons in 1960 to 777 million \ngallons in 1995. As industry and population increase, it will not be \nlong before growth outpaces available water supply. We must act now to \navoid serious problems.\n  Specifically, this legislation would allow Tennessee to work with the \nSecretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to select \na geographical area within the state having ``consistent, emerging \nwater supply needs'' and to take a serious look at the water supply in \nthat particular area. After gathering relevant data, the study would \nconsider available federal resources, identify areas for improvement \nand detect outdated programs. It would also begin determining the \nappropriate role of the federal government in helping local communities \nto develop an adequate water supply.\n  This legislation is not the full solution, but it will assist in \nunderstanding the complexity of water supply development and the \ndifferent alternatives to meeting future water supply needs. It is a \ngood step in addressing this important issue for all Tennesseans.\n  I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Federal Election Commission to set \nuniform national standards for Federal election procedures, change the \nFederal election day, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nElection Standards Act of 2001.\n  The entire nation was disgusted by the presidential election of 2000. \nThat election revealed the flaws in our election process to the entire \nworld. America is the greatest country--and the oldest democracy--in \nthe world, and we can do better.\n  The most fundamental premise of democracy is that every vote is \ncounted. But the reality is that votes cast in wealthier parts of the \ncountry frequently count more than votes cast in poorer areas, because \nwealthier districts have better, more accurate, more modern and less \nerror-prone counting machines than poorer precincts and districts. Some \ncounties in this nation are using voting machines and vote-counting \nmachines that are 50, 60, 70 years old, and that have error rates of 3 \nor more percent. In the wealthiest nation in the world, that is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that will give the Federal Election \nCommission the authority to issue uniform federal regulations governing \nregistration, access to polling places, voting machines, and vote-\ncounting procedures in federal elections across the country. Unlike \nsome other proposals introduced this Congress, these regulations will \nbe binding on states and localities. The Commission will also be \nauthorized to set deadlines for states and localities to comply, and to \nprovide the necessary federal funding to enable them to comply.\n  My bill will also require states to allow voters to register on the \nsame day that they vote, and will move federal election days from the \ncurrent Tuesday, to the preceding Saturday and Sunday. By simplifying \nregistration, by allowing voters to vote on weekends, and extending \nelection day to two days instead of one, more voters will be able to \nparticipate in federal elections more easily. I believe these changes \nwill go a long way toward improving our atrocious voter turnout rates, \nand help restore some of the confidence in our election process that \nmany Americans lost during the last election.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 242. A bill to authorize funding for University Nuclear Science \nand Engineering Programs at the Department of Energy for fiscal years \n2002 through 2006; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide for the Office of \nNuclear Energy, Science and Technology to reverse a serious decline in \nour nation's educational capability to produce future nuclear \nscientists and engineers. This bi-partisan bill which is referred to as \nthe ``Department of Energy University Nuclear Science and Engineering \nAct'' is co-sponsored by my colleagues Mr. Domenici and Mr. Crapo. Let \nme outline how serious this decline is, after doing so I will outline \nits impact on our nation and then discuss how this bill attempts to \nremedy this situation.\n  As of this year, the supply of four-year trained nuclear scientists \nand engineers is at a 35-year low. The number of four-year programs \nacross our nation to train future nuclear scientists has declined to \napproximately 25--a 50 percent reduction since about 1970. Two-thirds \nof the nuclear science and engineering faculty are over age 45 with \nlittle if any ability to draw new and young talent to replace them. \nUniversities across the United States cannot afford to maintain their \nsmall research reactors forcing their closure at an alarming rate. This \nyear there are only 28 operating research and training reactors, over a \n50 percent decline since 1980. Most if not all of these reactors were \nbuilt in the late 1950's and early 60's and were licensed initially for \n30 to 40 years. As a result, within the next five years the majority of \nthese 28 reactors will have to be relicensed. Relicensing is a long, \nlengthy process which most universities cannot and will not afford. \nInterestingly, the employment demand for nuclear scientists and \nengineers exceeds our nation's ability to supply them. This year, the \ndemand exceeded supply by 350, by 2003 it will be over 400. Our current \nprojections are that in five years 76 percent of the nation's nuclear \nworkforce can retire, the university pipeline of new scientists and \nengineers is moving in the wrong direction to meet this national \nproblem.\n  These human resource and educational infrastructure problems are \nserious. The decline in a competently\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\ntrained nuclear workforce affects a broad range of national issues.\n  We need nuclear engineers and health physicists to help design, \nsafely dispose and monitor nuclear waste, both civilian and military.\n  We rely on nuclear physicists and scientists in the field of nuclear \nmedicine to develop radio isotopes for the thousands of medical \nprocedures performed everyday across our nation--to help save lives.\n  We must continue to operate and safely maintain our existing supply \nof fission reactors and respond to any future nuclear crisis \nworldwide--it takes nuclear scientists, engineers and health physicists \nto do that.\n  Our national security and treaty commitments rely on nuclear \nscientists to help stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons whether in \nour national laboratories or as part of worldwide inspection teams in \nsuch places as Iraq. Nuclear scientists are needed to convert existing \nreactors worldwide from highly enriched to low enriched fuels.\n  Nuclear engineers and health physicists are needed to design, operate \nand monitor future Naval Reactors. The Navy by itself cannot train \nstudents for their four year degrees--they only provide advance \npostgraduate training on their reactor's operation.\n  Basically, we are looking at the potential loss of a 50 year \ninvestment in a field which our nation started and leads the world in. \nWhat is worse, this loss is a downward self-feeding spiral. Poor \ndepartments cannot attract bright students and bright students will not \ncarry on the needed cutting edge research that leads to promising young \nfaculty members. Our system of nuclear education and training, in which \nwe used to lead the world, is literally imploding upon itself.\n  I've laid out in this bill some proposals that I hope will seed a \nnational debate in the upcoming 107th Congress on what we as a nation \nneed to do to help solve this very serious problem. It is not a perfect \nbill, but I think it should start the ball rolling. I welcome all forms \nof bipartisan input on it. I hope that my colleagues in the House \nScience Committee looks favorably at this worthy effort and I would \nsuggest joint hearings so that we as a Congressional body can hear \ntogether the testimony on the serious decline that we now face. My \nstaff has worked from consensus reports from the scientific community \ndeveloped by the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee to the Department of \nEnergy's Office of Nuclear Science and Technology, in particular its \nsubcommittee on Education and Training. The report is available on the \nOffice's website. I encourage everyone to read and look at these \nstartling statistics.\n  Here is an outline of what is in the bill.\n  First and foremost, we need to concentrate on attracting good \nundergraduate students to the nuclear sciences. I have proposed \nenhancing the current program which provides fellowships to graduate \nstudents and extends that to undergraduate students.\n  Second, we need to attract new and young faculty. I've proposed a \nJunior Faculty Research Initiation Grant Program which is similar to \nthe NSF programs targeted only towards supporting new faculty during \nthe first 5 years of their career at a university. These first five \nyears are critical years that either make or break new faculty.\n  Third, I've proposed enhancing the Office's Nuclear Engineering \nEducation and Research Program. This program is critical to university \nfaculty and graduate students by supporting only the most fundamental \nresearch in nuclear science and engineering. These fundamental programs \nultimately will strengthen our industrial base and over all economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Fourth, I've strengthened the Office's applied nuclear science \nprogram by ensuring that universities play an important role in \ncollaboration with the national labs and industry. This collaboration \nis the most basic form of tech transfer, it is face-to-face contact and \nnetworking between faculty, students and the applied world of research \nand industry. This program will ensure a transition between the student \nand their future employer.\n  Finally, I've strengthened what I consider the most crucial element \nof this program--ensuring that future generations of students and \nprofessors have well maintained research reactors.\n  I've proposed to increase the funding levels for refueling and \nupgrading academic reactor instrumentation.\n  I propose to start a new program whereby faculty can apply for \nreactor research and training awards to provide for reactor \nimprovements.\n  I have proposed a novel program whereby as part of a student's \nundergraduate and graduate thesis project, they help work on the re-\nlicensing of their own research reactors. This program must be in \ncollaboration with industry which already has ample experience in \nrelicensing. Such a program will once again provide face-to-face \nnetworking and training between student, teacher and ultimately their \nemployer.\n  I have proposed a fellowship program whereby faculty can take their \nsabbatical year at a DOE laboratory. Under this program DOE laboratory \nstaff can co-teach university courses and give extended seminars. This \nprogram also provides for part time employment of students at the DOE \nlabs--we are talking about bringing in new and young talent.\n  For the research funds allocated, I have permitted portions be used \nto operating the reactor during the investigation. I make this \nallocation provided that the investigator's host institution makes a \ncost sharing commitment in its operation. My intent is clearly not to \nmake the program simply fund the operations and maintenance of \nuniversity reactors; it must be tied to the bill's research. The cost \nsharing insures that the host institution does not simply reallocate \nthe funds already committed to operating the reactor.\n  In making all of these proposals, let me emphasize that each one of \nthese programs I have described is intended to be peer reviewed and to \nhave awards made strictly on merit of the proposals submitted. This \nprogram is not a hand out. Each element that I am proposing requires \nthat faculty innovate and compete for these funds. Those institutions \nthat do not win such competitions will have the choice of funding the \nresearch reactor activities themselves or consider shutting them down.\n  I have outlined a very serious problem that if not corrected now will \ncost far more to correct later on. If the program I have outlined is \nimplemented, then it will strengthen our reputation as a leader in the \nnuclear sciences, strengthen our national security and our ability to \ncompete in the world market place.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of this bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``Department of Energy University \n     Nuclear Science and Engineering Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) U.S. university nuclear science and engineering \n     programs are in a state of serious decline. The supply of \n     bachelor degree nuclear science and engineering personnel in \n     the United States is at a 35-year low. The number of four \n     year degree nuclear engineering programs has declined 50 \n     percent to approximately 25 programs nationwide. Over two-\n     thirds of the faculty in these programs are 45 years or \n     older.\n       (2) Universities cannot afford to support their research \n     and training reactors. Since 1980, the number of small \n     training reactors in the United States have declined by over \n     50 percent to 28 reactors. Most of these reactors were built \n     in the late 1950s and 1960s with 30- to 40-year operating \n     licenses, and will require re-licensing in the next several \n     years.\n       (3) The neglect in human investment and training \n     infrastructure is affecting 50 years of national R \n     investment. The decline in a competent nuclear workforce, and \n     the lack of adequately trained nuclear scientists and \n     engineers, will affect the ability of the United States to \n     solve future waste storage issues, maintain basic nuclear \n     health physics programs, operate existing and design future \n     fission reactors in the United States, respond to future \n     nuclear events worldwide, help stem the proliferation of \n     nuclear weapons, and design and operate naval nuclear \n     reactors.\n       (4) Further neglect in the nation's investment in human \n     resources for the nuclear sciences will lead to a downward \n     spiral. As the number of nuclear science departments shrink, \n     faculties age, and training reactors\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\n     close, the appeal of nuclear science will be lost to future \n     generations of students.\n       (5) Current projections are that 76% of the nation's \n     professional nuclear workforce can retire in 5 years, a new \n     supply of trained scientists and engineers is needed.\n       (6) The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, \n     Science and Technology is well suited to help maintain \n     tomorrow's human resource and training investment in the \n     nuclear sciences. Through its support of research and \n     development pursuant to the Department's statutory \n     authorities, the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and \n     Technology is the principal federal agent for civilian \n     research in the nuclear sciences for the United States. The \n     Office maintains the Nuclear Engineering and Education \n     Research Program which funds basic nuclear science and \n     engineering. The Office funds the Nuclear Energy and Research \n     Initiative which funds applied collaborative research among \n     universities, industry and national laboratories in the areas \n     of proliferation resistant fuel cycles and future fission \n     power systems.

A bill to provide for the issuance of bonds to provide \nfunding for the construction of schools of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nof the Department of the Interior, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Bingaman, Daschle, \nCampbell, Inouye, Cochran, Reid, Akaka, and Baucus am introducing \nlegislation to establish an innovative funding mechanism to enhance the \nability of Indian tribes to construct, repair, and maintain quality \neducational facilities. Representatives from tribal schools in my State \nof South Dakota have been working with tribes nationwide to develop an \ninitiative which I believe will be a positive first step toward \naddressing the serious crisis we are facing in Indian education.\n  Over 50 percent of the American Indian population in this country is \nage 24 or younger. Consequently, the need for improved educational \nprograms and facilities, and for training the American Indian workforce \nis pressing. American Indians have been, and continue to be, \ndisproportionately affected by both poverty and low educational \nachievement. The high school completion rate for Indian people aged 20 \nto 24 was 12.5 percent below the national average. American Indian \nstudents, on average, have scored far lower on the National Assessment \nfor Education Progress indicators than all other students.\n  By ignoring the most fundamental aspect of education; that is, safe, \nquality educational facilities, there is little hope of breaking the \ncycle of low educational achievement, and the unemployment and poverty \nthat result from neglected academic potential.\n  The Indian School Construction Act establishes a bonding authority to \nuse\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\nexisting tribal education funds for bonds in the municipal finance \nmarket which currently serves local governments across the Nation. \nInstead of funding construction projects directly, these existing funds \nwill be leveraged through bonds to fund substantially more tribal \nschool construction, maintenance and repair projects.\n  The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates the tribal school construction \nand repair backlog at over $1 billion. Confounding this backlog, \ninflation and facility deterioration severely increases this amount. \nThe administration's school construction request for fiscal year 2001 \nwas over $62 million. In this budgetary climate, I believe every avenue \nfor efficiently stretching the Federal dollar should be explored.\n  Tribal schools in my State and around the country address the unique \nlearning needs and styles of Indian students, with sensitivity to \nNative cultures, ultimately promoting higher academic achievement. \nThere are strong historical and moral reasons for continued support of \ntribal schools. In keeping with our special trust responsibility to \nsovereign Indian nations, we need to promote the self-determination and \nself-sufficiency of Indian communities. Education is absolutely vital \nto this effort. Allowing the continued deterioration and decay of \ntribal schools through lack of funding would violate the Government's \ncommitment and responsibility to Indian nations and only slow the \nprogress of self-sufficiency.\n  I urge my colleagues to closely examine the Indian School \nConstruction Act and join me in working to make this innovative funding \nmechanism a reality. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for United States policy toward Libya; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday a Scottish court, meeting in \nthe Netherlands, convicted Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi for the 1988 \nbombing of Pan American flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. That court \nsentenced him to life in prison. Two-hundred seven people, including \n189 Americans, lost their lives in this barbaric act.\n  In addition, the court conclusively tied the planning and execution \nof the bombing to Libya and Libya intelligence.\n  While no verdict could have fully comforted the families of the \nvictims, eased their anguish, or removed the haunting images from their \nminds, they can take some solace in the fact that guilt has now been \nestablished. I would like to personally thank the families of the \nvictims for their hard work, for their dedication, and for the \nunyielding determination to ensure that their loved ones did not die in \nvain. The international community truly owes them a debt of gratitude.\n  Nevertheless, the quest for justice is not over. Now some have \nsuggested the verdict brings the matter to a close, and at the \nsanctions in place since 1992 should now be lifted. We, however, \nbelieve that would be a serious mistake and an insult to the victims \nand their families. U.N. Resolutions have required Libya to pay \ncompensation to the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 if a guilty \nverdict is rendered, and, second, to officially end support for \ninternational terrorism before the multilateral sanctions can \npermanently be lifted.\n  A formal lifting of the sanctions now would send Libya the wrong \nsignal. It would indicate that the international community has absolved \nLibya of its role in the bombing, a role, to repeat, clearly \nestablished by the Scottish court. It would say that Libya should be \naccepted back into the community of responsible nations. It would \nbestow upon Colonel Qadhafi's regime a respect and credibility it seeks \nbut has not earned.\n  The United States must press Libya to publicly accept its role in the \nbombing of Pan Am Flight 103, issue an apology, and compensate the \nvictims' families.\n  Consequently, today we are introducing the Justice for the Victims of \nPan Am 103 Act of 2001. This legislation is cosponsored by Senators \nHelms, Brownback, Leahy, Reid of Nevada, Nelson of Nebraska, Clinton, \nDodd, Baucus, Boxer, Byrd, and Carper.\n  The legislation states that it shall be the policy of the United \nStates to oppose lifting U.N. and U.S. sanctions against Libya until \nall cases of American victims of Libyan terrorism have been resolved; \nthe Government of Libya has accepted responsibility, has issued an \napology, has paid compensation to the victims' families of Pan Am 103; \nand has taken real and concrete steps to end support of international \nterrorism; and the legislation would prohibit assistance to the \nGovernment of Libya until the President determines and certifies that \nLibya has fulfilled the above requirements.\n  In addition, the legislation expresses the sense of the Senate that \nthe Government of Libya should be condemned for its support of \ninternational terrorism and the bombing of Pan Am 103.\n  Second, the Government of Libya should accept responsibility for the \nbombing, issue a public apology, and provide due compensation.\n  Finally, the President, the Secretary of State, and other U.S. \nofficials should encourage other countries and the United Nations to \nmaintain sanctions against Libya until it fulfills the above \nrequirements. Until Libya accepts responsibility for its actions, \napologizes, and ends its support for international terrorism, the \nUnited States should leave and will leave no stone unturned in the \nquest for justice.\n  We owe the victims of Pan Am 103 no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas educating international students is an important \n     way to spread United States values and influence and to \n     create goodwill for the United States throughout the world;\n       Whereas international exchange programs, that in the past \n     have done much to extend United States influence in the world \n     by educating the world's leaders, are suffering from decline;\n       Whereas international education is important to meet future \n     challenges facing the United States including challenges \n     involving national security and the management of global \n     conflict and competitiveness in a global economy;\n       Whereas international education entails the imparting of \n     effective global literacy to United States students and other \n     citizens as an integral part of their education;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 international students and their \n     dependents contributed an estimated $12,300,000,000 to the \n     United States economy in the academic year 1999-2000;\n       Whereas other countries, especially the United Kingdom, are \n     mounting vigorous recruitment campaigns to compete for \n     international students;\n       Whereas United States competitiveness in the international \n     student market is declining, the United States share of \n     internationally mobile students having declined from 40 \n     percent to 30 percent since 1982;\n       Whereas less than 10 percent of United States students \n     graduating from college have studied abroad; and\n       Whereas research indicates that the United States is \n     failing to graduate enough students with expertise in foreign \n     languages and cultures to fill the demands of business, \n     government, and universities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN \n                   INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY FOR THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     establish an international education policy to enhance \n     national security and significantly further United States \n     foreign policy and global competitiveness.\n\n     SEC. 2. OBJECTIVES OF AN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY FOR \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       An international education policy for the United States \n     should strive to achieve the following:\n       (1) Invigorate citizen and professional international \n     exchange programs and to promote the international exchange \n     of scholars.\n       (2) Streamline visa, taxation, and employment regulations \n     applicable to international students.\n       (3) Significantly increase participation in study abroad by \n     United States students.\n       (4) Promote greater diversity of locations, languages, and \n     subjects involved in study abroad to ensure that the United \n     States maintains an adequate international knowledge base.\n       (5) Ensure that a college graduate has knowledge of a \n     second language and of a foreign area.\n       (6) Enhance the educational infrastructure through which \n     the United States produces international expertise.\n       (7) Capture 40 percent of the international student market \n     for the United States.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am honored to be joined by Senators \nLugar, Levin, Reid, Wellstone, and Graham in introducing a resolution \nfocused on the important issue of international education. My \ncolleagues and I strongly believe that the United States should \ncontinue to build a vigorous international education policy. Former \nSecretary of Education Richard Riley has noted that nations across the \nworld are keen on fostering greater faculty and student exchanges and \nsuggested a series of new steps to re-energize the cause of \ninternational education in the United States. The conference report of \nthe FY01 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill included language \nrecognizing that international education is a foreign policy priority. \nOn November 11-17, 2000, campuses and schools across the country \ncelebrated the first-ever International Education Week, recognized by \nPresidential Proclamation. I hope that this resolution will build on \nthese efforts to preserve and extend a proud tradition of support for \nU.S. international education programs that dates back almost a half \ncentury.\n  Providing an excellent education to America's children has always \nbeen vital in preserving U.S. leadership abroad. During the cold war, \nwe demonstrated democracy's strength by winning the space race, by \npossessing superior scientific knowledge, and by understanding the \nlanguages, cultures and history of regions where the defense of liberty \nand freedom was paramount. In 1958, in response to the launch of \nSputnik by the Soviet Union, the Congress enacted the National Defense \nEducation Act as a major tool of cold war policy. The NDEA focused on \nimproving the teaching of science and math education, history, \ngeography and foreign languages in all levels of education. The \nNational Defense Education Act provided capital funds to colleges and \nuniversities so that they could make low-interest loans to students.\n  Today more than ever, in an environment of intense global economic, \nscientific and technological competition, a national education policy \nis crucial to America's leadership in the world. I believe that we need \na new national defense education policy that focuses on foreign \nlanguages and the history and cultures in other parts of the world, \nbecause we can not lead in a world we do not understand. Unfortunately, \nwe are once again falling behind when it comes to providing our \nchildren the tools they need to compete on the global stage.\n  Less than one-tenth of graduating American college students have \nstudied abroad. The reality of the global economy dictates that we \ncannot allow this rate to stand. In order for graduates to be effective \nin the increasingly international business community, they must better \nunderstand the world. Secretary Richard Riley put it well last year \nwhen he argued that ``college students [should] expect their education \nto give them a diverse global perspective that enriches their learning. \nMore and more, international education will become the norm, not the \nexception, and students will routinely study abroad and know multiple \nlanguages.''\n  Of course, international education works both ways. The resolution we \nare introducing today also recognizes the intrinsic value of bringing \ninternational students to study in this country. Today, the percentage \nof science and engineering doctoral recipients from abroad is \ndeclining. We must reverse this trend, because international students \nworking in our universities make a valuable contribution to the \nresearch and study of their American counterparts and an invaluable \ncontribution to global peace and stability when they return to their \nhome nations imbued with all the possibilities democracy has to offer.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution expressing \nthe need for establishing an international education policy for the \nUnited States. I am pleased to join Senator Kerry and other colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle in this endeavor.\n  Ask any American Ambassador in any U.S. Embassy what their most \nvaluable programs are and many will respond by citing those programs \nwhich promote international cooperation and understanding. Educational \nand cultural exchanges typically rank high on their list because they \nare integral to our foreign policy and national security interests and \nbuild enormous good will abroad.\n  Our resolution reflects the same priority to international education. \nIt expresses the need for an international education policy that \nenhances our national security, advances our foreign policy and \nstrengthens our global competitiveness.\n  Our resolution states: 1. That all college graduates should have \nknowledge\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nof a second language and another geographic area of the world; 2. That \nwe should enhance and streamline our educational infrastructure to \nstrengthen international expertise--this should include our employment \npractices, our tax laws, visa and immigration procedures, educational \nadvising and other areas for improving international education \nprograms; 3.

Res. 7\n\n       Whereas educating international students is an important \n     way to spread United States values and influence and to \n     create goodwill for the United States throughout the world;\n       Whereas international exchange programs, that in the past \n     have done much to extend United States influence in the world \n     by educating the world's leaders, are suffering from decline;\n       Whereas international education is important to meet future \n     challenges facing the United States including challenges \n     involving national security and the management of global \n     conflict and competitiveness in a global economy;\n       Whereas international education entails the imparting of \n     effective global literacy to United States students and other \n     citizens as an integral part of their education;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 international students and their \n     dependents contributed an estimated $12,300,000,000 to the \n     United States economy in the academic year 1999-2000;\n       Whereas other countries, especially the United Kingdom, are \n     mounting vigorous recruitment campaigns to compete for \n     international students;\n       Whereas United States competitiveness in the international \n     student market is declining, the United States share of \n     internationally mobile students having declined from 40 \n     percent to 30 percent since 1982;\n       Whereas less than 10 percent of United States students \n     graduating from college have studied abroad; and\n       Whereas research indicates that the United States is \n     failing to graduate enough students with expertise in foreign \n     languages and cultures to fill the demands of business, \n     government, and universities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN \n                   INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY FOR THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     establish an international education policy to enhance \n     national security and significantly further United States \n     foreign policy and global competitiveness.\n\n     SEC. 2. OBJECTIVES OF AN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY FOR \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       An international education policy for the United States \n     should strive to achieve the following:\n       (1) Invigorate citizen and professional international \n     exchange programs and to promote the international exchange \n     of scholars.\n       (2) Streamline visa, taxation, and employment regulations \n     applicable to international students.\n       (3) Significantly increase participation in study abroad by \n     United States students.\n       (4) Promote greater diversity of locations, languages, and \n     subjects involved in study abroad to ensure that the United \n     States maintains an adequate international knowledge base.\n       (5) Ensure that a college graduate has knowledge of a \n     second language and of a foreign area.\n       (6) Enhance the educational infrastructure through which \n     the United States produces international expertise.\n       (7) Capture 40 percent of the international student market \n     for the United States.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am honored to be joined by Senators \nLugar, Levin, Reid, Wellstone, and Graham in introducing a resolution \nfocused on the important issue of international education. My \ncolleagues and I strongly believe that the United States should \ncontinue to build a vigorous international education policy. Former \nSecretary of Education Richard Riley has noted that nations across the \nworld are keen on fostering greater faculty and student exchanges and \nsuggested a series of new steps to re-energize the cause of \ninternational education in the United States. The conference report of \nthe FY01 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill included language \nrecognizing that international education is a foreign policy priority. \nOn November 11-17, 2000, campuses and schools across the country \ncelebrated the first-ever International Education Week, recognized by \nPresidential Proclamation. I hope that this resolution will build on \nthese efforts to preserve and extend a proud tradition of support for \nU.S. international education programs that dates back almost a half \ncentury.\n  Providing an excellent education to America's children has always \nbeen vital in preserving U.S. leadership abroad. During the cold war, \nwe demonstrated democracy's strength by winning the space race, by \npossessing superior scientific knowledge, and by understanding the \nlanguages, cultures and history of regions where the defense of liberty \nand freedom was paramount. In 1958, in response to the launch of \nSputnik by the Soviet Union, the Congress enacted the National Defense \nEducation Act as a major tool of cold war policy. The NDEA focused on \nimproving the teaching of science and math education, history, \ngeography and foreign languages in all levels of education. The \nNational Defense Education Act provided capital funds to colleges and \nuniversities so that they could make low-interest loans to students.\n  Today more than ever, in an environment of intense global economic, \nscientific and technological competition, a national education policy \nis crucial to America's leadership in the world. I believe that we need \na new national defense education policy that focuses on foreign \nlanguages and the history and cultures in other parts of the world, \nbecause we can not lead in a world we do not understand. Unfortunately, \nwe are once again falling behind when it comes to providing our \nchildren the tools they need to compete on the global stage.\n  Less than one-tenth of graduating American college students have \nstudied abroad. The reality of the global economy dictates that we \ncannot allow this rate to stand. In order for graduates to be effective \nin the increasingly international business community, they must better \nunderstand the world. Secretary Richard Riley put it well last year \nwhen he argued that ``college students [should] expect their education \nto give them a diverse global perspective that enriches their learning. \nMore and more, international education will become the norm, not the \nexception, and students will routinely study abroad and know multiple \nlanguages.''\n  Of course, international education works both ways. The resolution we \nare introducing today also recognizes the intrinsic value of bringing \ninternational students to study in this country. Today, the percentage \nof science and engineering doctoral recipients from abroad is \ndeclining. We must reverse this trend, because international students \nworking in our universities make a valuable contribution to the \nresearch and study of their American counterparts and an invaluable \ncontribution to global peace and stability when they return to their \nhome nations imbued with all the possibilities democracy has to offer.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution expressing \nthe need for establishing an international education policy for the \nUnited States. I am pleased to join Senator Kerry and other colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle in this endeavor.\n  Ask any American Ambassador in any U.S. Embassy what their most \nvaluable programs are and many will respond by citing those programs \nwhich promote international cooperation and understanding. Educational \nand cultural exchanges typically rank high on their list because they \nare integral to our foreign policy and national security interests and \nbuild enormous good will abroad.\n  Our resolution reflects the same priority to international education. \nIt expresses the need for an international education policy that \nenhances our national security, advances our foreign policy and \nstrengthens our global competitiveness.\n  Our resolution states: 1. That all college graduates should have \nknowledge\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nof a second language and another geographic area of the world; 2. That \nwe should enhance and streamline our educational infrastructure to \nstrengthen international expertise--this should include our employment \npractices, our tax laws, visa and immigration procedures, educational \nadvising and other areas for improving international education \nprograms; 3. That we should increase U.S. student participation in \nstudy abroad programs. For now, only about one percent of our college \npopulation study abroad; 4. That we should increase the diversity of \ncountries, languages, and subjects in our study abroad and exchange \nprograms; and 5.
