Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2\\1/2\\ hours of debate on the conference report with 2 \nhours to be equally divided and controlled between the chairman and \nranking member or their designees for 15 minutes each for Senators \nWellstone and Jeffords.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to talk for a few minutes about \nthe bill before us today--the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  First of all, I would like to commend the members of the conference \ncommittee who worked for months to reach a final agreement.\n  In Congress, you very rarely get exactly what you want, and in this \nbill I think both sides reached a good compromise that will help our \nchildren and our schools.\n  I have 9 kids and 35 grandkids, and I know exactly how important \neducation is.\n  I know how crucial it is for children to be challenged and encouraged \nat school. It is one of the most important elements of their \ndevelopment.\n  Every child in America deserves a good education, and the President \nis exactly right when he says no child should be left behind. This bill \ntakes a big step in that direction.\n  It provides increased flexibility of funds, accountability for \nstudent achievement and more options for parents. It is a win-win-win \nbill for students, parents and schools.\n  First, the bill gives new options to kids who have been trapped year \nafter year in failing schools.\n  Schools that do not make adequate yearly progress will face \nincreasingly stiff penalties. For example, students trapped in failing \nschools will be allowed to transfer to another public school.\n  Personally, I would have preferred giving children and their parents \neven more options and given them the choice of going to a private or \nreligious school as well. But there is no doubt the legislation \nrepresents a definite improvement over current law.\n  If a school continues to fail on a long-term basis, students will \nreceive money for supplemental services like tutoring or an after-\nschool program.\n  Also, I am very pleased the final version of this bill allows \nsupplemental services to be provided by public, private or faith-based \norganizations. This could be especially important in smaller \ncommunities that offer fewer options to kids.\n  Furthermore, the bill provides that schools that continue to fail \nstudents can be completely restructured.\n  This means they could be taken over by the states or incompetent \nstaff could be fired.\n  I know this is drastic. No one wants to see anything like this \nhappen. But if it's a choice between helping the kids or protecting a \nfailing school, the choice is clear.\n  Second, this bill provides states and school districts greater \nflexibility with federal education dollars.\n  For years, many of us have argued we need to preserve local control \nover education and guard against a bigger federal bureaucracy.\n  It is the local school board and state education officials who know \nbetter than anyone in Washington what works in their communities, and \nthis bill represents a fundamental shift toward better education \npolicy.\n  For instance, the legislation before us allows every local school \ndistrict and state to transfer certain federal funds among a variety of \nprograms, along with establishing a local Straight A's program which \nwill be available for 150 school districts nationwide.\n  Straight A's is a great idea that actually lets the local officials \ndirect federal money to their most pressing needs, whether it be hiring \nmore teachers or buying new books, in exchange for meeting certain \nperformance goals.\n  I hope many schools in Kentucky take advantage of these new \nopportunities.\n  If you think about it, we trust our local school officials with our \nchildren every day. But more and more, we have not been trusting them \nto know best how to spend education dollars. That does not make any \nsense to me and now that is going to change.\n  This bill also consolidates some existing funding for class size \nreduction and professional development to give schools more options in \nimproving teacher quality.\n  Under the legislation, schools will have the ability to help teachers \ndo their jobs better, whether it is reducing class size, providing \ntraining or recruiting new teachers.\n  We all know good teachers are one of the keys to a good education. \nNow school officials are going to have more tools at their disposal to \nhelp teachers do their job.\n  I have always said teachers have one of the hardest, most important \njobs in the world, and too often they do not get the credit they \ndeserve. I hope that starts to change.\n  I am also glad this bill contains the important Troops to Teachers \nProgram. There are no better role models for kids than men and women \nwho have sacrificed for our country. The conference report is going to \ncontinue this program.\n  Along that same line, the legislation also requires schools to give \nmilitary recruiters the same access to high school students as job \nrecruiters.\n  Since September 11, there has been a newfound appreciation by many \nfor our military. I hope many of our young people who feel called to \nserve their country will take advantage of the benefits the armed \nservices can provide.\n  Finally, I realize some are concerned funding for the Individuals \nWith Disabilities Education Act was not included in this bill. This is \nan important program. I have long supported increasing funding for IDEA \nand for the Federal Government living up to its commitment of full \nfunding at 40 percent.\n  In fact, under a Republican controlled Congress, IDEA funding has \nvirtually tripled from 1994 to 2001. Although we still have not met our \ngoal and have a long way to go to fully fund this program, I am looking \nforward to working with my colleagues on reauthorizing IDEA next year.\n  In conclusion, the bill we have before us is a good proposal. It is \nnot perfect, but there is no doubt about it, it represents a clear \nimprovement over current law. I believe our children, our Nation, and \nour schools will benefit from it. I look forward to voting for this \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, a year ago this week, in Texas, I joined \nseveral colleagues as the then-chairman of the Senate Education \nCommittee and met with President-elect Bush to discuss education \nreform.\n  It is interesting to note that the meeting occurred in Texas, the \nhome of the current President, and the home of our 36th President, \nLyndon Johnson, who, in 1965, signed into law the original Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  As we emerged from last year's Austin meeting, we made a bipartisan \ncommitment to write and pass an education reform bill that would raise \nschool accountability and improve student achievement.\n  With the projection of budget surpluses for as far as the eye could \nsee, it appeared that we would not only set in motion innovative \nreforms, but we would also match those reforms with new monetary \ninvestments.\n  It has been 362 days since we left that optimistic Austin meeting, \nand the scenario has dramatically changed. We are not only facing a \nvery different economic reality, but we also have an administration in \nplace that does not support the funding needed to successfully carry \nout its own education reform initiative.\n  There is no question that we need to improve our Nation's schools. \nResults from the recently released National Assessment of Educational \nProgress show that only 1 in 5--that is only 1 in 5--of this country's \nhigh school seniors are proficient in math and science, and only 2 in 5 \nare proficient in reading.\n  Further, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study shows\n\n[[Page S13367]]\n\nthat performance in math and science by U.S. students declines relative \nto that of students in other nations as students move through the \ngrades of our school system.\n  Another startling statistic is that almost half of all adults have \neither dropped out of high school or have not pursued any type of post-\nsecondary education.\n  Last year, we had to again raise the cap on the number of H-1B visas \nbecause this Nation is lacking the skilled employees necessary to meet \nthe workforce demands of the high-tech and health care industries. That \nis insulting.\n  I commend the President and the chairmen and ranking members of the \nHouse and Senate Education Committees for creating legislation \nspecifically mandating that States and schools must significantly \nimprove performance.\n  The bill before us imposes very strict mandates on our schools, \nrequiring States to separate achievement data by race, gender, and \nother subgroups to better identify those students having academic \ndifficulties. This is a very worthy goal and one which I fully support.\n  However, I fear that this bill, without the sufficient resources, \nwill merely highlight our shortcomings. I fear it will not provide the \nassistance--both financial and technical--that schools will need to \nmeet the goal of having every student reach their full academic \npotential.\n  Educational budgets throughout this Nation are facing severe cuts \ndue, in part, to the recent economic downturn, but also due to the high \ncosts associated with providing students with disabilities special \neducation services.\n  In Vermont, 92 percent of the children with disabilities, between the \nages of 6 and 11, are educated in their neighborhood schools in \nclassrooms with their nondisabled peers. Special education costs in \nVermont have increased 150 percent over the past 10 years.\n\n  The Federal underfunding of special education leads to State and \nlocal districts spending approximately $20 million more in Vermont from \nlocal sources than would be necessary if Federal funding were provided \nat the level Congress promised in the original law.\n  In 1975, we, in the Congress, authorized the Federal Government to \npay up to 40 percent of each State's excess cost of educating children \nwith disabilities. It has been 26 years since we made that commitment, \nand we have failed to keep our promise. We are currently providing only \n16 percent of the original 40 percent promised.\n  Earlier this year, during Senate consideration of the ESEA bill, this \nbody unanimously adopted the Harkin-Hagel amendment that required \nCongress to fully fund IDEA through progressive annual increases. I am \nextremely disappointed that the final product we are considering today \ndoes not include this critical amendment. Without the inclusion of the \nHarkin-Hagel amendment, and without sufficient funding for the programs \noutlined in the bill, I am afraid this bill may actually do more harm \nthan good.\n  The primary feature of H.R. 1 is adequate yearly progress. Under the \nrevamped title I program, every student in every school must be \nproficient within 12 years. This sounds reasonable. However, at current \nfunding levels, and even with over a billion-dollar increase for title \nI in the coming year, we will still only be funding less than half of \nthe children who qualify under the title I program.\n  Since title I was created in the landmark Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965, neither Congress nor any administration has \nprovided the dollars required to fund all of the students needing \nservices. It seems to me that Congress has failed to meet its own \nadequate yearly progress goals for the past 36 years.\n  I have been in Congress for more than 25 years. I have never voted \nagainst an education bill before. But to vote for this education bill \nas it now stands, I believe, is counterproductive, if not destructive. \nMy instincts tell me that this bill will become law within a matter of \ndays.\n  Although I am voting against this bill, I will work very hard with \nall of my colleagues to obtain the funding that is needed so that our \neducational system will not only be strengthened but, as Dr. Seuss once \nsaid in one of the last books to be issued before this author's \npassing: ``. . . you'll be the best of the best. Wherever you go, you \nwill top all the rest.''\n  We can only be the ``best of the best'' by not only adequately \nfunding these programs but also working with parents and teachers and \nprincipals and superintendents and school personnel and school board \nofficials and students, for they have many of the answers that will \nenable us and our students ``to top all of the rest.''\n  Today, I vote against this bill because I believe it is better to \napprove no bill rather than to approve a bad bill. I am sincerely \nhoping, for the sake of our children, that history will prove me wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for his work on \nthis legislation. He was chairman of our committee when we reported out \nthe Senate version. Sometime after that, we had a change in leadership. \nAs a matter of fact, the bill itself was on the floor. I had the \nopportunity to chair the legislation.\n  The Senate should know that on this legislation, the first parts were \nreported out of the committee when Senator Jeffords was the principal \narchitect. Although we come to different conclusions in terms of the \noutcome on this legislation, I express our great appreciation to him \nfor his longstanding commitment to funding the IDEA. He has been \npassionate about that and has worked on it. He makes a compelling case. \nWe are closer to the day when I think we will get there. I think we \nwill get there, and we are going to. When we do, Senators Jeffords, \nHarkin, and Hagel will all have been enormously helpful in our \nachieving it.\n  The final point I will mention: We have in this legislation expanded \nthe afterschool program by 200,000 children. We still have a long way \nto go. I am mindful that that program started out in 1994 sponsored by \nSenator Jeffords. It started out as a $50 million program and several \nthousand students. Now there are probably more subscriptions for that \nprogram than any other program in these last years because of the \nrecognition of the difference it makes in terms of being a resource for \nchildren to get assistance after school. I thank him for his good work. \nI wish he had come to a different conclusion, but the Senate should \nknow.\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota. We expect him to talk. If I may, I \nyield for 30 seconds to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Kennedy.\n  I had the opportunity yesterday to speak at length on this bill and \nto commend my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg, our \ncolleagues from the other body, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Miller, and Senator \nJeffords for his leadership as chairman.\n  I neglected to commend people who were much responsible for this \nlegislation, and that is staff members, particularly my staff member \nElyse Wasch who did a remarkable job.\n  I also extend my thanks and congratulations to Danica Petroshius, \nRoberto Rodriguez, Michael Dannenberg, Dana Fiordaliso, and Michael \nMyers of the majority staff and Denzel McGuire of the Republican staff. \nTheir efforts were remarkable.\n  Much of the success of the bill was because of these individuals. I \nthank them personally for their great work, particularly Elyse Wasch of \nmy staff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take some time now and I will \nreserve the final 5 minutes right before the vote.\n  Senator Reed, in his characteristically gracious style, thanked his \nstaff and other staff here for their great work. I would as well. I \ninclude Joe Morningstar who works with me in that mix.\n  I also say to Senators Kennedy and Gregg that I appreciate all of \ntheir commitment and all of their very hard work.\n  I say to Senator Jeffords that I greatly appreciate his soul, his \nunbelievable commitment to children, how strongly he feels about this \nquestion.\n\n[[Page S13368]]\n\n And I very much find myself in agreement with his analysis.\n  I must say with a smile that I am amazed that so many of my \ncolleagues are now supporting a Federal mandate right under the school \ndistrict saying every school district--school districts have \nrepresented the essence of graduate political culture in our country--\nevery school district, every school, you will test every child, grades \n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. I must say that I think this oversteps, if not \nthe authority, the sort of boundaries of congressional decisionmaking \non education. Here I am, a liberal Senator from Minnesota, but this is \nmy honest-to-God belief. I am just amazed that so many Senators have \nvoted for this, especially my conservative friends.\n  Having said that, I voted for the bill when it was on the Senate \nfloor for two reasons: One, we had the IDEA program mandatory. That is \nhugely important in terms of getting funding back to our States and \nschool districts. No. 2, I wanted to get on the conference committee to \ntry to make the bill better.\n  I thank both my colleagues. I can't say the Chair and I always agreed \non everything, but I wanted to thank them for letting me be on the \nconference committee. I enjoyed the work. There is a lot of good policy \nin this bill. I will be proud of whatever I contributed, but also many \nSenators contributed to that.\n  Let me just say that for my own part, the big issue with me is this \nsort of rush to testing, as if it is the reform. The testing is \nsupposed to test the reform, it is not supposed to be the reform.\n  This focus on standardized tests, multiple choice tests, and teachers \nteaching to it has become drill education. It is educationally \ndeadening.\n  There are a lot of amendments and provisions in this bill I had a \nchance to work on that talk about high-quality testing, how we do that, \nand multiple measures, giving our States maximum flexibility so that \nthey have 3 years in the aggregate of testing before they begin to use \nthem as high stakes testing, see how schools do. And they don't have to \nstart until 2005 or 2006. Therefore, we don't get the result until 2008 \nor 2009, and I am glad we will not have this mad rush to the worst of \nstandardized testing.\n  There are some good provisions in this bill that will make a \ndifference when it comes to having high-quality testing.\n  We also have very good legislation in here that deals with teacher \nrecruitment and retainment. That had to do with Senators Hutchison, \nClinton, Kennedy, and DeWine. That is a huge issue--how we can recruit \nand retain teachers.\n  Parent information and resource centers, local family information \ncenters, the ways in which you can have parents more involved--and \nquite often you have to do it through some of the nonprofits and \nnongovernmental organizations in the neighborhoods and communities--\nthat is extremely important. We have a great program in Minnesota after \nwhich this is modeled. I am so glad that is in the bill.\n\n  Then I thank Sheila my wife because she is my teacher when it comes \nto violence in homes, and there are some really good provisions in this \nbill that deal with children who witness violence and how to help them.\n  That is all to the good. But we had the chance to make our rhetoric \nof the last 26 years about the IDEA program a reality. We did that on \nthe Senate side, but the House Republican leadership killed it on the \nHouse side and the administration opposed it. That is what I am saddest \nabout. I believe we could have made the fight for children in \neducation, and we could have said to this administration: You cannot \nrealize this goal of leaving no child behind unless the resources are \nthere to go with the testing. The tests don't bring more teachers. The \ntests don't lead to smaller class size. The tests don't lead to good \ntextbooks. The tests don't lead to better technology. The tests don't \nmean the children come to kindergarten ready to learn. All of these \nthings have to change.\n  Without a commitment to making IDEA mandatory and making the full \nfunding over a 6-year period that should have been this year, we cheat \nour States and school districts and our schools, and we cheat our \nteachers and we cheat our children.\n  That is why I oppose this legislation. People in my State of \nMinnesota are angry because they believe by acceding to the House \nRepublican position and the administration position, we have cheated \nMinnesota out of $2 billion of IDEA money over the next 10 years--about \n$45 million on the glidepath this year. They are angry because no \nlonger are we going to be able to have all-day kindergarten in a lot of \nour schools. They are angry because we are having to eliminate some of \nour good early childhood development programs. They are angry because \nwe are going to have to eliminate some of our afterschool programs. And \nthey are angry because we are eliminating teachers and we are \nincreasing class size. They are angry because we are having to make \ncuts in the school lunch program. They are angry because we are having \nto make cuts in transportation.\n  There are first graders who are going to have to walk a mile, and \nseventh graders 2 miles, to go to school because the bus service has \nbeen cut out.\n  Colleagues, if we had lived up to our commitment on full funding of \nIDEA, we would not have to make those cuts in Minnesota. But we did. \nThat is why I will vote no. I will vote no for my State of Minnesota.\n  The Center for Education Policy has a quote that I think is so \nimportant:\n  Policymakers are being irresponsible if they lead the public into \nthinking that testing and accountability alone will close the learning \ngap. Policymakers on the State and national level should be wary of \nproposals that embrace the rhetoric of closing the gap, but do not help \nbuild the capacity to accomplish that goal.\n\n  I believe what we have here is a Federal unfunded mandate calling on \nour States and school districts to do more with less, calling on them \nto test every child every year, grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and telling \nthem that they have to do so without a Federal mandate that every child \nwill have the same opportunity to do well on these tests.\n  Where are the resources to make sure that all the children in America \nhave the same chance to do well? And when they don't do well on these \ntests or the schools don't do well, where are the additional resources \nto help them? Not in this bill. When you start talking about we have \nincreased funding for title I, no, not in real dollar terms. We are in \na recession. There are many more children who are eligible. We are not \ndoing any more funding in real terms. About a third of the eligible \nchildren are going to get the funding, and that is it. We didn't live \nup to our commitment to fully fund the IDEA program, and there is a \npittance in the Federal budget for early childhood development so that \nchildren can come to school ready to learn.\n  The President and the administration talk about leaving no child \nbehind--the mission of the Children's Defense Fund--and that is the \ntitle of this bill. We cannot realize the goal of leaving no child \nbehind on a tin cup budget. We are setting a lot of schools and \nchildren and school districts up for failure because we have not lived \nup to this promise. We are calling on the schools to be more \naccountable. But what about our accountability to our States and our \nschool districts and our teachers and our children? We have failed the \ntest of accountability by not making the IDEA program mandatory and \nproviding full funding. We have failed the test of accountability by \nnot providing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator has 5 minutes \nremaining. The Senator wanted to be informed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Five minutes of the original 15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield 5 minutes of our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for his graciousness.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were trying to arrange some additional \ntime. We were unable to do that. The vote will occur around 12 noon \ntoday.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have made my point. I will say to colleagues that I \nam amazed that Senators don't want to have a little more debate on \nthis. What is the problem? There are people who want to speak against \nit, too. I am just amazed that apparently my colleagues\n\n[[Page S13369]]\n\non the Republican side, I gather, are opposed to this. They don't want \nto have more debate. I don't blame you because a lot of people in our \nStates are going to feel quite betrayed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I don't understand the Senator's accusation \nagainst Republicans on that issue. The time agreement on this bill was \nreached between the majority party and the minority party. It was not \nunilaterally agreed to by the minority party. It was put forward by the \nleadership on both sides. Do not accuse the Republican side of the \naisle of being the people who are trying to limit this. You have an \nopportunity to speak. You got 15 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has been kind enough to offer you more. I will offer \nyou 5 more minutes of my time if you want more.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Since the Senator speaks with such indignation, I am \npleased to offer an explanation. First of all, it is not about me; it \nis about other colleagues who want to speak. Yesterday, we had an \nunderstanding for 2 hours and a half hour--or 1 hour and a half hour. \nThen there was a unanimous consent yesterday to extend an additional \nhour for the proponents. I asked the majority whip whether we could \nhave more time for other Senators to speak, and my understanding is \nthat that is fine on our side, but the Republicans have turned that \nproposal down, in which case, Senator, I stand by my remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds Senators to address each \nother in the third person and through the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Let's make sure we \nhave the time down here. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nMassachusetts graciously agreed to give the Senator from Minnesota 5 \nminutes, and the Senator from New Hampshire also agreed to give him an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will reserve that. The Senator has \nclearly rejected my offer.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Minnesota has an additional 5 minutes that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts extended. I ask that that be approved by \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Senator this. There were several other \nSenators who wanted to speak in opposition. The Senator from Minnesota, \nMr. Dayton, is one.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Vermont allocated the Senator his 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and he has 5 from Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. All together I have how much time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. Plus the 7\\1/2\\ minutes from the Senator from Vermont, who \nagreed to let him use that time, but also 5 minutes from the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I guess we are going to have more \ndiscussion on these points. I think it is appropriate at this time to \nbriefly respond to the Senator from Minnesota relative to his \nrepresentations on especially IDEA funding.\n  There is a history to this funding which I think has to be reviewed. \nDuring the Clinton administration, not once in the first 7 years of \nthat administration was there an increase sent to the Congress for \nspecial education funding--not once--of any significance at all.\n  However, a group of us on our side of the aisle said that was not \nright. We decided to significantly increase the IDEA funding beginning \nabout 5 years ago. We were successful in accomplishing that. Over the \nlast 5 years, we have increased IDEA funding, special education \nfunding, by 173 percent. That is the single largest percentage increase \nthat any significant policy account has received over the last 5 years.\n  The new President, President Bush, also understood, because he was a \nGovernor who was sensitive to this issue, that IDEA was not properly \nfunded.\n  He sent up in his budget the single largest increase in IDEA funding \never proposed by an administration. At the end of this appropriating \nprocess which will occur this year, hopefully before Christmas, IDEA \nfunding will have gone from approximately 6 percent when we began this \nprocess in 1995 and 1996, up to approximately 20 percent of the cost of \nIDEA, not the 40 percent which is our goal, but the obvious path which \nis being pursued is towards full funding.\n  I do not believe the Senator from Minnesota voted against any of the \nbudgets offered by President Clinton which had zero increases in \nspecial education funding. I do not believe he did. But he comes here \ntoday and says that because special education funding was not included \nin this bill which deals with title I funding we should vote against \ntitle I funding.\n  I find that inherently inconsistent, first because we are on a path \ntowards full funding of special education, but second, by voting \nagainst a bill which significantly increases funding for title I, which \nis the low-income children of this country and who represent a primary \nresponsibility of the Federal Government, which we have assumed as a \nFederal Government, we are undercutting the capacity of those children \nto have a chance to compete effectively in the school systems.\n  These are two different issues, special education and title I. Yes, \nthere is overlap on children, no question about it, but the policy \nissues involved in the two are significantly different. So a decision \nwas made since we are going to reauthorize special education next year \nthat we should take on the policy issues of special education and the \nfunding issues of special education as a package, as a unit, and do it \nnext year, in the context of the fact we are increasing special \neducation this year by over $1 billion. It is not as if we are saying \nwe are not going to do anything in the special education accounts for \ndollars; we are actually increasing it by $1 billion this year. The \nmoney is being put on the table, but the policy that needs to be \naddressed in the special education accounts are as important as the \ndollars that need to be addressed. For example, the issue of discipline \nneeds to be addressed. The disparity in discipline between special \neducation kids and kids who are not in special education is a big \nproblem in school systems.\n  The issue of bureaucracy needs to be addressed. It is extremely \nexpensive to school districts to meet the bureaucratic requirements of \nIDEA.\n  The issue of attorney's fees needs to be addressed. We have created a \ncottage industry for attorneys dealing with special education. We need \nto address that.\n  There are significant policy concerns which should be addressed at \nthe same time we address the issue of how we set up the funding stream. \nI have one other point on the mandatory funding stream. This in some \nways is a smokescreen because, as I pointed out, there is a dramatic \nexpansion in funding occurring in special education.\n  The question is, Is that money going to come out of the discretionary \naccounts or is it going to come out of the mandatory accounts, and that \nis an inside-the-beltway baseball game, but it is a big game because if \nwe move it all over to the mandatory accounts, basically we free up $7 \nbillion in the discretionary accounts. That is $7 billion the \nAppropriations Committee, on which I have the honor to serve, has \navailable to spend on anything they want to spend it on. It does not \nhave to spend it on education. It frees up that money.\n  A lot of this exercise in mandatory accounts is an exercise to free \nup $7 billion of discretionary spending.\n  I do think the argument that because the IDEA language was not \nincluded in this bill, therefore, I am going to vote against the title \nI reform language is inconsistent with the fact pattern because we know \nwe are going to reauthorize special education next year, we know we \nwill visit the issue of mandatory spending next year, and, at the same \ntime, we know we are significantly increasing special education funding \nthis year through the discretionary accounts; we have done it over the \nlast 6 years.\n  I find that argument to be one that does not have much in the way of \nlegs,\n\n[[Page S13370]]\n\nas far as I am concerned, as a reason to oppose this bill. There may be \nother issues in this bill, and the Senator from Minnesota raised the \nissue of testing. That is a legitimate issue in this bill. We are \nsignificantly changing the role of the Federal Government relative to \ntesting in the States. That is a legitimate issue. I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota feels strongly about that issue and has very credible \narguments, in my opinion, but the IDEA is another issue.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Idaho 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthe bill. I came down to express my strong support for this \nlegislation, not only because of the important reforms in education \nthat it proposes but because of the significant new resources that the \nFederal Government will be providing to public education, and also to \ndiscuss the fact we are going to be moving forward from this \nlegislation to reform and strengthen the IDEA legislation next year. I \nlook forward to being a part of that process and working with our \nchairman and ranking member on addressing these critical needs of our \nchildren.\n  I have worked for the last 3 or 4 years myself with the committee and \nwith others to see if we could somehow reach that goal of 40-percent \nfunding for IDEA, which is our objective. We have had a lot of \ndifficult battles over that issue, and we have had a number of votes to \ntry to get us moving down that path. We are on the path toward \nachieving that objective.\n  I certainly agree with my good friend, Senator Gregg, about the fact \nbecause we have not yet achieved success does not mean we should vote \nagainst this legislation. I also have concerns about the testing \nlanguage in the legislation. I have concerns about where we should \naddress a number of the critical issues in education.\n  Not everything in this legislation is as I would have had it. \nHowever, I consider this bill to be an important step forward, and I \nlook forward to working with the committee next year on achieving both \nsubstantive reforms and the financial commitment we need to make to \nIDEA.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I want to take 1 \nminute to respond, and I want to yield the floor to Senator Dayton for \na few minutes, and that will be in opposition.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there is an order, and the time is being \ncontrolled by the Senator from Massachusetts, not by the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, after the Senator winds up, I was hoping \nwe were going to go to Senator Mikulski. The Senator had been \nrecognized for 15 minutes and then the tentative agreement is that \nSenator Mikulski was going to be able to respond. We are trying to work \nout an accommodation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How about Senator Mikulski speaking and then Senator \nDayton will follow?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are trying to go from one side to the other.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is what I was trying to do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought the Senator was trying to get Senator Dayton \nafter himself.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am going to yield time to Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts \nwhat order we are in, and I am happy to take whatever order he deems \nappropriate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought the Senator might be here a little after 10:30 \na.m., if that is convenient to the Senator. We are trying to do the \nbest we can, but we do have an order. I am glad to yield 3 minutes to \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I wish to make clear \nthat I will vote for the legislation called the No Child Left Behind \nAct. The reason I am going to vote for this legislation is because I am \na pragmatist. Does the legislation do everything in education that I \nwant done? No. Does it do everything on funding the way I want it to be \ndone? No. But there is a crying need in our public schools to pass this \nmodernization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and I do \nnot want to make this legislation be an example of the perfect is the \nenemy of the good.\n  We do many fine things in this legislation. Technology is one area in \nwhich I have been concentrating.\n  This bill does include my amendment to create an education technology \ngoal that every child be computer literate by the eighth grade. It \nincludes my amendment to authorize community tech centers to create and \nexpand community tech centers in rural and distressed urban areas, in \nother words, to bridge the digital divide and allows the Department of \nEducation to provide competitive grants to community-based \norganizations.\n  These nonprofits would set up technology centers where children and \nadults would have access to technology. What does this mean? It means a \nsafe haven for children; it lets them do their homework as well as surf \nthe Web. It also means job training for adults during the day. This \nlegislation also includes more flexibility for the tech approach, such \nas maintenance and repair.\n  In Baltimore, the Social Security Administration gave over 1,000 \ncomputers to the Baltimore city school system, but they needed repairs. \nSome of the microchips had been broken. No one could afford to pay for \nthem. My amendment would allow schools greater flexibility to have \nthese public-private partnerships to repair this equipment.\n  Now I will address the issue of IDEA. Full funding for IDEA is \nessential for our special needs children and all of the children. Had \nthe Senate passed the Harkin-Hagel amendment, this would have meant $42 \nmillion for my State, as well as an increase of $2.5 billion in overall \nIDEA funding. Yet that approach was rejected by the House conferees.\n  I salute Senator Jeffords and Haskin others who led the fight to add \nmore money for IDEA, because at the rate we are funding IDEA it will \ntake us to the year 2017 to fund IDEA at the 40 percent we promised 26 \nyears ago. However, I chose not to hold up this bill over this topic \nbecause there is increased funding and next year we are going to \naddress the issue of IDEA, which is: What is the right money and what \nis the right policy?\n  Since the IDEA legislation was passed 26 years ago, so many of our \nchildren come to school now far more medically challenged than when the \nlegislation was passed, far more challenged with psychological or other \nlearning disabilities. I think we need to take a new look, based on \nresearch-driven recommendations, that will give us the guiding \nprinciples on what is the right way to handle special needs children \nbecause of the complexity of their needs. It is often not only someone \nwho helps sign in the classroom, but it is often the school nurse who \nnow is required to dispense medication or medical treatment.\n  I could say a lot more about this bill, but when they call my name I \nwill vote aye. I congratulate Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Jeffords for \nmoving this legislation in the Senate. I also want to thank their \nstaffs and my staff for their outstanding work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think the Senator from Minnesota is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that the \nSenator from Minnesota is next.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had indicated we were going to \nalternate. The last time I saw Senator Mikulski she was a Democrat, so \nnow we will go to the Republican side. That is what I indicated \nearlier. That is the way we proceeded yesterday. That is our \nunderstanding today, and that is the way we will proceed right now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my friend, I thought we were taking a \nviewpoint on----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are going from one side to the other.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What is the ruling of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota controls his own\n\n[[Page S13371]]\n\ntime. It was the understanding of the Chair that Senator Dayton was to \nbe next, using Senator Wellstone's time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nDayton, Senator Bond be recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my decision to \nvote against the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Conference \nReport.\n  Let me first say what enormous respect I have for the bill's manager, \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who, throughout his \nSenate career, has fought heroically to improve the quality of \neducation for our nation's schoolchildren. He and other Senate \nconferees have labored long and hard for months to negotiate the best \nbill possible with the House and the White House, who have other, \nhigher priorities. All year long, they have placed tax giveaways to the \nrich and the powerful above our nation's schoolchildren.\n  Let there be no doubt: this legislation fails to achieve the \nPresident's stated goal: ``Leave No Child Behind.'' President Bush, \nthis legislation leaves many thousands of children behind throughout \nthis country. It fails, for the 25th consecutive year, to keep the \nFederal promise to pay for 40 percent of the costs of special \neducation. This broken promise is costing my state of Minnesota over \n$183 million this year. It means the 110,000 Minnesota schoolchildren \nin these programs are receiving less special education than they need \nand deserve. It means that other Minnesota schoolchildren are harmed, \nas state and local money intended for their educations must be shifted \nto cover the Federal shortfall. It means that Minnesota taxpayers must \npay higher property taxes to fund this broken Federal promise.\n  To make matters worse, the House conferees refused to accept the \nSenate's bipartisan commitment to bring Federal funding for special \neducation to 40 percent over the next six years. Earlier this year, Mr. \nPresident, I proposed an amendment to this legislation, which would \nhave funded the 40 percent promise in two years. That amendment was \ndefeated, in favor of a six-year timetable. Now, the House Republicans \nare saying that even six years is too soon.\n  That is absolutely unconscionable, unjustifiable, and it should be, \nto this Senate, unacceptable. As a result, under this legislation, next \nyear's Federal funding for IDEA will cover only 17.5 percent of those \ncosts nationwide. In Minnesota, it will fund only 15 percent. This \nfailure will leave thousands of children behind.\n  House Republicans reportedly refused to accept the Senate position \nuntil after IDEA is ``reformed.'' Yet, just a few weeks earlier, the \nHouse added over $30 billion in tax breaks to large energy companies in \ntheir Energy Bill. The House Economic Stimulus package would repeal the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax, and it would refund over $25 billion \nto some of America's largest and most profitable corporations. Neither \nof these two huge tax giveaways was predicated on any kind of \n``reform.''\n  The failure to fully fund IDEA is tragic, because that money was \navailable earlier this year. There was also enough money to \nsignificantly increase the Federal government's support of all \nelementary and secondary education nationwide. But massive tax cuts for \nthe rich and powerful were the President's and the House Republicans' \nhigher priorities. Now, those projected Federal surpluses are gone, and \nour nation's schoolchildren must wait in line again.\n  Less money and more testing. That will be the legacy of this \n``education President.'' Well, the President and the Congress have \nfailed their big education test this year. It shouldn't be surprising \nwhen, as a direct result of their failure, more of our nation's schools \nand schoolchildren do also in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as a member of the conference committee, we \nspent nearly 6 months crafting this bill. I am pleased to rise in \nsupport of this landmark legislation which leaves no child behind.\n  As many of my colleagues have already mentioned, this bill provides \nthe most comprehensive education reform since 1965. I take this \nopportunity to thank and congratulate the leader on our side, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, and the manager of the bill, the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. \nTheir tireless work to bring this bill to the Senate has placed \ncomprehensive education reform within reach of all students across the \ncountry.\n  Too many children in America are segregated by low expectations, \nilliteracy, and self-doubt. In a constantly changing world that demands \nincreasingly complex skills from its workforce, children are being left \nbehind. Over the years, we have empowered the Federal Government and \nfaceless bureaucrats while burying our educators and schools in \nregulation, redtape, mandates, and endless paperwork. As a result, we \nhave disenfranchised educators and slowly eroded the opportunity for \ncreativity and innovation at the local level.\n  At last count, the Federal Government had 760 different education \nprograms operating within 39 different agencies, boards, and \ncommissions. Each was launched as a step toward reform, but each new \nprogram comes with added regulation and paperwork.\n\n  By one estimate, compliance consumes 50 million hours each year, the \nequivalent of 25,000 full-time employees just to process the forms. Ask \nthe teacher who has to deal with 760 programs, or the administrator who \nhas to handle it, just how much this detailed reform and direction from \nWashington has helped them focus on their children. In my State they \nwill say ``not one bit.''\n  Today, nearly 70 percent of low-income fourth graders are unable to \nread at a basic level. Our high school seniors trail students of most \nindustrialized nations on international math tests. Nearly a third of \nour college freshmen must take a remedial course before they are able \nto begin college level courses. This is why President Bush has chosen \neducation reform as a cornerstone of his administration.\n  This conference report reflects an agenda that President Bush \noutlined during his first days in office. It emphasizes flexibility, \nlocal control, accountability, literacy, and parental involvement. I am \nhonored to have had a hand in shaping that policy. Parental \ninvolvement, early childhood, and parents as teachers are issues I have \nworked with a long time. I am pleased the principles of my direct check \nfor education were included in the legislation. Over the years, I have \nworked with Missouri educators to develop the direct check approach to \neducation reform, which consolidates Federal education programs, cuts \nFederal strings and paperwork, and sends the money directly to local \nschool districts.\n  Like my direct check proposal, this conference report recognizes that \neducational reform and progress will take place in the classrooms in \nAmerica, not in Washington, DC. This report consolidates a myriad of \nexisting Federal programs and allows States and local school districts \nto make decisions on their own, to determine their priorities. By \nreducing the mandates, as well as the costly and time-consuming \npaperwork that local school districts must endure to obtain Federal \ngrants and funding, parents and teachers are empowered to take back \ncontrol of educating our Nation's children.\n  To me, the issue is simple. We must empower our States and local \nschool districts with flexibility to utilize the limited amount of \nFederal resources as they best see fit to educate our children. This \nconference report does just that. Local schools will immediately be \ngiven the flexibility they need, where they are most needed, because a \nschool in Joplin, MO, may have different needs than one in Hannibal, \nKansas City, St. Louis, or Boonville, MO.\n  Some schools need new teachers. Others may need new textbooks or \ncomputers, or wish to begin an after-school program.\n  We simply cannot continue to ask teachers and local schools to meet \nhigher expectations without empowering them with the freedom and \nflexibility to do the job.\n\n[[Page S13372]]\n\n  This legislation strikes a delicate balance. It keeps the Federal \nGovernment out of the day-to-day operations of local schools; gives \nStates and school districts more authority and freedom; and requires \nperformance in return.\n  Education, while a national priority, remains a local responsibility. \nI believe that those who know the names of the students are better at \nmaking decisions than bureaucrats at the Department of \nEducation. Parents, teachers, local school boards are the key to true \neducation reform, not big government, Washington-based educational \nbureaucracy. In addition to giving local schools more control, I am \npleased this conference report recognizes parental involvement and \nincreases resources to our very successful Parents as Teachers Program \nwhich we hope to provide to every State in the Nation as well as \nforeign countries. It strengthens accountability, it provides the \nnecessary funds to attract and retain quality teachers, and develops \nliteracy programs to guarantee all students will be able to read by the \nthird grade.\n\n  With its emphasis on the child rather than the bureaucracy, this \nlegislation offers an opportunity to make real progress in our schools.\n  The great Missourian Mark Twain said: Out of public schools grows the \ngreatness of a nation.\n  One-sixth of the American population is enrolled in public schools. \nThe content and quality of their education will determine the character \nof our country.\n  I thank the managers of this bill for their courtesy to me as well as \nfor their great work over the 6 months in bringing this conference \nreport to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. As he \nmentioned in his comments, he, as a Governor, was involved in the \nParents as Teachers Program. We have developed a different way of \nrecognizing this as a national problem, a national challenge, and \ndifferent ways to bring people into the teaching profession. His is one \nof the imaginative and creative programs. We always welcome his \ncontinued interest in this program.\n  Before yielding 3 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, I take a \nbrief moment to respond to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I gather there are three major points the Senator made, one about the \nfunding for the IDEA program. I am in strong support of that program. \nIt seems to me we are only meeting 17 percent of our responsibilities. \nWe are pitting children, title I children, against disabled children. \nTwo-thirds of those who receive the funding under special needs are \ntitle I children. We are talking about a similar group of children. We \nare trying to bring about significant reforms in this program. We will \nbring about the reforms next, but we should move ahead and recognize we \nare going to try to be of assistance to them. I am sympathetic and a \nstrong supporter of that.\n  However, I don't know whether the Senator has read the conference \nreport when it comes to testing because we have effectively accepted \nthe Senator's amendments. The Senator is quite correct, testing is not \nperformed.\n  We have a situation with some States spending $1.46 per student in \none State and another State is $3.16, another State is $3.21. In this \nlegislation we are committing with a trigger that says, if the \nresources are not there, these provisions do not apply.\n  We have the most overtested group of students in the country. We \nunderstand that. However, what we do not have are content standards \nestablished by the States, curriculums established by the States, well-\ntrained teachers to be able to teach the curriculum, and assessments \nabout how the children are doing so they can be assisted in academic \nachievement and accomplishment. That is what this bill is committed to, \nnot off-the-shelf tests.\n  We do a disservice in describing this bill as the off-the-shelf test. \nIt is not. It has been rejected. If the Senator read page 458, he would \nsee his language is effectively accepted to enable States or \nconsortiums of States to collaborate with institutions of higher \neducation, other research institutions, other organizations, to improve \nquality, validity, and reliability of State academic assessments beyond \nthe requirements for such assessments described in the act, and \nmeasuring students' academic achievement using multiple measures from \nmultiple sources.\n  We have leaned over backwards to do it right. The Senator was right \nin his amendment. We have it right in this program. To try to distort \nit does not serve the issue well. It is not an accurate reflection of \nwhat is in the bill.\n  I do not yield to the Senator from Minnesota or anyone else in terms \nof getting additional resources. We started with modest resources, the \n3-percent increase in terms of the title I program. That happened to be \nincreased to 20 percent. We started off with only a third of the \nchildren covered. It is true, we are facing recession and there will be \n600,000 more children covered under this program. They are going to \nbe eligible this year because of the state of the economy, but we only \nreach 40 percent of the Head Start children. Are we against Head Start \nbecause it only reaches 40 percent? Are we breaking our promises? We \nare out here to try to get full investment in these reforms. That is \nwhat I am committed to do.\n\n  I think we have made some progress. It is always easy to criticize \nthe failures, but I think, along with our colleagues, this is one of \nthe most important efforts made by the Congress in terms of enhancing \nacademic achievement and accomplishment. We might come back to the \nother areas, but I thought this was the time to respond.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana. I thank the Senator. \nThere is additional targeting. Under this bill, Minnesota would get $20 \nmillion more for title I. But the targeting, both in urban areas and \nrural areas, is a direct tribute to the Senator from Louisiana. She \nfought for that and built a coalition. It is always difficult to alter \nor change formulas. It is a significant alteration to reach the \nneediest children. We are grateful to her for her commitment in this \narea.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor those kind remarks and I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg \nfor their extraordinary effort that has not gone unnoticed by the \nMembers of this Senate and all the people who have followed so closely \nthe tireless efforts to get to this point where we can support such a \nsolid, principled compromise that all Members can be proud of passing \ntoday. It is a great victory for our school system and our Nation and \nfor the Presiding Officer, in the role played as a former Governor of \nIndiana. I thank also Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, and Senator \nSessions. It was a really bipartisan effort. And to the President, I \nsay thank you. Through all of the efforts, along with the war in \nAfghanistan and our defense, trying to stand up and defend our \nhomeland, the President stayed focused on education. We stayed focused \non education. I think that speaks well of the work we have done. I am \nproud to be a part of it.\n\n  This bill works for our Nation to strengthen our schools and to build \non a promise that every child deserves a quality education and the \nbelief that we can fund it and strengthen it so that every child can \nlearn and so that every child should have an opportunity--not a \nguarantee but an opportunity--to be all that God created them to be and \nall their parents and loved ones hope for them to be.\n  That is why I am excited about this bill. It outlines some new goals \nand objectives that are going to be difficult and challenging. But we \nneed to lift those expectations for our children. We need to challenge \nour Nation. We need to fund it.\n  That is why I thank Senator Kennedy, our leader from Massachusetts. \nHe fought like a tiger to say: Yes, we want accountability. Yes, we \nwant flexibility. Yes, we want to work in partnership with the \nGovernors, but we want to give them the resources to fight the battle. \nThat is what this bill does. It is the single largest investment in \neducation in a single year.\n  I also thank the Governors who are our partners--the 23 Governors who \nare on the front line with mayors and school boards around the Nation \nleading this fight for their support.\n  Let me focus on three issues.\n  First, accountability. We say if you are going to run a school, run \nit right. If not, we are going to reconstitute it so that every child \nhas a chance.\n\n[[Page S13373]]\n\n  Second, the flexibility issues that we fund at the Federal level, but \nwe allow the local jurisdictions to make those decisions.\n  Third, targeting. Senator Kennedy mentioned this. I want to say for \nLouisiana that this will mean $100 million more for title I to help \nwith the resources to make these classes really work for children. It \nwill help us with technology and will make sure kids really have an \nopportunity. It is going to help us with afterschool programs. It is \nnot just given out by a grant but a formula, so we get it to the \nparishes that really need the most help. This will give them the \nhelping hand.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues. I could speak for hours and days. I \ncongratulate our leaders for doing such a fine job. It was a joy for me \nto work on this bill. It will mean a lot to the kids in Louisiana and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my colleagues \non the conference committee for their efforts on behalf of our Nation's \nschool children. This legislation encompasses a number of important \nreforms for our schools. One notable provision reforms the collection \nand dissemination of personal information collected from students to \nprotect their privacy.\n  Earlier this year Senator Dodd and I introduced the Student Privacy \nProtection Act. The goal of this legislation is to ensure that parents \nhave the ability to protect their children's privacy by requiring \nparental notification of any data collection for commercial purposes \nfrom their children during the school day. I am pleased that the \nconference agreed with Senator Dodd and me on the importance of \nprotecting student's privacy and the essential nature of parental \nparticipation in the process.\n  The need for this provision stems from the growing practice of a \nlarge number of marketing companies going into classrooms and using \nclass time to gather personal information about students and their \nfamilies for purely commercial purposes. In many cases, parents are not \neven aware that these companies have entered their children's school, \nmuch less that they are exploiting them in the one place they should be \nthe safest, their classroom.\n  The provision included in H.R. 1 builds on a long line of privacy \nlegislation to protect kids, such as the Family Educational Rights Act, \nthe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the Protection of \nPupil Rights Act. The goal of these laws, as is the case with our \nprovision, is to ensure that the privacy of children is protected and \nthat their personal information cannot be collected and/or disseminated \nwithout the prior knowledge and, most importantly, the ability of \nparents to exclude their children from such activities.\n  We understand that schools today are financially strapped and many of \nthese companies offer enticing financial incentives to gain access. Our \ngoal is not to make it more difficult for schools to access the \neducational materials and the computers that they so desperately need \nor to deter beneficial relationships. Rather our goal is to ensure that \nthe details of these arrangements are disclosed and that parents are \nallowed to participate in the decisionmaking process.\n  The bottom line is that parents have a right and a responsibility to \nbe involved in their children's education. Much of these noneducational \nactivities are being done at the expense of the parents' decision \nmaking authority because schools are allowing companies direct access \nto students. The provision included in H.R. 1 enhances parental \ninvolvement by giving them an opportunity to decide for themselves who \ndoes and does not get access to their children during the school day.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the bipartisan education bill before \nthe Senate today puts in place some strong and unprecedented reforms in \nelementary and secondary education to make schools more accountable and \nhelp students learn. For the public, this bill helps assure that our \nschools get results and that we know what those results are. \nCalifornia's public schools should be helped by this bill.\n  To bolster student achievement, this bill includes several needed \nreforms, tying the receipt of Federal funds to getting results:\n  The bill continues the current requirement that States must have \nacademic standards for reading and math and adds a requirement that \nStates establish standards for science.\n  Schools must assure that students make continuous and substantial \nacademic improvement and that students reach a proficient level within \n12 years.\n  To measure student achievement, States are required to test every \nstudent in grades 3-8 annually in reading and math based on State \nstandards, by 2005-06.\n  To ensure accountability, schools that fail for 2 consecutive years \nto make adequate yearly progress must be identified for improvement and \nalso must identify specific steps to improve student performance.\n  After 3 years, a failing school must offer public school choice and \nprovide supplemental services. After 4 years, a school must take \ncorrective actions such as replacing staff or implementing a new \ncurriculum. After 5 years, a failing school must undertake major \nrestructuring. The bill provides $500 million to help turn around low-\nperforming schools.\n  In order to improve teacher quality, this bill authorizes grants to \nStates for teacher certification, recruitment, and retention services. \nStates must assure that all teachers are qualified by 2006.\n  The bill authorizes $1.25 billion in 2002 and up to $2.5 billion in \n2007 for afterschool programs remedial education, tutoring and other \nservices to improve student achievement.\n  The bill requires public ``report cards,'' which will report on \nacademic achievement, graduation rates and the names of failing \nschools.\n  There are many other important initiatives and reforms.\n  Another important feature of this bill is that it better directs \nFederal funds to disadvantaged students than does current law. Here are \nsome examples:\n  It requires that for the largest Federal education program, Title I, \nAid to the Disadvantaged, the poor children count be updated every year \ninstead of every 2 years under current law. This is very important to \nCalifornia, a State that has a higher than average poverty rate and \nhigh growth in the number of low-income children.\n  The bill requires that more funds be funneled to States and districts \nusing the targeted grant formula, which is focused on concentrations of \npoverty, areas such as Los Angeles, San Diego and other major cities. \nCalifornia is expected to receive a larger share of targeted grant \nfunding than under current law because of its concentrated child \npoverty enrollment.\n  The bill shifts bilingual and immigrant education funding from a \ncompetitive grant program to a formula grant program based on the \nnumber of children. California has a very high proportion of limited-\nEnglish proficient and newly-immigrant children and should be greatly \nhelped by this change.\n  These are welcomed changes and should send the resources to where the \nneeds are.\n  The Federal Government provides only 7 percent of total education \nfunding, but the strength of this bill is that it tries to leverage the \nFederal share to prod States and school districts to make schools \nresponsible for real results. I believe the bill offers hope and \nresources to California's students, school officials, parents, and the \npublic.\n  California's schools are facing huge challenges. California has a \nprojected enrollment rate triple that of the national rate. \nUnfortunately, many California students perform poorly compared to \nstudents in many other States. California has some of the largest \nclasses in the Nation. California has overcrowded and substandard \nfacilities and 30,000 uncredentialed teachers.\n  I am sorry to say that 34 percent of California's schools that \nparticipate in Title I are identified for improvement compared to the \nnational average of 19 percent, according to the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  According to the January 2001 Education Weekly Quarterly Report, only \n20 percent of California's fourth grade students are proficient in \nreading, ranking 36 out of 39 States. California ranks 32 out of 36 \nStates for proficient eighth graders in reading, at 22 percent.\n  American students are falling behind their counterparts in other \ncountries.\n  In literacy, 58 percent of U.S. high school graduates rank below an \ninternational literacy standard, dead last\n\n[[Page S13374]]\n\namong the 29 countries that participated, according to Education Week, \nApril 4, 2001.\n  United States eighth graders scored significantly lower in \nmathematics and science than their peers in 14 of the 38 participating \ncountries, according to the 1999 TIMMS Benchmarking Study.\n  The percentage of teachers in the United States that feel they are \n``very well prepared'' to teach science in the classroom is 27 percent. \nThe international average is twice that, peaking at 56 percent, \naccording to the 1999 TIMMS Benchmarking Study.\n  United States students' knowledge of civic activities ranked 3rd out \nof the 28 countries that participated. However, those same students \nhave been slipping in scores relating to math and science, according to \nCivic Know-How: US Students Rise to Test, International Association for \nthe Evaluation of Educational Achievement.\n  The final bill includes several initiatives that I suggested:\n  As to Title I funding, I have long argued that Title I should reflect \nthe real numbers of poor students. This bill retains the requirement \nthat the poor child count be updated every two years. Also, the bill \nbetter targets funds on concentrations of poor children, which should \nparticularly help our urban school districts, like Los Angeles.\n  As to master teachers, the bill allows funds under the teacher \ntraining title to create ``exemplary'' or ``master'' teachers who could \nmentor and guide less-experienced teachers, in an effort to keep new \nteachers in teaching. This is an outgrowth of my bill, S. 120.\n  As to the Title I audit, the bill requires the Inspector General to \nconduct of audit to determine how Title I funds are used and the degree \nto which they are used for academic instruction. The Senate had \naccepted my amendment to better direct Title I funds to academic \nactivities and away from things like playground supervisors. While the \nlimitations of my amendment are not included in the final bill, the \nrequired audit will help us determine specifically whether Title I \nfunds are being used to help students learn.\n  As to small schools, the bill allows the use of Innovative Education \nfunds to create smaller learning environments. While the final bill \ndoes not include my amendment that puts in place certain school-size \nrequirements, as a condition for receiving funds, it does move that \ndirection and recognize that smaller schools produce more learning.\n  As to gun-free schools clarification, the bill includes several \nclarifications of the current Gun-Free Schools Act, the 1994 law which \nrequires a 1-year expulsion for students who ``bring'' a gun to school. \nThis bill includes students who ``possess'' a gun at school; it \nclarifies that the term ``school'' means the entire school campus, any \nsetting under the control and supervision of the local school district; \nand it requires that all modifications of expulsions be put in writing. \nThese are important clarifications to the law, the need for which was \nhighlighted by an Inspector General's report on the implementation of \nthat law.\n  This bill makes some of the most profound revisions to Federal \neducation policy since ESEA was first enacted in 1965. It is an \nimportant reform designed to help students learn, achieve and in fact, \nexcel.\n  The bill authorizes significant new funding. For example, Title I's \nauthorized funding would grow from $13.5 billion in fiscal year 2002 to \n$25 billion in 2007. Now the challenge is to in fact provide those \nfunds so that this bill will not be an empty promise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1, \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, which will reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, ESEA.\n  Last year, presidential candidate George W. Bush appropriately \nindicated that education reform was a top priority. This year, \nPresident Bush has worked to make this top priority a reality. The \nSenate will soon pass H.R. 1, legislation which is based on President \nBush's education blueprint, entitled, ``No Child Left Behind.'' I share \nthe President's goal; our educational system must leave no child \nbehind.\n  I commend President Bush, Secretary of Education Paige, and my \ncolleagues who served with me on the Education Conference Committee. We \nhave worked in bipartisan fashion to forge this legislation that will \nsubstantively reform elementary and secondary education in this \ncountry.\n  Education is the key to a better quality of life for all Americans. \nFrom early childhood through adult life, educational resources must be \nprovided and supported through partnerships with individuals, parents, \ncommunities, and local government. The Federal Government has a limited \nbut important role in assisting states and local authorities with the \never-increasing burdens of education.\n  Originally passed in 1965, the ESEA provides authority for most \nfederal programs for elementary and secondary education. ESEA programs \ncurrently receive about $18 billion in federal funding, which amounts \nto an estimated 7 cents out of every dollar that is spent on education.\n  Nearly half of ESEA funds are used on behalf of children from low-\nincome families under title I. Since 1965, the federal government has \nspent more than $120 billion on Title I.\n  Despite the conscientious efforts of federal, state, and local \nentities over many years, our education system continues to lag behind \nother comparable nations. Nearly 70 percent of inner city fourth \ngraders are unable to read at a basic level on national reading tests. \nFourth grade math students in high poverty schools remain two grade \nlevels behind their peers in other schools. Our high school seniors \nscore lower than students in most industrialized nations on \ninternational math tests. And, approximately one-third of college \nfreshman must take a remedial course before they are able to even begin \ncollege level courses.\n  The underlying issue is--do we just pour more taxpayer dollars to \nperpetuate these mediocre results or do we take some bold new \ninitiatives?\n  The No Child Left Behind Act takes some bold new initiatives by \nincreasing federal education funding, increasing state and local \nflexibility in their use of Federal funds, and increasing \naccountability--each are steps in the right direction.\n  First, in regard to funding, the No Child Left Behind Act authorizes \n$26.5 billion for elementary and secondary education. This includes a \nsubstantial increase for Title I programs--which are education programs \ndirected toward disadvantaged children. The bill also provides \nsubstantial funding for programs aimed at having all children read by \nthe 3rd grade, teacher quality programs, and programs aimed at making \nour schools safe and drug free.\n  Next, in regard to flexibility, the bill significantly increases \nState and local flexibility in the use of their Federal education \ndollars.\n  Under the ESEA law that exists today, most ESEA programs have a \nspecified purpose and a target population. Our states and localities \nare given little, if any flexibility in the use of the federal dollars \nthey receive.\n  Our schools do not need a targeted one size fits all Washington, D.C. \napproach to education. While schools in some parts of the country may \nneed to use federal education dollars to hire additional teachers to \nreduce classroom size, schools in other parts of the country may wish \nto use federal dollars for a more pressing need, like new text books. \nFederally targeted programs for a specified purpose do not recognize \nthat different states and localities have different needs.\n  Who is in a better position to recognize these local needs, Senators \nand Representatives in Washington, D.C. or Governors, localities, and \nparents? Those Virginians serving in state and local government and \nserving on local school boards throughout the Commonwealth are \ncertainly in a better position than members of Congress from other \nstates to determine how best to spend education dollars in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act increases flexibility and local control. \nFor example, the bill allows every local school district in America to \nmake spending decisions with up to 50 percent of the non-title I funds \nthey receive from the federal government. Thus, with regard to non-\ntitle I funds, every local school district will have the freedom to \nchoose alternative uses for these funds within certain broad \nguidelines.\n  Moreover, the bill provides even more flexibility in the use of \nfederal\n\n[[Page S13375]]\n\neducation dollars for up to 7 states and 150 school districts. These \nstates and local school districts will be given the opportunity to \nconsolidate a number of federal education programs, providing the \nparticipating states and localities the ability to focus federal \ndollars where they are needed most.\n  Finally, accountability, in certain areas, is needed. Our education \npolicy is locking out many students and not providing them the key to a \nbetter life. It's time to move forward in education to ensure that all \nof our children are given the opportunity to receive a higher quality \nof education.\n  President Bush's proposal to test students annually in grades 3-8 in \nreading and math, which is part of the No Child Left Behind Act, is a \nstrong proposal that promotes accountability.\n  These tests will result in parents and teachers receiving the \ninformation they need to know to determine how well their children and \nstudents are doing in school and to determine how well the school is \neducating its students. Testing also provides educators the information \nthey need to help them better learn what works, improve their skills, \nand increase teacher effectiveness.\n  While some have expressed concern that this legislation calls for too \nmuch testing, I have a different view. A yearly standard test in \nreading and math will allow our educators to catch any problems in \nreading and math at the earliest possible moment. Tests are becoming a \nvital part of life, no matter how onerous. If America is to survive in \nthe rapidly emerging global economy, tests are a key part.\n  I note that Virginia has already recognized the importance of \ntesting, having installed an accountability system called the Standards \nof Learning (SOLs). In Virginia, we already test our students in math \nand science in grades 3, 5, and 8. The No Child Left Behind Act will \nbuild upon Virginia's experience.\n  Increased funding, increased flexibility, and enhanced \naccountability, are all steps in the right direction that we take with \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. However, I must remind my colleagues that \nwe have more work to accomplish.\n  President Bush's ``No Child Left Behind'' blueprint calls for tax \nrelief for America's teachers when they dip into their own pocket to \npurchase supplies for students. Senator Collins and I have worked \ntogether since early this year to pass legislation to provide teachers \nwith this type of tax relief. Unfortunately, the bill before us today \ndoes not contain these provisions.\n  In my view, as we leave no child behind, we must not forget our \nnations' teachers.\n  The important role that our nations' teachers play in educating \ntoday's youth and tomorrow's leaders cannot be overstated. Quality, \ncaring teachers along with quality, caring parents, play the \npredominant roles in ensuring that no child is left behind.\n  Nevertheless, in part because of their low salaries and the numerous \nout-of-pocket expenses they incur as part of their profession, we are \nin the midst of a national teaching shortage. Teacher tax relief \nlegislation is one way the federal government can help.\n  So, while I look forward to voting in support of the No Child Left \nBehind Act and look forward to President Bush signing this important \neducation reform legislation into law, I also look forward to working \nwith the President and my colleagues in Congress to ensure that our \nteachers receive the tax relief they deserve.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \neducation bill before us.\n  First of all, I thank my colleagues for the many hours of work they \nhave spent on this bill. From day one, they have had the best interests \nof our students and teachers in mind. It is difficult to design a \nFederal education plan that supports the needs of the countless school \ndistricts around the country. But this bill affirms the Federal \nGovernment's role as one that seeks to narrow the achievement gap \nbetween poor students and their wealthier counterparts. This is clearly \na worthy goal, and, while I am not entirely pleased with this \ncompromise, I plan on supporting this bill when we vote on its approval \ntomorrow morning.\n  I believe this education bill sets a platform from which we can build \na solid, supportive role for the Federal Government in our schools \nacross the country. I must say, however, that this bill does not do \neverything it needs to do. I am on the floor today to remind my \ncolleagues that we have a long ways to go, that this bill is merely a \nstep along the way, and that our schools will need additional \ninvestments if we want to provide our children with the knowledge and \nskills that will bring them opportunities for personal and professional \nsuccess.\n  I want to outline the challenges that lie before us. Our biggest \nchallenge may be to fulfill old promises before requiring new mandates. \nI am, of course, speaking of our failure to fully fund the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, this year. I am extremely \ndisappointed that we failed to do so, because I recognize the burden \nthat schools face in coming up with special education funds from their \nown pockets.\n  We have the very worthy intent of educating all students in this \ncountry, regardless of their ability or capability. It simply makes \ngood common sense that we would do whatever we can to support that \ncause from the federal level. Fulfilling a promise we made to schools \nin 1975 is an easy way to support that effort. I challenge my \ncolleagues to build on the successful Senate amendment to fully fund \nIDEA with a bill to fully fund IDEA during next year's reauthorization.\n  I also want to challenge my colleagues to recognize that a federal \npresence in our state's education systems must fit into the structure \nof each state. That has not always been the case in my home state of \nMontana.\n  Montana's very successful education system is built on a system of \nlocal control. Montana's Constitution is built on this premise, giving \ncontrol of most education decisions to local school boards rather than \nto the state. This system has proven effective, but makes compliance \nwith state oversight of federal programs difficult, sometimes \nimpossible. As a result, Montana has not been able to meet the testing \nand assessment requirements implemented in 1994, despite recording some \nof the highest student outcomes in the nation.\n  With the strengthening of accountability provisions in this bill, I \nam very concerned that Montana's education system may suffer from the \ninability to integrate federal reforms. The construction of Montana \nlaw, for example, will make any attempt by the state to ``institute a \nnew curriculum,'' ``restructure the local educational agency,'' \n``reconstitute school district personnel,'' or ``make alternative \ngovernance arrangements,'' as outlined in this year's bill, an \nunconstitutional measure. I hope my colleagues recognize this \nincongruity and will work to insure that our successful system of local \ncontrol is not stymied by federal intervention.\n  Finally, for all our talk of wanting to support public education, I \nthink it is unfortunate that we spend an enormous amount of time, \nenergy, and resources in this bill on oversight and accountability \nmeasures from the federal level. As I've just mentioned, our state's \nsuccesses in education have often been the result of local communities \ntaking on the responsibility to build a successful program tailored to \ntheir individual environment.\n  Just as our communities have taken on the responsibility of providing \ntheir students with the best possible education at the local level, so \nmust we, at the federal level, make decisions that support our Federal \neducation goals to support local schools and to eliminate achievement \ngaps. To that end, our focus must be on improved student outcomes. I am \nnot convinced that the provisions outlined in this bill will reach that \ngoal.\n  I certainly do not want strict controls to be placed on schools, like \nthose in Montana, that have outstanding student outcomes on limited \nbudgets. Montana's schools, for example, would be much better off with \nadditional funds for teacher and principal recruitment and retention \nprograms, school maintenance and repair, technology hardware and \ntraining, and on-going professional development opportunities.\n  In the end, this bill starts us on a very critical path towards \naddressing the acute and variable needs of schools in states as diverse \nas Montana and Florida. This bill takes a good, hard\n\n[[Page S13376]]\n\nlook at the role of the federal government in our elementary and \nsecondary schools for the first time since its inception in 1965. It \nwould be overly optimistic to expect that we could accomplish \neverything necessary to provide an ideal environment for closing \nachievement gaps and supporting school teachers and administrators \nacross the country in this bill.\n  We certainly have not reached that point yet. But we have done \nsomething very important in starting that dialogue and in attempting to \nmeet that need. Again, I challenge my colleagues to keep the education \ndebate alive and active and to work every day to make our schools a \nplace where student success is the number one priority.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the conference report we have before us \nrepresents the first comprehensive overhaul of the Federal Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, ESEA, in 35 years. And from what all of us \nhave learned, overhaul is mandatory.\n  Since 1965, the Federal Government has pumped more than $135 billion \ninto our educational system. Yet despite this infusion of funds, \nachievement gaps between students rich and poor, disadvantaged and \naffluent remain wide.\n  In fact, only 13 percent of low-income fourth graders score at or \nabove the ``proficient'' level on reading tests. As the 2000 National \nAssessment of Education Progress shows, the reading scores of fourth \ngrade students have shown no improvements since 1992. That is \nunacceptable.\n  This conference report reflects the four principles underlying \nPresident Bush's education reform plan--accountability and testing; \nflexibility and local control; funding for what works, and expanded \nparental options. President Bush promised that he would bring Democrats \nand Republicans together to develop an education plan that puts \nchildren first. And this conference report reflects that commitment.\n  The House passed this conference report by an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote of 381 to 41. Last June, after we debated and voted on more than \n40 amendments to the education reform bill, the Senate voted 91-8 in \nfavor of the reform measure. I expect a similar vote on this final \nconference report.\n  Why is there such strong support for this measure? I think the reason \nis simple: we cannot afford as a nation to continue to allow our public \nschools to languish. Our children represent the future of America, yet \nthey are not getting the best training for their future. The first \nthing we need to do is bring greater accountability to the education \nsystem. This legislation does that.\n  It requires States to implement annual reading and math assessments \nfor grades 3--8. These annual reading and math assessments will give \nparents the information they need to know how well their child is doing \nin school, and how well the school is educating their child. This is \nnot a Federal learning test. The State will be able to select and \ndesign these tests, while the Federal Government would provide $400 \nmillion to help the States design and administer the tests.\n  The conference report also provides unprecedented new flexibility for \nall 50 States and every local school district in America to use Federal \nfunds. Every school district would have the freedom to transfer up to \n50 percent of their Federal dollars to various educational programs. \nThe conference report attempts to consolidate the myriad Federal \nprograms that comprise ESEA, reducing the number of programs from 55 to \n45.\n  The conference report also provides greater choices for families with \nchildren in failing schools. Parents in such schools would be allowed \nto transfer their children to a better-performing public or charter \nschool immediately after a school is identified as failing. Moreover, \nadditional title I funds, approximately $500 to $1,000 per child, can \nbe used to provide supplemental educational services, including \ntutoring, after-school services and summer school programs, for \nchildren in failing schools.\n  In addition, the conference report provides a major new expansion of \nthe charter school initiative, providing more opportunities for \nparents, educators and interested community leaders to create schools \noutside the bureaucratic structure of the education establishment.\n  I am very pleased that the conferees retained provisions that I \nauthored which allow the Education Department to provide grants to \nlocal schools to develop and implement suicide prevention programs. \nMoreover, States may use Safe and Drug Free funds to finance suicide \nprevention programs.\n  This is a critically important program that desperately needs \nattention. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among those 15 \nto 25 years of age, and is the sixth leading cause of death among those \n5 to 14 years of age. In Alaska, suicide is the greatest cause of death \namong high school age youths. In fact, Alaska's suicide rate is more \nthan twice the rate for the entire United States.\n  None of us know the future so we can never say with certainty whether \nthis conference report will achieve the goals that are being set. But \nwe know that what we have tried in the past with regard to elementary \nand secondary education has not worked. Too many children in America \nare being left behind. We cannot afford as a society and as a community \nto allow these failures to continue.\n  I believe this conference report is an important first step in \nchanging the interaction between Washington and local school districts \nand that the ultimate beneficiaries will be the students who will \nbecome the leaders of tomorrow.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, after many months of hard work we have \nbefore us today an education bill that represents a quantum leap \nforward for America's children. We have come together in a common-\nsense, bipartisan way and we should be proud of the progress we've \nmade.\n  The bill is a strong one, and I commend my colleagues for recognizing \nthat a quality public education is not a conservative or liberal goal. \nThe education debate in Washington has too often broken down along \nstale ideological lines. With this bill, we are moving beyond the false \nchoice of greater investment versus stricter accountability. We've \nstruck the right balance by both giving more to our schools and \nexpecting more in return. This bill increases investment in our \nschools, gives new flexibility to principals and superintendents, \nencourages high standards for all children, and holds schools \naccountable for their performance. Every child in America has a right \nto a world-class education. This bill enacts the reforms and provides \nthe resources necessary to make this right a reality.\n  My State of North Carolina has much to offer in this debate about \nnational education reform. Since coming to the Senate, I've tried to \nbring some of North Carolina's successes to the rest of the Nation. I \nam grateful that the final bill includes a provision which I introduced \nthat will allow States to try out a very simple plan we have \nimplemented with great success in North Carolina.\n  Here's how our program works: immediately after we learn that a \nschool is in trouble, we appoint a specially-trained Assistance Team \ncomposed of experienced educators and administrators who are dedicated \nto a clear and specific goal: helping that school get back on track. \nThe team begins with an intensive review of school operations to find \nout what works and what doesn't work.\n  Then the team evaluates all of the school's personnel; finally, the \nteam works with the school staff and local boards of education to make \nthe changes necessary to restore educational quality, to improve \nstudent performance, basically, to turn the school around. It's a \nsimple idea, but sometimes simple ideas can lead to dramatic results, \nand it has worked in North Carolina. Now other States will also have \nthis same tool in their reform arsenal.\n  I must confess that I am disappointed that some of our Republican \ncolleagues rejected the proposal by Senators Harkin and Hagel to fully \nfund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. For almost \nthree decades, the Federal Government has failed to live up to its \npromise to pay 40 percent of special education costs at the local \nlevel. The Senate approved an eminently reasonable, bipartisan proposal \nto make good on this promise. I regret that this long-overdue provision \nis not included in the final bill.\n  For all the progress we have made, my hope is that this bill will \nonly be\n\n[[Page S13377]]\n\nthe beginning of our conversation about education reform. It will take \ntime to learn whether the changes we are making will work and whether \nthe resources we are providing are adequate. We must commit to \nreviewing these issues periodically and consistently as the \nconsequences of reform become clearer. Today we take an important first \nstep towards a fundamental reform of American education. But it is only \na first step. Even as we approve a strong bipartisan bill, we must \ncommit ourselves to doing all that we can for America's children in the \nmonths and years to come.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 1, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nAuthorization Act, the primary Federal law affecting K-12 education \ntoday.\n  Completion of this reauthorization was a long time coming, \nconsidering that the original reauthorization expired last year and \nthat the Senate passed its bill 6 months ago. It is critical that the \nSenate approve this report prior to adjourning for the session.\n  The fact is, while education is primarily a local and State \nresponsibility, the seven percent of funding the Federal Government \ndoes provide plays a key role in preparing today's students for \ntomorrow's workforce. We have been faced with the daunting task of \nreauthorizing and revamping the Federal Government's entire K-12 \ncommitment, and the passage of this conference report comes not a \nmoment too soon for the young men and women of America.\n  We have spent $120 billion in title I education funds over the last \n35 years, yet we have failed to close the achievement gap between \nstudents in high-income and low-income families. We spend near the \nmaximum for students each year compared to our foreign competitors, \n$5,300 for a primary education, yet have one of the poorest test \nrecords in math, reading and science, with only 40 percent of grade \nschool students meeting today's basic reading standards and only 20 \npercent who are prepared for high school math. The cold hard truth is \nthat with 89 percent of our kids in public schools, that is almost 50 \nmillion students, we cannot afford to let this happen any longer.\n  So I applaud President Bush for following through on his promises and \nmaking education a cornerstone of his Presidency. He has continually \nset the proper tone by making a case for ensuring that greater \nflexibility goes hand-in-hand with accountability.\n  Indeed, the conference report before us creates unprecedented \nflexibility for States and local educational agencies, while increasing \naccountability to ensure that they are getting the job done.\n  This reauthorization allows States to help schools that have not met \ntheir annual goal through the dedication of additional resources to \nhelp turn the school around, while guaranteeing students access to \nsupplemental services to bolster their education. Students are not \ntrapped in failing schools, as the conference report ensures that \nstudents in a failing school can transfer to another public school if \ntheir home school is considered to be failing for more than 1 year.\n  In order to have accountability there needs to be some sort of ruler \nby which to measure the school's success. I am pleased that the \nconference report allows States to determine not only the assessment \nsystem but also the annual achievement goals.\n  My own State of Maine has worked for several years to develop its own \nassessment system to ensure that our students, and our schools, are \nachieving. Having witnessed the evolution of Maine's Learning Results \nProgram over the past several years, I would not support this \nconference report if I thought that it would interfere with Maine's \nefforts. To the contrary, I believe it would build on those efforts, \nand therefore I will support passage of the conference report. \nAdditionally, passage of the conference report is supported by Maine's \nCommissioner of Education, Duke Albanese.\n  My support for this package is tempered only by my disappointment \nthat the conferees did fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act or IDEA. The Senate, by a unanimous vote, supported the \ninclusion of mandatory full funding for IDEA during consideration of \nthe ESEA bill in the spring.\n  IDEA is an unfunded mandate that is draining precious resources from \nour States and in each and every community. Twenty-six years ago, \nCongress committed to paying 40 percent of IDEA funding, and we have \nyet to come close. While Congress has more than doubled IDEA funding \nover the past 5 years, the Federal Government has not contributed more \nthan 15 percent of the total cost of IDEA.\n  Full funding would free up billions of dollars nationwide, and \napproximately $60 million in Maine, freeing up local and State \neducation money which can then be used for other pressing needs. \nThroughout my tenure in Congress, I have fought for full funding of \nIDEA and this is a fight I will not give up.\n  Those conferees who opposed including the full funding provisions in \nthis conference report argued that this program cannot be made \nmandatory until the program is reformed and reauthorized. Fortunately, \nIDEA is due for reauthorization next year and I will be working to \nensure that it is fully funded.\n  I appreciate the diligence of my colleagues who sit on the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in this effort, and I \nlook forward to supporting this conference report and sending it to the \nPresident for his signature. I believe this legislation will make an \nimportant difference in the future of our children as well as our \nNation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am very gratified that the House and \nSenate conferees included in the conference report of the elementary \nand secondary education bill the language of a resolution I introduced \nduring the earlier Senate debate. That resolution concerned the \nteaching of controversies in science. It was adopted 91-8 by the \nSenate. By passing it we were showing our desire that students studying \ncontroversial issues in science, such as biological evolution, should \nbe allowed to learn about competing scientific interpretations of \nevidence. As a result of our vote today that position is about to \nbecome a position of the Congress as a whole.\n  When the Senate bill was first under discussion in this body, I \nreferenced an excellent Utah Law Review article, Volume 2000, Number 1, \nby David K. DeWolf, Stephen C. Meyer and Mark Edward DeForrest. The \nauthors demonstrate that teachers have a constitutional right to teach, \nand students to learn, about scientific controversies, so long as the \ndiscussion is about science, not religion or philosophy. As the \neducation bill report language makes clear, it is not proper in the \nscience classrooms of our public schools to teach either religion or \nphilosophy. But also, it says, just because some think that contending \nscientific theories may have implications for religion or philosophy, \nthat is no reason to ignore or trivialize the scientific issues \nembodied in those theories. After all, there are enormous religious and \nphilosophical questions implied by much of what science does, \nespecially these days. Thus, it is entirely appropriate that the \nscientific evidence behind them is examined in science classrooms. \nEfforts to shut down scientific debates, as such, only serve to thwart \nthe true purposes of education, science and law.\n  There is a question here of academic freedom, freedom to learn, as \nwell as to teach. The debate over origins is an excellent example. Just \nas has happened in other subjects in the history of science, a number \nof scholars are now raising scientific challenges to the usual \nDarwinian account of the origins of life. Some scholars have proposed \nsuch alternative theories as intelligent design. In the Utah law review \narticle the authors state, ``. . . The time has come for school boards \nto resist threats of litigation from those who would censor teachers, \nwho teach the scientific controversy over origins, and to defend their \nefforts to expand student access to evidence and information about this \ntimely and compelling controversy.''\n  The public supports the position we are taking today. For instance, \nnational opinion surveys show--to use the origins issue again--that \nAmericans overwhelmingly desire to have students learn the scientific \narguments against, as well as for, Darwin's theory. A recent Zogby \nInternational poll\n\n[[Page S13378]]\n\nshows the preference on this as 71 percent to 15 percent, with 14 \npercent undecided. The goal is academic excellence, not dogmatism. It \nis most timely, and gratifying, that Congress is acknowledging and \nsupporting this objective.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased that with the passage of \nthis legislation, we are on our way to assisting our Nation's schools \nin providing a quality education for each and every child. I want to \nthank Senators Kennedy and Gregg, Congressmen Boehner and Miller and \ntheir staffs for their hard work in crafting a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that will give children the opportunity to succeed in the \nclassroom.\n  I am also happy to see that this legislation includes an emphasis on \nmath and science education. Senator Frist, Congressman Ehlers and \nmyself have worked hard to make ensure that there is a renewed focus on \na portion of education curricula that needs addressing. Scores on the \nNational Assessment for Educational Progress, NAEP, test in the subject \narea of science have not improved over the last several years and, in \nfact, have been lower than previous years test scores. Seniors in high \nschool who took the 2000 NAEP science test scored, on average, three \npoints lower than those taking the test in 1996. Only 18 percent \ncorrectly answered challenging science questions, down from 21 percent \nand those students who knew just the basics dropped to 53 percent. This \nis simply unacceptable.\n  According to an Associated Press article that appeared in the Kansas \nCity Star on November 20, many science teachers complain that they \ncan't persuade school officials to give them the time or money required \nfor training. Our math and science provision in this bill addresses \nthis very problem through a variety of ways, including: one, improving \nand upgrading the status and stature of mathematics and science \nteaching by encouraging institutions of higher education to assume \ngreater responsibility for improving mathematics and science teacher \neducation; two, create career-long opportunities for ongoing \nprofessional development for math and science teachers; three, provide \nmentoring opportunities for teachers by bringing them together with \nengineers, scientists and mathematicians; and four, develop more \nrigorous math and science curricula.\n  This legislation authorizes the math and science partnerships at $450 \nmillion in the first year. I would encourage my colleagues, especially \nin light of the recent NAEP scores, to adequately fund this program in \norder to improve the abilities of our teachers to provide good, quality \ninstruction in math and science.\n  We are in an age where science and technology fields are booming and \nyet we cannot produce students who even have an understanding of basic \nscience principles. How can we attract students into fields that are \nexperiencing dramatic shortages such as nursing or engineering when \nthey don't have a good background in math and science? We have failed \nour children and I believe it is imperative to the future of our \ncountry to make sure that our children are adequately prepared in math \nand science subject areas.\n  I am disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to provide our \nschool districts the financial relief needed in the area of special \neducation. I have strongly supported funding the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA, at the full 40 percent and yet we \nwill go another year with it being inadequately funded by the Federal \nGovernment. We have made dramatic improvements in the funding levels \nover the last several years. However, we are now only providing \napproximately 15 percent instead of the 40 that we said we would commit \n26 years ago. I look forward to working with my colleagues who have \nstated throughout the conference their willingness to address this \nissue next year when IDEA will be reauthorized.\n  I am pleased with our overall product and will be looking forward to \nseeing results in the years to come as our States and local districts \nwork to implement the reforms made in this bill. I believe the State of \nKansas overall provides a good education for it's children and I look \nforward to seeing the quality of education in Kansas get even better.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe conference report of H.R. 1, The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. \nEarlier this year, I voted in support of S. 1, the Better Education for \nStudents and Teachers Act, with the belief that we were taking the \nfirst step toward enacting quality education reform in our nation's \nschools. My support for this legislation was to be contingent upon \ntaking an essential second step providing adequate financial resources \nfor carrying out these reforms. I will repeat now what I said then: \nunless we commit ourselves to providing the resources necessary for \nStates to carry out the reforms outlined in the bill, we will be doing \nserious harm to our children. I am afraid that in passing this bill, we \nare headed down that very path.\n  First, I want to express my strong disappointment that an amendment \nadopted during the Senate's consideration of this bill, authored by \nSenator Hatch and myself, was dropped in conference. This amendment \nwould have re-authorized Department of Justice grants for new Boys and \nGirls Clubs in each of the 50 States. In 1997, I was proud to join with \nSenator Hatch and others to pass bipartisan legislation authorizing \ngrants by the Department of Justice to fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs \nacross the nation. Our bipartisan amendment to this education bill \nwould have authorized $60 million in Department of Justice grants for \neach of the next five years, enabling the establishment of 1,200 \nadditional Boys and Girls Clubs across the nation. These new grants \nwould have brought the total number of Boys and Girls Clubs to 4,000, \nserving 6,000,000 young people by January 1, 2007.\n  In my home state of Vermont, these federal grants have helped \nestablish six Boys and Girls Clubs in Brattleboro, Burlington, \nMontpelier, Randolph, Rutland, and Vergennes. Together, Vermont's Boys \nand Girls Clubs have received more than $1 million in Department of \nJustice grants since 1998. I know what a great impact these after \nschool opportunities have had in these communities, and it is clear to \nme that more resources must be invested in order to help our kids lead \nhealthy lives and avoid the temptations of drug use. I am disappointed \nthat some members of the conference committee did not want to ensure \nfuture funding for these successful programs.\n  Some of the most publicized and often-discussed provisions of the No \nChild Left Behind Act are the expanded requirements for measuring \nstudent performance through annual testing of students in grades three \nthrough eight in math and reading. This conference report requires \nstates to develop and administer this annual testing. While \naccompanying appropriations will provide the resources necessary to pay \nfor a portion of the costs of developing and administering the tests, \nthe funds are far less than what will be necessary, leaving Vermont and \nother states with large financial gaps to fill. At a time when our \neconomy is slowing and states are facing difficult budget choices, the \nFederal Government should not be placing burdensome, unfunded mandates \non local and state officials, especially when there are education \nfunding commitments the Federal Government is still yet to meet.\n  With this legislation, Congress had before it the opportunity to \nreverse its decades-long transgression in the area of special education \nfunding. The conferees rejected a provision adopted during the Senate's \nconsideration of the education bill that would have ensured that the \nFederal Government finally lived up to its commitment to our children \nwith special needs and the communities in which they live. I am deeply \ntroubled by this. When Congress first passed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act, IDEA, the States were required to comply with the \nspecial education provisions, and in exchange, the Federal government \nwould contribute up to 40 percent of the costs. Instead, the Federal \ncontribution is generally only 12 to 15 percent, far from the promised \n40 percent. The provision included in the Senate-passed bill would have \nrequired the government to contribute the 40 percent by changing the \nFederal contribution from discretionary spending to mandatory. In \nVermont, countless communities struggle each year to pass their local \nschool budgets, hampered by the high\n\n[[Page S13379]]\n\ncosts of providing special education. The actions of the conferees fail \nto provide the relief States are owed, and have instead placed \nadditional mandates that State and local education officials must find \na way to address.\n  In addition to the inadequate resources provided for special \neducation, and for implementation of the assessment provisions, I am \nconcerned about the extensive Federal control exerted in this bill over \nthe evaluation of whether a school is failing. I am particularly \nconcerned about the definition of what constitutes a failing school, \nespecially because this is a determination that could ultimately lead \nto the elimination of Federal funds for that school. Finally, I find \ntroubling the degree to which this legislation increases Federal \ncontrol over teacher qualification and greatly increases administrative \npaperwork for the States.\n  Current statistics leave no doubt that some schools in our country \nare failing--education reform is necessary in some parts of our \ncountry. One of the fundamental problems with this legislation, \nhowever, is that in recognizing the areas in our education system that \nare failing and in need of assistance, it fails to recognize the \nsuccessful things happening in education in some States. My state of \nVermont leads the Nation with its innovative and effective policies for \nassessing student performance and providing necessary technical \nassistance to struggling schools. This new Federal legislation will \nrequire that Vermont abandon its home-grown successful tools and \nimplement--at a high cost--new tools selected by Federal lawmakers that \nappear to be aimed at failing schools in our Nation's urban areas. This \nlegislation will require schools to make major changes in a short \nperiod of time without the resources necessary to implement these \nchanges. With difficult financial times ahead for many States, \nincluding Vermont, this Federal law will force State legislatures to \nmake very difficult budget choices in order to comply with these new \nFederal mandates.\n  I commend the bipartisan effort that has gone into crafting this \nlegislation. I know that my colleagues all want to ensure that our \nNation's children have access to the quality education they deserve. \nUnfortunately, despite these efforts, the legislation that has been \npieced together does more harm than good for school children in \nVermont. While there are some positive reforms included in the final \nmeasure, there is far more that will hurt Vermont's local educational \nefforts and cost the State dearly in financial resources. As the former \nchairman of the Education Committee for many years, and as a leader in \neducation policy, my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, understands better than most the impact that this bill will \nhave on our home State. During this debate, Senator Jeffords' continued \nperseverance on the issue of increased Federal special education \nfunding has been outstanding, and I commend his tireless advocacy on \nbehalf of our Nation's schoolchildren.\n  I regret I am not able to support this legislation today. And I \nregret that we will likely find ourselves on the Senate floor sometime \nsoon, once again discussing education reform efforts. Next time, \nthough, I believe we will be here to discuss how to fix the harm we \nhave done in passing the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I rise to say a few words about the \nConference report to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act also \nknown as the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, H.R. 1.\n  First of all, I want to thank President Bush for his leadership on \nthis important issue, which he has made a cornerstone of his domestic \nagenda. He is to be commended for this commitment to local control of \neducation, and for ``leaving no child behind.''\n  As a former civics and history teacher and school board chairman, I \nknow that decisions regarding education are best executed at the local \nlevel, and that we should not run our public schools from Washington \nDC.\n  Although the Senate's education bill, S. 1, lacked several important \nreform provisions, I voted for the bill's passage on June 14 of this \nyear.\n  I supported the bill because I wanted to move the ball forward to \nimprove our nation's educational system. I supported the bill because I \nam tired of the status quo.\n  I am tired of failing schools, and smart kids who are trapped in \nthem. I am tired of money that is directed to our classrooms being \nspent on bureaucracy. I am tired of the United States' academic \nprogress falling far behind that of other nations.\n  The reconciled education bill will make modest but necessary and much \nneeded reforms with the goal of making lasting improvements for our \nnation's schools.\n  Bill Bennett, the Secretary of Education under President Ronald \nReagan and one of the most respected leaders in the education reform \nmovement, said in a recent article that there are several basic \ningredients to a quality education for America's children. These \ningredients are:\n  First, strong leadership and excellent teachers;\n  Second, principals and teachers sharing a common vision of the \nschool's academic mission with clearly defined goals which are adhered \nto;\n  Third, a commitment to homework and testing;\n  Fourth, teaching character education; and\n  Fifth, a successful school hinges on parents being involved in the \nacademic lives of their children.\n  I agree with Mr. Bennett completely.\n  I want to first speak about funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act, or IDEA as it is commonly called. I have heard from a \nnumber of New Hampshire constituents who are concerned about the \nFederal Government's commitment to funding our share of the costs \nassociated with educating children with disabilities. IDEA does receive \nsubstantial funding increases in this bill. I support fully funding the \nIDEA mandate, and I am also committed to making sure that localities \nhave more flexibility and that true reforms, such as cost control, are \nenacted to IDEA.\n  I look forward to addressing IDEA next year when this bill is \nreauthorized by Congress. I hope to be able to offer amendments to \nreform and improve this important legislation at that time.\n  I am also proud to report that this bill reflects the principles of \ntwo out of three amendments that I passed during consideration of S. 1. \nThe first amendment requires the Department of Education to initiate a \nstudy on sexual abuse in our nation's schools. This is a very serious \nproblem that, unfortunately, has received very little national \nattention, and I am glad that this amendment was included in the final \nbill.\n  The second amendment applies ``Dollars to the Classroom'' principles \nto all Federal formula grant programs, and directs 95 percent of this \nmoney to the local level.\n  Unfortunately, the vast majority of all federal education funds do \nnot go to schools or school districts.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, audits from around the country \nhave found as little as 26 percent of school district funds are being \nspent on classroom expenditures. Classroom expenditures are defined as \nexpenditures for teachers and materials.\n  Twenty six percent is unacceptable to me.\n  Heritage also found that my home State of New Hampshire only receives \n47 cents to the dollar of federal education money. What becomes of the \nremaining 53 cents?\n  Many of my colleagues believe that throwing more money at our \neducation system will solve all of its problems.\n  I respectfully disagree, and let me briefly tell you why.\n  Over the last 36 years, the federal government has spent more than \n$130 billion to shrink the scholastic achievement gap between rich and \npoor students.\n  I am here to report that not much has improved.\n  Poor students lag behind their peers by 20 percent even though the \nscope of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has \nexpanded.\n\n  In fact, the average fourth grader today who comes from a low-income \nfamily reads at two grade levels less than his or her peer in that same \nclassroom.\n  One of the biggest reasons for this failure is that very little \naccountability exists for how all of this money is spent.\n  Greater accountability and flexibility, not more money, is the key to \neducation reform.\n\n[[Page S13380]]\n\n  I am also proud to report that the House/Senate agreement would \nprovide all States and local school districts with the flexibility to \nshift Federal dollars earmarked for one specific purpose to other uses \nthat more effectively address their needs and priorities.\n  States would now be allowed to make spending decisions with up to 50 \npercent of most of their non-title I administrative funds that they \nreceive from the Federal Government.\n  The proposal would give every State the freedom to choose alternative \nuses for these funds within certain broad guidelines; for example, \ntechnology funds could now be used by the state to improve teacher \nquality. States can also use Federal funding to improve education for \ndisadvantaged students.\n  In addition, every local school district will be able to transfer up \nto half of its non-title I funds at its discretion.\n  I am also pleased to report that the proposal would also allow 150 \ndistricts to apply for waivers from most Federal education rules and \nrequirements associated with a variety of ESEA programs, as long as \nthey obtain certain achievement levels for their lower-income students.\n  Additionally, seven States will receive additional flexibility, \nmaking it possible for State and local education agencies to enter into \nState-local ``flexibility partnerships'' to coordinate their efforts \nand put Federal resources to their most effective use for students.\n  Although these provisions fall short of what was originally \nenvisioned for the Straight A's concept, I am pleased that we have a \nfoundation on which to build regarding funding flexibility.\n  It is my hope that these States and school districts will effectively \ndemonstrate that less government heavy-handedness, with more local \ncontrol and broader decision making power at the local level is the key \nto improving schools in this nation.\n  The conference report also consolidates wasteful federal programs.\n  The proposal would reduce the overall number of ESEA programs to 45, \nwhich is 10 fewer programs than in current law, and 34 fewer programs \nthan in the Senate-passed legislation. The proposal would accomplish \nthis by streamlining programs and targeting resources to existing \nprograms that serve poor students.\n  Additionally, H.R. 1 would, for the first time, require States to \nbegin using annual statewide assessments and insisting that states show \nthat progress is being made toward narrowing the achievement gap.\n  National testing and federally-administered exams would be \nprohibited: States would be able to design tests that are consistent \nwith its current academic standards--not Washington D.C.'s standards. \nStates would need to ensure that student academic achievement results \ncould be compared from year to year within the State, and federal \nfunding will be provided to States so they can develop their annual \nassessments. I also believe that parents should have a choice in \nschooling options for their children. This can come in the form of tax \ncredits, the option to change to another public school, or private \nschool vouchers. Under the agreement reached by the House and Senate, \napproximately a portion of title I funding would, for the first time \never, be used to allow parents to obtain supplemental educational \nservices for their children. These services include tutoring, after-\nschool services, and summer school programs.\n  I am pleased that private, church-related and religiously-affiliated \nproviders would be eligible to provide supplemental services to \ndisadvantaged students. For the first time ever, Federal title I funds \nwould be permitted to flow to private, faith-based educational \nproviders. Another component of H.R. 1 would provide parents with the \nopportunity for a child trapped in a failing school to transfer to a \nbetter public school, including a charter school, with their \ntransportation costs paid for. Although I would have preferred Federal \nfunding being permitted to flow to private schools as well, I am glad \nthat we obtained a good, first step toward the goal of greater \naccountability in our schools. H.R. 1 contains language to push States \nand local districts to take responsibility for ensuring teacher quality \nthrough testing and certification. It also protects teachers who are \ntrying to maintain order in the classroom by shielding them from \nfrivolous lawsuits. Finally, there are several provisions in the \nreconciled bill which will give rights to parents that were not \navailable to them previously. Schools must now develop a policy to \nallow parents the right to inspect surveys given to their children as \nwell as instructional material used as curriculum for their child's \neducation. Parents must be notified about surveys and medical exams and \nwill have the right to opt their child out of them. In addition, \nparents have new rights to see the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress (NAEP) test, comment on it, and to receive a response to their \nconcerns. Parents may also choose to opt their child out of the NAEP \nexam.\n  I am pleased with several aspects of H.R. 1, because it: Attempts to \nclose the achievement gap; provides flexibility to States and school \ndistricts; promotes accountability and teacher excellence; increases \nparental involvement; provides for a limited education choice \ncomponent; and finally, this legislation returns decisions regarding \neducation back to the local level, where they belong.\n  Our children are the future of this Nation. Now, more than ever, we \nneed to guarantee that they will receive a quality education and that \nfederal money will flow to where it is most effective. We need to \nsupport our kinds and push them to excel. We need to equip teachers to \neffectively educate our children. And we need to empower parents to be \nmore involved in the lives of their children. Although there are still \naspects of the conference report that I wish were stronger, I am \npleased that we are taking incremental steps to raise the grades for \nour Nation's schools.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when we first began the debate on the \neducation reauthorization bill, I came to the floor calling for three \nsimple things--reform, resources, and results.\n  Overall, I believe this education bill makes a significant step \ntoward achieving these three goals, and I want to highlight some of the \nbill's important provisions.\n  The bill includes improved targeting of federal funds to the neediest \ncommunities and increases support for Limited English Proficient and \nmigrant students.\n  It continues our federal commitment to improve public schools by \nreducing class sizes and overcrowding in order to provide safe and \norderly places for learning. This will improve the performance of \nstudents and teachers in our public schools.\n  Because I am a firm believer in school testing and accountability \nstandards when properly structured, I am pleased that my colleagues \nwere able to reach a compromise so that the federal government will pay \nits fair share in supporting the new standards in schools.\n  This bill also maintains the emergency school repair and construction \nprogram, and ensures that every classroom will be led by a qualified \nteacher.\n  But the provision of this bill of which I am most pleased is the \nTitle V provision on afterschool programs. This Title includes the \nafterschool amendment that I offered with my colleague Senator Ensign.\n  Studies have shown that services such as afterschool programs are \nsome of the most important weapons against juvenile crime by keeping \nour kids out of the streets.\n  Afterschool programs provide academically-enriched services during \nthe hours of 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., which the FBI reports are the times \nwhen children are most likely to be involved in crimes and other \ndelinquent behavior.\n  This is why I strongly believe in the 21 Century Community Learning \nCenters program and am delighted that this authorization bill contains \nthe first ever multi-year authorization for afterschool services.\n  Although my amendment would have provided a total of $4.5 billion in \nfunding for fiscal year 2008, I am extremely pleased that this bill \nmakes a significant step forward in achieving this goal by authorizing \nover $300 million in additional funds for fiscal year 2002 for a total \nof $1.25 billion. This bill then increases funding levels by $250 \nmillion each year for the next five years.\n  This will allow for a total of $2.5 billion in 2007 and will provide \nnearly four\n\n[[Page S13381]]\n\nmillion children in need access to afterschool programs.\n  Finally, I want to mention one thing this bill does not include that \nit should. The federal government needs to meet its commitment by \ncontributing 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure toward the \nfunding of special education programs.\n  Providing full funding of the Individuals with Disabilities in \nEducation Act would have helped alleviate some of the strain placed \nupon school districts to educate both regular and special education \nstudents.\n  While I regret that we were not able to include mandatory full \nfunding for special education programs, I know that my colleagues and I \nwill not rest until this finally becomes a reality.\n  Reform plus Resources equals Results. This is the recipe to a \nsuccessful public school system. Just like any good recipe, we cannot \nreasonably expect to have a successful public education system if we \nare not willing to put forth the necessary resources.\n  I believe that this Education Reauthorization bill symbolizes the \nwillingness of all parties to put aside their differences and work \ntoward the betterment of our children.\n  Make no mistake, we still have a long way to go toward fully \nsupporting our public education system, but I believe that this bill is \na positive step forward in achieving this goal.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to support the final \nconference report on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, \nand I commend Senator Kennedy and all the conferees for their hours of \nnegotiations to forge consensus on this vital legislation.\n  This package outlines our major Federal framework for education \npolicy for the coming years. The bill requires new emphasis on \nachievement through annual testing and school report cards, but it also \ncalls for new investments to reach these higher education goals. We \nmust have higher education standards. This bill creates new goals \nthrough the Adequate Yearly Progress, AYP, standards, which charts a \n12-year strategy to achieve education goals, with meaningful \nmeasurement along the way, to ensure that all children, especially \ndisadvantaged students, get help and make strides. Students in schools \nthat are struggling and fail to meet the standards will have the option \nof after-school tutoring, which is a good compromise to ensure help to \nstudents without using controversial private school vouchers that drain \nneeded resources from public schools.\n  While high standards are crucial, it takes real resources to achieve \nthem. This legislation authorizes meaningful increases in title I \nfunding for disadvantaged schools and IDEA. This year, West Virginia \nreceived $73.7 million in title I funding. Today's legislation \nauthorizes new investments in title I; depending on the final \nnegotiations in the pending Labor-HHS-Education appropriation \nconference, West Virginia will receive between $78.8 million to $80.9 \nmillion for title I, which will be essential to achieving our new \ngoals. However, pushing for the additional resources is not a single \nevent; it will mean hard work on appropriations for the next 6 years. I \nam committed to working with Senator Kennedy and others to deliver on \nthe needed funding to fulfill our promises on education.\n  This is a major legislative initiative. I particularly want to note \nthe emphasis on reading for young children. Teaching a child to read, \nand read well, is a fundamental building block for education. We should \nbe proud of the bill's provisions highlighting reading and literacy, \nand its special support for reading programs for preschool and early \ngrades. I am also pleased about the new emphasis on drop-prevent \nprograms and parental involvement. In addition, this legislation \nprotects and continues some key education programs, including the Safe \nand Drug-Free School program which I worked to create more than a \ndecade ago. We all understand the importance of school safety and \nprotecting children from the dangers of drugs and alcohol.\n  Our bill requires that all teachers be qualified in their subjects by \nthe school year beginning in 2005. This will be a challenge in West \nVirginia and many States, especially in crucial subject areas like math \nand science. When I talk with business leaders in my State, they bring \nup the importance and the difficulties of attracting teachers who are \nqualified, especially in math and science. Given the national shortage \nof teachers, this will be hard to achieve, but we simply must ensure \nthat our teachers are qualified in their subjects if we hope to achieve \nthe adequate yearly progress standards.\n  In the Senate, we voted to fulfill our Federal commitment to fully \nfund the IDEA program, which suggests that the Federal Government pay \n40 percent of the costs of educating children with disabilities. \nHowever, while progress was made on better funding for IDEA, we did not \nreach the Senate goal of full mandatory funding, and this is a real \ndisappointment to me.\n  We need accountability and high standards, but we also need \ninvestments to achieve those key goals. This legislation provides the \nframework for success. It will up to President Bush and the Congress to \nwork together over the coming years to secure the investment needed to \nfill in this bold plan for education reform.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD, Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on one of \nthe most important pieces of legislation that we have debated this \nyear. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has provided the \nframework for the Federal role in education for more than 35 years. The \nconference report currently before us, the ``No Child Left Behind \nAct,'' will chart the course for the Federal role in education for the \nnext 6 years and beyond.\n  I strongly support maintaining local control over decisions affecting \nour children's day-to-day classroom experiences. The Federal Government \nhas an important role to play in supporting our States and school \ndistricts as they carry out one of their most important \nresponsibilities, the education of our children.\n  Every child in this country has the right to a free public education. \nEvery child. That is an awesome responsibility, and one that should not \nhave to be shouldered by local communities alone. The States and the \nFederal Government are partners in this worthy goal, and ESEA is the \ndocument that outlines the Federal Government's responsibilities to our \nNation's children, to those who educate them, and to our States and \nlocal school districts.\n  It is with this conference report that we must find the right balance \nbetween local control and Federal targeting and accountability \nguidelines for the Federal dollars that are so crucial to local school \ndistricts throughout the United States.\n  I remain opposed to the new federally-mandated annual tests in grades \n3-8. I am concerned that adding another layer of testing could result \nin a generation of students who know how to take tests, but who don't \nhave the skills necessary to become successful adults. I am pleased \nthat the conference committee retained a Senate provision to ensure \nthat the tests that are used are of a high quality and that the \nconference included language to ensure that the test results are easy \nto understand and are useful for teachers and school districts to help \nimprove student achievement.\n  I fear that this new annual testing requirement will \ndisproportionately affect disadvantaged students. We should ensure that \nall students have an equal opportunity to succeed in school. I am \npleased that this conference report authorizes a 20-percent increase in \ntitle I funding for fiscal year 2002 and that it authorizes additional \nincreases for this crucial funding in each of the next 5 years, 2003-\n2007. I am also pleased that the conference report includes language to \nensure that these dollars are targeted to students who need them the \nmost. I will continue to work to ensure that Title I is fully funded.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes language to ensure \nthat the States will not have to implement or administer this new \nFederal testing mandate unless the Federal Government provides a \nspecific amount of funding. While the true cost of this mandate is \nstill unclear, it is clear that the Federal Government should provide \nadequate funding for this new requirement.\n  I regret that the House-Senate conference voted to strip a Senate \nprovision that would have guaranteed full funding of the federal share \nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. This action, \ncoupled with the new Federal testing mandate, could\n\n[[Page S13382]]\n\npush already stretched local education budgets to the breaking point. I \nwill continue to work for fiscally responsible full funding of the \nFederal share of IDEA when the Senate considers reauthorization of that \nimportant law next year.\n  This debate gave Congress the opportunity to strengthen public \neducation in America. Unfortunately, many of the provisions contained \nin the conference may undermine public education by blurring the lines \nbetween public and private, between church and state, and between local \ncontrol and Federal mandates. Because this conference does not provide \nthe resources necessary to implement its goals, it will leave many \nchildren behind. For those reasons, I will vote against it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 1, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. \nPresident Bush has provided the leadership for this landmark education \nreform bill. I also commend the conference members and Senate \nleadership on forging an agreement that revises and improves the role \nof the Federal Government in the education of our children.\n  The education of the children and youth of our Nation is a cause I \nhave served for many years. In fact, my first job, upon graduation from \nClemson, was as a teacher and coach. Later, I served as the County \nSuperintendent of Education in Edgefield County, SC. There have been \nmany changes over the years within the educational system of our Nation \nin structure, policy, technology and methods. However, there are \nprinciples which remain constant. The fundamentals of successful \nteaching, caring teachers, prepared students, and involved parents, \nhave not changed. This conference report builds on those fundamentals.\n  This legislation reflects the principles set down by President Bush \nin his education reform proposal. While it does not include all that we \nmight have wished, I believe that it will serve the students of the \nNation well. The President asked us to link funding to scholastic \nachievement and accountability, expand parental options, maintain local \ncontrol, and improve the flexibility of Federal educational programs. \nThis conference report delivers on all of these reforms.\n  First, I am very pleased with the accountability provisions of this \nlegislation. I believe the testing and reporting provisions are the \nmost promising reforms. School performance reports and statewide \nresults will give parents and educators much-needed information about \ntheir students' progress. These provisions, along with the expanded \nschool choice provisions, should provide our schools with sufficient \nincentives to make improvements.\n  The streamlining of Department of Education programs will allow local \nschools to focus on educating children rather than filing paperwork. As \na former Governor, I am especially pleased that the legislation will \nalso enhance local control by allowing local school boards more \ndiscretion in how they spend their education funds.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes a number of specific programs \nwhich I supported as the Senate debated this bill and I am pleased to \nsee these included in the conference report. The President's Early \nReading First program will help boost reading readiness for children in \nhigh-poverty areas. The Troops-to-Teachers Program is an innovative \napproach to bring experienced individuals into the classroom and helps \nour former Servicemembers with their transition to civilian life. \nFinally, I strongly supported an amendment, the `'Boy Scouts of America \nEqual Access Act.'' This provision will ensure that our patriotic youth \ngroups will be allowed access to public schools.\n  In South Carolina, while we are improving in our educational \nperformance, we have a long way to go. This legislation, will greatly \nassist us in our goal to leave no South Carolina child behind. Again, I \nthank the President for his leadership on this issue. I am pleased to \njoin in my support of this legislation which will help improve the \neducation of the youth and children of our great Nation.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, if there is one thing that the Senate \ncan agree on, it is the obligation we have to help prepare our children \nfor the future. Even as we recognize the importance of education, we \nmust ask ourselves, if this government function is so important, how do \nwe best meet this obligation?\n  This bill does not meet our children's education needs in the best \nway possible. This bill throws money at problems that can ultimately \nonly be resolved by more parental involvement, and it violates our \nNation's long-held tradition of federalism in which duties not \nexpressly assigned to the Federal Government are assigned to the State \nand local level. By seeking to abolish the role that State and local \ngovernments, specifically locally elected school boards, have in our \nchildren's education, I fear will put us on the slippery slope to the \neventual federalization of all education in this country.\n  Despite its grave faults, the conference report to H.R. 1, the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act contains several provisions \nthat I favor.\n  The bill contains a modest performance partnership provision that \nwill help us build on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act that I \nworked to help pass in the 106th Congress that allows States to \nconsolidate Federal education programs to meet local needs.\n  H.R. 1 also expands local flexibility and control by block-granting \nfunds, consolidating many programs, and includes another amendment that \nI sponsored to allow local districts to spend title II funds, if they \ndesire, on pupil services personnel.\n  On balance, however, these token allowances to local control are \ninsufficient to outweigh the all out assault on local control \nrepresented by this bill.\n  As a former Governor and mayor, I've seen how well State and local \ngovernments can respond to the needs of the people they serve. The \nFederal Government cannot and does not have a better understanding of \nhow to serve the millions of students in local school districts across \nthis great country. That is the responsibility of sovereign local \nschool boards working together with parents, educators and community \nleaders. Congress is not the national school board and any attempt by \nit to play that role will result in a Federal curriculum of one-size-\nfits-all programs that fail to prepare a nation of students for the \nchallenges ahead.\n  Our forefathers specifically warned us against the urge to federalize \nin the 10th amendment:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are \n     reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.''\n\n  Education is one such responsibility. Since our country's creation, \nthose at the local level have been responsible for educating our \nchildren. In fact, only in the past 35 years has the Federal Government \neven had much of a role in education policy, albeit a small one.\n  The reason for this is that the educational environments of our \nchildren greatly vary by region, just as the economies of our Nation's \nregions greatly vary. Therefore, universal education solutions will \nalways elude us.\n  As my colleagues know, the Federal Government currently provides \napproximately 7 percent of all money spent on education in America, \nwhile 93 percent is spent by local and State educators. Indeed, in \nspite of this limited expenditure of Federal funds, Congress is saying \nwith this bill that the Federal Government has the right to dictate \nthat every school district in America will test their students from \ngrades 3 through 8.\n  This testing will occur regardless of how well students are \nperforming in their particular school districts, and despite the fact \nthat most of our states have mechanisms already in place that test \nstudents' educational performances.\n  I can assure you that there are many teachers in Ohio who are going \nto be saying, ``here we go again.'' We already have in place statewide \nstandardized tests in Ohio, which were controversial enough when they \nwere established, I speak from first-hand experience here. Yet these \ntests have been good measures of the progress students are making and \nwere, in fact, recently revised to be even more effective. Even these \nstatewide tests have been criticized by local voices, however, for \nbeing too centralized to be effective. That's because the tradition of \nlocal control of education is zealously guarded in our Nation and will \nnot be easily surrendered.\n\n[[Page S13383]]\n\n  This bill also steps on State and local control in its provisions \naddressing failing schools. What this bill fails to appreciate is that \nmany states, such as my home State of Ohio, are already addressing the \nneeds of failing schools by increasing accountability, measuring school \nperformance, building the capacity of local schools and district \nleaders, and providing significant resource assistance to low-\nperforming and at-risk schools.\n  Also under H.R. 1, the Federal Government would be able to tell \nStates that its teachers in many schools must meet certain Federal \nqualification and certification requirements.\n  Further, the Federal Government would tell school districts how to \nspend funds in a number of areas including: reading; teacher \ndevelopment; technology; and programs for students with limited English \nlanguage skills, instead of providing States and local school districts \nwith full flexibility to spend funds on their own identified \npriorities.\n  Many groups, from the American Association of School Administrators \nto the National Conference of State Legislators are opposing passage of \nthis conference report, in large part because of its increase in the \nscope and influence of the Federal Government into education matters \nbest left to our States and localities.\n  None of these provisions are, on their face, bad for education. What \nis troubling is the direction in which these measures lead us. Make no \nmistake, with this bill we take a giant leap forward toward \nfederalizing our education system. We should not let Federal \nbureaucrats become the national school board.\n  Besides violating a long-held principle regarding State and local \ncontrol over schools, the bill's fatal flaw is that it increases \nauthorized spending for education by more than 41 percent over last \nyear's budget.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, CRS, ESEA spending \ntotaled $18.6 billion in fiscal year 2001. The total authorization \nlevel for this conference report for fiscal year 2002 is $26.3 billion. \nIf this level of funding is appropriated, that is more than a 41-\npercent increase. However, according to CRS, 16 of the programs listed \nin this ESEA bill are listed at unspecified authorization levels, and, \ntherefore, are not included in that $26.3 billion level. So the final \ncost to the taxpayer may well be higher.\n  When you consider that the House and Senate agreed to a budget \nresolution that included a modest increase in Federal spending over \nlast year's budget of approximately 5 percent, it's obvious that if we \nare to fund ESEA with a 41-percent increase, many legitimate functions \nthat are the true responsibility of the Federal Government may not be \nmet. Our situation has been exacerbated by a war and a recession.\n  The response to these concerns are, of course, ``But Senator \nVoinovich, are you saying that our children do not deserve all that we \ncan provide them?'' My response to that shallow criticism is, in fact, \n``Yes, our children deserve all that we can provide them, such as a \nstrong military, and adequate funding for transportation and health \nresearch, prescription drugs and unemployment insurance and all the \nmyriad other worthy efforts in which the Federal Government engages.''\n  We pursue this bill and provide this unsustainable amount of funding \nauthorization as if our Federal Government has no other obligations. In \na perfect world, I would love to be able to provide this much money for \neducation, but a perfect world isn't governed by a budget resolution \nand a perfect world doesn't come with other expensive priorities that \nmust fit within a finite pool of dollars.\n  It is high-time for Congress to stand-up and show that it has the \ncourage to be fiscally responsible, to prioritize our spending on the \nbasis of those responsibilities that are truly Federal in nature, and \nto make the tough choices. It is completely irresponsible to issue new \ndebt and further burden our children in the name of preparing them for \ntheir futures. The two are irreconcilable and highlight one of the \nmajor faults of this bill.\n  While I realize that the conference report to H.R. 1 will pass and \nwill likely be signed into law, I cannot in good conscience vote in \nfavor of this legislation. It is a well-intentioned bill but spends far \ntoo much money at a time when we can least afford it, and on priorities \nthat are better left to our State and local governments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the No Child Left Behind Act provides the \nauthorization for Federal assistance to States for the education of the \nchildren of our Nation.\n  I support this conference report, and I am pleased with the emphasis \non flexibility it permits for State and local educators. I appreciate \nvery much the courtesies shown to me during the consideration of this \nbill by the chairman, Mr. Kennedy, and ranking member, Mr. Gregg, of \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The conference \nreport includes several programs which are of particular interest to \nme, and were the subject of an amendment I offered and was accepted by \nthe Senate during our initial consideration of H.R. 1.\n  The National Writing Project is one such program. This provides \nteacher training in the effective teaching of writing at 164 sites \nlocated in 50 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It has \nbeen a Federal program for 10 years, and is the only Federal assistance \nprogram aimed at writing.\n  Another area of interest is targeted to young children before they \nbegin school, and helps ensure they are ready to learn when they arrive \nat school. The public television program, Ready to Learn, was launched \nin 1994, and was initially authorized by legislation authored by the \nchairman and myself. The essence of Ready to Learn is a full day of \nnon-violent, commercial-free, educational children's television \nprogramming broadcast free of charge to every American household. This \ndaily broadcast includes some of the most popular, award-winning and \nengaging programming available today such as Arthur, Clifford, and \nReading Between the Lions.\n  Other programs that have proved to be of great assistance to local \nschool districts which are included provide grants for arts, civics, \nand foreign language education. These grants enable schools to provide \nenhanced, competitive education opportunities to students in all parts \nof the country.\n  I am especially pleased with the opportunities authorized in reading \ninstruction and assessment. The bill provides incentives to schools to \nseek out programs with research based and proven methods as described \nby the National Reading Panel.\n  Also authorized is funding for the National Board of Teaching \nStandards, which is responsible for providing a voluntary assessment \nbase for teachers in all disciplines. This is a very sought after \nresource for professional development as well as assessment. The \nteachers in my State, for example, are given financial incentive to \nseek the certification of the board. Teachers report that the process \nfor the certification makes them better and happier teachers.\n  These are a few of the programs in which I've been personally \ninvolved throughout the consideration of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I am very hopeful that the new education authorizations and the \nreauthorization of effective education programs will bring better \nlearning opportunities to all of America's students.\n  Mr. NELSON OF Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to announce my \nopposition to this conference report.\n  During my campaign for the Senate last year I promised the people of \nNebraska that if George W. Bush occupied the White House, I would \nsupport him when I believed he was right, and oppose him when I thought \nhe was wrong. In my first year in the Senate, I have worked with the \nBush administration to negotiate a tax cut, craft a compromise on a \nPatient's Bill of Rights, and, recently, negotiate an economic stimulus \npackage. I have kept my promise to work with President Bush when he is \nright, and now I must keep my promise to oppose him when he is wrong.\n  As Governor of Nebraska, I repeatedly protested the Federal \nGovernment's practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on the \nStates, requiring the States to do something without providing the \nadequate funding for them to do it.\n  The President's plan will impose a massive unfunded mandate on \nNebraska in the form of annual testing,\n\n[[Page S13384]]\n\nand it fails to provide relief from a previous mandate imposed by the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. Because of these mandates, \nI do not believe that the President's plan will improve education in \nNebraska and I am deeply concerned that it may likely cause greater \nfinancial harm.\n  The lack of IDEA funding is the bill's biggest failure, and my \nprimary reason for opposing it. When Congress passed the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act in 1975, it promised to pay 40 percent \nof the cost of educating children with special needs. Since then, it \nhas never contributed more than 15 percent of the funding for special \neducation, with the States left to cover the shortfall, placing a \ngreater strain on local property taxes.\n  When the Senate originally passed this bill in June, it included an \namendment by Senators Harkin and Hagel to finally require the Federal \nGovernment to pay its 40 percent share of the costs of special \neducation. Unfortunately, the final version does not include the \nHarkin-Hagel plan, depriving the State of Nebraska more than $300 \nmillion over the next 5 years. The failure to fully fund IDEA short \nchanges not only the services provided to students with disabilities, \nbut all students by forcing reductions in other State and local \neducation programs.\n  The bill will also impose costly, burdensome, and, some would argue, \nduplicative annual testing requirements on Nebraska's schools. The \nPresident has said that these tests will provide accountability for \nschools that fail to properly educate their students, but Nebraska \nschools are already holding themselves accountable.\n  We have a rigorous program of standards and assessments in place and \nour students consistently rank among the best in the Nation. Local \nschools and community leaders have worked hard with the State \nDepartment of Education to put this system in place and we know it is \nworking. The State of Nebraska has no reservations about being held \naccountable for educating its students. But I believe the people of \nNebraska have every right to demand accountability from the Federal \nGovernment and I do not believe they are getting it with this bill.\n  This legislation will require Nebraska to develop and administer a \ndozen additional tests each year to be in compliance but it does not \nprovide adequate funding to do so. Across the Nation, fewer than a \nthird of the States have assessments in place that will satisfy the \nrequirements of this bill. But States are already spending in excess of \nthe $400 million provided by the bill on their assessment programs, \nbefore you factor in the new tests. We know from the outset that this \nis going to cost States a considerable amount of money at a time when \ntaxpayer dollars are already scarce.\n  That is not my idea of accountability. Combined with the failure to \nfully fund IDEA this marks a retreat from accountability.\n  The National Governors Association recently announced that \ncollectively the States will report a $35 billion deficit this year. In \n2001, the State of Nebraska suffered a $220 million budget shortfall. \nTo make up for the shortfall caused by these unfunded mandates, local \ngovernments will have to dramatically cut education spending, or \nsignificantly increase property taxes. As a former Governor who has had \nto deal with the challenges of balancing State budgets, neither of \nthese options is acceptable in my estimation.\n  This will be a difficult vote for me. The President and most of my \ncolleagues, both Democrat and Republican support this legislation. I \nknow that my colleagues have worked very hard to reach this agreement \nand I appreciate their hard work. There are some victories to \ncelebrate. The bill provides a significant increase in overall funding, \nbetter targeting of title I resources, greater flexibility, some \nadditional funding for rural schools, and mentoring legislation that I \nworked on with Congressman Osborne.\n  But on balance, I do not believe that these ultimately outweigh the \nfinancial problems that the plan will create within local schools and \nthe State budget, and accordingly, I must vote no on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support, with some reservations, the the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act Reauthorization conference \nreport, which the Senate is about to overwhelmingly adopt. While I \nsupport this legislation as a whole, I continue to have some concerns \nabout testing provisions which it contains, and I believe that the \nCongress must monitor the impact of these provisions on students. I \nalso regret that the Senate provision requiring Congress to fully fund \nthe 40 percent of special education costs, was not retained in the \nconference report. Keeping this commitment is critical and we must \naddress this issue next year during reauthorization of the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, IDEA.\n  Since 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has sought to \nhelp our K thru 12 students learn in an appropriate learning \nenvironment as well as assist school communities in meeting new and \ngrowing challenges. The work that we have concluded today seeks to help \nall students make progress toward reaching their full potential. It \nsets high standards for all children and provides flexible Federal \nsupport that focuses on initiatives that we know are effective, such \nas: smaller classes, high quality teachers, after-school programs, \ntechnology and technology training for teachers, targeting resources to \ntitle I for educationally disadvantaged students, support for students \nwith limited English proficiency, an expanded reading program, a strong \nSafe and Drug Free Schools Program, and guarantees of a quality \neducation for homeless kids. Therefore, on balance, I believe this is a \ngood bill, not just because of what it does, but because of what it \ndoes not do. We successfully defeated vouchers, block grants, the \nrepeal of After-School programs and the repeal of funding for emergency \nschool repair and construction.\n  I am especially pleased that this compromise reform legislation \nprovides some needed support to low performing schools. Struggling \nschools will be identified for extra help so that school improvement \nfunds can be targeted where they are most needed. Students would have \nthe option of attending other schools, including public charter \nschools. The legislation authorizes $500 million in direct grants to \nlocal school districts to help improve low-performing schools most in \nneed of assistance. It sets a 12-year goal for States and schools to \nclose the achievement gaps between rich and poor, and minority and non-\nminority students. The bill also ensures that parents will have better \ninformation about their local schools through annual report cards and \nstrong parent involvement.\n  The Reading First provisions of the legislation authorize an \nimportant new initiative that provides nearly $1 billion for States and \nlocal school districts to improve reading education, and help teachers \nget ready to ensure that all children become proficient readers. I am \npleased that an amendment I offered, to permit funds under this program \nto be used for family literacy programs, was retained. The conference \nreport also retained two additional amendments that I offered to ensure \nthat teachers are trained to effectively use technology in the \nclassroom to improve teaching and learning.\n  Though not all that I had hoped for, this bipartisan legislation \ncontains reforms that seeks to provide all of our students with a much \ngreater opportunity to learn and to succeed.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today the Senate will vote to pass \ncomprehensive education reform legislation in the form of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act of 2001.\n  This important legislation contains the Native American Education \nImprovement Act of 2001 which I was proud to have introduced in January \n2000, along with Senator Inouye, to improve the education of Native \nAmerican youth across the country.\n  I would first like to thank the Bush administration and the conferees \nfor working with the Indian Affairs Committee to work on the Indian \nportion of this legislation to benefit the schools in Indian country \nand the education of Native children.\n  In 1965, Congress passed The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nESEA, which is broad-sweeping legislation that provides funding for \nvarious educational programs in an effort to assist underprivileged \nstudents and school districts. While the original focus of ESEA was to \nbe a supplemental source for needy public schools,\n\n[[Page S13385]]\n\nthe ESEA now provides funds to and affects virtually every public \nschool in the nation.\n  As a former teacher and one who knows all-too-well the problems faced \nby Indian youngsters, I strongly believe that education holds the key \nto individual accomplishment, the promotion of developed Native \ncommunities, and real self determination.\n  I believe that the Native American Education Improvement Act of 2001 \nis legislation that improves the conditions and operations of Bureau \nand tribally-operated schools.\n  This act represents more than 2 years' worth of committee hearings to \ndevelop a comprehensive set of reforms that address all areas of BIA \nand tribally-operated schools in issues that include accreditation, \naccountability, the recruitment of Indian teachers, and the \nconstruction of Indian schools.\n  I note that this legislation contains an innovative specification \nrequiring accreditation. Twenty-four months after enactment of this \nact, Bureau funded schools must be accredited or in the process of \nobtaining accreditation by one of the following: an approved tribal \naccrediting body; or a regional accreditation agency; or in accordance \nwith State accreditation standards.\n  The act also requires a report to be completed by the Secretary of \nEducation and Secretary of Interior in consultation with tribes and \nIndian education organizations leading to the establishment of a \n``National Tribal Accrediting Agency.''\n  Quality assurance mechanisms are included in this act regarding the \nfailure of a school to achieve or maintain accreditation and any \nunderlying staffing, curriculum, or other programmatic problems in the \nschool that contributed to the lack of or loss of accreditation.\n  Indian kids around the country need a solid education that will give \nthem the tools they need to excel in today's competitive world. With \nthe passage of this act the Senate declares that it will no longer \ntolerate schools that fail, year after year, with no consequences to \nthe schools but plenty of consequences for the children.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, one of the most important issues facing \nour Nation continues to be the education of our children. Providing a \nsolid, quality education for each and every child is critical not only \nto the prosperity of our Nation in the years ahead, but also to \nensuring that all our children reach their full potential.\n  Whether we work in the private sector or in government, we all have \nan obligation to develop and implement initiatives that strengthen the \nquality of education we offer our children. It is essential that we \nprovide our children with the essential academic tools they need to \nsucceed professionally, economically and personally.\n  Unfortunately, we can no longer take for granted that our children \nare learning to master even the most basic skill of reading. A recent \nsurvey reported that less than one-third of fourth- graders in America \nare ``proficient readers.'' In fact, 40 million Americans cannot fill \nout a job application or read a menu in a restaurant much less a \ncomputer menu. In this high-tech information age, these Americans will \nbe lost and that is unacceptable.\n  In addition, American children lack basic knowledge of their Nation's \ncultural and historical traditions. For example, a recent report \nindicated that half of American high school seniors did not know when \nLincoln was President; did not know the significance of ``Brown v. \nBoard of Education''; and had no understanding of the aims of American \nforeign policy, either before or after World War II.\n  Since the tragic events of September 11, the American people, \nespecially our young citizens, have demonstrated through their courage \nand generosity that they are prepared to meet the challenges that face \nour Nation. But we must help them in their quest for knowledge and \ninstruction.\n  We must work to ensure that our students do not continue down the \npath of cultural illiteracy and educational under-performance. But how? \nWell, one major step in the right direction is to take away power from \neducation bureaucrats and return it to those on the front lines of \neducation--the local schools, the local teachers and the local parents.\n  Fortunately, the education authorization bill before the Senate today \nis a step in that direction. This bill provides support and guidance to \nour State and local communities to strengthen our schools, while also \ngiving much needed flexibility for every State related to the use of \nFederal education dollars. This education bill contains many \ninitiatives that will help ensure that more Federal education dollars \nreach our classrooms rather than being lost in bureaucratic black hole.\n\n  This bill also strives to improve the quality of our Nation's \nteaching force by allocating $3 billion for recruiting and training \ngood teachers. We must ensure that our teachers are continually \nimproving their skills and retain their desire to teach. We also need \nto ensure that we recruit the brightest and enthusiastic students into \nthe teaching profession.\n  This measure helps make schools more accommodating and friendly for \nparents. In addition, it works to ensure that parents are better \ninformed about the public education system by providing pertinent \ninformation regarding their child's school. Annual report cards \npertaining to each school's specific performance, along with statewide \nperformance results, will be available for public view.\n  One of the most important factors in our children's success in school \nis parental involvement. Parents are our first teachers. Our first \nclassroom is the home, where we learn the value of hard work, respect, \nand the difference between right and wrong. As I have said before, the \nhome is the most important Department of Education.\n  Parental involvement is the best guarantee that a child will succeed \nin school. I am genuinely excited when I think of the many reforms \ntaking place across the country--namely school vouchers and charter \nschools--that are wisely built on this premise: Let parents decide \nwhere their children's educational needs will best be met.\n  In the broadest sense, this is what school choice is all about.\n  School choice stimulates improvement and creates expanded \nopportunities for our children to get a quality education. Our public \nschool system has many good schools, but there are many schools that \nare broken. Instead of serving as a gateway to advancement, these \nschools have become dead-end places of despair and low achievement. In \nurban settings, the subject performance of 17-year-old African-American \nand Hispanic students is at the same level as 13-year-old-white \nstudents. This is an unacceptable and embarrassing failure on the part \nof our public schools.\n  Exciting things are happening in Milwaukee and Cleveland, where \nschool voucher programs have been put in place. There, minority school \nchildren are being given a chance to succeed. The early signs are good: \ntest scores and performance are up.\n  We need more such experiments, and I am gravely disappointed that \nthis authorization bill failed to contain such a provision. Repeatedly, \nI have proposed legislation for a 3-year Nationwide test of the voucher \nprogram. It would be funded not by draining money away from the public \nschools but by eliminating Federal pork barrel spending and corporate \ntax loopholes.\n  This is an important component that sadly was left out of this \nmeasure. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to provide parents and our students with choices to ensure \nthat our children, no matter what their family's income, have access to \nthe best possible education for their unique academic needs.\n  Finally, I am very disappointed that the conferees eliminated an \nimportant provision adopted during the Senate debate that would have \nensured that the federal government finally fulfill its obligation to \nfund 40 percent of the cost for meeting the special educational needs \nof our nation's children through the Individuals with Disabilities Act.\n  My dear friend and colleague, Senator Hagel, fought valiantly for \nthis provision but unfortunately it was watered down. This is \nunacceptable. Congress needs to follow the laws it makes and provide \nfull funding for the Federal portion of IDEA. We ask our schools to \neducate children with disabilities, but we don't give them enough money \nfor the expensive evaluations, equipment and services needed to do \nthat. There\n\n[[Page S13386]]\n\nare 6 million children that receive special education funding, so let's \nfully support their academic needs.\n  James Madison once wrote that without an educated electorate, the \nAmerican experiment would become ``a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps \nboth.'' Let us stop the slide in the performance of our students. Let \nus return the control of education to our local communities. Let us \nrenew our trust in our parents and teachers and do what is best for our \nchildren.\n  This is why I am supporting this measure today. While it could be \nstrengthened, the bill does make needed strides to improve our Nation's \nschools.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to put my full support behind \nthe conference report for H.R. 1, the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  It has been a true honor to serve on the conference committee for \nthis important legislation, especially as a freshman Member of the \nSenate.\n  I would first thank the leaders of the conference for their hard work \nand determination to complete this legislation for the President's \nsignature this year. Senators Kennedy and Gregg worked every day with \ngreat determination on this legislation without partisan rancor, and \nChairman Boehner and Representative Miller showed the same \ndetermination and steadfastness.\n  I am pleased that Congress has finally completed action on one of \nPresident Bush's top domestic priorities this year. President Bush and \nSecretary Paige deserve commendation for their commitment not only to \nthis legislation, but also to the education of our Nation's children. \nNever before has a President shown such commitment to the issue of \neducation.\n  In March I addressed this body for the first time as a U.S. Senator \non the topic of education. Little did I know the opportunity I would be \ngiven to be a member of the conference committee to reauthorize of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  At that time I stated the following:\n\n       Our public schools are failing our children. And unless we \n     address this problem now--today--we will bear the \n     consequences for a generation or more. Let's not forget: \n     today's students are tomorrow's leaders--in business, \n     technology, engineering, government and every other field. If \n     even the brightest of our young people can't compete in the \n     classroom with their colleagues abroad in math and science, \n     how will they be able to compete with them as adults in the \n     world of business? How can we expect them to develop into the \n     innovators America needs to maintain--and, yes, expand--her \n     dominant role in the global marketplace? We need to make sure \n     every single student in America graduates with the basic \n     skills in communications, math, and information technology \n     that are necessary to excel in the New Economy. As a nation, \n     we simply cannot afford to accept the status quo.\n  With the passage of this legislation I believe that our schools will \nimprove. And if they fail, there will be consequences. This legislation \nstates loud and clear that the status quo is not acceptable. Students \nwill have the opportunities to be tomorrow's leaders by having access \nto technology and other advanced programs that are needed for continued \nexcellence. Our disadvantaged children will be given the assistance \nthey need, and deserve, to succeed in the global marketplace of the \nfuture.\n  In that same speech I mentioned that my home State of Nevada faces \nmany obstacles in obtaining title I funds for our eligible children. \nTitle I dollars are the largest source of assistance that states \nreceive from the Federal Government.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act will be particularly beneficial to title \nI eligible students in my home State of Nevada by recognizing that \nfamilies move around and children are often unaccounted for when \nFederal funds are dispensed from the Federal Government to States. The \nState of Nevada has been particularly hard hit in the past when the \nmost recent and accurate ``kid counts'' were not available.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure that title I dollars are properly \nand fairly sent to each State. My population update provision, that is \nan important part of this legislation, will ensure that this happens \nevery year. As a member of the conference committee, I worked hard to \nensure that this provision I offered as an amendment during the \nSenate's consideration of this legislation was included in the final \nbill. This amendment requires the Department of Commerce and the \nDepartment of Education to produce annually updated data on the number \nof title I eligible children in each state so that title I dollars can \nbe accurately allocated to the States.\n  The annual population update provision in this legislation states:\n\n       The Secretary shall use annually updated data, for purposes \n     of carrying out section 1124, on the number of children, aged \n     5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for \n     counties or local educational agencies published by the \n     Department of Commerce. . . .\n\n  To further clarify this language, the following statement is included \nin the conference report that accompanies this legislation:\n\n       The Conferees strongly urge the Department of Education and \n     the Department of Commerce to work collaboratively to produce \n     annually updated data on the number of poor children as soon \n     as possible, but not later than March 2003. The conferees \n     believe it is imperative that the departments use annually \n     updated data, as produced by the Department of Commerce, as \n     provided for in the Conference agreement. The Conferees \n     recognize that additional resources will likely be necessary \n     to produce annually updated data and therefore expect the \n     Departments of Commerce and Education to submit budget \n     requests that reflect the efforts that will be necessary \n     to carry out this new responsibility.\n\n  It is imperative that the Secretary recognizes the vital importance \nof this provision to children not only in Nevada, but also in every \nother State in the Nation. After all, these funds represent the largest \nsource of Federal funds to states and local school districts, and it is \nonly fair that the funds are properly and fairly distributed. I look \nforward to working with both the Secretary of Education and the \nSecretary of Commerce in implementing this provision.\n  This conference agreement that is before us today also provides \nStates and local school districts with an unprecedented level of \nflexibility. States and local school districts will finally be able to \nspend Federal education dollars in a manner that will best suit their \nunique needs. The Federal Government has long been too prescriptive as \nto how Federal funds could be spent. School districts will now have the \nfreedom to provide additional funds to the children that need the most \nhelp.\n  This flexibility will come with added responsibility, but it is a \nchallenge that I believe all States and local school districts will be \nwilling and, quite frankly, satisfied to accept. In giving these \nentities increased flexibility, we are requiring a higher level of \naccountability for student achievement. We do not want to create \nanother layer of bureaucracy that tells schools precisely how to \nmeasure student achievement. We simply want to ensure that all students \nare performing at grade-level and that their school is doing what it is \nsupposed to do: educate students. By annually testing students, \nparents, teachers, and the students themselves will finally know \nwhether or not their school is doing its job.\n  If a school is failing to properly educate children, we do not want \nto immediately punish that school. We understand that change is \ndifficult, and some years are going to be worse than others. However, \nwe do expect to see results. If a school is failing, the Federal \nGovernment will provide technical support to assist in improving \nstudent's test scores. However, the burden ultimately lies with each \nschool to show improvement year to year. The Federal Government cannot \nsimply stand by and watch some of our Nation's public schools fail to \neducate our children. Their futures are simply too important to waste.\n  Parents, teachers, and administrators will also benefit from the \npassage of this landmark legislation. Parents will be provided with \nannual report cards on the performance of the school their child \nattends. If the school is failing, parents will be given a choice of \nwhere to send their child to school, including charter schools. If a \nschool is chronically or persistently failing, a parent will be given \nfederal funds for supplemental services for their child. This includes \nprivate tutoring services by any entity of the parent's choice.\n  Teachers and administrators will be given more opportunities for \nextensive professional development. States and local school districts \nwill be able to use the funds provided by this section of\n\n[[Page S13387]]\n\nthe bill in any number of ways that they believe will most benefit \ntheir teachers. Professional development should be held in higher \nesteem than it has in the past. For the first time, teachers will be \nable to enjoy comprehensive professional development opportunities that \nwill truly enrich their knowledge and further improve their teaching \nskills.\n  Teachers will also be given legal protections from frivolous \nlawsuits--a provision I have championed with several of my colleagues \nfrom the very beginning. A teacher can no longer be sued for something \nthat he or she may do in the normal course of his or her daily duties. \nIt is time that students and parents realize the real day-to-day \nresponsibilities that teachers have and respect them to use their best \njudgment to properly remedy classroom mishaps.\n  Above all else, the real winners in this legislation are the students \nthemselves. We are finally providing the most needy students with the \nsupport they need to get an appropriate education. We are providing \ntheir teachers with the tools they need to teach these students. We are \nproviding their administrators with the training they need to be the \nmost effective leaders they can be for these students. We are providing \nthem with access to technology, arts and music, and many other \nimportant educational opportunities to ensure that they leave our \npublic education system as well-rounded students prepared for the \nchallenges of the global economy.\n  I am pleased with the final product that this conference committee \nhas produced. I can truly say that the education system in this country \nis receiving a much-deserved and much-needed facelift because of this \nlegislation. Nevadans should also applaud this legislation. Federal \ndollars will finally flow into the State at the rate they should and \nwill finally be utilized in ways that will most benefit the greatest \nnumber of needy students.\n  The education of our children is one of the most important issues \nthat will come before Congress. I believe that Congress has accepted \nthis responsibility wholeheartedly with the passage of this \nlegislation. This legislation ensures that current and future \ngenerations receive the education they deserve to succeed in this great \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the conference \nreport on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, ESEA, which expands and improves the Federal Government's \ncommitment to education.\n  In my view, there is no more important issue before the Congress than \neducation. As our economy becomes increasingly global and based on high \ntechnology, its future is increasingly dependent on the quality of our \nworkforce. The better our educational system is, the stronger our \neconomy and our Nation will be. That's why, as a nation, we should make \neducation our top priority.\n  Some have suggested that local school boards should be left alone to \nsolve these problems on their own. But I disagree. In general, I do \nsupport local control of education. But local control doesn't mean much \nif you don't have adequate resources within your control. And it's not \nenough to leave the problem to States, which can pit urban areas \nagainst suburban communities, a fight with no winners.\n  No, if we are serious about education, we need to make it a national \npriority. And we need to ensure that our National Government plays an \nactive and aggressive role.\n  I am pleased that the conference report on the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, the Better Education for \nStudents and Teachers Act, takes a significant step toward increasing \nour Federal commitment to education. I want to commend Chairman Kennedy \nand Ranking Member Gregg for their tireless work in developing this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation requires States to set high standards for every \nstudent and strengthens Federal incentives to boost low-performing \nschools and significantly improve education achievement. It has strong \naccountability measures that I hope will help narrow the educational \nachievement gaps that threaten every child's access to the American \ndream. And, it better targets funding to schools serving the neediest \nstudents, to make sure that they have the resources to hire and train \nwell-qualified teachers, pay for additional instruction, and increase \naccess to after-school and school safety programs.\n  In particular, I want to note that the final conference report \ncontains a provision I authored to promote financial literacy. \nUnfortunately, when it comes to personal finances, young Americans \nunfortunately do not have the skills they need. Too few understand the \ndetails of managing a checking account, using a credit card, saving for \nretirement, or paying their taxes. It's a serious problem and it's time \nfor our education system to address it more effectively.\n  We need to teach all our children the skills they need, including the \nfundamental principles involved with earning, spending, saving and \ninvesting, so they can manage their own money and succeed in our \nsociety.\n  I am not alone in advocating the importance of financial literacy. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently said that: ``Improving \nbasic financial education at the elementary and secondary school levels \nis essential to providing a foundation for financial literacy that can \nhelp prevent younger people from making poor financial decisions.''\n  The amendment I authored, along with Senators Enzi, Akaka and Harkin, \nwill include financial education as an allowable use in the local \ninnovative education grant program, which funds innovative educational \nimprovement programs. Elementary and secondary schools will be able to \napply for Federal funds for activities to promote financial education, \nsuch as disseminating and encouraging the best practices for teaching \nthe basic principles of personal financial literacy, including the \nbasic principles involved with earning, spending, saving and investing. \nAs a result, schools will have access to resources to allow them to \ninclude financial education as part of the basic educational \ncurriculum. I am grateful to the conferees for including this important \nprovision in the final conference report.\n  I do have some reservations about this legislation, however. In \nparticular, I am concerned that the testing provisions may impose \nsignificant burdens on schools without providing them with adequate \nresources to help them implement the requirements. In addition, I have \nserious questions about subjecting young children to a battery of tests \nevery year. We do not have sufficient information to know whether \nconstant testing is the best way to monitor our children's educational \nprogress, and indeed, the pressure of such tests may detract from their \neducational experiences. I hope that Congress will closely monitor the \nimplementation of these and other provisions to ensure that they do not \nundermine the worthwhile reform efforts in this legislation.\n  Of course, reauthorization of ESEA is not the only critical education \nissue we will face in this Congress. Next year, we will be \nreauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, \nwhich has meant so much to children with disabilities in New Jersey and \nacross the country. Unfortunately, however, we have drastically \nunderfunded this program, which has imposed a tremendous burden on \nlocal communities in New Jersey and across the Nation.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, school budgets are capped by law at 3 \npercent annual growth. Therefore, districts often have to cut other \nprograms to accommodate mandated and rising special-education costs. \nOr, local property taxpayers, who already are overburdened, have to pay \nincreased taxes to cover expenses that the Federal Government should be \nsharing.\n  I have received many letters, phone calls, and emails from concerned \nconstituents urging Congress to fulfill the promise of full funding for \nthe services mandated under IDEA.\n  One woman, for example, wrote: ``My son is currently enrolled in our \ndistrict's preschool disabled program. He is autistic and requires a \nfull day program with intensive, 1:1 teaching. He is one of four \nchildren in the class, all with similar needs. Not only does this \nprogram require extra staffing, it also requires very specialized \ntraining.\n\n[[Page S13388]]\n\nThanks to the incredible teachers and support staff, Kevin is making \nwonderful progress. This, of course, would not be possible without the \nfunding provided by the school district.''\n  This woman then went on to note that in her town, special education \ncosts have increased by 14 percent, 26 percent, and 11 percent over the \nlast 3 years, while revenues have only increased by 3 percent annually. \nThe result has been that the school district has had to use funds \nintended for regular education in order to cover the special education \ncosts.\n  Another parent, whose son has Down syndrome said, ``It makes me very \nconcerned when administrators are phrasing things in a way that makes \nit sound like special ed is denying the other kids. It's not special \neducation that's denying them. It's the funding mechanism that's doing \nit.''\n  Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped that we would fulfill our \ncommitment to the States, fully funding the Federal share of 40 percent \nof the average cost per pupil that we envisioned when IDEA first passed \nthe Congress. Unfortunately, the conference committee rejected full \nfunding of IDEA. I was very disappointed that we missed this \nopportunity to ease the burden on local communities, but remain \ncommitted to working to increase the Federal share of IDEA spending in \nnext year's reauthorization.\n  With this education reform bill we are taking significant strides to \nenhance our educational system and provide every child with the \nopportunity they deserve to achieve their full potential. I am pleased \nto support the conference report.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I join my Senate colleagues in \nsupport of the conference agreement to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA. I want to thank Senators Gregg and Kennedy for all \nof the long hours I know they put into this legislation, and all of the \nconferees for that matter.\n  Now, do I agree with all of the provisions in this bill? No. Does \nthis bill contain everything? No. But I do think it is heading in the \nright direction, and I do look forward to working with members on many \nprovisions contained within this bill and those not within this bill. \nThis legislation is certainly not perfect, and I bet that much of what \nit contains will be revisited.\n  There is nothing more important than making sure our kids have the \neducational tools they need to get ahead in today's competitive world. \nThat means making sure our schools are top notch, making sure students \nhave access to technology and up-to-date learning materials, and our \nteachers are equipped with the skills and tools they need to be their \nbest.\n  I believe that for the most part, the conferees have done a good job \ncoming up with a plan that will enable our children to compete in \ntomorrow's economy. Companies moving to a new State place a high \npriority on a quality education system and access to trained workers. \nMontana's schools are among the best in the Nation. However, there is \nmore that needs to be done and areas where additional improvements need \nto be made, such as in science and math. In order to ensure a quality \neducation and future for young Montanans, we must focus on critical \nareas.\n  I am pleased to see that conferees recognize that schools in rural \nareas and small America often require additional assistance in \nimplementing high technology programs and other advanced curriculum. So \nmany schools in small rural towns are isolated and technology can offer \nrural students opportunities that they otherwise would not have. \nEnsuring that students in rural areas are as technologically literate \nas students in more urban areas is vital. I believe the conferees have \nshown their commitment to improve achievement in rural areas and have \nmade sure that rural kids will have the tools they need to participate \nin the complex economy of the 21st century.\n  Montana has done a lot in the area of distance learning. There is a \ncapability, in many schools to give children a wider variety of \nclasses, and this bill will only help to enhance that. We must also \nfocus on making sure our children have a good learning environment. All \nthe funding, technology and books in the world won't help our children \nif they do not have a good environment in which to learn.\n  We must ensure that Montana parents and teachers retain control over \neducation decisions, that Federal funds are targeted toward Montana's \nneeds, and that Federal rules don't interfere with our ability to teach \nour children. States must be able to free themselves from Federal red \ntape and have the opportunity to use this flexibility to boost student \nachievement. Whenever possible, decisions about the education of our \nchildren should be made at the local level. Montana parents and \neducators know best what works for Montana kids, and I am glad to see \nthat this conference agreement allows for that.\n  At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the Federal \nGovernment makes important investments in our children, such as \neducating students who live on Federal land. I am pleased to see that \nthis conference report also goes a long way to support Impact Aid and \nfulfill the Federal Government's continuing responsibility to the \neducation of children living on military bases, Indian reservations, or \nother Federal property. The conference committee has ensured these \nprograms retain high quality and provide for not only the basic \nelementary and secondary educational needs, but culturally related \nacademic needs as well.\n  I think this agreement, while not perfect, does lay some groundwork \nand provides an important partnership between Federal, State, and local \nefforts to educate children and includes ridding some Federal mandates \nthat burden local educators. Rules that make sense in New York are \noften restrictive and expensive in Havre, MT. I'm glad to see that our \nlocal schools will have the flexibility they need to better educate our \nchildren.\n  I must say that I have some concerns over the assessment requirements \ncontained in this bill and the funding of these assessments. In a State \nlike Montana, where money is often hard to come by, we have a difficult \ntime funding the few tests currently required. The Federal Government \nmust obligate funds toward these new testing requirements, States \ncannot be left with an unfunded mandate.\n  Congress has correctly asked schools to teach our disabled children. \nUnfortunately, only 10 percent of the funding for such activities has \ncome from the Federal Government. That means local school districts, \nalways forced to squeeze shrinking tax dollars, are often times asked \nto pay thousands of dollars to comply with inflexible Federal rules \nthat many times disregard small rural school districts. It is \nimperative that we fulfill our promise to fully fund IDEA. While we \nstill have a long way to go, I do believe we have made great strides, \nand we are heading in the right direction, toward full funding. Full \nfunding of IDEA has always been extremely important to me, and I will \ncontinue my work with educators and school boards to make sure that we \nfund a larger percentage of the costs of this program. I have great \nconfidence that the Senate will also continue working to this end.\n  States and locals must have the funds to develop high-quality \nprofessional development programs, address teacher shortages, and \nprovide incentives to retain quality teachers. Some of the most \nimportant provisions in this legislation concern teachers. Teachers are \nour greatest educational resources and have such a great impact on a \nchild's life. I am glad to see that this legislation goes a long way to \nensure technology and training opportunities for our teachers.\n  As Congress continues to consider various education programs, I will \nbe actively involved to make sure Montana's needs are addressed. I will \nfight against a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach that in my opinion, \ntends to do more harm to a quality education than good, and will fight \nto ensure that significant investment is provided to all children and \ntheir teachers.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nsupport for the education reform package that is now before the Senate. \nAfter debating this issue for almost three years, I am pleased we have \nreached a bi-partisan agreement on a package that puts our children's \nfuture ahead of the partisan bickering that has diverted our energy and \nattention for too\n\n[[Page S13389]]\n\nlong. In my opinion, the proposal before the Senate represents an \nimportant step in the right direction by recognizing the right of every \nchild to receive a high quality education.\n  Before I describe why I think this proposal is important for our \nnation's future and my home State of Arkansas, I want to look back for \na moment on how we arrived at where we are today.\n  I doubt many of my colleagues remember what we did or debated in the \nSenate on May 9, 2000. I remember that date very well because that's \nthe day I joined 9 of my Senate New Democratic colleagues in offering a \nbold ESEA education reform plan known as the Three R's bill.\n  Prior to introducing our amendment, we had spend months drafting our \nbill and were very proud of the finished product. That day we arranged \nto come to the floor as a group to talk about why we felt our \ninnovative approach combined the best ideas of both parties in a way \nthat would allow both Democrats and Republicans to move beyond the \npartisan stalemate that had stalled progress for so long.\n  Needless to say, we were disappointed when our amendment attracted \nonly 13 votes. Normally, I might hesitate to remind my colleagues and \nconstituents of a vote like that. But I felt as strongly then as I do \ntoday, that the proposal we crafted provided an opportunity to improve \nour system of public education by refocusing our attention on academic \nprogress instead of on bureaucracy and process.\n  Fundamentally, we believe that by combining the concepts of increased \nfunding, targeting, local autonomy and meaningful accountability, \nStates and local school districts will have the tools they need to \nraise academic achievement and deliver on the promise of equal \nopportunity for every child.\n  So as I have listened to many of the comments delivered on the floor \ntoday, I can not help but reflect back on May 9 of last year when I \njoined Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh and other Senate New Democrats \non the Senate floor to unveil these fundamental principles. I am \ngratified that many of the priorities we spoke of that day have been \nincorporated into the final agreement we will hopefully adopt later \ntoday.\n  That having been said, I know many of my colleagues played a critical \nrole in fashioning this very important legislation. I especially want \nto express my appreciation to Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for \ntheir tireless efforts on behalf of our nation's school children. As \nsomeone who has followed the progress of this bill very closely, I \nthink each Member of this body owes the managers of this bill a debt of \ngratitude for bringing Senators with very different points of view \ntogether to find common ground on this critical issue. I applaud their \nleadership and I congratulate their success.\n  As I noted previously, I support this bipartisan compromise because \nit contains many of the elements that I think are essential to foster \nacademic success. It provides school districts with the resources they \nneed to meet higher standards. It expands access in Arkansas to funding \nfor teacher quality, English language instruction, and after-school \nprograms by distributing resources through a reliable formula based on \nneed, not on the ability of school districts to fill out a federal \ngrant application. And finally, and most importantly, in exchange for \nmore flexibility and resources, it holds states and school districts \naccountable for the academic performance of all children.\n  I do want to highlight one component of this legislation that I had a \ndirect role in shaping. During consideration of the Senate reform bill \nin May, I successfully offered an amendment with Senator Kennedy and \nothers calling on Congress to substantially increase funding to enable \nlanguage minority students to master English and achieve high levels of \nlearning in all subjects. More importantly for my State of Arkansas, \nunder the approach I promoted, funding will now be distributed to \nStates and local districts through a reliable formula based on the \nnumber of students who need help with their English proficiency.\n  Currently, even though Arkansas has experienced a dramatic increase \nin the number of limited English proficient (LEP) students during the \nlast decade, my State does very poorly in accessing Federal funding to \nmeet the needs of these students because the bulk of the funding is \ndistributed through a maze of competitive grants.\n  I am pleased the conferees accepted the funding level and the reforms \nI advocated. This new approach represents a dramatic improvement over \nthe current system and will greatly benefit schools and students in my \nstate.\n  Ultimately, I believe all of the reforms that are contained in this \nbill will make an important difference in the future of our children \nand our nation. So I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nurge the adoption of this truly landmark legislation.\n  Unfortunately, I fell compelled to mention one aspect of this \nlegislation that dampens my excitement for its passage. Even though I \nbelieve the bill on balance represents a major improvement over the \ncurrent federal framework, I am very disappointed that we are once \nagain denying the promise we made to our constituents in 1975 to pay 40 \npercent of the costs of serving students under IDEA.\n  In my opinion, our failure to live up to this promise undermines to \nsome extent the very reforms we seek to advance. While Congress and the \nAdministration continue to ignore the commitment we made 26 years ago, \nschool districts are forced to direct more and more state and local \nrevenues away from classroom instruction to pay the Federal share of \nthe bill. I will continue to work in the Senate to reverse this record \nof inaction which is profoundly unfair to school districts, teachers, \nand the students they serve.\n  I want to close, by thanking all of my colleagues who spent many \nweeks and months negotiating this agreement. Even though progress has \nbeen slow at times, the way Democrats and Republicans have worked \ntogether on this bill is a model I hope we can repeat often in the \nfuture. I already mentioned Senators Kennedy and Gregg without whom \nthis bill would not be possible. I also want to say a special word of \nthanks to Senators Lieberman and Bayh who demonstrated real leadership \nby talking about many of the reforms we are about to ratify before \nthose ideas were very popular. They deserve a lot of credit for the \nfinal agreement they helped draft and I was honored to join them in \ncrafting the original Three R's proposals that is clearly reflected in \nthe bill before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I also thank Senator Kennedy for getting a \ngood target formula in this bill.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine whose fingerprints are \nall over this bill--especially in the area of Rural-Flex and Ed-Flex, \nwhich she basically designed, and the reading programs. She has put a \nsignificant amount of time and effort into this bill, and it paid off \nroyally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by saluting the outstanding \nleadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg. It is due to their \ntireless efforts, their commitment to a quality education, and their \npersistence and hard work that we can celebrate today the passage of \nlandmark education reform legislation. It has been a great pleasure to \nwork with them, with Secretary of Education Paige, and with the \nPresident to reach this day.\n  During the past year, it has been a pleasure to work with my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle as well as with the President \nand the Secretary of Education on this landmark education legislation.\n  In approaching the reauthorization of the ESEA, I had three goals. \nOne was to provide greater flexibility and more funding to our small or \nrural school districts. The second was to strengthen and put greater \nemphasis on early reading programs so that we could in fact achieve the \ngoal of leaving no child behind. The third was fulfilling the Federal \ncommitment to funding its share of special education costs.\n  I am very pleased that we will realize the first two objectives \nthrough the Rural Education Achievement Program as well as the Reading \nFirst Program included in this bill. Although I am disappointed by the \nfailure of the IDEA mandatory funding amendments, I know the Senate \nsupport for IDEA full funding will carry over into next year. And it \nwill remain one of my highest priorities.\n\n[[Page S13390]]\n\n  The No Child Left Behind Act includes many innovative and promising \nreforms. Among the improvements is the Rural Education Achievement \nProgram which I authored. The program would benefit school districts \nwith fewer than 600 students in rural communities. More than 35 percent \nof all school districts in the United States have 600 or fewer \nstudents. In Maine, the percentage is even higher: 56 percent of our \n284 school districts have fewer than 600 students.\n  Rural school districts encounter two specific problems with the \ncurrent system of Federal funding.\n  The first is that formula grants often do not reach small, rural \nschools in amounts sufficient to achieve the goals of the programs. \nThese grants are based on school district enrollment, and, therefore, \nsmaller districts often do not receive enough funding from any single \ngrant to carry out a meaningful activity. One Maine district, for \nexample, received a whopping $28 to fund a district-wide Safe and Drug-\nfree School program. This amount is certainly not sufficient to achieve \nthe goal of that Federal program, yet the school district could not use \nthe funds for any other program.\n  Second, rural schools are often shut out of the competitive grant \nprocess because they lack the administrative staff and the grant \nwriters that large school districts have to apply for competitive \ngrants from the Federal Government. So they do not get to participate \nin those programs at all. To eliminate this inequity and give rural \nschools more flexibility to meet local needs, our legislation will \nallow rural districts to combine the funds from four categorical grant \nprograms and use them to address that school district's highest \npriorities.\n  In one school district, that might mean hiring a reading specialist \nor math teacher. In another, the priority might be upgrading the \nscience lab or increasing professional development or buying a new \ncomputer for the library. Whatever the need of that district, the money \ncould be combined for that purpose.\n  Let me give you a specific example of what these two initiatives \nwould mean for one Maine school district in northern Maine. The \nFrenchville and St. Agatha school system, which serves 346 students, \nreceives four separate formula grants ranging from $1,705 for Safe and \nDrug Free Schools to $10,045 under the Class Size Reduction Act. How do \nyou fight drug use with $1,700? And how do you reduce class sizes with \n$10,000? The grants are so small they are not really useful in \naccomplishing the goals of the program. The total for all four programs \nis just over $16,000. Yet each requires separate reporting and \ncompliance standards, and each is used for different--federally \nmandated--purposes.\n  Superintendent Jerry White told me that he needs to submit eight \nseparate reports, for four programs, to receive the $16,000. Under our \nbill, his school district would be freed from the multiple applications \nand reports; paperwork and bureaucracy would be reduced, and the school \nwould be able to make better use of its Federal funding.\n  The other problem facing small rural districts is their lack of \nadministrative capacity. In some cases, the superintendent acts as the \nsole administrator. With such minimal administrative resources, the \nschool district has no opportunity to apply for competitive grants. \nHere in Washington, we are surrounded by large urban school districts, \neach with more than 100,000 students and often having a central \nadministrative office with specialized staff and professional grant \nwriters. How can rural districts with a single administrator be \nexpected to compete for the same grant opportunities?\n  To compensate for the inequity, our legislation provides supplemental \nfunding. In the case of the Frenchville district, schools would receive \nan additional $34,000. Combined with the $16,000 already provided, the \nRural Education Achievement Program would make sure the District had \n$50,000 and the flexibility to use these funds for its most pressing \nneeds. That $50,000 can make a real difference in the education of \nschool children in northern Maine. The district could hire a math \nteacher or a reading specialist, whatever it needed. The district could \npurchase technology, upgrade professional development efforts, or \nengage in any other local reforms.\n  With this tremendous flexibility and additional funding come \nresponsibility and accountability. In return for the advantages our \nbill provides, participating districts would be held accountable for \ndemonstrating improved student performance over a 3-year period.\n  The focus of the No Child Left Behind Act is accountability, and \nrural schools are no exception. Schools will be held responsible for \nwhat is really important--improved student achievement--rather than for \ntime-consuming paperwork. As Superintendent White told me, ``Give me \nthe resources I need plus the flexibility to use them, and I am happy \nto be held accountable for improved student performance. It will \nhappen.'' I know most superintendents feel exactly the same way.\n\n  I am equally delighted that today's education bill will include \nsignificant new resources for early reading intervention programs. \nUnfortunately, today, in many schools, there are few services available \nto help a child who has a reading difficulty. Oftentimes, no help is \nprovided at all until that child reaches the third grade and is \nidentified for special education.\n  For students who have reached the third grade without the ability to \nread, every paragraph, every assignment, every day in the classroom is \na struggle. They constantly battle embarrassment and feelings of \ninadequacy, and they fall further and further behind. It is no wonder \nso many children without basic reading skills lose their natural \ncuriosity and excitement for learning.\n  The two new reading programs--Reading First and Early Reading First--\nin this legislation are based on the principle that if we act swiftly \nand teach reading effectively in the early grades, we will provide our \nchildren with a solid foundation for future academic success. Indeed, \nthe best way to ensure that no child is left behind is to teach every \nchild to read.\n  If a child's reading difficulty is detected early, and he or she \nreceives help in kindergarten or the first grade, that child has a 90 \nto 95 percent chance of becoming a good reader. These early \nintervention programs work. They are a wonderful investment.\n  By contrast, if intervention does not occur during the period between \nkindergarten and third grade, the ``window of literacy'' closes and the \nchances of that child ever becoming a good reader plummet. Moreover, if \na child with reading disabilities becomes part of the special education \nsystem, the chances of his or her leaving special education are less \nthan 5 percent. So this is a program that is going to improve the \nquality of life for these children, help them to become successful, \nand, in many cases, will avoid the need for special education and all \nthe costs involved in providing that kind of education. These are truly \ninvestments that make sense.\n  Other than involved parents, a good teacher with proper literacy \ntraining is the single most important prerequisite to a student's \nreading success. We also know that reading is the gateway to learning \nother subjects and to future academic achievement. That is why it is so \nimportant that this bill make such a national commitment to reading \nprograms.\n  Reading First is a comprehensive approach to promoting literacy in \nreading in all 50 States. It will support the efforts in States, such \nas Maine, that have already made great strides under the Reading \nExcellence Act in promoting literacy. Indeed, I am very proud of the \nwork the State of Maine has done. Our fourth graders lead the Nation \nyear after year in reading and other subjects.\n  President Bush deserves enormous credit for placing reading at the \ntop of our education agenda. The First Lady, Laura Bush, has also \nrepeatedly highlighted the importance of reading. President Bush also \ndeserves credit for being willing to work with us, the Members on both \nsides of the aisle, to hammer out the best possible education reform \nlegislation.\n  Again, I thank the President for all of his efforts, and Senator \nGregg and Senator Kennedy, because without their combined leadership we \nwould not be here today. Thanks to their hard work, we have quality \nlegislation before us today that will reform the public education \nsystem and bring our nation closer to the goal of providing every child \nwith an opportunity to succeed.\n\n[[Page S13391]]\n\n  With the improvements in rural education, and the emphasis in this \nbill on reading, flexibility, and accountability, as well as a host of \nother reforms, I am delighted to support this reauthorization of ESEA \nand to see our hard work and efforts over the past year come to \nfruition.\n  I am convinced this legislation is going to make a real difference \nfor the children of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to yield 3 minutes to \nour friend and colleague, the only Member of this body who has been \nboth a teacher and a school board member and has led the country, \nreally, understanding that smaller class sizes give the best \nopportunity for children to learn. She has been an invaluable member of \nour Education Committee and our Human Services Committee.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. \nI thank Senator Kennedy, and all of his staff, for the hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of hours they have put into making this bill a \nsuccess.\n  I do rise today to express my support for the ESEA conference report \nand to highlight some of my concerns with the bill.\n  Since 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has helped \nstudents in our schools have more equal access and be more effective \nthan ever before. It is important we renew our Federal education \npolicies in order to keep up with the growing challenges that face our \nschools.\n  While I do not agree with everything in the bill, I do believe \nCongress must move forward with education reform to provide the support \nthat our students need today.\n  Throughout this process, five principles have guided my \nconsideration.\n  First, I believe we have to invest in what we know works.\n  Second, we have to protect disadvantaged students and make sure they \nget the extra help they need.\n  Third, we have to make sure taxpayer dollars stay in public schools.\n  Fourth, we have to help our students meet national education goals.\n  And finally, we have to set high standards and provide the resources \nso all students can meet them.\n  On balance, I believe this bill meets all of my principles.\n  This is a bipartisan win for our students. I am proud that as we \nmoved forward we left behind some of the most troubling proposals: from \nvouchers to Straight A's. This bill requires high standards for all \nchildren and provides flexible Federal support that focuses on the \nthings that we know work, including smaller classes, high-quality \nteachers, afterschool programs, technology and technology training for \nour teachers, support for students with limited-English proficiency, a \nstrong Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, guarantees of a quality \neducation for homeless students, and more resources for disadvantaged \nstudents.\n  While I support the bill overall, I do continue to have significant \nconcerns about some of the mandates in the bill. I believe Congress \nmust now closely monitor how this bill impacts students.\n  My top concern, of course, is the funding in the bill. While we have \nmade progress in securing an additional $4 billion, I fear the funding \nlevel will be short of what our communities will need to carry out the \nmandates in the bill.\n  In part to ease this burden, I believe we must fully fund special \neducation next year. Almost every member of our conference committee \nexpressed a commitment to fulfilling the promise of full funding when \nIDEA is reauthorized. Keeping that commitment is critical to the \nsuccess of education reform.\n  I remain concerned, as well, about how the new tests will be used and \nabout the Federal Government setting the formula to measure student \nprogress. We now have a responsibility to make sure these mandates do \nnot end up holding children back. If this bill leads to more crowded \nclassrooms, fewer high-quality teachers, or a focus on testing instead \nof learning, then we will have to revisit these mandates.\n  But, on balance, this bill takes important steps forward to improve \nour public schools. While I am not pleased with every provision, I do \nnot want the Federal Government to miss this opportunity to help \nstudents throughout the country make progress.\n  So, again, I thank Senator Kennedy and his staff and my staff, \nincluding Bethany Little, for the tremendous amount of work they have \ndone to get us to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, who has been a key player on this bill in a variety of \ndifferent areas. He worked very hard on the flexibility issues, the \nbilingual issues, the merit pay issues, and teacher tenure. All sorts \nof different parts of this bill have been impacted by his influence. He \nhas been great to work with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am so pleased today to be able to \nrise in support of this legislation. I think it is an exciting day and \na memorable day for America that we adopt this legislation.\n  As a member of the Health and Education Committee and a member of the \nconference committee on this bill, I have worked long and hard with my \ncolleagues to ensure that the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Act comes to fruition.\n  I especially want to thank President Bush. When he came to \nWashington, he came with a vision to reform education. This is a big \nstep toward the fulfillment of that vision.\n  President Bush shows a true compassion for helping disadvantaged \nstudents gain the tools to succeed, a compassion he gained in his work \nas Governor. It is that vision and compassion that have gotten us to \nthis point of final passage. President Bush is to be commended for his \nefforts and his vision.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on the committee, and for \nhis chairmanship, his perseverance, and his willingness to reach \ncompromise and agreement on a number of issues.\n  It has been a great pleasure for me to be able to work with Senator \nGregg, as he has, through all the twists and turns in the long road of \nthis past year, continued to fight for accountability and expanded \noptions for parents. I admire his commitment to this legislation, and I \nam proud to have worked with him and to serve under his leadership on \nthe HELP Committee.\n\n  Starting in the early months of 1999, the Senate Health and Education \nCommittee began holding hearings on ESEA. The Senate attempted to pass \nan ESEA reauthorization bill during the 106th Congress, but was not \nsuccessful. Almost three years later, final passage is before us.\n  The impetus that has gotten to this point after a long and arduous \nprocess is our President. President Bush has made education his number \none domestic priority, and has injected new ideas and a deep sense of \npassion into this debate. Without his leadership, we would not be here \ntoday.\n  This bill reflects the themes that were laid out by the President \nlast year: accountability, parental options, flexibility, and funding \nwhat works.\n  This legislation will finally inject new accountability into the \ntitle I program. For too long, we have provided billions of dollars in \nfunding without seeing any results. In the past, we have let our \npoorest children down--no longer will we let this happen.\n  Our Nation has a right to expect all of our children to learn, and \nthis legislation will help local school districts identify their \nweaknesses and address them.\n  Schools, for the first time, will be held to a high standard. It is \ntime that we stop making excuses and expect results from our schools. \nThere will be stumbling blocks along the way, and this bill is not \nperfect, but the education of our children is too vital to delay \neducation reform.\n  There are a number of components that I am particularly pleased to \nsee included in the bill. The provision regarding supplemental \nservices, for which Senator Gregg has worked so diligently, is one of \nthem.\n  Under this legislation, in approximately 3,000 schools across the \ncountry, parents will have an immediate option to get help for their \nchildren through tutoring at their local Sylvan Center or afterschool \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S13392]]\n\n  Because of this legislation, over 200 schools in Arkansas will now \nprovide public school choice immediately to parents to allow them to \nsend their children to a higher performing public school. I am very \npleased with the provision called transferability that will allow every \nschool district in the country to shift up to 50 percent of Federal \nfunds between formula grant programs, with the exception of title I. \nThis will allow school districts to address priorities from year to \nyear as they see fit.\n  I am also very pleased with the rural education initiative, proposed \nand championed by Senator Collins, that will allow over 100 school \ndistricts in Arkansas to receive additional funding and flexibility \nover their formula funds.\n  As Senator Gregg mentioned, I am particularly glad to have been \ninvolved in the bilingual reforms that will now ensure fairness in the \ndistribution of dollars by turning the bilingual program into a formula \ngrant program. It will benefit States such as Arkansas that never did \nwell in the competitive grant competitions. For the first time, States \nmust now set objectives for students to learn English, a component that \nwas amazingly absent from the previous bilingual program.\n  I am glad to have been able to offer an amendment that allowed \nprofessional development funds for our teachers to now be used to \nreward the best teachers. That is a very commonsense and important \nreform in allowing those teacher development funds to be used in \nprograms to reward those teachers who have the best record of \nperformance.\n  This legislation is a giant step in education reform and represents a \nbipartisan agreement between Republicans, Democrats, the House, the \nSenate, and the administration. I am pleased to have worked on the bill \nand look forward to President Bush signing it into law. I thank him for \nhis vision and leadership. Education reform was a fleeting thought a \nyear ago. Thanks to George W. Bush, it is now a reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. Senator Kerry understands \nthat leadership in local schools makes an extraordinary difference. We \nhave seen constant examples of that. He has had a focus and attention \nparticularly on having good principals in the schools. He has \nintroduced a number of pieces of legislation. We have drawn on them \nheavily. He is one who is deeply concerned and involved in the \neducation issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.) The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleague and \ncongratulating him on his extraordinary leadership in this effort. I \nthank Senator Gregg also for his cooperation and leadership. Senator \nKennedy, as we all know, has been fighting for and pushing for \neducation reform for a long time. He has been our leading voice in the \nSenate on the subject of education. His tenacity in pursuing this in \nmoments that even appeared to be bleak--and I thank his staff also for \nthat--have helped to bring us to this moment.\n  It gives me great pleasure to come to the Senate floor today to talk \nabout, and to lend my support to, the conference report for H.R. 1, the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. This is groundbreaking legislation that \nenhances the Federal Government's commitment to our Nation's public \neducation system, dramatically reconfigures the federal role in public \neducation, and embraces many of the principles and programs that I \nbelieve are critical to improving the public education system.\n  This bill represents a true coming together of Republicans and \nDemocrats, and both sides made important compromises in order to arrive \nat this point. I have come to the floor many times over the past few \nyears to express my belief that we were past due to break the partisan \ngridlock over education reform, and to come together around the \nprograms, policies, and initiatives that members of both parties could \nagree are critical to improving public education. For years we spun our \nwheels as we tried to reform the public education system, Republicans \ncalling for a diminished Federal role, Democrats calling for more \nprograms and greater funding levels. I was of the opinion that there \nwas significant room for consensus on public education reform, and last \nyear I worked with 10 of my Democratic colleagues to introduce \nlegislation that would help break the stalemate and move beyond the \ntired, partisan debates of the past. Our education proposal became the \nfoundation of the bill before us today. I am extraordinarily pleased \nthat Republicans and Democrats came together to adopt a fresh, new \napproach to improving public education, one that focuses on increasing \nstudent achievement and that provides increased resources and \nflexibility in exchange for increased accountability.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act provides public schools with more \nfunding and flexibility in return for demanding accountability for \nresults. I am convinced that a strong accountability system is the \nlinchpin of this reform. For the first time, the Federal Government \nwill put into place an accountability system that will hold States, \nschools, and districts accountable for steadily improving the learning \nof their children and closing the achievement gap between rich and poor \nand between minorities and non-minorities. The accountability \nprovisions in this bill sharply redefine the definition of adequate \nyearly progress to ensure that schools and districts are making \ndemonstrable gains in closing the achievement gap. This legislation \nrequires States, districts, and schools to set annual goals for raising \nstudent achievement so that all students achieve proficiency in 12 \nyears. The bill applies performance standards and consequences not only \nto the title I program but to all major programs. And in addition to \nrequiring tough corrective actions for chronically failing schools, it \ngives students in failing schools the right to either transfer to a \nbetter public school or obtain supplemental services.\n  This bill puts in place a new accountability system, which is a vital \nfirst step to improving student achievement. But implementing and \nenforcing the accountability system are equally as important as \ncreating one. The Federal Government must follow through on its \ncommitment to hold schools accountable for student achievement or the \nlegislation that we are passing today will do little to change the \nstatus quo. I urge the administration to vigorously implement and \nenforce the provisions of this new law.\n  Another key component of this bill is the expansion of public school \nchoice and charter schools. I strongly support increasing the \neducational options available to parents within the public school \nframework, and in fact, expanding public school choice has been one of \nmy education reform priorities. I believe that choice and competition \nwithin the public school system are vital ingredients to increasing \naccountability and improving our schools. I am pleased that the No \nChild Left Behind Act strengthens the Federal charter school program \nand authorizes the inter-and intra-district choice initiative. The \nlegislation also requires states and local districts to issue detailed \nreport cards with data on school performance so that parents can be \nbetter informed about the quality of their child's schools and can make \neducated decisions about which school their child should attend.\n  This bill does an excellent job of targeting federal education funds \nto public schools with large numbers of poor children. The title I \nprogram was originally designed to compensate for spending gaps left by \nstate and local education funding in order to help level the playing \nfield for children in low-income school districts. However, despite the \ngoal of sending funds to those very low-income schools, over the years, \nmoney has been directed to communities with extremely low poverty rates \nand in some instances does not reach the country's poorest schools at \nall. This legislation funnels new title I funding through the targeted \ngrant formula, which will ensure that the neediest communities receive \nadditional funding.\n  I am extremely pleased that the conference report includes my \namendments to improve school leadership and increase alternative \neducation opportunities, which were part of the education reform bill \nthat Senator Gordon\n\n[[Page S13393]]\n\nSmith and I introduced during the 106th Congress. Focusing on school \nleadership is critical to ensuring that the ambitions reforms contain \ndin this legislation are successfully implemented in the schools. Many \nof today's principals are reaching the age at which they could choose \nto retire, and evidence has pointed to a decline in the number of \ncandidates for each opening. If we don't stem the flow of retirees and \nbuoy up the numbers of aspiring principals, we will face a crucial \nschool leadership crisis--one that could debilitate meaningful \neducation reform. A good principal can create a climate that fosters \nexcellence in teaching and learning, while an ineffective one can \nquickly thwart the progress of the most dedicated reformers. I can tell \nyou unequivocally that I have never been in a blue-ribbon school that \ndoesn't have a blue-ribbon principal. And I'm sure that my colleagues \nhave noticed this, too when they have visited schools in their \nrespective States. Without a good leader as principal, it is difficult \nto instigate or sustain any meaningful chance and schools cannot be \ntransformed, restructured, or reconstituted without leadership.\n  Our amendment addressed this critical problem in school leadership by \ngiving States greater flexibility in the use of their title II dollars \nso that funding can be used to retain high-quality principles and to \nimprove principal quality. By expanding the list of authorized uses of \nfunds, this amendment will allow States and school districts to use \nFederal dollars to ensure that principals have the instructional skills \nto help teachers teach, implement alternative routes for principal \ncertification, or mentor new principals, and to provide principals with \nhigh-quality professional development.\n\n  The conference agreement also includes our amendment on alternative \neducation opportunities. The presence of chronically disruptive \nstudents in schools interferes with the learning opportunities for \nother students. One way to ensure safe schools and manageable \nclassrooms has been to require the removal of disruptive and dangerous \nstudents. While expulsion and suspensions may make schools safer and \nmore manageable, students' problems do not go away when they are \nremoved from the classroom--the problems just go somewhere else. The \nconsensus among educators and others concerned with at-risk youth is \nthat it is vital for expelled students to receive educational \ncounseling or other services to help modify their behavior while they \nare away from school. Without such services, students generally return \nto school no better disciplined and no better able to manage their \nanger or peaceably resolve disputes. Our amendment enable States and \nschool districts to develop, establish, or improve alternative \neducational opportunities for violent or drug abusing students under \nthe Safe and Drug Free Schools program.\n  This bill is a compromise, and thus, everyone can point to things \nthat they wish were done differently. I echo the comments made by my \ncolleagues, in particular Senator Jeffords, who have decried the lost \nopportunity to include in this bill guaranteed full funding for the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. This bill fails to deliver \non the Federal Governments commitment to fully fund special education, \nand it does this just as it places substantial new requirements on \nschools. Perhaps most disconcerting, all of this comes at a time when \nstate budgets are in deficit. According to the National Governors' \nAssociation, states are facing a $35 billion shortfall due to the \nnational recession, and states have already begun paring back their \neducation budgets. The No Child Left Behind Act contains significant, \nmeaningful reforms, but these reforms cannot succeed without sufficient \nresources. We expect about a 20 percent increase in education funding \nthis year, which is a tremendous step forward. But we need to continue \nto make resources a priority--we need to fully fund IDEA--we must not \nthrust new requirements on schools without providing them with \nsufficient resources to implement reforms.\n  I also have concerns about the mandatory testing provisions contained \nin the bill. This legislation requires the testing of all students in \nmath and reading in grades 3-8. I am not opposed to testing, in fact, I \nthink that tests are important so that we know year to year how well \nstudents are achieving. It is critically important to be able to \nidentify where gaps exists so that efforts can be focused on closing \nthem. When used correctly, good tests provide information that helps \nteachers understand the academic strengths and weaknesses of students \nand tailor instruction to respond to the needs of students with \ntargeted teaching and appropriate materials. My concern is that once we \nknow where the gaps exist, once we know how a child needs to be helped, \nwe will not provide the resources necessary to ensure that all students \nare able to reach proficiency. It is my sincere hope that Congress and \nthe States will continue to recognize that reform and resources go \nhand-in-hand. Resources without accountability is a waste of money, and \naccountability without resources is a waste of time. The two together \nare key to successful reform.\n  I would like to congratulate the conferees for their tremendous work \non this legislation. I am excited and encouraged by the reforms in this \nbill. I believe that they will have a tremendous impact on raising \nstudent achievement by increasing accountability, improving teacher and \nprincipal quality, expanding flexibility, and increasing public school \nchoice. This groundbreaking legislation has enormous potential. I hope \nthat the Congress will live up to its commitment to provide states and \nschools with the resources they need to make these reforms work.\n  We are now about to adopt a fresh new approach to improving public \neducation in a way that focuses on improving student achievement and \nproviding increased resources simultaneously. Though I will add to the \nvoice of my colleagues in the Senate, the resources are not what they \nneed to be to guarantee success.\n  Last year, I joined with 10 of my Democratic colleagues to introduce \nlegislation that we hoped would break the stalemate, that would change \nthe dialog. I would like to believe that thanks to the efforts of the \nSenator from Indiana and the Senator from Connecticut and others, we \nhave contributed in a way that has helped to shift that dialog.\n  We are now providing a strong accountability system which is the \nlinchpin of reform, together with a reconfiguration of the role that \nthe Federal Government plays in providing some resources and \nflexibility over the use of funds to the States in exchange for that \nstrong accountability system. For the first time, the Federal \nGovernment is putting into place accountability that will hold States, \nschools, and districts accountable for steadily improving the learning \nof their children and closing the achievement gap between the rich and \nthe poor, between minorities and nonminorities.\n  I am also pleased that the law includes a mechanism to target \nadditional funding to schools with high concentrations of low-income \nstudents. Historically, title I has always been our focus of directing \nFederal funds to schools with large proportions of poor students, but \nCongress has not always met that goal. It is our hope that this \nincreased targeting, for which I again congratulate Senator Kennedy, is \ngoing to be an important part of our achieving that.\n  Another key component is the expansion of school choice in public \nschools together with the charter schools. I strongly support \nincreasing educational options available to parents within the public \nschool system framework. In fact, expanding public school choice has \nbeen one of my top education priorities. I am pleased that the No Child \nLeft Behind Act strengthens that Federal charter program and authorizes \nthe inter- and intradistrict school choice initiative.\n  I am also pleased that it includes several amendments that I have \nproposed, one specifically to improve principals, to improve the \nstrength of leadership. We can have all the rules we want and all the \nframework we want, but if you don't have adequate leadership in the \nschools, it is often hard to achieve. We have a method in here to help \nto increase that.\n  We also include an amendment that I have introduced to enable States \nand school districts to help to develop, establish, and improve \nalternative educational opportunities for violent or\n\n[[Page S13394]]\n\ndrug offending students under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. \nThat is one way to guarantee that we will ensure safe classrooms, safe \nschools, manageable classrooms by removing disruptive students and \ndangerous students and making sure that those who are expelled receive \neducational counseling or other services to help modify their behavior.\n  This bill, as all legislation, is a compromise. Not everything meets \neverybody's eye. I do believe we have to push on to achieve the \nopportunity of guaranteeing full funding for individuals with \ndisabilities education, and we have to guarantee the resources for this \nact.\n  I congratulate Senator Kennedy and all those who have been part of \nthis effort to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I yield 8 minutes to the \nSenator from Alabama who, as a member of the committee, played a \nsignificant role. This is such a complex bill. It required a lot of \ndifferent people thinking about different parts of it. It has so many \nmoving parts, it really is not the handiwork of one individual. It \ntruly was the handiwork of a large number of Senators participating \nfrom both sides of the aisle. The Senator from Alabama played a major \nrole in a variety of areas, especially in the discipline area and the \nsafe and drug free schools. I very much appreciate the work he did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, It is a pleasure to see this bill come \nup now for what I believe will be its approval. We have worked hard on \nit. I know it was a thrill to see the bill come out of committee with a \nunanimous vote under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and ranking \nmember, Senator Gregg. I thought that showed good bipartisan support. \nIt languished a bit in conference with the House, and we struggled a \nbit. The President had to raise the level of heat a bit, but things \nhave moved forward. It is exciting to see this bill move toward law.\n  The President campaigned on education as one of his top themes. He \ntalked about it constantly. He visited schools regularly. His wife was \na teacher. He has honored that commitment by continuing to press a \nmajor education bill this year which will represent one of the largest \nincreases in funding for education in recent years. It also represents \na significant policy change that will allow more freedom for the school \nsystems, that will put more money in local schools, that will help \nchildren who are being left behind and move them forward.\n  I believe we should recognize and salute the leadership of the \nSecretary of Education, Rod Paige. He came here from Houston. He was \nchosen to be the superintendent of the Houston school system, comprised \naround 200,000 students. He believed that a 37-percent passing rate of \nthe Texas test in Houston was unacceptable. In 5 years, with \ndetermination, sound policies and great leadership, he doubled the \npercentage of schoolchildren passing that test.\n  I say that because there are some people who do not believe that \nprogress is possible. I have seen school systems in every State in \nAmerica. There are systems where teachers, parents, and leaders have \ncome together to achieve significant increases in productivity and \nchange. Certainly money is not the complete answer; it is also policy \nchange, determination, and leadership. We have too many schools where \nchildren are locked into a failing system, and they have been falling \nbehind. Nobody even knows or cares that they are falling behind. They \ncan't go to any other school. They are required by law to attend this \ndysfunctional school. And that is just not good.\n  The President understands this deeply. As Governor of Texas, he made \neducation one of his highest priorities, and he has made it his number \none domestic priority as President. He has helped us move forward to \nwhat I think is really historic legislation. It is an honor to be a \npart of it.\n  Testing and accountability have been a matter of some debate. I do \nnot believe tests are accurate reflections of a child's complete \nability to learn and what they absolutely know. But it is true that you \ncan determine through a test whether a child can do fundamental \nmathematics, whether a child knows fundamental science, and whether a \nchild can read or not. It is a tragedy in America that we have been \nmoving children through the school system, even to graduation, who \ncan't read and write and they are making the lowest possible scores on \ntests. We have just accepted that. That is not a good way to do it.\n  The President has said he is not going to leave any child behind, and \nwe will make sure we achieve that goal. We are going to find out if \nchildren are falling behind. We will have a testing program in grades 3 \nthrough 8 in math and reading that will not be Federal Government-\nmandated tests, but state tests, and we will begin to learn. The \nnewspaper editors, the business community, the teachers, the \nprincipals, the parents, and the students will know how the kids are \ndoing in that school system. Some schools do better than others. We \nneed to find out which ones are doing best and identify those that are \nnot doing well. I think that is important. As Secretary Paige says, if \nyou love the children and you care about them and you want them to \nlearn so they can be successful throughout their lives, you will not \nallow them to fall behind.\n  What we need to do is intervene early in the lives of children when \nthey are falling behind--as soon as possible. Then we can make some \nprogress. This bill says there can be supplemental services in a system \nthat is not working and where kids are falling behind. They can get \nmaybe $500 or $1,000 for outside tutoring for a child who is not \nkeeping up because as you get further behind, a lot of bad things \nhappen. Dr. Paige says that a child in the seventh, eighth, and ninth \ngrades, if they are really behind, that is when they drop out. \nNormally, it is around the ninth grade. They can't keep up, they are \nbehind and discouraged, and they drop out.\n  We need to find out in the third grade, the fourth grade, and fifth \ngrade how they are doing and make sure we then intervene, when the cost \nis not so great. We can increase their ability to be a functional and \ngood student and help them go on to success. It is a lot like business \nmanagement, frankly. It is just good supervision and having a system \nthat does not allow the status quo to drift, but one where we care \nenough to make the tough decisions, apply tough love, to insist that \nchildren behave in the classroom, they do their homework, and teachers \ndo their work. If teachers are not performing, they need to be held to \naccount, and we need to create accountability in the system. If we do \nso, I believe we can make real progress.\n\n  As a part of the compromise that went on in the legislation, some \ngood language was put in to ensure that all this testing we require is \npaid for by the Federal Government, so it is not an unfunded mandate. \nWe also have in the bill testing rules that guarantee States will not \nhave their curriculum set by Washington. It will guarantee that the \ntests don't mandate a single type of learning in America. I think that \nprocess worked well as we went forward.\n  The flexibility goal has been achieved in a number of ways. It is not \nas great as I would like to see it. I have visited, in the last 15 to \n18 months, 20 schools in Alabama and spent a lot of time talking with \nteachers, principals, superintendents, school board members. They felt \nvery strongly. These are people who have given their lives to children. \nThey have chosen to teach and to be involved in education. They have \ntold me consistently that the Federal Government has too many rules and \nregulations that make their lives more difficult and actually \ncomplicate their ability to teach in a classroom. There is money, but \nit is only available for what the Federal Government says, not for what \nthey know they need at a given time in their communities.\n  I think we need to continue to improve in the area of flexibility. We \nhave made some real progress in that, and I am happy we have made \nprogress in this bill. But it could have been greater. I think our \nteachers and principals will like what they see. It is a step in the \nright direction.\n  Alabama has established an exceedingly fine reading program that is \nbeing replicated by many States. Senator Kennedy's excellent school \nsystem in Massachusetts is always on the\n\n[[Page S13395]]\n\ncutting edge of things. They have appropriated $10 million to just \nstudy this program and implement some of it in their system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I salute the leadership on this \nlegislation. I note that the IDEA program amendments that were passed \nin the House and the Senate were not included in this, which was a \ndisappointment to me. But we will have an opportunity next year to \nreform that, during the reauthorization of IDEA.\n  I believe education is one of the most important issues that faces \nour Naiton today. We need to do all we can to free States and \nlocalities from Federal regulation, assure accountability by setting \nhigh standards, and empower parents with choices and information.\n  As Governor of Texas, President Bush recognized the importance of \neducation and made it the centerpiece of his campaign for President. \nWhen he took office, he delivered on his promise by releasing a \ncomprehensive plan for reform during the first days he was in office.\n  I believe that President Bush's leadership has been essential to the \nCongress producing the historic reform legislation that was passed by \nthe conference committee on December 11. Since the tragedy on September \n11 the Congress and the President have understandably been focused on \nthe war on terrorism.\n  I believe it is a credit to the leadership of President Bush that he \nwas able to continue to make education reform a priority. He never lost \nsight of protecting our greatest resource, and children. His leadership \nnever wavered and I believe we could not have reached the bipartisan \ncompromise in the education conference without his influence.\n  Secretary of Education Rod Paige was also essential to our efforts at \nreform. Secretary Paige's real-life experiences as Superintendent of \nthe Houston school system were invaluable in helping us to formulate \nlegislation that will truly foster reform for all our children.\n  I would also like to recognize the leadership of Senators Gregg and \nKennedy here in the Senate and Congressmen Boehner and Miller in the \nHouse. Even when our country was threatened and they could have \nabandoned this effort, they stayed focused and were able to hammer out \ntheir differences and come up with a good piece of legislation.\n  While the legislation does not contain all the provisions that I \nwould have liked to have seen in the bill, it does take some important \nsteps toward improving the educational opportunities for all our \nchildren.\n  The conference report includes testing in grades 3 through 8 in math \nand reading, which is the cornerstone of the President's plan. I am \nglad that we have recognized the need to measure the progress of our \nstudents. We must determine if our schools are actually teaching our \nchildren the skills they need to succeed. The only way to measure our \nstudents knowledge is through testing.\n  While some have raised concerns about reliance on testing, I believe \nthis legislation strikes an important balance to ensure that we bring \naccountability to the system without overburdening our State and local \nschool systems.\n  The bill significantly changes accountability standards with the goal \nof assuring that low income students are learning at a level that is \nequal to their peers. The States are charged with developing the tests \nbased on their own curriculum. This is not a one-size-fits-all \napproach.\n  The bill specifically prohibits federally sponsored national testing \nor Federal control over curriculum and sets up a series of controls to \nensure that any national evaluating test such as NAEP must be fair and \nobjective and does not test or evaluate a child's views, opinions, or \nbeliefs.\n  In addition, the bill includes a trigger mechanism so that State-\nbased testing requirements are paid for by the Federal Government thus \navoiding an unfunded mandate.\n  In Alabama, we have already recognized the importance of testing, we \nalready test our students in virtually every year of school. I believe \nthis legislation will assist Alabama in these efforts and the new funds \nwill help to improve the current system.\n  The legislation also includes a number of major new initiatives which \ngive parents options when their children are trapped in failing \nschools.\n  For the first time, parents whose child is trapped in a failing \nschool will be able to take a portion of the monies available under \ntitle I for their child--approximately $500 to $1,000--and use it to \nget the child outside tutorial support. These services can come from \npublic institutions, private providers, or faith-based educators.\n  For children who have fallen behind because of lack of good services \nat their school, groups such as Boys and Girls Clubs, Catholic schools, \nSylvan Learning Centers, and a variety of other agencies would be able \nto give these children the support they need to catch up in the areas \nof math and English.\n  Another new opportunity provided for parents under this legislation \ninvolves public school choice. A parent whose child is trapped in a \nfailing school will have the opportunity to send their child to another \npublic school which is not failing and have the transportation costs \npaid for.\n  This bill does not allow parents to access private schools, but it \ndoes provide parents the option to move their child to a better public \nschool where they can get an adequate education.\n  We believe this option will put pressure on those public schools \nwithin a major school system that are failing and will give these \nchildren a viable chance to succeed.\n  I believe one of our most important goals is to give States and local \ncommunities more flexibility. After all, they are best suited to make \ndecisions regarding their own children. While the legislation does not \nprovide the flexibility that many of us would have liked to have seen, \nit does make major improvements in freeing State and local education \nagencies from burdensome Federal regulations.\n  Currently, Federal rules mandate that funds only be used for a \ndesignated purpose. Under this legislation, all 50 States will be \npermitted to make significant spending decisions of up to 50 percent of \ntheir non-title I funds by being allowed to move those funds from \naccount to account without Federal approval.\n  This means that States and local communities can spend these funds \nwhere they feel they will get the most benefit for the dollars.\n  Seven States will also be permitted to consolidate 100 percent of \ntheir State activity, administrative funds, and innovative block grant \nfunds and use them for any activity authorized under H.R. 1. This frees \nup hundreds of millions of dollars for these States to use at their \ndiscretion. This will dramatically expand a State's flexibility of they \ndecided to participate in the program.\n  Up to 150 school districts--at least three per State--could also \napply to participate in even broader flexibility. They will be able to \napply for waivers from virtually all Federal education rules and \nrequirements associated with a variety of ESEA programs in exchange for \nagreeing to further improve academic achievement for their low-income \nstudents.\n  The concept is simple, the Federal Government will give them even \ngreater flexibility in exchange for significant results.\n  The State of Alabama has instituted a major reading initiative that \nhas begun to make a difference in the lives of students in our state. \nIn fact, the Alabama Reading Initiative is becoming a model for reading \nprograms in other States.\n  Massachusetts has appropriated $10 million to begin a program based \non Alabama's efforts and Florida is beginning a pilot program in 12 \nschool districts patterned after the Alabama Initiative.\n  President Bush also recognizes the importance of reading, he has \ndescribed reading as ``the new civil right.'' Early on, he stated his \ngoal that every child should be able to read by the third grade. One of \nthe cornerstones of President Bush's education plan was his Reading \nFirst and Early Reading First initiatives.\n  These initiatives are meant to encourage States and local schools to \nimplement scientifically based reading programs and to augment programs\n\n[[Page S13396]]\n\nsuch as the Alabama Reading Initiative.\n  The Reading First Initiative would help to establish reading programs \nfor children in kindergarten through grade 3. Under this legislation, \nFederal funding for reading programs will be tripled from $300 million \nin 2001 to $900 million for 2002. President Bush has demonstrated his \ncommitment to this program by budgeting $5 billion over 5 years for the \neffort.\n  The companion program, Early Reading First, is intended to enhance \nreading readiness for children in high poverty areas and where there \nare high numbers of students who are not reading at the appropriate \nlevel. The $75 million initiative is designed to provide the critical \nearly identification and early reading interventions necessary to \nprevent reading failure among our children.\n  This legislation also takes important steps to improve teacher \nquality in our schools. In order to provide increased flexibility, the \nagreement eliminates the class-size reduction program and now gives \nschool districts the option to choose whether they want to use federal \nteacher dollars to recruit or retain teachers, reduce class-size or to \nprovide additional training to teachers already in the classroom.\n  States would also be able to spend Federal teacher dollars on merit \npay, tenure reform, teacher testing and alternative certification.\n  The point is to allow flexibility for school districts to address the \nneeds most important to the local community, instead of simply \ndictating what should be done from Washington.\n  The legislation also includes the teacher liability language that \npassed the Senate.\n  These provisions help to ensure that teachers, principals, and other \nschool professionals can undertake reasonable actions to maintain order \nand discipline in the classroom, without the fear of being dragged into \ncourt or subject to frivolous lawsuits simply for doing their jobs.\n  One issue that I am disappointed that we did not address in this \nlegislation are the problems with the discipline provisions in \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA.\n  While both the House and the Senate passed provisions to address this \nproblem, unfortunately, many of my colleagues on the conference \ncommittee opposed both versions and neither was included in the final \nconference report.\n  Having traveled all over Alabama and visiting a number of schools \nover the past few years, I am firmly convinced that the Federal IDEA \ndiscipline regulations cause more distress for dedicated teachers than \nany other single Federal rule or mandate.\n  Some of my colleagues on the conference committee feel very strongly \nabout this issue and strongly opposed my amendment. But I want to make \nmy proposal clear.\n  My amendment was carefully tailored to allow schools to discipline \nIDEA students in the same manner as non-IDEA students, when the \nbehavior that led to the disciplinary action is not related to the \nchild's disability. No child could be denied educational services for \nbehavior that is related to their disability.\n  My amendment also retains many of the procedural safeguards in \ncurrent law to ensure that IDEA children are treated fairly, but it \nallows state and local educators more flexibility in their discipline \npolicies.\n  My amendment also would provide a better option for parents of \nchildren with disabilities to move their child to a better educational \nenvironment. While this option is available under current law, my \nlanguage would streamline this process. The parents of the child and \nthe school would still have to agree on this decision.\n  I believe this is a reasonable proposal that would allow more \nstudents with disabilities, with the agreement of the school, to seek \nspecial education programs that better meet their needs.\n  During my meetings at schools, I encouraged teachers to write to me \nto share their experiences with IDEA. I received a large stack of mail.\n  The frustration and compassion in the letters is powerful. Real \nstories from educators and students are the best evidence of the need \nfor change.\n  Two things are clear to me. First, current Federal IDEA discipline \nrules cause disruption in the classroom and even threaten the safety of \nstudents and teachers.\n  Second, the Federal Government needs to increase IDEA funding and \nmeet its commitment to providing 40 percent of the national average per \npupil expenditure.\n  President Bush's budget included a $1 billion increase for IDEA for \nnext year, the largest increase ever proposed by a President in his \nbudget. He is committed to increasing this funding in future years.\n  This new funding will be an important step in assisting schools to \nmeet the goals established under IDEA.\n  The IDEA law is filled with complex issues and problems besides \ndiscipline. One area that Secretary Paige seeks to address is the \npossible over-identification and disproportionate placement of minority \nstudents in special education.\n  Secretary Paige has spoken to me about this problem and I stand ready \nto work with him to address it. For example, we need to look at how to \ndistribute Federal special education funds without creating \ninappropriate incentives regarding referral, placement or services to \nchildren.\n  We shouldn't be creating an incentive for schools to place children \nin special education programs that can be helped under our existing \nsystem.\n  The IDEA law provides many wonderful and special benefits for \nchildren with disabilities, but we can make it better. It is important \nthat we return common sense and compassion to this problem.\n  I am committed to working to improve the law when it comes up for \nreauthorization next year. If we work together by providing more money \nfor IDEA and give more authority to our local school officials, we can \ntake a big step toward improving learning.\n  While I continue to believe that education is and must remain the \nprimary function of State and local government, I believe this \nlegislation will help to improve our public education system.\n  This legislation is far from perfect and I am sure we will have to \nmake adjustments in future years.\n  But I believe that with President Bush's leadership this legislation \npresents the best opportunity in 35 years to return power and dollars \nto the state and local school districts and to make academic \nachievement a priority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas. First, I remind the Senate that during the debate on this \nissue her amendment to increase the funding for bilingual education \npassed 62 to 34, and we kept her first year mark in this bill. That \nwill mean that 400,000 more limited-English-speaking children will be \nable to learn. It is a major achievement and accomplishment. She has \neducated the Senate about the change in demographics and what is \nhappening in her part of the world. We welcome the opportunity to yield \nher 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nsupport for the education reform package that is now before the Senate. \nAfter debating this issue for almost 3 years, I am pleased we have \nreached a bi-partisan agreement on a package that puts our children's \nfuture ahead of the partisan bickering that has diverted our energy and \nattention for too long. This proposal before the Senate represents an \nimportant step in the right direction by recognizing the right of every \nchild to receive a high quality education.\n  I know many of my colleagues played a critical role in fashioning \nthis very important legislation. I especially want to express my \nappreciation to Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for their tireless \nefforts on behalf of our nation's school children. As someone who has \nfollowed the progress of this bill very closely, I think each Member of \nthis body owes the managers of this bill a debt of gratitude for \nbringing Senators with very different points of view together to find \ncommon ground on this critical issue. I applaud their leadership and I \ncongratulate your success.\n  I also want to say a special word of thanks to Senators Lieberman and \nBayh who demonstrated real leadership by talking about many of the \nreforms we are about to ratify before those ideas were very popular. \nThey deserve\n\n[[Page S13397]]\n\na lot of credit for the final agreement they helped draft and I was \nhonored to join them in crafting the original Three R's proposals that \nis clearly reflected in the bill before us.\n  As I noted previously, I support this bipartisan compromise because \nit contains many of the elements that I think are essential to foster \nacademic success. It provides school districts with the resources they \nneed to meet higher standards. It expands access in Arkansas to funding \nfor teacher quality, English language instruction, and after-school \nprograms by distributing resources through a reliable formula based on \nneed, not on the ability of school districts to fill out a federal \ngrant application. And finally, and most importantly, in exchange for \nmore flexibility and resources, it holds States and school districts \naccountable for the academic performance of all children.\n  I do want to highlight one component of this legislation that I had a \ndirect role in shaping. During consideration of the Senate reform bill \nin May, I successfully offered an amendment with Senator Kennedy and \nothers calling on Congress to substantially increase funding to enable \nlanguage minority students to master English and achieve high levels of \nlearning in all subjects. More importantly for my State of Arkansas, \nunder the approach I promoted, funding will now be distributed to \nStates and local districts through a reliable formula based on the \nnumber of students who need help with their English proficiency.\n  Currently, even though Arkansas has experienced a dramatic increase \nin the number of limited English proficient (LEP) students during the \nlast decade, my state does very poorly in accessing federal funding to \nmeet the needs of these students because the bulk of the funding is \ndistributed through a maze of competitive grants.\n  I am pleased the conferees accepted the funding level and the reforms \nI advocated. This new approach represents a dramatic improvement over \nthe current system and will greatly benefit schools and students in my \nState.\n  Ultimately, I believe all of the reforms that are contained in this \nbill will make an important difference in the future of our children \nand our nation. So I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nurge the adoption of this truly landmark legislation.\n  Unfortunately, I feel compelled to mention one aspect of this \nlegislation that dampens my excitement for its passage. Even though I \nbelieve the bill on balance represents a major improvement over the \ncurrent federal framework, I am very disappointed that we are once \nagain denying the promise we made to our constituents in 1975 to pay 40 \npercent of the costs of serving students under IDEA.\n  In my opinion, our failure to live up to this promise undermines to \nsome extent the very reforms we seek to advance. I will continue to \nwork in the Senate to reverse this record of inaction which is \nprofoundly unfair to school districts, teachers, and the students they \nserve.\n  I want to close, by thanking all of my colleagues who spent many \nweeks and months negotiating this agreement. Even though progress has \nbeen slow at times, the way Democrats and Republicans have worked \ntogether on this bill is a model I hope we can repeat often in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nleadership and assistance to me in being able to achieve something on \nbehalf of the people of Arkansas. Once again, I express my support for \nthe education reform package now before the Senate. We have debated \nthis issue for almost 3 years, and we are so pleased we have reached a \nbipartisan agreement on the package that puts our children's future \nahead of the partisan bickering that has diverted our energy and \nattention for way too long.\n  The proposal before the Senate represents an important step in the \nright direction by recognizing the right of every child in this great \nNation to receive a high-quality education.\n  I know many of my colleagues played a critical role in fashioning \nthis very important legislation, but there are two individuals who have \nbeen absolutely incredible in this debate and in this negotiation. I \nespecially express my appreciation to Senator Kennedy and to Senator \nGregg for their tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's \nschoolchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee who has played a very considerable role in this legislation, \nespecially in the flexibility accounts, but he had input throughout the \nlegislation and has done an exceptional job in making this a better \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senator Gregg and \nSenator Kennedy for their leadership in pulling together a complex \nbill. This bill accomplishes the goals that many of us have been \ntalking about over the last 2 years, the total length of time we have \nbeen working on this bill. Those goals included striving for more \nflexibility, accountability, and local control.\n  The events of September 11, 2001 dramatically changed our nation. As \na result, the President is focused on combating forces unlike any other \nwe have faced in our history. Nonetheless, the President has remained \nsteadfastly committed to education reform and thanks to his efforts, \ntoday we send to him a bill that will transform the Federal \nGovernment's role in education.\n  Since 1965, Federal aid has been provided to school districts for the \neducation of disadvantaged children through title I. Despite spending \n$125 billion on Title I over the past 25 years, the most recent results \nof the National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, tests for \nfourth-grade reading confirm that our current education system has not \nclosed this achievement gap.\n  The NAEP results revealed that 37 percent of the nation's fourth \ngraders scored below basic. That means 37 percent of our fourth graders \ncannot read.\n  I was disturbed to read in our Nashville newspaper, the Tennessean, \nlast week that only 45.5 percent of third-graders in Nashville are \nreading at the national average, down almost three percentage points \nfrom 1998. Perhaps more disturbing is the fact that the Nashville metro \narea failed to reduce the performance gap between poor students and \ntheir better-off peers: it was reduced only .2 percent in the \nelementary and middle-school grades, and it increased by 1 percent for \nhigh-school students.\n  As President Bush has said, too many children in America are \nsegregated by low expectations, illiteracy, and self-doubt. In a \nconstantly changing world that is demanding increasingly complex skills \nfrom its workforce, children are literally being left behind.\n  The following programs and reforms contained in the ``No Child Left \nBehind Act'' will help our schools better prepare our children for the \nfuture:\n  For reading first, $975 million in funds will be authorized for \nStates to establish a comprehensive reading program anchored in \nscientific research. States will have the option to receive Early \nReading First funds to implement research based pre-reading methods in \npre-school. Tennessee's recently awarded $27 million grant will \ncontinue, and Tennessee will no longer have to apply for such funding. \nFunding to the State will be guaranteed through this new formula grant \nprogram.\n  On rural education, $300 million in authorized funding will be \navailable to some of Tennessee's rural school districts to help them \ndeal with the unique problems that confront them.\n  On unprecedented flexibility, all states and local school districts \nwill be able to shift Federal dollars earmarked for one specific \npurpose to other uses that more effectively address their needs and \npriorities. And 150 school districts choosing to participate would \nreceive a virtual waiver from Federal education requirements in \nexchange for agreeing to improve student achievement. I am particularly \npleased that this latter initiative, known as Straight A's, was \nincluded in the final form of the bill.\n  On empowering parents, parents will be enabled to make informed \nchoices about schools for their children by being given access to \nschool-by-school report cards on student achievement for all groups of \nstudents. Students in persistently low-performing schools will be \nprovided the option of attending alternative public schooling or \nreceiving Federal funds for tutorial services.\n\n[[Page S13398]]\n\n That means that starting in September, students in more than 6,700 \nfailing schools will have the authority to transfer to better public \nschools. Students in nearly 3,000 of those schools also would be \neligible for extra academic help, such as tutoring and summer classes \npaid with Federal tax money. In Tennessee alone, 303 schools will be \nprovided these services.\n  As to accountability for student performance, parents will know how \nwell their child is learning, and schools will be held accountable for \ntheir effectiveness with annual state reading and math assessments in \ngrades 3-8. States will be provided $490 million in funding for the \nassessments. Tennessee will receive approximately $53 million of these \nfunds over the next 5 years.\n  With regard to improvements to the Technology and Bilingual Education \nprograms, the Technology and Bilingual Education programs have been \nstreamlined and made more flexible. Parents must be notified that their \nchild is in need of English language instruction and about how such \ninstruction will help their child. The bill also focuses on ensuring \nthat schools use technology to improve student academic achievement by \ntargeting resources to those schools that are in the greatest need of \nassistance.\n  On better targeting, Senator Landrieu offered an amendment to S. 1 \nearlier this year that required better targeting of funds to our \npoorest schools. I supported that effort and am proud to say that this \nbill targets funds better than ever before. Through consolidation of \nprograms and improved targeting of resources, we enable schools to do \nso much more with the 7 percent of funds they receive from the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  As to resources for teachers, over $3 billion will be authorized for \nteachers to be used for professional development, salary increases, \nclass size reduction and other teacher initiatives. Additionally, \nteachers acting in their official capacity will be shielded from \nFederal liability arising out of their efforts to maintain discipline \nin the classroom, so long as they do not engage in reckless or criminal \nmisconduct. And another $450 million will be authorized for Math and \nScience training for teachers, an initiative that is particularly \nimportant to me.\n  I want to take a few minutes to discuss the Math and Science \nPartnership program, because I am particularly concerned about the \nstate of Science education in our country. The most recent NAEP science \nsection results showed that the performance of fourth- and eighth-grade \nstudents remained about the same since 1996, but scores for high school \nseniors changed significantly: up six points for private school \nstudents and down four for public school students, for a net national \ndecline of three points. A whopping 82 percent of twelfth-grade \nstudents are not proficient in Science and the achievement gaps among \neighth-graders are appalling: Only 41 percent of white, 7 percent of \nAfrican-American and 12 percent of Hispanic students are proficient.\n  The disappointing overall results for seniors on the science section \nof the NAEP prompted Education Secretary Rod Paige to call the decline \n``morally significant.'' He warned, ``If our graduates know less about \nscience than their predecessors four years ago, then our hopes for a \nstrong 21st century workforce are dimming just when we need them \nmost.'' I couldn't agree with the Secretary more.\n  I urge the appropriators to take note of these statistics and fund \nthe Math and Science Program at the level it needs to make a \ndifference.\n  In this brief statement, I can only begin to list the number of \nreforms within this bill. The bill:\n  enhances accountability and demands results;\n  it has unprecedented state and local flexibility;\n  it streamlines bureaucracy and reduces red tape;\n  it expands choices for parents;\n  it contains the President's Reading First initiative;\n  it promotes teacher quality and smaller classrooms;\n  it strives toward making schools safer;\n  it promotes English fluency;\n  And that is just a brief summary.\n  I want to again congratulate our President, who provided great \nleadership by making education reform his top domestic priority. The \nresult is that our elementary and secondary schools will be \nstrengthened and local teachers, administrators and parents will be \nbetter able to make sure that no child is left behind.\n  For the first time, Federal dollars will be linked to specific \nperformance goals to ensure improved results. That means schools will \nbe held accountable. And, by measuring student performance with annual \nacademic assessments, teachers and parents will have the ability to \nmonitor each student's progress.\n  I want to thank Senators Gregg and Kennedy for all they have done on \nthis bill. Senator Gregg was forced into a new leadership role when he \nsuddenly became Ranking Member of the HELP Committee in the middle of \nthe 6 week debate of S. 1. Suddenly, he was charged with managing a \n1,200 page education bill, which was the top domestic priority of the \nPresident. I know he and his staff, particularly Denzel McGuire, have \ndedicated innumerable hours to this piece of legislation and I commend \nthem for their efforts.\n  I congratulate, on my staff, Andrea Becker, whose diligence, \ndedication, and hard work are reflected in this legislation. Senator \nGregg and Senator Kennedy were able to bridge some strong policy \ndifferences throughout and work together to make sure politics did not \nprevent passage of this landmark legislation. I thank them for their \nleadership and congratulate them on passage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his kind comments, \nand especially for his assistance in making this bill a reality.\n  Could the Chair advise us as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 6 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Massachusetts has 23\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is remaining for the Senator from Minnesota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes for the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut. The Senator from Connecticut has been a strong advocate in \nterms of accountability in schools and also investing in those \nchildren. So I welcome his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from \nMassachusetts, who has played a pivotal role in bringing us to this \nextraordinary moment of accomplishment. I rise today to join my \ncolleagues in voicing my enthusiastic support for this conference \nreport to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and \nhelp reinvigorate America's public education system.\n  This democracy of ours is a magnificent process, beautiful in its \nfreedom, although often untidy and cumbersome in its execution. We come \nto one of those wonderful moments when it has worked to provide a \nrevolutionary change in the Federal Government's relationship to public \neducation in our country. This agreement marks a truly unique coming \ntogether of parties, ideologies and people behind legislation that will \nhelp us deliver a high-quality public education to the children of this \nNation and, in doing so, help us deliver on the promise of equal \nopportunity for every American.\n  With this bill, we are fundamentally changing the educational \nequation in our country. We are saying public education is no longer a \nlocal responsibility, but it is now truly a national priority. We are \nsaying we are no longer going to tolerate failure for our children and \nfrom the adults who are supposed to be educating them. We are saying we \nbelieve, as a matter of faith, that every child in this country can \nlearn at a high level. And we are doing what has been long overdue--\nrefocusing our Federal policies and redoubling our national efforts to \nhelp realize those expectations of excellence and raise academic \nachievement for all of our children. refocusing our Federal policies \nand redoubling our national efforts to help realize those expectations \nof excellence and raise academic achievement for all of our children.\n  This new educational equation could be summed up in six words: Invest \nin reform; insist on results.\n\n[[Page S13399]]\n\n  We are proposing to substantially increase Federal funding to better \ntarget those dollars to the community and students with the greatest \nneeds, to give States and schools far more freedom in choosing how to \nspend those dollars and then, in exchange, to demand more \naccountability for producing results. No longer are we in Washington \ngoing to ask: How much are we spending and where is it going? Now we \nwill ask: How much are our children learning and where are they going?\n  This new approach, and the reforms we have developed to implement it, \nreflect the best thinking of both parties in both branches of our \nGovernment and the hard work of a lot of Members, including \nparticularly Senators Kennedy and Gregg in this Chamber, and \nRepresentatives Boehner and Miller from the House. I want to express my \nappreciation to them for their leadership, their vision, and their \ncommitment to rethinking the way we aid and support public education \nand reengineering our partnership with the States and local districts.\n  I am very proud to have had the opportunity to participate in this \nenormously constructive process as one of the negotiators of the Senate \nversion of the bill and as a member of the conference committee. For \nthat, I am grateful to Majority Leader Daschle and to Chairman Kennedy, \nwho solicited ideas and input from Senator Bayh and me and other New \nDemocrats, even though we were not members of the HELP Committee, and \nbroke with tradition to appoint us to the conference committee.\n  I am particularly proud of the role we New Democrats played in \nshaping the framework and ideas behind this reform plan, which \nincorporates many of the principles and programs of the comprehensive \nThree R's plan that Senator Bayh and I, and several of our colleagues \nin this Chamber sponsored last year. When we started out three years \nago along this road, our goal was to bring some fresh thinking to \nFederal education policy and to help break the partisan impasse on this \ncritical matter, to offer a proposal that could bridge the gaps between \nleft and right and forge a new consensus for real school reform for \nAmerica's children, and to truly reinvent the Federal role in \neducation. With this bill, I think all of us, new and old Democrats--I \ntake the liberty to say new and old Republicans--can fairly say \n``mission accomplished.''\n  We pushed not only for more funding, but to target more of those \nresources to the poorest districts and to restore the traditional \nFederal focus on disadvantaged children. This bill does just that. We \npushed to streamline the Federal education bureaucracy, reduce the \nstrings attached to funding, empower local educators and encourage \ninnovation. This bill does just that.\n  We pushed to create strong standards of accountability, to impose \nreal consequences for chronic failure, and to demand measurable \nprogress in closing the achievement gap between the haves and have-\nnots. Again, this bill does just that. Last but not least, we pushed to \ninject market forces deeper into our public school system, to promote \ngreater choice and better information for parents, and to harness the \npositive pressure of competition to drive real change. This bill does \njust that.\n  However, our work is not done. This new vision will take time and \nmoney to succeed, and we must be vigilant in following through on the \nimplementation of this legislation. Simply put, these reforms will not \nwork if they are not matched with resources. The significant funding \nlevels provided in the Senate and House appropriations bills of about \n$22 billion, an increase of over $4 billion, provide a substantial down \npayment in realizing the necessary investment. But we must do more. We \ncannot close the achievement gap on the cheap. We must make increased \ninvestment a priority for the life of this bill, not just this year. I \nthink the critical factor is for all of us to continue to work together \nin a bipartisan way to make sure we adequately and aggressively fund \nthe reforms that are part of this proposal.\n  In the meantime, I want to applaud President Bush for working with us \nin a cooperative, constructive manner to transform a promising \nblueprint for reform into what will soon be a landmark law. This was a \nmodel of bipartisanship and a reminder of what we can accomplish when \nwe leave our partisan agendas at the door. I hope we will soon \nduplicate it.\n  Mr. President, I wish to expand on my earlier comments to provide \nmore historical background on the development of this conference report \nand explain its legislative intent.\n  I am extremely pleased that the bill embodies many of the legislative \nintentions and key concepts that a number of my fellow New Democrats, \nparticularly Senator Evan Bayh, and I, proposed when we first \nintroduced the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and \nResponsibility Act--otherwise known as the ``Three R's'' bill--in March \n2000. I believe that we have achieved the same core goals in this \nconference report. The following analysis outlines the long, complex \nand ultimately fruitful evolution of the bill, and the concepts and \nthemes underpinning its key provisions.\n  The need for improving the federal role in K-12 public is well \nestablished. Too many of our schools have for years been failing to \ngive low-income and minority students the education and skills they \nneed to thrive in our increasingly knowledge-based economy. In \naddition, our nation faces a large achievement gap between higher- and \nlower-income students, and between white students and most minority \nstudents.\n  Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress for 2000 \nmakes this clear. According to the report, 60 percent of the nation's \nfourth graders in poverty were reading below the basic proficiency \nlevel, compared to 26 percent of more affluent fourth graders. And the \ngap between children of different races and ethnicities is just as \nsignificant as the income gap; 63 percent of African-American fourth \ngrade children and 58 percent of Latino children were reading below the \nbasic proficiency level, compared with 27 percent of white children.\n  The same problems persist at the top of the educational ladder. On \naverage, of every 100 white kindergarten students, 93 will finish high \nschool and 29 will earn at least a bachelor's degree. However, of every \n100 African-American kindergarten students, only 86 will finish high \nschool and only 15 will obtain at least a bachelor's degree. And of \nevery 100 Latino kindergartners, just 61 will graduate from high school \nand 10 will obtain at least a bachelor's degree. The result is that \nalmost half of all college graduates by age 24 come from higher income \nfamilies and only 7 percent from low-income families.\n  These achievement gaps are unacceptable and unnecessary. Every day, \nmore and more schools offering low-income students high standards and \nreal support demonstrate that an underprivileged background does not \nconsign a child to academic failure. In fact, students from low-income \nfamilies can achieve at similar or higher levels than their more \naffluent peers. We were convinced that with the right approach, the \nfederal government could help school districts and states spread these \nsuccesses across the nation.\n  Any reform of the federal role in education must start with the \nunderstanding that Washington is most helpful when it empowers states \nand localities to do their job more effectively, not when it micro-\nmanages the running of schools and districts. Though Congress helped \nfuel state and local improvements through its last reauthorization of \nESEA in 1994 and through its support of charter schools and public \nschool choice, those proved ultimately insufficient to the size of the \nchallenge before the country. To support states and localities as they \nworked hard to adopt better standards, improve the quality of their \nteachers, and increase choice and competition in public education, the \nfederal role had to change more profoundly.\n\n  It was this desire to spur a more accountable, competitive and \ninnovative public education system, and ultimately raise academic \nachievement among children of all incomes and backgrounds, that led my \ncolleagues and me to propose the Three R's bill.\n  In the winter of 1998, I began early discussions on the issue with my \nformer colleague, Republican Senator Slade Gorton, sharing the belief \nthat a broad, bipartisan education reform agenda could and should be \ndeveloped. We convened a series of meetings with\n\n[[Page S13400]]\n\nkey think tanks and policymakers--including the Progressive Policy \nInstitute, the Education Trust, the Heritage Foundation, the Fordham \nFoundation and Empower America--and it soon became clear that we shared \ngoals and approaches to reform that could serve as the basis for a \nlegislative blueprint.\n  Many of the concepts discussed in these meetings were distilled in a \nwhite paper in April 1999 on performance-based funding prepared by \nAndrew Rotherham of the Progressive Policy Institute in 1999, Toward \nPerformance-Based Federal Education Funding: Reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. Based on this framework, my \nstaff and that of Senator Bayh began working regularly with like-minded \nmoderate Democrats to draft a legislative proposal. Soon thereafter, \nthe moderate Democrats formed the Senate New Democrat Coalition, with \nSenator Bob Graham as the leader, and selected education reform as the \ncoalition's first legislative priority, with Senator Bayh and myself \nspearheading the effort.\n  On March 21, 2000, I joined Senator Bayh and other Senate New \nDemocrats, including Senators Mary Landrieu, Bob Graham, John Breaux, \nBlanche Lincoln, Herb Kohl, Richard Bryan, and Charles Robb, to \nintroduce the Three R's Act, S. 2254, a sweeping piece of legislation \ndesigned to fundamentally reform federal education policy to a \nperformance-based system focused on providing states and local school \ndistricts with greater resources and flexibility in return for greater \naccountability for increased student academic achievement. In May of \n2000, Representative Cal Dooley, a leader of the New Democrats in the \nHouse of Representatives, introduced the Three R's companion bill, H.R. \n4518, which was cosponsored by Representative Adam Smith.\n  To correct a system that had grown too rigid, bureaucratic, and \nunresponsive to the needs of parents, the Three R's Act called for \nproviding states and localities with more federal funding and greater \nflexibility regarding how to spend those dollars. In return, educators \nwould be held more accountable for academic results. We argued that as \na nation, we should ultimately base success on students' real \neducational outcomes--including test results and other measures--rather \nthan on the number of programs or the size of the federal allocation.\n  The Three R's Act called for streamlining the number of federal \neducation programs and focusing federal dollars and attention on a few \ncritical educational priorities, including serving disadvantaged \nstudents, raising teacher quality, increasing English proficiency, \nexpanding public school choice, and stimulating innovation. Overall, it \nwould have increased federal investment in public education by $35 \nbillion over the next five years, targeting most of those new dollars \nto the poorest school districts in the nation.\n  In April 2000, in conjunction with the introduction of our Three R's \nbill, the New Democrats held a forum on Capitol Hill to foster dialogue \non the need for education reform. Participants included Bob Schwartz of \nACHIEVE, former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, Amy Wilkins \nof The Education Trust, University of Maryland Professor Dr. Bill \nGalston, and Joseph Olshefske, Superintendent of Seattle Public \nSchools. Although some participants offered constructive criticism on \ncertain provisions in the Three R's bill, they largely cited the bill \nas the building block for a broad and bipartisan consensus.\n  In the Spring of 2000, Republican Senators Gorton and Gregg \napproached Senator Bayh and myself to discuss the possibility of \nproducing just such a reform package, and together we reached agreement \non a number of provisions later to appear in the Conference Report \nbefore us today, such as the concept known as ``supplemental \nservices.'' Despite our inability to reach a final compromise at that \nstage, these negotiations significantly furthered the framework for a \ncomprehensive bipartisan bill.\n  During the May 2000 debate over S. 2, the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee's Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization bill, my fellow Senate New Democrats and I successfully \npushed for the inclusion of provisions enhancing accountability for \neducational performance in the Democratic Caucus' alternative \namendment, Amdt. 3111, to S. 2. In addition, our coalition successfully \npushed for a separate debate on our Three R's proposal, which we \noffered as a substitute amendment, Amdt. 3127 to S. 2. That amendment \nwas one of the few to be considered on the Senate floor before the ESEA \nbill was withdrawn. Though our amendment only garnered 13 votes, all \nDemocratic, its defeat could not obscure the fact that the basis for \nbipartisan agreement was building.\n  Also in June of that year, I joined with Senator Landrieu in \ncosponsoring her amendment, S. 3645, to the Labor-HHS-Education FY 2001 \nAppropriations Bill, H.R. 4577, which proposed focusing $750 million in \nfederal funds on serving the poorest school districts. Unfortunately, \nthat amendment was tabled, and thus defeated, despite bipartisan \nsupport for improving the distribution of federal funds to better serve \nall students. However, on behalf of the New Democrats, I successfully \ngarnered inclusion of language requesting a GAO study of the formulas \nused to distribute federal education funds under Title I of the ESEA, \nincluding an assessment of their effectiveness in meeting the needs of \nthe highest poverty districts. The GAO full report is expected in \nJanuary 2002.\n  As 2000 advanced, progress on the Three R's reform model was slowed \nby special interests, partisan politics, and the Presidential campaign \nof which I was a part. Congress failed to reauthorize ESEA on time for \nthe first time since its enactment in 1965. Nonetheless, New Democrats \nand members supporting reform on the Republican side managed to take \nsignificant steps in the 106th Congress toward furthering the framework \nfor the bipartisan compromise reached in the 107th Congress. Key among \nour victories were building on the consensus for greater accountability \nfor academic results and agreeing to examine better targeting of \nfederal resources on our nation's most disadvantaged communities.\n  In August 2000, the Presidential elections went into full swing, \ntaking up much of my time. It was encouraging for me to see both \nPresidential candidates adopting into their campaign platforms many of \nthe concepts in the Three R's bill. Sandy Kress, current education \nadvisor to President Bush and then advisor to Governor Bush, was widely \nreported to be a key architect of his education blueprint. I was not \nsurprised to later learn that as a member of the Democratic Leadership \nCouncil in Texas, Sandy was intrigued by many of the concepts contained \nin the Progressive Policy Institute's education reform plan and our \nThree R's legislation in the Senate. I am pleased that President Bush \nembraced so many of these reforms in his blueprint for education \nreform.\n  After the election, President-elect Bush invited several key \neducation reformers, including Senator Bayh and Representative Tim \nRoemer, to Austin to discuss the reauthorization of ESEA. By including \nkey New Democrats at this meeting, the President-elect sent a clear \nsignal that to his administration, a bipartisan bill centered around a \nmoderate message of reform would be a top priority.\n  That message proved valuable in guiding us toward a compromise this \nyear. On February 13, 2001, early in the 107th Congress, I joined other \nNew Democrat cosponsors in reintroducing the Three R's bill as S. 303. \nThe same day, the White House released a white paper outlining the \nAdministration's education plan, ``No Child Left Behind,'' which shared \nsignificant common ground with the Three R's Act. Also that winter, \nRepresentative Tim Roemer reintroduced the Three R's companion bill, \nH.R. 345, in the House of Representatives, together with 18 other New \nDemocrat cosponsors including Cal Dooley and Adam Smith, who had \nintroduced the first House bill.\n  Over the same period, Senate New Democrats were approached by Senator \nGregg with the backing of the White House about the introduction of a \nbipartisan bill using the Three R's as a base. In late February and \nMarch 2001, Senators Bayh, Landrieu, Lincoln, and myself began \nbipartisan negotiations with Sandy Kress of the White House and \nRepublican Senators Gregg, Hutchinson, Collins, and Frist.\n  The Senate Education Committee was simultaneously beginning work on\n\n[[Page S13401]]\n\nESEA legislation, and on March 28, 2001, Senator Jeffords, Chairman of \nthe HELP Committee, reported out of committee an education bill, S. 1, \nentitled ``Better Education for Students and Teachers Act,'' or \n``BEST.''\n\n  Understanding that lasting reform requires broad bipartisan support, \nSenator Bayh and I encouraged the White House and our Republican \ncolleagues to bring all interested parties--many of whom had the same \nreform goals--together. I am appreciative of the leadership shown by \nSenators Lott and Daschle in uniting these efforts and to have been \nincluded in those negotiations.\n  However, the bill that emerged from the Senate was not as strong on \naccountability as the Three R's Act. I was disappointed, for example, \nthat concerns raised by some members of Congress and many outside \ngroups prompted the White House and others to abandon strong \naccountability tools to measure the performance of all students of all \nracial groups. Nonetheless, I believe that the language ultimately \nreached, while not as strong as I would have preferred, marked a \ndramatic step forward in holding schools, districts and states \naccountable for making annual progress in student academic achievement.\n  In the first week of May 2001, this bipartisan substitute bill, S. 1, \nwas brought to the floor. The Senate had a very lively debate on the \nbill for several weeks, with hundreds of amendments introduced and \npassed. The debate was interrupted periodically for other debates, most \nnotably the consideration of the final conference report on the budget \nand tax relief bill, which itself included several education \namendments. Several New Democrats, myself included, were concerned that \ninsufficient funds were being provided for investments in important \npriorities such as education. An amendment to support full funding of \nIDEA was introduced and passed overwhelmingly by the Senate. \nImmediately thereafter, Senator Jeffords changed his membership in the \nRepublican Party to independent status and the Senate was reorganized. \nSenator Kennedy became Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee and \nSenator Gregg became the Ranking Member of the Committee. Fortunately, \nthe bipartisan working spirit was not harmed by this change, and work \non the education bill continued.\n  During the debate on S. 1, I cosponsored with Senator Landrieu an \namendment to restore the original purpose of Title I funding by \nprohibiting the allocation of Title I funds to school districts unless \nnew funds were appropriated to the Targeted Grant formula, focusing \nthese funds on the communities and schools with the greatest need. The \namendment, S. Amdt. 475, passed by a vote of 57 to 36. We were able to \nsecure $1 billion in funding for these targeted grants in a subsequent \namendment, S. Admt. 2058, to the Senate Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations bill, S. 1536, for fiscal year 2002 which passed the \nSenate on November 6, 2001. The amendment, cosponsored by Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Cochran, and myself, passed the Senate by a vote of \n81 to 19.\n  I also cosponsored, with Senators Tom Carper and Gregg, an amendment \nto S. 1, S. Amdt. 518, to make public school choice a reality for \nchildren trapped in failing schools by encouraging states and local \ndistricts with low-performing schools to implement programs of \nuniversal public school choice and eliminating many of the existing \nbarriers to charter school start-up and facility costs. Parental choice \nis a crucial element of accountability, and both provisions promise to \ngive more and more parents a real stake in their children's education. \nI am proud that both concepts are incorporated in the legislation that \nwe are considering today.\n\n  After several weeks of debate, the Senate passed S. l, ``BEST'' in \nJune 2001. Since the House of Representatives had introduced H.R. 1, \nentitled ``No Child Left Behind Act of 2001,'' in March, a conference \nwas necessary to resolve the still significant differences between the \nbills. In July 2001, I was very gratified to be appointed a conferee to \nthe conference committee of the House and the Senate, with my Three R's \ncosponsor Senator Bayh. Since Senator Bayh and I are not members of the \nHELP Committee, our inclusion was unprecedented; and I thank Senator \nKennedy for his keen understanding of the contribution that the New \nDemocrats made to this process of forging a bipartisan compromise.\n  We have been negotiating and working diligently on the conference \nreport since July, and although this Conference process was long and \ndifficult, I believe the hard work has been worthwhile, as we have \nproduced a landmark bill with the potential to vastly improve our \nnation's public schools. Senator Kennedy, Senator Gregg, Representative \nBoehner, and Representative Miller all deserve praise for creatively \nresolving differences between the bills.\n  Previously, accountability for federal education dollars had been \nfocused on how a state, school district, or school spent funds rather \nthan the results that those funds produced. The Three R's bill, and now \nthe new conference report bill, shifts the focus from inputs to \noutcomes. This conference report embodies the performance-based \naccountability model put forth in the Three R's bill for holding \nstates, school districts, and schools accountable for increases in \nstudent achievement based on state assessments and state standards.\n  Of course, we have not solved all of the problems that confront \neducation in the United States, in particular, I would like to take a \nmoment to commend Senator Jeffords for his leadership on the issue of \neducating students with disabilities under the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA, and his dedication to ensuring that \nCongress lives up to its commitment made in 1975 to provide 40 percent \nof the costs associated with educating these students. His courage to \ntake such a strong stand on this important priority is admirable. I am \nhopeful that Congress can address this issue when it takes up the \nreauthorization of IDEA in 2002.\n  Nevertheless, this conference report represents a major step forward \nin improving and reforming our education policies and programs. The \nfollowing highlights provide an overview of concepts and policy themes \nthat were proposed in the New Democrats' Three R's bill and had an \nimpact on the new legislation.\n  On accountability, the heart of the Three R's plan called on each \nstate to adopt performance standards in all federal programs, most \nimportantly requiring states to ensure that all students, including \nthose in Title I schools, would reach proficiency in math and reading \nwithin 10 years. It required states, districts and schools to \ndisaggregate test results to better focus attention and resources on \nthe lowest performing subgroups in order to close the achievement gap \nthat exists in our nation between disadvantage and non-disadvantaged \nstudents, and minority and non-minority students. It further required \nstates to develop annual measurable performance goals for teacher \nquality and English proficiency, and held states and districts \naccountable for meeting those goals. The final agreement adopts much of \nthis accountability structure--creating a more performance-based \napproach to public education.\n\n  As to flexibility, the Three R's plan called for consolidating dozens \nof federal education programs into a limited number of funding streams \nthat would greatly expand the ability of states and districts to \nallocate federal aid to meet their specific needs. Although the final \nagreement does not contain the level of consolidation envisioned in the \nThree R's bill, it does significantly increase the flexibility of \nstates and local districts to transfer funding from many other \nprograms; it also creates new ``State Flex'' and ``Local Flex'' \nexperiments to provide even more freedom to consolidate funding.\n  Concerning disadvantaged students, the Three R's plan would have \nreformed the Title I program to hold states and districts accountable \nfor closing the achievement gap; strengthened the definition of what \nconstitutes adequate yearly progress; and required districts to first \nintervene and turn around chronically failing schools, and ultimately \nrestructure them, convert them to charter schools, or close them down. \nThe final agreement builds on these reforms and adds to them, sharply \nredefining adequate yearly progress so that all students must be \nacademically proficient within 12 years, offering students in failing \nschools the right\n\n[[Page S13402]]\n\nto transfer to higher-performing public schools, and giving families \nwith children in poorly performing schools the right to use federal \nfunds for outside tutoring assistance.\n  Related to targeting, the Three R's plan not only called for \nincreasing federal funding for Title I and other major programs, but \nfor targeting those resources to the districts with the highest \nconcentrations of poverty. The final agreement includes a New Democrat \namendment sponsored by Senators Landrieu and myself that channels most \nof the new Title I dollars to the poorest districts through a more \ntargeted formula. It also changes other program formulas to better \ntarget teacher quality, English proficiency, reading, technology and \nafter school funding to the districts and schools with the greatest \nneed.\n  On teacher quality, the Three R's plan called for consolidating \nseveral teacher quality grant programs into a single formula stream, \nbetter targeting those dollars to the districts with the most teachers \nteaching out of their area of specialty, and holding states and \ndistricts accountable for ensuring that all teachers are deemed highly \nqualified by a specified deadline. The final agreement meets all three \ngoals, requiring all teachers in a state to be qualified--not only \nmeeting state certification requirements but also meeting rigorous \ncontent standards--by 2006.\n  As to bilingual reform, the Three R's plan called for a total \noverhaul of federal bilingual education programs that would streamline \nthe bureaucracy, increase federal investment to meet growing \nenrollment, and refocus the program's mission on helping non-native \nspeaking students achieve proficiency in English and other academic \nsubjects. The final agreement adopts almost all of these reforms, \nincluding a requirement to annually assess students' language \nproficiency and hold districts accountable for improving English \nproficiency for the first time.\n\n  Regarding public school choice, the Three R's plan called for \nincreasing educational options for parents within the public school \nframework, strengthening funding for charter schools and creating a new \ninitiative to promote intra- and inter-district choice programs at the \nlocal level. The final agreement includes a New Democrat amendment \nsponsored by Senator Carper that is based largely on these provisions, \nas well as Three R's-related measures requiring states and districts to \nexpand the use of report cards to inform parents about school \nperformance.\n  I would like to turn now to a detailed discussion of some of the \nmajor titles and parts of the conference report which have been \ninfluenced by the provisions and intent of the Three R's bill. The \nheart of the Three R's plan, especially for Part A of Title I, was a \ncomprehensive accountability system for closing the academic \nachievement gap that held each, district, and school responsible for \nimproving academic performance. It called for a major investment of \nfederal resources under Title I and better targeting of those funds to \nthe highest poverty communities. Under that restructured system, states \nwould be required to define adequate yearly progress, or AYP, for \nstudent academic achievement so that all students would be proficient \nin reading and math within 10 years and each district and school would \nbe required to show measurable progress each year--not just on average, \nbut specifically for minority and disadvantaged subgroups. If schools \nfailed to meet these standards, districts would be required to \nintervene and make improvements. If schools continually failed, \ndistricts would eventually be required to take dramatic steps to \noverhaul them or close them down, while providing students in those \nschools with the right to transfer to another higher performing public \nschool.\n  Title I, Part A of the conference report incorporates much of the \nideas and architecture of this system as envisioned under the Three R's \nbill and substantially builds on them. It authorizes $13.5 billion in \nfunding for fiscal year 2002 while significantly reforming the funding \nformulas under Title I, Part A, subpart 2. It demands that states \ndevelop new annual assessments in grades 3-8 to better monitor student \nlearning, and sharply redefines the definition of adequate yearly \nprogress to ensure that schools and districts are making demonstrable \ngains in closing the achievement gap, and that all students are \nacademically proficient within 12 years. And, it demands annual \naccountability for that progress by intervening in failing schools and \ndistricts to turn them around, and imposes tough actions on those that \nfail to improve over time.\n  Regarding standards and assessments, the Three R's bill maintained \nthe requirements for state content and student performance standards \nand annual assessments that existed under current law, as directed \nunder the enactment of the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. Under section 1111(b)(4) of Title I, it \nrequired that states have in place their annual assessments in English \nlanguage arts and mathematics by the 2002-2003 school year. It further \nrecognized the growing importance of a high quality science education \nfor all students, so that our nation may continue to compete in a \nglobal and increasingly high-tech, high-skilled economy. As a result, \nit expanded current law by requiring states to develop and implement \nscience standards and assessments by the 2006-2007 school year. States \nthat failed to have their 1994 required assessments, and the new \nscience assessments, in place by the required deadlines would not \nreceive any new administrative funds and would lose 20 percent of their \nadministrative funds in subsequent years if the failure continued. \nStates would be required to administer assessments annual to at least \none grade in each the elementary, middle and high school levels.\n\n  It further required in section 1111(b)(4) that states assess limited \nEnglish proficient--LEP--students in the student's native language if \nsuch language would be more likely to yield accurate and reliable \ninformation on what that student knows and is able to do. However, it \ndemanded that states require assessments in English for English \nlanguage arts for LEP students. School districts could delay this \nrequirement for one additional year on a case-by-case basis.\n  As with the Three R's, the conference report upholds the requirements \nthat exist under current law, as enacted under the 1994 reauthorization \nof the ESEA, for standards and assessments and penalizes states that \nfail to meet the requirement to have standards and assessments in place \nby the 2001-2002 school year. Under the requirement, the Secretary \nshall withhold 25 percent of a non-compliant State's administrative \nfunds. It further expands on the testing requirements called for under \ncurrent law and under the Three R's plan. It requires, in section \n1111(b)(3), that States develop and implement new annual assessments \nfor all grades, between and including, third-eighth for mathematics, \nand reading or language arts. Such assessments must be administered \nbeginning in the 2005-2006 school year. The Secretary may withhold \nadministrative funds if states fail to meet deadline for the new annual \nassessments.\n  In addition the Act upholds the importance of a science education, as \nhighlighted under the Three R's bill, by requiring states under Title I \nPart A section 1111(b)(1)) to establish science standards and for those \nstandards to be in place by the 2006-2007 school year, and as required \nunder section 1111(b)(3) for states to develop and begin implementation \nof science assessments in at least one grade in each elementary, middle \nand high school level by the 2007-2008 school year.\n  Title I, Part A of the Act, section 1111(3), also requires the \nassessment of limited English proficient students in English in reading \nor language arts in English if such student have been in the United \nStates for three years, but allows districts to seek a waiver from this \nrequirement for up to two additional years, on a case-by-case basis. \nThe intent of the new legislation is that these waivers be used only in \nvery limited circumstances, and by no means broadly applied, to protect \nthe integrity of the new program.\n  In order to assist states with the costs associated with the \ndevelopment of assessments and standards, Title VI of the Three R's \nbill allowed states to use funds set aside under that title for the \ncontinue improvement and development of standards and assessments. This \nnew Act too will ensure that\n\n[[Page S13403]]\n\nstates have substantial resources to use for the development and \nadministration of new annual assessments. Under section 1111(b)(3), the \nAct authorizes $370 million in funding for fiscal year 2002 and raises \nthat level by an additional $10 million in subsequent fiscal years, up \nto $400 million for each fiscal year 2005-2007. If appropriated federal \nfunds fall below the specified amount in any fiscal year, states are \nallowed to cease the administration, but not the development, of new \nannual assessments.\n\n  To prevent gaming of test results, section 1111(b)(2) of the Three \nR's stated that in order for a school to be found meeting adequate \nyearly progress, it must meet its annual measurable objectives set for \neach subgroup and it must annually assess at least 90 percent of the \nstudents in each subgroup. The conference report improves this goal by \nrequiring schools to assess 95 percent of the students in each \nsubgroup. This provision will help protect against any abuses by \nschools or districts in excluding certain students from annual \nassessments.\n  I believe that it is the intention of the language in section 1111(3) \nregarding new annual assessments in mathematics and reading or language \narts, and science, that such assessments shall be interpreted by the \nU.S. Department of Education to mean state developed tests that produce \nvalid and reliable data on student achievement that is comparable from \nschool to school and district to district. This conference report's \nexpanded and improved focus in section 1111(3) of Title I on high-\nquality annual assessments will help ensure that schools and parents \nhave a better understanding of students' levels of knowledge and the \nsubject areas requiring improvement. Such regular monitoring of \nachievement also will help schools and district better achieve \ncontinuous academic progress.\n  Regarding English proficiency assessments, Title III of the Three R's \nrequired states to develop annual assessments to measure English \nproficiency gains. This new Act recognizes the importance of measuring \nEnglish proficiency attainment by limited English proficient students. \nUnder section 1111, it requires that states hold districts accountable \nfor annually assessing English proficiency (including in the four \nrecognized domains of reading, writing, speaking and listening). States \nmust demonstrate that, beginning no later than the 2002-2003 school \nyear, school districts will annual assess English proficiency of all \nstudents with limited English proficiency. In addition, it is the \nintention of the Conference that the Secretary provide assistance, if \nrequested, to states and districts for the development of assessments \nfor English language proficiency as described under section 1111(3) so \nthat those assessments may be of high quality and appropriately \ndesigned to measure language proficiency, including oral, writing, \nreading and comprehension proficiency. Regular and high quality \ncomprehensive assessment of English language proficiency will help \ncreate a stronger mechanism for measuring proficiency gains and \nensuring progress.\n  In calling for reformed accountability systems in states, Section \n1111(b)(2) of the Three R's required states to end the practice of \nhaving dual accountability systems for Title I and non-Title I schools, \nrequiring states to establish a single, rigorous accountability plan \nfor all public schools. It allowed states to determine what constitutes \nadequate yearly progress, or AYP, for all schools, local educational \nagencies, and the state in enabling all children in schools to meet the \nstate's challenging student performance standards.\n\n  It also established some basic parameters on AYP, requiring it to be \ndefined so as to compare separately the progress of students by \nsubgroup--ethnicity/race, gender, limited English proficiency, and \ndisadvantage/non-disadvantaged; compare the proportions of students at \neach standard level as compared to students in the same grade in the \nprevious school year; be based primarily on student assessment data but \nmay include other academic measures such as promotion, drop-out rates, \nand completion of college preparatory courses, except that the \ninclusion of such shall not reduce the number of schools or districts \nthat would otherwise be identified for improvement; include annual \nnumerical objectives for improving the performance of all groups of \nstudents; and include a timeline for ensuring that each group of \nstudents meets or exceeds the state's proficient level of performance \nwithin 10 years.\n  Section 1111(b)(2) of the conference report defines AYP in a manner \nthat is consistent with the goals of the Three's. It defines AYP as a \nuniform state bar or measure of progress for all students, set \nseparately for mathematics and reading or language arts, and is based \nprimarily on assessment data. The amount of progress must be sufficient \nto ensure that 100 percent of all students reach the state's standard \nof academic proficiency within 12 years. States are required to set a \nminimum bar, or measure, based on either the level of proficiency of \nthe lowest performing subgroup in the state or the lowest quintile \nperforming schools, whichever is higher, plus some growth. States may \nkeep the bar at the same level for up to three years before raising it \nto the next level. However, the first incremental increase shall be two \nyears after the starting point, and the bar shall be raised in equal \nincrements. Each of the four disaggregated\nsubgroups--disadvantage/non-disadvantaged, limited English proficient, \ndisabled, and race/ethnicity--must meet the state uniform bar, or \nmeasure of progress, for both mathematics and reading or language arts \nin order for a school or district to be determined meeting AYP.\n  However, the Conferees understand that some subgroups may make \nextraordinary gains but still fall below a state's uniform bar for \nprogress. Therefore, section 1111(b)(2) of this conference report \ncontains a ``safe harbor'' provision for such cases. Schools with \nsubgroups that do not meet AYP, but whose subgroups make at least 10 \npercent of their distance to 100 percent proficiency (or reduce by 10 \npercent the number of students in the relevant subgroup that are not \nyet proficient), and make progress on one other academic indicator, \nwill not be identified under section 1116 as in need of improvement.\n  The Conferees intend that this system of setting progress bar and \nraising it in equal increments over a 12-year period will allow states \nthe flexibility of focusing on their lowest performing subgroups and \nschools, while gradually raising academic achievement in a meaningful \nmanner. It will further ensure that state plans outline realistic \ntimelines for getting all students to proficiency, and prohibits states \nfrom ``backloading'' their expected proficiency gains in the out years. \nI believe that the Secretary in approving state plans shall give close \nscrutiny to the timelines established by states so that they may be \nmeaningful and meet the requirements of this language--to have 100 \npercent of student in all subgroups reach the state's proficient \nstandard level within 12 years.\n\n  In order to address concerns raised over the volatility of test \nscores, section 1111(b)(2) of the conference report allows states to \nestablish a uniform procedure for averaging of assessment data. Under \nthis system, states may average data from the school year for which the \ndetermination is made under section 1116 regarding the attainment of \nAYP with data from one or two school years immediately preceding that \nschool year. In addition, States may average data across grades in a \nschool, but not across subjects.\n  As did Three R's, the new Act recognizes that in order to maintain \nhigh quality pubic education alternatives, charter schools must be held \naccountable for meeting the accountability requirements under Title I \nfor academic achievement, assessments, AYP, and reporting of academic \nachievement data. However, the legislation also understands the unique \nrelationships established under individual state charter school laws. \nAs a result, this conference report clarifies that charters schools are \nsubject to the same accountability requirements that apply to other \npublic schools, including sections 1111 and 1116, as established by \neach state, but that the accountability provisions shall be overseen in \naccordance with state charter school law. It further expresses that \nauthorized chartering agencies should be held accountable for carrying \nout their oversight responsibilities as determined by each state \nthrough its charter school law and other applicable state laws.\n\n[[Page S13404]]\n\n  To aid low-performing schools so that they may make the necessary \nimprovements to turn themselves around, such as providing more \nprofessional development for teachers, designing a new curriculum and \nhiring more highly qualified teachers, the section 1003 of the Three \nR's bill required states to set aside 2.5 percent of their Title I, \nPart A funds in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, and 3.5 percent of funds \nfor fiscal years 2003-2005. States would be required to send 80 percent \nof these funds directly to school districts for the purpose of turning \naround failing schools and districts.\n  This conference report contains similar requirements, demanding that \nstates set aside two percent of their Title I funds received under \nsubpart 2 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and four percent of their \nfunds in fiscal years 2004-2007 to assist schools and districts \nidentified for improvement and corrective action under section 1116, \nand to provide technical assistance under section 1117. States shall \nsend 95 percent of the funds reserved in each fiscal year directly to \nlocal school districts. It further authorizes $500 million for grants \nto local school districts to provide supplemental efforts by districts \nto address schools identified under section 1116. I believe it is the \nintention of these provisions that funds be directed first, at schools \nand districts in corrective action, and second, to schools and \ndistricts identified for improvement.\n  Under the Three R's, section 1116, school districts shall identify as \nbeing in need of improvement any school that for two consecutive years \nfailed to make adequate yearly progress, or was in, or eligible for, \nschool improvement before enactment of the legislation. \nSchools identified would have the opportunity to review the school \ndata, and if the principal believed that identification was made in \nerror, the identification could be contested. In addition, districts \nwould be required to notify parents of the school's identification and \nwhat it means, what the school is doing to address the problems, and \nhow parents can become more involved in improvement efforts.\n\n  Parents of students in schools identified prior to the enactment of \nthe proposed legislation would be given the choice to transfer their \nchild to a higher performing public schools that was not identified \nunder section 1116. For parents of students in schools identified after \nenactment, the districts would be required to provide the parents with \nthe option to transfer their child to a higher performing school within \n12 months after the date of identification.\n  Schools identified for school improvement under section 1116 of the \nThree R's would be required to develop and implement school improvement \nplans to address the school's failure, and to devote 10 percent of \nTitle I, Part A funds for high quality professional development for \nteachers. Although districts would be allowed to take action earlier, \nthe bill required districts to identify for corrective action, any \nschool that, after two years of being identified for school \nimprovement, failed to make AYP. As under improvement, schools would \nhave the opportunity to contest the identification for corrective \naction. Districts would be required to impose corrective actions that \nincluded implementing new curricula, reconstituting school personnel, \nor making alternative governance arrangements for the school, such as \nshutting it down and reopening it as a charter school. In addition, \nparents with students in such schools would continue to receive the \nright to transfer to another school and have transportation costs or \nservices provided by the district. The bill capped the amount of Title \nI funds that could be spent by a district in meeting this requirement \nat 10 percent.\n  The bill also required states to identify local educational agencies \nthat had failed to make AYP under a similar timeframe, requiring them \nto develop and implement improvement plans, giving parents the right to \ntransfer their student to another school, and imposing corrective \nactions for repeated failure.\n  The conference report embodies much of the concepts proposed in the \nThree R's bill for turning around low performing schools and imposing \ncorrective actions on those who continually fail. It expands the \noptions available to parents of students in schools identified for \nimprovement or corrective action. And, it ensures that schools that \ncontinually fail will face tough consequences.\n  Under section 1116 of Title I of the conference report, schools and \ndistricts that have been identified for improvement or corrective \naction prior to enactment would start in the same category after \nenactment. It is the intention of these provisions that schools that \nhave been failing for years do not get to restart their clocks, and \nthat actions be taken immediately to address the failure in those \nschools and districts.\n  To address concerns raised that one year's worth of data is not \nenough to judge success or failure, the Act requires that schools must \nfail to make AYP for two consecutive years before being identified for \nimprovement under section 1116. Schools identified shall develop and \nimplement improvement plans and receive additional technical and \nfinancial assistance to make improvement, and must devote 10 percent of \ntheir Title I funds to professional development activities for teachers \nand principals. Parents of children in these schools will be given the \noption to transfer their child to a higher performing public school \nwith transportation costs or services provided. The Act clarifies that, \nalthough districts are required to provide transportation, they may \nonly use up to 15 percent of their Title I funds to pay for such costs \nor services. The option to transfer shall only be consistent with state \nlaw--local law or policy shall not apply--and schools receiving \ntransferring students must treat them in the same manner as any other \nstudent enrolling in the school. It is the intent of these provisions \nthat capacity constraints not be a barrier to public school choice and \nthat choice be meaningful by ensuring that transportation costs or \nservices will be provided.\n  Schools that fail for three consecutive years to meet AYP shall \ncontinue the improvement plan and other requirements from the previous \nyear, and shall give parents the option of receiving, and selecting, \noutside tutoring assistance for their child from a state-approved list \nof providers. Such providers may include private organizations, non-\nprofit organizations, and community-based organizations. School \ndistricts shall only be required to reserve 20 percent of their Title I \nfunds under Part A, and spend up to 5 percent of their Title I funds on \nproviding parents with the option to transfer to another school and 5 \npercent to provide supplemental services, with the remaining 10 percent \nof funds split between the two requirements as determined by the \ndistrict. District shall not be required to spend more than the \nreserved maximum of 15 percent on providing supplemental services and \nshall select students by lottery if not all eligible students may be \nserved.\n  It is the intention of these provisions that student in failing \nschools have meaningful options to choose from while enabling districts \nto devote the bulk of their Title I resources on making improvements in \nthe underlying school.\n  Just as the Three R's demanded that tough actions be taken with \nschools that fail to improve, the conference report requires that \nschools that fail to meet AYP for four years undergo at least one \ncorrective action. Such actions include instituting a new curriculum, \nreplacing the principal and some relevant staff, or reopening the \nschool as a charter school. Schools that fail for five consecutive \nyears shall continue the action from the previous year and must begin \nplanning for restructure. These measures are intended to ensure that \ndistricts take actions that will result in a substantive and positive \nchange in the school, and that directly address the factors that led to \nfailure.\n  This conference report embodies the intent of the Three R's and \nconferees that schools that continually fail to improve must, at some \npoint, face dramatic consequences. Section 1116 requires that Schools \nthat fail to meet AYP for six consecutive years shall be \ncompletely restructured, including instituting a new governance \nstructure, such as a charter school or private management organization, \nand replace all relevant staff. These steps shall, in effect, result in \nthe creation of an entirely new school.\n\n  I believe that the timelines established under this conference report \nare\n\n[[Page S13405]]\n\nrigorous but fair and will allow for true identification of low \nperforming schools so that they may get the assistance and time they \nneed to turn around performance, but ensure that they face \ncomprehensive and tough penalties if they fail to make improvement.\n  Clarifying that identification should be based on two years worth of \ndata, the Act requires that schools must make AYP for two consecutive \nyears in order to be removed from improvement status, corrective \naction, or restructure under section 1116. Districts may delay \ncorrective action or restructure for one year for a school that makes \nAYP for one year. It is the intention of this provision that schools \nthat may be on the right track to better performance should not be \nforced to curtail current improvement actions in order to implement a \nnew one. Rather, such schools should be expected to continue current \nimprovement activities and monitored for progress for one additional \nyear. If schools fail to make a second year of AYP, then they would be \nforced to undergo corrective action, or restructure.\n  As under the Three R's, the conference report requires states to \nestablish a similar process for identifying and taking corrective \naction on school districts that fail to meet AYP, and for providing \nparents in failing districts with the option to transfer to a higher \nperforming school or receive supplemental services from a tutoring \nprovider. Just as districts shall be required to enforce improvement, \ncorrective action and restructure requirements, it is my belief that \nthis conference reports intends for states to aggressively monitor \ndistrict performance and follow the requirements established under \nsection 1116 regarding district improvement and corrective action. I \nfurther believe that the Secretary shall consider non-compliant any \nstate that fails to take action on districts identified under section \n1116, or fails to take actions on schools identified under section of \n1116--in cases where districts within the state fail to uphold these \nrequirements.\n  Regarding teacher quality, the Three R's Title II required states to \nhave all teachers fully qualified by 2005, meaning that they must be \nstate certified and have demonstrated competency in the subject area in \nwhich they are teaching by passing a rigorous content knowledge test, \nor by having a bachelor's degree, or equivalent number of hours in a \nsubject area. The provisions were intended to ensure that all students, \nparticularly those in high poverty schools, were taught by educators \nwith expertise in their subject area. It sought to address the inequity \nthat exists in our public education system where disadvantaged students \nare more often taught by a teacher that is out of field than their more \nadvantaged peers. It also defined, in section 1119 of Title I, \nprofessional development, so that teachers and principals would receive \nhigh quality professional development that provides educators and \nschool leaders with the knowledge and skills to enable students to meet \nstate academic performance standards; is of on-going duration; is \nscientifically research based; and, in the case of teachers, is focused \non core content knowledge in the subject area taught.\n  To place greater emphasis on the crucial need for highly trained \nteachers in our nation's poorest schools and recognizing that a \nsignificant portion of Title I funds are used to hire teachers, the \nThree R's required states under Title I section 1119, as well as under \nTitle II to ensure that all teachers meet the requirement to be fully \nqualified by the end of 2005; to annually increase the percentage of \ncore classes taught by fully qualified teachers; and to annually \nincrease the percentage of teachers and principals receiving high \nquality professional development.\n  Section 1119 of the Three R's also established requirements for \nparaprofessionals to ensure that such individuals would be \nappropriately equipped to assist teachers in the classroom and assist \nin tutoring students. Paraprofessionals that provided only translation \nservices for non-native speaking students and families, or parent \ninvolvement activities, would be exempted from the new requirements. \nThe bill also placed restrictions on the types of duties that \nparaprofessional may provide in schools. The intent of these provisions \nwas to reduce the reliance in schools on paraprofessionals in providing \ncore academic instruction to students, and place a priority on ensuring \nthat students be taught by a highly trained teacher.\n  This conference report embodies much of the Three R's goals and \nprovisions on teacher quality, professional development and \nparaprofessional quality. Section 1119 of the report requires states to \nensue that all teachers hired under Title I will be highly qualified by \nthe end of the 2005-2006 school year. Highly qualified is defined as \nbeing state certified and, in the case of a newly hired teacher, having \ndemonstrated competency by passing a rigorous content knowledge test or \nhaving a bachelor's degree in the subject area taught. And, in the case \nof an existing teacher, highly qualified teachers shall have \ndemonstrated competency by passing a rigorous content knowledge test or \nmeeting a high, objective and uniform standard of evaluation developed \nby the state.\n  I believe it is the intention of this language to ensure that content \nknowledge assessments or state standards of evaluations as described in \nsection 1119 will provide for a rigorous, uniform, objective system \nthat is grade appropriate and subject appropriate, and that will \nproduce objective, coherent information of a teacher's knowledge of the \nsubject taught. Such a system is not intended to stigmatize teachers \nbut to ensure that all teachers have the crucial knowledge necessary to \nensure that students may meet the state's challenging academic \nachievement standards in all core subjects.\n  In addition, I believe that it is crucial that existing teachers be \ngiven the high quality professional development necessary to ensure \nthat they meet the definition of highly qualified. That is why under \nPart A of Title II of the Three R's bill, and under section 1119 of \nthis conference report, states would be required establish annual \nmeasurable objectives for districts and schools to annually increase \nthe percentage of teachers receiving high quality professional \ndevelopment, and to hold districts accountable for meeting those \nobjectives. It also is why both pieces of legislation require under \nPart A of Title I that districts spend five percent of their Title I \nfunds received under subpart 2 on professional development activities, \nand require under section 1116 that schools identified devote 10 \npercent of their Title I funds to professional development activities \nas defined under section 1119.\n\n  On report cards, The Three R's, in Title IV, section 4401, required \nstates, districts and schools to annually publish and widely \ndisseminate to parents and communities report cards on school level \nperformance. It required that report cards be in a manner and format \nthat is understandable and concise. State report cards would be \nrequired to include information on each district and school within the \nstate receiving Title I, Part A and Title II, Part A funds, including \ninformation disaggregated by subgroup regarding: student performance on \nannual assessments in each subject area; a comparison of students at \nthe three state standard levels of basic, proficient and advanced in \neach subject area; three-year trend data; student retention rates; the \nnumber of students completing advanced placement courses; four-year \ngraduation rates; the qualifications of teaches in the aggregate, \nincluding the percentage of teachers teaching with emergency or \nprovisional credentials, the percentage of classes not taught by a \nfully qualified teacher, and the percentage of teachers who are fully \nqualified; and information about the qualifications of \nparaprofessionals.\n  District level report cards would be required to report on the same \ntype of information as well as information on the number and percentage \nof schools identified for improvement, and information on how students \nin schools in the district perform on assessments as compared to \nstudents in the state as a whole. School level report cards would be \nrequired to include similar information as that required under the \nstate and district report cards as well as information on whether the \nschool has been identified under section 1116. Parents would also have \nthe right to know, upon request to the school district, information \nregarding the professional qualifications of their student's classroom, \nand information on the level of performance of the individual student.\n\n[[Page S13406]]\n\n  Section 1111 of Title I of the conference report contains a similar \nstructure for report cards and essentially the same required \ninformation. States would be required to annually report to the public \non student performance information in the aggregate for each of the \nfour subgroups, in addition to migrant students and gender, including: \nstudent performance on state assessments; a comparison of students \nperforming at each of the states standard levels of basic, proficient \nand advanced; graduation rates; the number and names of schools \nidentified under section 1116; the qualification of teachers; and the \npercentages of students not tested.\n  Districts would be required to provide similar information in their \nreport cards, in addition to information on the numbers and percentages \nof schools identified for school improvement under section 1116, and \nhow long the schools have been identified. In the case of school level \ninformation, districts shall also include whether the individual school \nhas been identified for improvement.\n  Expanding on the intent behind the Three R's to make the public, \nincluding parents, schools, and communities more aware of how our \nnation's schools are performing, the conference report further requires \nthat states submit annual reports to the Secretary with information, \nincluding the disaggregated assessment results by subgroup; the numbers \nand names of each school identified for improvement under section 1116 \nand the reasons for the identification as well as the measures taken to \naddress the achievement problems; the number of students and schools \nthat participated in the public school choice and supplemental service \nprograms and activities in section 1116; and information on the quality \nof teachers and the percentages of classes not taught by a highly \nqualified teacher. The Secretary, in turn, shall transmit a report to \nCongress with data from these state reports.\n\n  This conference report carries out the intent of the Three R's to \nprovide the public, particularly parents, with a greater awareness of \nstate, districts and school performance on raising academic \nachievement; the academic achievement levels of all students \ndisaggregated by subgroup; and the qualifications of our nation's \neducators. Such information expands public understanding of the \nacademic achievement gap that exists between minorities and non-\nminorities, and between disadvantage and non-disadvantaged students so \nthat the federal government, states, districts, and schools may better \ntarget attention and resources in order to close those gaps.\n  As to targeting funds, the Three R's plan made a commitment not only \nto boost the Federal investment in public education, but to improve the \ntargeting of those resources to the schools with the greatest needs. It \nfound in Title I, section 1001, that:\n\n       The Federal Government must better target Federal resources \n     on those children who are most at risk for falling behind \n     academically. Funds made available under this title [Title I, \n     Part A] have been targeted on high-poverty areas, but not to \n     the degree the funds should be targeted on those areas, as \n     demonstrated by the following: (A) although 95 percent of \n     schools with poverty levels of 75 percent to 100 percent \n     receive title I funds, 20 percent of schools with poverty \n     levels of 50 to 74 percent do not receive any title I funds; \n     [and] (B) only 64 percent of schools with poverty levels of \n     35 percent to 49 percent receive title I funds. Title I \n     funding should be significantly increased and more \n     effectively targeted to ensure that all economically \n     disadvantaged students have an opportunity to excel \n     academically.\n\n  The Three R's plan upheld the commitment made in the 1994 law that \nall new funds under Title I, Part A would be distributed to states and \ndistricts under the Targeted Grant formula described in section 1125. \nThis commitment was further codified this past June when the Senate \npassed an amendment, S. Amdt. 475, to S. 1, the Senate ESEA \nreauthorization bill, that would prohibit the Secretary from making \nawards under Title I, Part A, Subpart 2 unless the goals of the \nTargeted Grant formula were met.\n  This campaign to better target federal funds met with much political \nresistance. But the Conference Committee decided to make this goal a \npriority, and as a result, the conference report upholds and in some \ncases goes beyond the call for targeting in the Three R's plan. In \nparticular, it includes the amendment sponsored by myself and Senator \nMary Landrieu regarding the Targeted Grant.\n  The conference report maintains current law formulas under subpart 2 \nfor Basic, Concentration and the Targeted Grant formula, but applies a \nhold harmless rate of 85-95 percent of the previous fiscal year \nallocation to each district for each of these three formulas. However, \nit also ensures that localities that fail to meet the minimum threshold \nfor the Concentration grant for four years shall no longer be eligible \nfor funds under this formula.\n  Crucial to the priority of targeting our federal funds, are the \nprovisions made under section 1125 to Targeted Grant and the Education \nFinance Incentive Grant. In particular, the language prohibits the \nallocation of funds under Part A, unless all new funds are distributed \nthrough the Targeted Grant formula. It is the intent of this provision \nto address the history of Federal appropriations, which have failed to \nprovide funding to the Targeted Grant, by requiring appropriators to \nuphold the commitment that has existed in authorized law since 1994 to \nbetter target Federal resources to our nation's highest poverty \ndistricts via the Targeted Grant formula.\n  In addition, these provisions significantly modify the Education \nFinance Incentive Grant Program. This program has never been funded and \npreviously would have been the least targeted formula for Title I, Part \nA funds. The conference report changes the formula so that funding to \nstates would be based on the total number of poor children within the \nState multiplied by the per pupil expenditure, the state's effort \nfactor, and the state's equity factor. Most significantly, within state \nallocations would be highly targeted to the highest poverty districts \nwithin each state. Allocations to districts would be based on the \nTargeted Grant formula, with greater weighting given to higher poverty \nareas depending on the state's equity factor.\n  I believe that these changes clarify the intent that new Title I \nfunds should be distributed through the Targeted Grant formula while \nensuring that Education Incentive Grant is modified to better target \nresources to high poverty states and districts. These provisions will \nmake for some of the most important reforms in this conference report, \nand will help ensure that Federal resources are targeted to our \ndistricts and schools with the greatest need, rather than diluted \nacross districts with relatively low levels of poverty.\n  Regarding Title I, Part B--Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants, \nI believe that reading is an essential building block to learning. \nTitle I, Part A, sections 1111 and 1116 of the New Democrats Three R's \nbill put special emphasis on ensuring that all children reach the state \nproficiency level in reading and mathematics within 10 years, and held \nstates and school districts receiving federal funds accountable for \nensuring that their students achieve at the proficient level in both \ncore subjects. It further called for a significant increase in funding \nfor Title I and under subpart 2, called for greater targeting of those \nresources on our highest poverty communities so that they have the \nfunds necessary to ensure all students achieve higher levels of \nlearning in core subjects, such as reading.\n  The Three R's bill throughout its entirety, but especially in Titles \nI, called for targeting of resources to the poorest students and \nschools. With the same policy goal, the conference report in Title I, \nPart B, also targets resources to the poorest students. It does so by \nsending ``Reading First'' awards, authorized at $900 million level in \nFY02 in subpart 1 to states under a poverty-based formula that requires \nstates to give priority in awarding competitive grants within the state \nto high poverty areas; and requires school districts to target funds to \nschools with high percentages of students from families below the \npoverty level, or that have a high percentage of children in grades K-3 \nreading below grade level and that are identified for school \nimprovement under Sec. 1116. Additionally, subpart 2 of Part B of \nconference report provides a new competitive grant initiative \nauthorized at $75 million in FY02 called ``Early Reading First'' which \nfunds early reading intervention targeted at children in high-poverty \nareas and\n\n[[Page S13407]]\n\nwhere there are high numbers of students who are not reading at grade \nlevel.\n\n  The intention of the Reading First programs is to place a high \nfederal priority on reading so that students may better succeed \nacademically in other subjects as well. These programs seek to provide \nstudents with the basic skills to reach proficiency in reading or \nlanguage arts in their grade level, and to better train teachers to \nteach children to read. They provide the fundamental building blocks to \nhelp ensure that states, districts and schools reach their academic \nachievement goals set forth in this Title.\n  Teacher quality is also essential to student success, which is why \nour Three R's legislation dramatically increased the national \ninvestment in teacher professional development in its Title II, Part A, \nto help ensure that all teachers are competent in their subject area, \nand provided them with more opportunities for high quality professional \ndevelopment. The ``Reading First Program'' in Title II, Part B of the \nconference report follows this lead and calls for preparing teachers, \nincluding special education teachers, through professional development \nand other support, so the teachers can identify specific reading \nbarriers facing their students and so the teachers have the tools to \neffectively help their students learn to read. It is the intent of the \nlegislation to ensure that teachers are highly qualified and trained in \nthe latest research and techniques to help all children learn to read \nand that the Department provides technical assistance and disseminates \nbest practices and the latest research on reading.\n  Because it is important to better understand each child's level of \nunderstanding and learning as he or she enters schools and to identify \nchildren at risk for reading difficulties, Title I, Part A, of the \nThree R's bill required states to assist and encourage districts to \nconduct first grade literacy diagnostics and assessments that are both \ndevelopmentally appropriate and aligned with state content and student \nperformance standards and to provide districts with technical \nassistance. With this same goal, the conference report in Title I, Part \nB calls for states to assist school districts in selecting and \ndeveloping rigorous diagnostic reading and screening, diagnostic and \nclassroom-based instructional reading assessments. The intent of the \nlegislation is to ensure that every child receives a rigorous diagnosis \nand assessment of their reading capabilities and that schools and \nteachers are helped to administer and use these assessments so that \nthey can better determine each student's level of reading and design \nstrategies to ensure that child will read at grade level.\n  Throughout its entirety, the Three R's bill emphasized greater \naccountability for results. This conference report encompasses this \nresults-based approach. Additionally, Title IV, Part D, of the Three \nR's bill called for much more public reporting of progress so that \nparents can make more informed decisions regarding their child's \neducation. The ``Reading First Program'' in Title I, Part B, Subpart 1, \nof this new bill requires states receiving grants to provide the \nSecretary with an annual report including information on the progress \nthe state, and school districts, are making in reducing the number of \nstudents served under this subpart in the first and second grades who \nare reading below grade level, as demonstrated by such information as \nteacher reports and school evaluations of mastery of the essential \ncomponents of reading instruction. The report shall also include \nevidence that they have significantly increased the number of students \nreading at grade level or above, significantly increased the \npercentages of students in ethnic, racial, and low-income populations \nwho are reading at grade level or above, and successfully implemented \nthe ``Reading First Program'' in Title I, Part B, Subpart 1 of the \nconference report. It is the intent of this legislation that the \nSecretary hold accountable states, school districts, and schools for \nmaking progress in increasing the numbers of students--in all major \neconomic racial and ethnic groups--who are reading at or above grade \nlevel by calling upon the Secretary to review the data contained in \nthese reports to make a determination on continued funding for states. \nI would encourage the Department, in its review, to rigorously enforce \nthe intended accountability for lack of performance by taking stringent \nactions to ensure that recipients of federal funds demonstrate results \nin reading gains for all students.\n  In regards to Title II--Preparing, Training and Recruiting High \nQuality Teachers and Principals, the conference report will make \nrevolutionary changes in federal programs aimed at raising the quality \nof our nation's teachers and principals. Many of these reforms were \npromoted in the Three R's legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th \nCongresses. Most significantly, this conference report builds on the \nstructural reform advocated by the New Democrats in Title II of the \nThree R's bill to streamline several programs into one formula program \nto states and localities to better focus Federal attention on the \ncritical aspects of teacher and principal quality to ensure that all \nstudents, especially those most disadvantaged, are taught by a highly \nqualified teacher. It also further enhances the call for better \ntargeting of our federal resources on the highest poverty states and \nschool districts.\n  Title II, Part A of the Three R's bill emphasized the importance of \nevery child being taught by a highly qualified teacher because research \nconsistently shows that teacher quality is a key component of student \nachievement. It transformed the current Eisenhower Professional \nDevelopment Programs into one performance-based program that in return \nfor greater investments, held states and districts accountable for \nhaving all teachers ``fully qualified'' within four years and for \nproviding teachers and principals with high quality professional \ndevelopment. The Three R's required states to set annual measurable \nobjectives so that all teachers would be ``fully-qualified'' by the \nschool year 2005-2006, with ``fully-qualified'' defined for secondary \nas being state certified, having a bachelor's degree in the area that \nthey teach, and passing rigorous, state-developed content tests. Title \nVII of the Three R's bill further required states to meet the annual \nmeasurable performance objectives established in each title and imposed \nfiscal consequences if they did not meet their goals.\n\n  Title II, Part A--Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund \nof the new bill has accountability measures similar to that of the \nThree R's bill in Titles II and VII and stipulates that all teachers \nmust be ``highly-qualified'' by the school year 2005-2006. It further \nrequires states to set annual measurable objectives to meet that goal \nand to ensure that teachers and principals get high quality \nprofessional development. States must hold districts accountable for \nmeeting these annual objectives; districts that fail to make progress \ntoward meeting the objectives for two consecutive years must develop an \nimprovement plan that will enable the agency to meet such measurable \nobjectives. States must provide technical assistance to such districts \nand schools within the districts. If a district fails to make progress \ntoward meeting the objectives for three consecutive years, the district \nshall enter into an agreement with the state on the use of the \ndistrict's funds. Under this agreement, the state shall institute \nprofessional development strategies and activities that the district \nmust use to meet the measurable objectives and prohibit the district \nfrom using Title I funds received to fund paraprofessionals hired after \nthe date of enactment, except that the district may use Title I funds \nif the district can demonstrate a significant increase in student \nenrollment, or an increased need for translators or assistance with \nparent involvement activities. During this stage of professional \ndevelopment strategies and activities by the state, the state shall \nprovide funding to schools affected to enable teachers within such \nschools to select high-quality professional development activities.\n  It is the intent of this legislation that states rigorously enforce \nthese accountability measures in regards to districts that fail to meet \nthe goals established by the state. I would encourage that the \nSecretary consider as non-compliant any state that fails to take action \non districts failing these goals, and urge the Secretary to take action \nto ensure that such states uphold the requirements of this language to \nhold districts accountable.\n\n[[Page S13408]]\n\n  The conference report establishes a different definition of what \nconstitutes a ``highly-qualified'' teacher, found in Title I, Sec. \n1119, than was proposed in the Three R's definition of ``fully \nqualified'' teacher, found in Title II, Part A. However this definition \nstill retains a strong and reasonable focus on ensuring all teachers \nmeet a high state standard of demonstrated content knowledge. \nSpecifically, the ``No Child Left Behind Act'' defines ``highly-\nqualified'' teachers as teachers that are state certified and:\n  1. In the case of a newly hired elementary school teacher, has a \nbachelor's degree and has demonstrated, by passing a rigorous state \ntest, subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, \nmathematics, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum.\n  2. In the case of a newly-hired secondary school teacher, has a \nbachelor's degree and demonstrates a high level of competency in each \nsubject area taught by passing a rigorous state academic subject area \ntest, or completion, in the subject area(s) taught, of an academic \nmajor, graduate degree, or equivalent course work for an undergraduate \nmajor, or advanced certification.\n  3. In the case of a veteran elementary or secondary school teacher, \nholds a bachelor's degree and has passed a rigorous state test, or \ndemonstrates competency based on a high, objective and uniform standard \nof evaluation developed by the state.\n  As stated earlier, I believe it is the intention of this language to \nensure that content knowledge assessments or state standards of \nevaluations as described in section 1119 will provide for a rigorous, \nuniform, objective system that is grade appropriate and subject \nappropriate, and that will produce objective, coherent information of a \nteacher's knowledge of the subject taught. Such a system is not \nintended to stigmatize teachers but to ensure that all teachers have \nthe crucial knowledge necessary to ensure that students may meet the \nstate's challenging academic achievement standards in all core \nsubjects.\n  In addition, I believe that it is crucial that existing teachers be \ngiven the high quality professional development necessary to ensure \nthat they meet the definition of highly qualified. That is why under \nPart A of Title II of the Three R's bill, section 1119 of this \nconference report, and this title, states would be required to \nestablish annual measurable objectives for districts and schools to \nannually increase the percentage of teachers receiving high quality \nprofessional development, and to hold districts accountable for meeting \nthose objectives. It also is Three R's and this legislation required \ndistricts to spend a portion of their Title I funds on professional \ndevelopment, and required under section 1116 that schools identified \ndevote 10 percent of their Title I funds to professional development \nactivities as defined under section 1119. In addition, I am pleased \nthat this title authorizes over $3 billion for the purpose of ensuring \nthat all students be taught by a highly-qualified teacher by providing \na major investment of federal resources to help states and districts \nwith the recruitment and retention of high quality teachers.\n  Following the intent of the Three R's bill, to target federal \neducation funding to meet the needs of the poorest children, schools, \nand school districts, and to provide assistance to maintain and upgrade \nskills of teachers, the conference report distributes funding to states \nthrough a formula based 65 percent on poverty and 35 percent on student \npopulation, and to school districts through a formula based 80 percent \non poverty and 20 percent on student population. This targeting formula \nis the same as that proposed in S. AMDT 474 by Senator Landrieu and \nadopted this summer into S.1, the Senate education bill. The conference \nreport further requires local school districts to provide assurances \nthat they will target funds to schools that have the lowest percentage \nof highly qualified teachers, have the largest class sizes, or are \nidentified for school improvement under Title I.\n  Research shows that poor and minority children are more likely to be \ntaught by a teacher who is teaching out of field--without a major or \nminor in the field they are teaching. Obviously, this is a disadvantage \nto students as well as teachers. The emphasis on targeting under the \nThree R's and expanded upon in this bill, will significantly help our \nnation's poorest districts, who often face the greatest obstacles to \nrecruiting and retaining high-quality teachers.\n  As called for in Title II of the Three R's bill, Title II, Part A of \nthe conference report also consolidates teacher quality and \nprofessional development programs into one program for the purposes of \nassisting state and local educational agencies with their efforts to \nincrease student academic achievement through such strategies as \nimproving teacher and principal quality, providing high quality \nprofessional development for teachers and principals, and recruiting \nand retaining highly qualified teachers and high quality principals. \nSimilar to Title II of the Three R's bill, the conference report \nrequires districts to provide high quality professional development for \nteachers, principals and administrators so that they are better \nprepared to raise students' academic achievement and meet state \nperformance standards.\n  Title II, Part A, subpart 3 of the conference report also encourages \ninnovative training and mentioning partnerships between local school \ndistricts and universities, non-profit groups, and corporations and \nbusiness organizations, by requiring states to reserve 2.5 percent of \nthe funds they receive under this subpart for competitive grants to \nlocal partnerships involving higher education institutions and school \ndistricts to provide high quality professional development activities \nfor teachers and principals and high quality leadership programs for \nprincipals. This mirrors the educator partnerships suggested in Title \nII, Part A of the Three R's bill. The intent of such partnerships is to \nprovide a better linkage between institutions that prepare teachers and \nthe need for high-quality and on-going professional development to \nteachers and principals in order to reach the goal of having fully \nqualified teachers in all classrooms and all core subjects.\n  As did Title II in the Three R's bill, the conference report gives \nstates and school districts significant flexibility in how they can use \nfederal education funds to meet the goal of having all teachers highly \nqualified within four years. Such flexibility allows states to reform \nteacher/principal certification; develop alternative routes to \ncertification for mid-career professionals; provide support to new \nteachers and principals (such as mentioning); provide professional \ndevelopment; promote reciprocity of teacher and principal certification \nand licensing between states; encourage and support training for \nteachers to integrate technology into curricula; develop merit-based \nperformance systems; and develop differential and bonus pay for \nteachers in high-need academic subjects and teachers in high-poverty \nschools/districts. This flexibility also extends to the local level, \nand helps realize the goal proposed in the Three R's bill to provide \nstates and local with maximum flexibility to address the problem of \nrecruiting and retaining highly-qualified teachers and meeting the goal \nof ensuring all children are taught by a qualified teacher.\n  Title II Part B--Mathematics and Science Partnerships responds to the \nrecognition of a national deficit in the number of teachers with \ndemonstrated content knowledge in math and science. The Three R's bill \nsought to address this problem by requiring states to set aside 10 \npercent of the funds they received under Title II, Part A to establish \npartnership grants--between states, institutions of higher education, \nlocal educational agencies, and schools--that supported professional \ndevelopment activities for mathematics and science teachers in order to \nensure that such teachers have the subject matter knowledge to \neffectively teach mathematics and science. Following this same intent, \nTitle II Part B of the conference report provides for a \nseparate Mathematics and Science Partnerships program to states for the \ncreation of partnerships focused on improving the academic achievement \nof students in math and science by: improving math and science teacher \ntraining at institutions of higher education; providing sustained \nprofessional development for math and science teachers; increasing the \nsubject matter knowledge of mathematics and\n\n[[Page S13409]]\n\nscience teachers by bringing them together with scientists, \nmathematicians and engineers; encouraging institutions of higher \neducation to share equipment and laboratories with local schools; and \ndeveloping more rigorous math and science curricula, and training \nteachers in the effective integration of technology into the curricula.\n\n  Matching the focus on accountability for results in the Three R's \nbill, Part B of Title II of the new bill emphasizes accountability and \ncalls for recipients to develop measurable objectives, and to report to \nthe Secretary on the progress of meeting the objectives of increasing \nthe number of math and science teachers receiving professional \ndevelopment; on improved student academic achievement based on state \nmath and science assessments or the International Math and Science \nStudies; and on other measures such as student participation in \nadvanced courses. The new bill calls on the Secretary to consult and \ncoordinate with the Director of the National Science Foundation with \nrespect to these programs.\n  The intent of this Part of the conference report is to improve the \npre-service training, recruitment, and retention of mathematics and \nscience teachers and to encourage partnerships with institutes of \nhigher education, scientists and engineers who are employed in other \nsectors to ensure that teachers receive high quality professional \ndevelopment in science and mathematics and with the goal to improve \nacademic achievement by all students in these important subjects. It \nalso creates a stronger focus on core subject knowledge by teachers in \nmathematics and science where the problems of out-of-field teaching are \ngreatest.\n  In relation to Title II, part D--Enhancing Education Through \nTechnology, the Three R's bill recognized that it is necessary but not \nsufficient to increase schools' access to computer hardware; to be an \neffective educational tool, technology must be integrated into the core \ncurricula and teachers must have adequate training on how to do so. The \nThree R's bill--Title VI, section 6006, New Economy Technology \nSchools--provided funding for states and school districts for high-\nquality professional development for teachers in the use of technology \nand its integration with state content and student performance \nstandards; effective educational technology infrastructure; training in \nthe use of equipment for teachers, school library and media personnel \nand administrators; and technology-enhanced curricula and instructional \nmaterials that are aligned with state content and student performance \nstandards. It also required states and districts to provide high-\nquality training to teachers, school library and media personnel and \nadministrators in the use of technology and its integration with state \ncontent and student academic standards. These core principles were \nadopted in Title II part D of the conference report, which consolidated \nseveral technology programs into a state-based technology grant program \nentitled ``Enhancing Education Through Technology.''\n  The purposes of part D of Title II of the new law are to provide \nassistance to states and localities for the implementation and support \nof a comprehensive system that effectively uses technology in \nelementary and secondary schools to improve student academic \nachievement; to encourage private-public partnerships to increase \naccess to technology; to assist states and localities in the \nacquisition, maintenance and improvement of technology infrastructure \nto increase access for all students, especially disadvantaged students; \nto support initiatives to integrate technology into curriculum aligned \nwith state student academic standards; to provide professional \ndevelopment of teachers, principals and administrators in teaching and \nlearning via electronic means; to support electronic networks and \ndistance learning; to use technology to promote parent and family \ninvolvement, and most importantly to support rigorous evaluation of \nprograms and their impact on academic performance. These points are \ncomparable to Title VI Sections 6001 and 6006 of the Three R's bill.\n  The primary goal of the conference report's Title II, part D, as \nstated in its purpose section, is to improve student academic \nachievement through the use of technology in elementary and secondary \nschools, to ensure that every child is technologically literate by the \ntime they finish the eighth grade regardless of their background and to \nencourage the effective integration of technology and teacher training \nand curriculum. The conference report requires states to develop state \ntechnology plans which must include an outline of the long-term \nstrategies for improving student academic achievement and local \napplications for grants must include a description of how they will use \nFederal funds to improve academic achievement aligned to challenging \nstate academic standards. These parallel the goals under the Three R's \nTitle VI which emphasized that technology should be an integrated means \nto higher achievement, not an end unto itself. It is our intent that \nachieving this emphasis remains a key goal for state technology plans, \nand that states rigorously review local applications and performance in \nmaking any future awards.\n  The Findings Policy and Purpose section of Title VI of the Three R's \nbill, section 6001, found that technology can produce far greater \nopportunities to enable all students to meet high learning standards, \npromote efficiency and effectiveness in education, and help to \nimmediately and dramatically reform our nation's educational system. It \nalso found that because most federal and state educational technology \nprograms have focused on acquiring educational technology hardware, \nrather than emphasizing the utilization of the technologies in the \nclassroom and the training and infrastructure required to support the \ntechnologies, the full potential of educational technology has rarely \nbeen realized. It also noted that the effective use of technology in \neducation has been inhibited by the inability of many State educational \nagencies and local educational agencies to invest in and support needed \ntechnologies, and to obtain sufficient resources to seek expert \ntechnical assistance in developing high-quality professional \ndevelopment activities for teachers and keeping pace with rapid \ntechnological advances. Three R's also emphasized that to remain \ncompetitive in the global economy, our nation needs a workforce that is \ncomfortable with technology and able to integrate rapid technological \nchanges into production processes. These purposes remain fully \napplicable to the implementation and goals of the new Act.\n  The emphasis in the new law on using technology to improve student \nacademic achievement in core subjects is directly related to the goals \nof the Three R's bill which called for improved academic achievement \nfor all children. Title II part D of the conference report is closely \naligned with Title VI--High Performance and Quality Education \nInitiatives of the Three R's bill. The intent of this legislation is to \nmake sure that technology programs are not just providing access to \nhardware, but are effectively integrating technology into activities \nthat are part of the core curricula and to assist students in improving \nacademic achievement aligned with state content and performance \nstandards and this intent is carried over into the new law. The \nDepartment in overseeing these provisions should be expected to place \nstrong emphasis in ensuring that these goals are achieved.\n  The Three R's emphasized targeting of resources to the poorest \nchildren and schools. This goal was expanded upon in the new law's \nTitle II, Part D, as funds are allocated to the states based 100 \npercent on what the state received under Title I, Part A. Additionally, \nof the total state funds distributed to locals, 50 percent shall be \ndistributed through a state formula based on Title I, Part A, and the \nremaining 50 percent shall be distributed via competitive grants. \nAdditionally, competitive grants shall give priory to high need areas. \nThe intent is that states shall determine which school districts, \nbecause of their size, receive an insufficient amount of formula funds, \nto implement efficient and effective activities, and provide them with \nsupplemental competitive grants.\n  Title II, part D of the new law requires states to submit \napplications for technology funds and that such applications shall \ninclude long-range strategic technology plans. The intent of this is to \nensure that states design long-term strategies for improving student \nacademic achievement, including\n\n[[Page S13410]]\n\ntechnology literacy, that incorporate the effective integration of \ntechnology in the classroom, curricula, and professional training of \nteachers. Such plans shall also contain a description of: the state \ngoals for using advanced technology to improve student achievement \naligned to challenging state academic standards; the steps they will \ntake to ensure that all students and teachers in high-need school \ndistricts have increased access to technology; the process and \naccountability measures the state will use to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the integration of technology; how incentives will be \nprovided to teachers who are technologically literate to encourage such \nteachers to remain in rural and urban areas; and how public and private \nentities would participate in the implementation and support of the \nplan. We intend that in administering this effort, that the Department \nof Education require that states effectively integrate technology in \ntheir classrooms and curricula, and provide adequate professional \ndevelopment for their teachers, with the goal of improving student \nacademic achievement in core subjects.\n  The specific intent in the new Title II, part D is that each local \napplication for technology grants shall include a description of: how \nthe school district will use federal funds to improve the academic \nachievement, including technology literacy, of all students and to \nimprove the capacity of all teachers to provide instruction through the \nuse of technology; what steps they will take to ensure that all \nstudents and teachers in high-need School districts have increased \naccess to technology; how they will promote teaching strategies and \ncurriculum which effectively integrate technology into instruction \nleading to improvements in student academic achievement as measured by \nchallenging state standards; how it will provide ongoing professional \ndevelopment for teachers principals administrators and school library \npersonnel to further the effective use of technology in classrooms and \nlibrary media centers; and the accountability measures and how they \nwill evaluate the extent to which the technology has been integrated \ninto the curriculum, increasing the ability of teachers to teach and \nincreasing the academic achievement of students. All of these elements \nare consistent with the Three R's goals that technology shall not be \nintroduced for technology's sake, but deeply integrated into the \ncurricula and teaching strategies to foster an enhanced learning \nenvironment. We intend that the Department of Education shall \naggressively enforce the requirements that states ensure that school \ndistricts have a comprehensive technology plan in place; that the use \nof technology in the classroom foster a learning environment which will \nimprove academic achievement in the core subjects, and not only \nincrease access to technology hardware.\n\n  The Three R's emphasis on improving accountability by setting \nmeasurable annual goals and standards for student achievement, and \nevaluating and measuring progress achieved can be seen in the new Title \nII part D's requirements for state and local applications. These \nrequire states to develop: state goals for using advanced technology to \nimprove student achievement aligned to challenging state academic \nstandards; steps to ensure that all students and teachers in high-need \nschool districts have increased access to technology; and \naccountability measures the state will use to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the integration of technology. We intend that, just as \nin other areas of this Act, the Secretary of Education provide \noversight and assist states in the development of rigorous and \nmeasurable goals and standards regarding the use of technology to raise \nstudent academic achievement, and to develop evaluations of the impact \nof technology on student academic achievement.\n  Additionally, one of the allowable uses under state activities in the \nnew Title II, Part D is the development of enhanced performance \nmeasurement systems to determine the effectiveness of education \ntechnology programs funded under this subpart, especially their impact \non increasing the ability of teachers to teach and enable students to \nmeet state academic content standards. We intend that states and school \ndistricts develop measurable annual goals and standards to integrate \nand use advanced technology to improve student achievement, and expect \nthat this option be exercised wherever possible by applicants and \nstrongly encouraged by the Department of Education.\n  Title II, Part D--Enhancing Education Through Technology requires \nthat state plans and local applications allocate 25 percent of the \nfunds to be reserved for high quality professional training for \nteachers, principals, librarians and administrators to assist them in \nintegrating the technology and core curriculum. This mirrors the intent \nof the Three R's Title II, Part A--Teacher and Principal Quality and \nProfessional Development, which calls for teachers to receive high \nquality professional development and to be trained in the areas that \nthey teach, and specifically the Three R's Title VI, section 6006 which \ncalls for high quality professional development for teachers in the use \nof technology and its integration with student performance standards.\n\n  Regarding Title II, Part A--Teacher and Principal Training and \nRecruiting Fund, the Three R's proposal called for a radical \nrestructuring of Federal programs serving limited English proficient, \nor LEP, students. This restructuring streamlined the existing \ncompetitive Bilingual Education Act programs and significantly \nincreased and concentrated federal investment for LEP students into one \nformula program for districts while, in return, demanding results from \nstates, school districts and schools for annual gains in English \nproficiency and academic achievement among non-native speaking \nchildren. Title III of this new Act embodies much of the restructuring \nand policy goals proposed in the Three R's, and creates a new, major \nfederal initiative aimed at ensuring LEP and immigrant children have \nthe English language skills and academic knowledge to successfully \nparticipate in American society. This conference report will, for the \nfirst time, hold recipients of federal funds accountable for annually \nincreasing the percentage of LEP children achieving English proficiency \nas well as high levels of learning in all core subjects, and nearly \ndoubles the amount of federal funding provided to states and localities \nfor the education of LEP and immigrant students.\n  The Three R's bill, in Title III, section 3001, recognized that \neducating limited English proficient students is an urgent and \nincreasing need for many local educational agencies. It found that over \nthe past two decades, the number of LEP children in schools in the \nUnited States has doubled to more than 3,000,000, and will continue to \nincrease. One of the key goals of the Three R's bill in Title III, \nsection 3003, was to ensure that students with limited English \nproficiency learn English and achieve high levels of learning on core \nacademic subjects, including reading and math. Title III of this \nconference report also has the goal of assisting all LEP students to \nattain English proficiency, so that those students can meet the same \nchallenging state content standards and challenging state student \nperformance standards as all students are expected to meet.\n  Title III, section 3001, of the Three R's noted that each year \n640,000 limited English proficient students are not served by any sort \nof program targeted to their unique needs. The title increased the \namount of Federal assistance to school districts serving such students \nand streamlined the existing competitive Bilingual Education Act \nprograms into a single performance-based formula grant for state and \nlocal educational agencies to help LEP students become proficient in \nEnglish. Title III of this new Act also consolidates the Bilingual \nEducation Act, as well as the Emergency Immigrant Education Program, \nand authorizes $750 million for one formula program to states and \nschool districts once federal appropriations levels reach $650 million. \nThe intention behind this language to recognize that a substantial \nlevel of federal resources are essential in order to provide funding to \ndistricts that is meaningful. It further ensures that resources are not \ndiluted.\n  The Three R's focused resources to those most in need and allocated \nfunds to states based on the number of LEP students, and required \nstates to send 95 percent of the funds received to school districts so \nthat they may better assist such students. Similarly, the conference \nreport provides funding in Title\n\n[[Page S13411]]\n\nIII (Part A, subpart 1) to states via a formula based 80 percent on the \nnumber of LEP children in the state and 20 percent on the number of \nimmigrant children. Additionally the conference report calls for 95 \npercent of the funds to be used for grants to eligible entities at the \nlocal level. Districts shall receive funds based on their number of LEP \nstudents. However, to ensure that funds are not diluted, the Act \nrequires that states shall not make an award to districts if the amount \nof grant would be less than $10,000.\n\n  Under the Three R's Title III, section 3109, states were required to \nestablish standards and annual measurable benchmarks for English \nlanguage development that are aligned with state content and student \nacademic achievement standards; develop high quality annual assessments \nto measure English language proficiency, including proficiency in the \nfour recognized domains: speaking, reading, writing and comprehension; \ndevelop annual performance objectives based on the English language \ndevelopment standards set to increase the English proficiency of LEP \nstudents; describe how the state will hold districts or schools \naccountable for meeting English proficiency performance objectives, and \nfor meeting adequate yearly progress with respect to LEP students as \nrequired in Title I, section 1111; describe how districts will be given \nthe flexibility to teach English in the scientifically research based \nmanner that each district determines to be the most effective; and \ndescribe how the state will provide assistance to districts and \nschools. Section 3108 further required states to certify that all \nteachers in any language instruction program for LEP student were \nfluent in English to help ensure that students in language instruction \nprograms are taught by the most qualified educators.\n  We intend that these requirements will ensure that states emphasize \nlanguage proficiency that ensures a comprehensive understanding of the \nEnglish language so that students have the oral, writing, listening and \ncomprehension skills necessary to successfully achieve high-levels of \nlearning in our schools and later in the American workforce.\n  In turn, under sections 3106 and 3107, school districts were required \nto describe how they would use funds to meet the annual English \nproficiency performance objectives and how the district would hold \nschools accountable for meeting the performance objectives. Under Title \nVII, section 7101, states that failed to meet their performance \nobjectives after three consecutive years would have 50 percent of their \nstate administrative funding withheld. And, states that failed to meet \nsuch performance objectives after four consecutive years would have 30 \npercent of their Title VI programmatic funds withheld.\n  Title III, section 3105 of the Three R's further required the \nSecretary of the U.S. Department of Education to provide assistance to \nstates and districts in the development of English language standards \nand English language proficiency assessments. The intent is that the \nDepartment provide support to ensure high quality plans, performance \nobjectives, and English language assessments.\n  The conference report, contains nearly the same accountability \nprovisions and requirements. Title III, section 3113, requires states \nto establish standards and objectives for raising the level of English \nproficiency that are derived from the four recognized domains of \nspeaking, listening, reading and writing, and that are aligned with \nachievement of the challenging state academic content and student \nacademic achievement standards in section 1111; to hold districts \naccountable for annually assessing English proficiency as required \nunder Title I, section 1111; and hold districts accountable for meeting \nannual measurable objectives, in section 3122, for annual increases in \nthe percentage of LEP students attaining proficiency in English, and \nfor making adequate yearly progress as required under Title I, section \n1111 while they are learning English.\n\n  Section 3122(b) requires states to identify school districts that \nhave failed to meet their annual measurable objectives for two \nconsecutive years and ensure that such districts develop an improvement \nplan to ensure that the district shall meet the objectives and \naddresses the factors that prevented the district from achieving such \nobjectives. For districts that fail to meet the annual objectives for \nfour years, states shall ensure that districts modify their language \ninstruction program; determine whether to terminate program funds to \nthe district; and replace educational personnel relevant to the \ndistrict's failure to make progress on the annual measurable \nobjectives.\n  States shall be held accountable for meeting the annual performance \nobjective for Title III under Title VI, section 6161 of this Act. The \nSecretary is required to, starting two years after implementation, \nannually review whether states have met annual measurable objectives \nestablished under Title III. If states have failed to meet such \nobjectives for two years, the Secretary may provide technical \nassistance to states that is rigorous and provides constructive \nfeedback to each failing state. In addition, the Secretary shall submit \nan annual report to the Congress listing the states that have failed to \nmeet the objectives under Title III.\n  Title III of the Three R's bill gave districts the flexibility to \ndetermine what method of instruction to implement. This conference \nreport also gives districts the flexibility to design English language \ninstruction programs that best meet the needs of their limited English \nproficient students. It further, as did the Three R's bill, eliminates \nthe requirement that 75 percent of funding be used to support programs \nusing a child's native language for instruction to give districts the \nflexibility they need to meet new proficiency goals.\n  One of the fundamental goals of the Three R's bill was to provide \nbetter information to parents about quality and progress of their \nchild's education. Title III (section 3110) of the Three R's bill \nrequired parental notification of each student's level of English \nproficiency, how it was assessed, the status of the student's academic \nachievement, and the programs that are available to meet the student's \neducational needs. Title III further required that states give parents \nthe option to remove their student from any language instruction \nprogram. States were required to provide parents with timely \ninformation, in manner and form understandable to the parents, about \nprograms under Title III and notice of opportunities to participate in \nregular meetings regarding programs developed.\n  Similarly, the conference report, under Title I (section 1112), \nrequires districts to provide parents notification of their child's \nplacement in a language instruction program, and give parents the right \nto choose among various programs if more than one type is offered, and \nhave the right to immediately remove their child from a language \ninstruction program. The Title further allows districts to develop \nparent and community outreach initiatives and training so that parents \nmay be more active in their child's education. As with the Three R's \nbill, the intent of the provision is to provide the maximum information \nabout performance and programs to parents, and the Department must take \nsteps to ensure this.\n  Title IV, Part A--Safe and Drug Free Schools of the Conference Report \nwas influenced by concepts in the Three R's bill. The Three R's bill \nsought to more directly focus resources and activities on the \nimprovement of academic achievement. This conference report progresses \nthat goal in the Title IV, Part A--Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, \nstressing activities that will foster a learning environment that \nsupports academic achievement. The conference report requires states to \ndescribe how they will fulfill this goal in their comprehensive plan \nand their application to the Secretary. Local applications must also \nassure that the activities will foster a safe and drug free learning \nenvironment that supports academic achievement. Additionally, following \nanother major intent of the Three R's bill (in both Titles VI and VII), \nincreased accountability and evaluation is called for in Title IV Part \nA in the conference report. The activities shall be based on an \nassessment of objective data and assessment of need. Established \nperformance measures will be used and the programs will be periodically \nevaluated to assess their progress based on the attainment of these \nperformance measures. National\n\n[[Page S13412]]\n\nreports are required every two years by the Secretary and reports by \nstates and school districts are required on an annual basis. The Three \nR's bill in Title II, Part A and Title VI, Sec. 6006, highlighted \nincreased professional training for teachers, principals, and other \nstaff related to academic content as well as dealing with disruptive \nstudents and those exhibiting distress. Similarly, the conference \nreport contains greater awareness and support for training activities.\n  On academic achievement, the purposes of Title IV Part A--Safe and \nDrug Free Schools in the conference report are to support programs \nthat: prevent violence in and around schools; prevent the illegal use \nof alcohol, tobacco and drugs; involve parents and communities; and \nthat are coordinated with related federal, state, school and community \nefforts and resources. Under the conference report, a school district \ncan use funds to develop, implement and evaluate comprehensive programs \nand activities which are coordinated with other school and community-\nbased services and programs that foster a safe and drug-free learning \nenvironment that supports academic achievement. The overall goal of the \nprograms in the conference report's Title IV Part A is to foster a safe \nand drug-free learning environment which supports academic achievement. \nThis embodies similar principles in the Three R's bill in Title VI, \nsections 6001 and 6006 and the general intent of the Three R's bill in \nfocusing all activities on the improvement of academic achievement for \nall children.\n  Related to accountability and evaluations, Title VI of the Three R's \nbill emphasizes that programs should be evaluated to determine if they \nare effective in achieving the goals of improving safe learning \nenvironments. The conference report allows up to $2 million for the \nSecretary to conduct a national impact evaluation for the ``Safe and \nDrug Free'' programs under Title V Part A. National reports are \nrequired every two years by the Secretary and state and school district \nreports are required on an annual basis. The conference report also \nrequires states to implement a Uniform Management Information and \nReporting System that would include information and statistics on \ntruancy rates; the frequency, seriousness, and incidence of violence \nand drug related offenses resulting in suspensions and expulsion in \nelementary and secondary schools in states; the types of curricula, \nprograms and services provided, the incidence and prevalence, age of \nonset, perception of health risk and perception of social disapproval \nof drug use and violence by youth in schools and communities. Title V \npart A of the conference report also requires that state and school \ndistrict applications must contain a needs assessment for drug and \nviolence prevention programs which is based on objective data and the \nresults of on-going state and local evaluation activities. They shall \nalso provide a statement of the performance measures for drug and \nviolence prevention programs that will be used in evaluations. Under \nthe conference report, programs in this Title will be periodically \nevaluated to assess their progress based on performance measures. The \nresults shall be used to refine, improve and strengthen the program and \nto refine the performance measures. Such evaluations shall be made \navailable to the public on request. These provisions follow the intent \nof the Three R's bill to increase accountability and evaluation in all \nmajor activities with the understanding that education reforms cannot \nbe achieved without continual, thorough evaluations of their \neffectiveness and making such evaluations available to parents and the \npublic. The Department shall act to ensure that quality evaluations are \nimplemented.\n\n  The Principles of Effectiveness Activities part of the new act \nrequires that activities shall be based upon an assessment of objective \ndata regarding the incidence of violence and illegal drug use in the \nelementary and secondary schools, and communities to be served, \nincluding an objective analysis of the current conditions and \nconsequences regarding violence and illegal drug use, delinquency and \nserious discipline problems. In addition, activities shall be based on \nestablished performance measures aimed at ensuring that the elementary \nand secondary schools and communities to be served by the program have \na drug-free, safe and orderly learning environment; be based upon \nscientifically based research that provides evidence that the program \nto be used will reduce violence and illegal drug use; be based on an \nanalysis of data reasonably available at the time of the prevalence of \nrisk factors and include meaningful and ongoing consultation with \nparents. It is our intent that the Department act to ensure a high \nquality assessment effort fully consistent with the requirements.\n  Regarding streamlining and targeting, the Three R's bill consolidated \na number of national competitive grant programs--such as in Title VI--\ninto state and school district formula programs to drive more resources \nto school districts and to concentrate resources in the poorest areas. \nThe Safe and Drug Free Schools Program in Title V Part A of the \nconference report, utilizes a formula that is nearly the same as that \nestablished under the Three R's bill, with positive improvements. Title \nV, Part A distributes funds to states through a formula that is based \n50 percent on school age population and 50 percent on Title I \nConcentration Grants, which requires districts to have at least a 15 \npercent poverty level, or 6,500 low income students. Eighty percent of \nthe funds received by the state shall be distributed to school \ndistricts via a formula distribution that is the same as that contained \nin the Three R's bill, with 60 percent based on poverty in Title I, \nPart A, subpart 2, and 40 percent on school enrollment.\n\n  The Act further allows states to reserve, not more than 20 percent of \nthe total amount received for competitive grants to school districts \nand community-based organizations, and other entities for activities \nthat complement and support district safety activities. Such activities \nshall especially provide assistance to areas that serve large numbers \nof low-income children, or rural communities. This provision further \ntargets funds to areas of need and the Department is expected to adopt \nguidelines for the flexible program effort that assure quality and \ncreativity.\n  On professional training, Title II, Part A of the Three R's bill also \ncalled for increased professional training for teachers, principals and \nother personnel, with the goal of providing them with more expertise to \ncreate safer environments and to deal with disruptive students, as well \nas obtain greater ability to help students reach academic achievement \ngoals. Specifically, Title VI, section 6006 of the Three R's allowed \nlocalities to use funds to provide professional development programs \nthat provide instruction on how best to discipline children in the \nclassroom, how to teach character education; and provide training for \nteachers, principals, mental health professionals, and guidance \ncounselors in order to better assist and identify students exhibiting \ndistress, such as exhibiting distress through substance abuse, \ndisruptive behavior, and suicidal behavior. With the similar goal of \nhaving trained personnel work with children, Title VI, Part A of the \nconference report allows for drug and violence prevention professional \ndevelopment and community training. It further, under National Programs \nunder Title V Part A, provides for the development and demonstration of \ninnovative strategies for the training of school personnel, parents and \nmembers of the community for drug and violence prevention activities.\n  Title IV, Part B--21st Century Community Learning Centers of the \nconference report contains a similar focus to that of the Three R's \nbill. A major intent of the Three R's bill was to ensure that all ESEA \nprograms, more directly focus on the academic performance of students \nand that accountability for these programs be strongly linked to \nincreased performance toward that goal. Specifically, Title VI Sec. \n6006. of the Three R's bill required localities to spend 25 percent of \nthe funds they received, under a new major federal program that was \nfocused on spurring academic achievement through innovation, on \nproviding high quality, academically-focused after school opportunities \nto students.\n  This conference report furthers that principle by making improved \nacademic achievement a primary element of the modified 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers program. Title\n\n[[Page S13413]]\n\nIV, Part B also enhances the aim of greater accountability as set forth \nin the Three R's--Title VI Sec. 6005 and Title VII, Part A. The \nlegislation provides significantly increased funding for entities \nproviding students with opportunities for continued academic enrichment \nbefore and after school, and during the summer. Such opportunities are \nintended to help students, particularly students who attend low-\nperforming schools, meet state student performance standards in core \nacademic subjects. And, building on the focus of the Three R's bill to \ndemand greater results in return for greater investment, the conference \nreport calls for the 21st Century activities to be evaluated and \nmonitored for their effectiveness, and requires states to consider \nthose results and apply a series of fiscal sanctions if performance \ndoes not meet performance goals. Additionally, the Act carries forth \nthe intent of the Three R's bill to target the funds to those most in \nneed. Title IV, Part B of the conference report distributes funds to \nthe states based on their share of Title I, Part A and requires states \nto give priority for competitive grants to recipients serving low-\nincome communities and schools.\n\n  The purpose of 21st Century programs in Title IV, Part B of the \nconference report is to provide opportunities to communities to \nestablish or expand activities before and after school that: provide \nacademic enrichment, including providing tutorial services to help \nstudents, particularly students who attend low-performing schools, to \nmeet state and local student performance standards in core academic \nsubjects; offer students a wide array of additional services and \nactivities such as art, music, and recreation, technology education, \ncharacter education, and counseling programs that reinforce and \ncomplement the regular academic program; offer families of students \nopportunities for literacy and related educational development. These \nprograms should be designed and approved consistent with the intent of \nthe Three R's bill in Title VI Section 6006 that provided funds to \nSchool districts and schools for innovative programs and activities \nthat transform schools into ``21st Century Opportunities'' for students \nby creating a challenging learning environment and facilitating \nacademic enrichment through innovative academic programs or provide for \nextra learning time opportunities for students. The intent of the Three \nR's bill to focus before and after school programs on learning \nopportunities, especially for those most in need, is mirrored in the \nintent and purpose of the conference report's 21st Century program.\n  Regarding streamlining and targeting, the Three R's bill, in several \ntitles including Title I, had the intent of targeting the education \nfunds to the poorest communities and schools who are most in need. \nFollowing this direction, 21st Century funds under the conference \nreport in Title IV Part B are allocated to the states based 100 percent \non Title I, part A subpart 2, thereby targeting these funds on a \npoverty basis. Additionally, the conference report in Title IV Part B \nrequires states to focus competitively awarded grants on applicants \nthat seek to serve students who primarily attend schools eligible for \nschoolwide programs in Title I, those schools with at least 40 percent \nlow income students, and other schools with a high percentage of low \nincome students;\n  Regarding accountability and evaluation, the Three R's bill in Title \nVI Section 6007 and 6008 called for evaluating the impact of 21st \nCentury Opportunity programs on academic achievement. Title IV Part B \nof the conference report follows this intent, by requiring states to \nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of their 21st Century \nprogram and activities and requires that state applications describe \nhow the state will evaluate the effectiveness of their 21st Century \nprograms and activities.\n  Title V, Part B of the conference report contains major influences \nfrom the Three R's bill. A primary policy goal of the Three R's bill \nwas to provide additional innovation and effective voluntary public \nschool choice options for children and parents with the belief that \nmarket forces and choice integrated into the public framework will \nresult in a stronger system for students with greater incentives for \nschools to raise academic performance. Title V, Part B of the \nconference report follows this same intent and develops many of the \nsame programs.\n  Building directly on many of the proposals contained in the Three R's \nbill, the conference report would strengthen the Federal commitment to \nexpanding the range of educational options available to all students \nwithin the public school framework. Although the conference report \nmakes only minor changes to the current charter schools start up \nprogram, designated as subpart 1, does contain a new initiative to help \ncharter schools deal with the cost of operations and facility \nfinancing, section 5205(b), as well as a new initiative to encourage \nbroader choice programs at the local level, subpart 3. These provisions \nare based on language from the Three R's bill--Title IV, Part C--as \nwell as an amendment--S. AMDT. 518--to the Senate bill, S.1, which \nSenators Carper, Gregg and I cosponsored that would encourage and \nexpand intra-district wide or inter-district wide public school choice \nprograms as well as help to provide additional options for financing \ncharter schools. In addition, the conference report includes a program \nthat has been funded under appropriations, but never authorized that \nprovides critical funding for charter school construction under subpart \n2.\n  Titles I and VI of the Three R's bill called for increased funding to \nhelp finance charter schools, provide them with technical assistance, \nevaluate the programs, and disseminate information on innovative \napproaches, all with the purpose of helping expand the educational \nchoices available in the public system to parents and students. I have \nbeen a long time advocate for charter schools and was the chief \nDemocratic sponsor of the Public School Redefinition Act of 1991, S. \n1606, and in 1993, S. 429, which provided states with funding to \nestablish charter school.\n  I am pleased that this conference report will continue this strong \nfederal support for the expansion of the charter school movement, while \nensuring that those schools meet the same high accountability standards \nexpected of all schools under Title I, Part A. It was the intent of \nconferees that charter schools shall meet the accountability \nrequirements in this Act, including those provisions in section 1111 \nand 1116, but that the mechanism for holding them accountable should be \nconsistent with state law. In most cases, this means that the \nrecognized chartering authority would be responsible for holding \ncharter schools accountable. It is my belief that chartering \nauthorities that fail to carry out their responsibilities in holding \ncharter schools accountable should themselves be held accountable based \non State law.\n  The conference report also ensures that charter schools receive their \nfull allotment of Title I funds by stipulating that a local educational \nagency, in passing through subgrant awards to charter schools, may not \ndeduct funds for administrative fees unless the applicant enters \nvoluntarily into a mutually agreed upon arrangement for administrative \nservices with the relevant school district. I advocated for this \nagreement in conference because of the importance of giving charter \nschools fuller decision-making authority over the funds to which they \nare entitled.\n\n  In addition, the conference report will help further the range of \npublic education options available by creating a new ``Voluntary Public \nSchool Choice'' demonstration program under Title IV, Part B, subpart \n3. This program authorizes the Secretary to award grants on a \ncompetitive basis for the development of universal public school choice \nprograms. The program evolved out of the Three R's bill and an \namendment sponsored by Senator Carper to S. 1. It is the intent of this \nprogram that the Secretary give priority to applicant providing the \nwidest choice and that have the potential of allowing students from \nlow-performing schools to attend high performing schools. I believe \nthat demonstrations that provide inter-district, or state wide choice \nshould be of highest priority. In addition, I am pleased that the \nprogram calls for an evaluation of the success of these demonstrations \nin promoting educational equity and excellence, and the effect of the \nprograms on academic achievement of students\n\n[[Page S13414]]\n\nparticipating and on the overall quality of participating schools and \ndistricts.\n  I believe that the language under section 1116 of Title I, granting \nparents the option to transfer their student out of a school identified \nfor improvement or corrective action to a higher performing public \nschool, will be meaningless unless the federal government actively \nsupports and encourages programs such as the Charter School Programs \nand the Voluntary Public School Choice programs under Title V to expand \nthe creation of new alternative public education opportunities.\n  That is why I also am pleased that the agreement contains the Per \nPupil Facility Financing and Credit Enhancement Initiatives, which will \nhelp charter schools facing financial burdens due to their lack of \nbonding or tax raising capabilities. As a result of their inability to \nraise resources, charter schools must spend more of their resources on \noperating costs, and fewer dollars on educational needs, such as hiring \nqualified teachers. To ensure that charter schools better spend their \nown resources on academic activities, and to address the special \nfinancial problems faced by charters, Title V, Part B, section 5205(b) \ndirects the Secretary to make competitive awards to states as seed \nmoney for the development of innovative programs providing annual \nfinancing to charters schools on a per pupil basis for operating \nexpenses, facility acquisition, leasing payments, and renovation. The \nlanguage authorizes $300 million for Part B, but designates $200 \nmillion for subpart 1, Charter School Programs, other than 5205(b), and \nthe next $100 million in funding for the purpose of meeting the Per \nPupil Facility Financing provisions in section 5205(b). Once funding \nlevels for Part B, subpart 1 reaches $300 million, any new funding \nabove that level will be equally split between 5205(b) and subpart 1, \nthe charter start up program.\n  To provide clearer understanding of this funding arrangement, I \nproposed, along with Senator Gregg, the following report language:\n\n       Charter schools are public schools, yet lack the bonding \n     and taxing authority traditionally available to school \n     districts to finance their facilities. As a result, charter \n     schools are forced to use operating revenues that are \n     intended to be spent in the classroom to pay rent or to \n     make debt payments for facilities. States have the primary \n     obligation to address this inequity. But, to stimulate \n     state incentives, this conference report authorizes a \n     limited-term federal role in encouraging states to \n     establish or expand per pupil facilities aid programs.\n       Conferees support significant funding increases for the \n     charter school program in order to free up resources, as \n     quickly as possible, for the per-pupil financing program, a \n     program that assists charter school in meeting their \n     operating needs, so that charter school resources may be \n     better spent on academic activities.\n\n  Title V, Part B, Subpart 2 of this conference report includes \nlanguage from an amendment, S. Amdt. 518, to the Senate bill, S. 1, \nwhich Senators Carper, Gregg, and I cosponsored to provide funding for \na competitive program awarded by the Secretary to entities that develop \ninnovative credit enhancement initiatives that assist charter schools \nwith the costs of acquiring, constructing and renovating facilities. \nThis language was included in the Appropriations agreement for FY 01, \nbut was never authorized under the ESEA. The program is authorized at \n$150 million, and will provide critical funding for charter schools for \nrenovations and repairs of facilities.\n  It is my belief that these provisions, combined with the strong \npublic reporting requirements under section 1111 of Title I, will \nensure that parents have tools and the options available to make real \neducational choices.\n  Title VI.--Flexibility and Accountability of the conference report \ncontained a number of similar concepts as the Three R's bill. The Three \nR's plan established a clear accountability contract for Federal \nassistance: the federal government would provide far more resources and \nmore flexibility than ever before to states and localities, and in \nexchange, states would be held accountable for measurable results. The \nbill significantly streamlined a wide range of Federal programs into a \nlimited number of priority areas, especially under Titles II, III and \nVI, reduced the strings attached to those funds, and gave states and \nlocal districts broad latitude to focus those funds on their most \npressing needs.\n  The conference report embraces the goal of greater flexibility and \nputs it into practice, so that local educators can best utilize federal \nresources to meet their specific challenges and do what is necessary to \nimprove academic achievement. The conference report is not as \nstreamlined as the Three R's plan. But it does consolidate a number of \nlarge and small programs, especially under Titles II and III, and \nprovides States and local districts with additional flexibility to \ntransfer funds from different accounts to target local priorities. It \nalso creates two pilot programs to give States and local districts \nbroad discretion to merge and consolidate federal funding.\n  Regarding Three R's consolidation and transferability, Title VI--High \nPerformance and Quality Education Initiatives of the Three R's \nconsolidated several Federal programs (21st Century Community Learning \nCenters, Technology programs, Innovative Programs block grant, and the \nSafe and Drug Free Schools program) into one formula program to States \nand local districts for the purpose of: (1) providing supplementary \nassistance for ``School Improvement'' to schools and districts that \nhave been, or are at risk of being, identified as being in need of \nimprovement under section 1116 of Title I; (2) providing assistance to \nlocal districts and schools for innovative programs and activities that \ntransform schools into ``21st Century Opportunities for students'' by \ncreating challenging learning environments and providing extra learning \ntime; (3) providing assistance to districts, schools and communities to \nstrengthen existing activities or develop and implement new programs \nthat create ``Safe Learning Environments''; and (4) creating ``New \nEconomy Technology Schools'' by providing assistance for high quality \nprofessional development, educational technology infrastructure, \ntechnology training for teachers, and technology-enhanced curricula and \ninstructional materials aligned with State content and student \nperformance standards. Districts were required to spend 30, 25, 15 and \n30 percent of funds, respectively, on the four areas.\n\n  Section 6005 required districts to ensure that programs and \nactivities conducted were aligned with State content and student \nperformance standards under section 1111; to establish annual \nmeasurable performance goals and objectives for each program; and to \nestablish measures to assess progress by schools in meeting established \nobjectives as well as holding schools accountable for meeting the \nobjectives. Districts were required to annually publish and widely \ndisseminate to the public a report describing the use of funds in the \nfour purpose areas; the outcomes of local programs as well as an \nassessment of their effectiveness; the districts progress toward \nattaining its goals and objectives; and the extent to which such \nfunding uses increased student achievement.\n  Based on the premise that districts that are achieving academic goals \nshould have greater flexibility in deciding how to spend Federal \nresources, the Three R's allowed districts that were meeting adequate \nyearly progress--AYP--established by the State under section 1111, to \ntransfer up to 30 percent of their program funds among the four purpose \ncategories. Districts that were exceeding AYP would be allowed to \ntransfer up to 50 percent of their funds across the four purpose \ncategories.\n  If districts, however, failed to make AYP for two consecutive years, \nthey would only be allowed to transfer 25 percent of program funds from \nthree categories, and only into the School Improvement category. In \naddition, the State would have the authority to direct how remaining \nTitle VI funds would be spent in the district. Districts that were \nunder corrective action (as described in section 1116 of Title I) would \nlose all decision-making capacity over the use of Title VI funds and \nStates would determine how funds would be spent. The bill called for a \nsimilar accountability structure between local districts and schools.\n  Regarding the conference report transferability and flexibility, \nalthough the conference report does not call for the same level of \nstreamlining as called for under the Three R's, the Act does provide \nStates and districts with flexibility similar to that established under \nthe Three R's. Title VI,\n\n[[Page S13415]]\n\nSection 6123, allows States to transfer up to 50 percent of their State \nadministrative and activity funds among the following Federal programs: \nPart A of Title II--Teacher and Principal Quality, Part D of Title II--\nTechnology, Part A of Title IV--Safe and Drug Free Schools, Part B of \nTitle IV--21st Century Community Learning Centers and Part A of Title \nV--Innovative Programs, Block Grants.\n\n  In addition, just as the Three R's linked the degree of flexibility \nallowed to the attainment of adequate yearly progress under section \n1111 of Title I, school districts that are making AYP may transfer up \nto 50 percent of the following Federal program funds: Part A of Title \nII--Teacher and Principal Quality, Part D of Title II--Technology, Part \nA of Title IV--Safe and Drug Free Schools, and Part A of Title V--\nInnovative Programs, Block Grants. School districts that have been \nidentified under section 1116 as being in need of improvement may only \ntransfer 30 percent of the program funds, but shall only transfer funds \ninto their set aside under section 1003 for turning around low-\nperforming schools and into section 1116 activities. States and \ndistricts may transfer funds into Title I, but no funds may be \ntransferred out of Title I. School districts in corrective action may \nnot transfer any funds.\n  In addition, the conference report creates two pilot programs for \nstates and districts to further expand opportunities for greater \nflexibility. Subpart 3 of Title VI gives the Secretary authority to \naward ``State Flexibility Demonstrations'' to up to seven states, and \nallows them to consolidate their state activity and administration \nfunds under the following Federal programs: Part A of Title II, Part D \nof Title II, Part A of Title IV, Part A of Title V, and section 1004 of \nTitle I. To be eligible, states must also have four to 10 local \ndistricts within the state that agree to participate and that will also \nconsolidate similar funds and align them to the State Flexibility \nDemonstration. At least half of these local districts must be high \npoverty. Selected states would receive maximum flexibility in spending \nconsolidated funds on any educational purpose authorized under the Act. \nStates that failed to make AYP for two years would have their \ndemonstration terminated.\n  States participating a demonstration must still meet all the \naccountability requirements from any of the programs from which funds \nare consolidated, including meeting the requirement in section 1119 in \nTitle I and Title II that all teachers be highly qualified by the end \nof the 2005-2006 school year. The Act creates a similar demonstration \nprogram for localities. 150 districts (70 of which much come from the \nseven State Flexibility Demonstration States) may apply for a local \nflexibility demonstration from the Secretary; however, there shall only \nbe three districts participating in any State (except for the State \nFlexibility Demonstration States). These local districts would be \nallowed to consolidate funds from Part A of Title II, Part D of Title \nII, Part A of Title IV, and Part A of Title V. Participating districts \nwould be given maximum flexibility over the use of funds for any \neducational purpose under this Act. School districts that failed to \nmake AYP for two years would have their demonstration terminated.\n  Regarding state accountability, in return for substantial federal \ninvestment and flexibility over the use of funds, the Three R's \ndemanded that States be held accountable for greater academic \nachievement for all students. Title VII of the bill required that \nStates that failed to make adequate yearly progress under section 1111, \nor its established annual measurable performance objectives under \ntitles II and III be sanctioned. Specifically, it required that, in the \ncase of a state that failed to meet such goals for three years, the \nSecretary withhold 50 percent of that state's administrative funds from \nthe relevant title. In the case of a state that failed to meet such \ngoals for four years, the Secretary was required to withhold 30 percent \nof the state's funds under Title VI.\n\n  Three R's was based on the premise that states, in addition to school \ndistricts and schools, should be held accountable for the attainment \nAYP, and other state-wide goals and objectives established in Titles II \nand III. It recognized that in the history of the ESEA, no Secretary \nhas imposed fiscal sanctions on States for failure, and so required \nthat the Federal government impose tough sanctions on states that \nrepeatedly fail to meet their own goals.\n  This Act does not contain the same degree of state-level \naccountability as envisioned under the Three R's bill, but does call \nfor meaningful initial steps to hold States accountable for progress, \nand lays a solid foundation for stronger measures in the future. \nSpecifically, under section 6161 of Title VI, it requires the Secretary \nof the U.S. Department of Education to, starting two years after \nimplementation, annually review whether states have met their adequate \nyearly progress--AYP--established under section 1111 and the annual \nmeasurable objectives established under Title III. The Secretary must \nprovide technical assistance to states that fail to meet AYP for two \nyears, and may provide technical assistance to states, where any \ndistrict receiving funds under Title III fails to meet the annual \nobjectives established in such title. In addition, technical assistance \nmust be valid, reliable, rigorous, and provide constructive feedback to \neach failing state. In order to ensure full public knowledge of a \nstate's failure to meet its goals, the Secretary shall submit an annual \nreport to the Congress containing a list of states that have failed to \nmeet AYP; the teacher quality reporting requirements under section \n1119; and a list of states that have failed to meet the annual English \nproficiency and academic achievement objectives for limited English \nproficient students under Title III.\n  In order to clarify the intent behind this language, Conferees agreed \nto conference report language that makes it clear that Congress expects \nstates identified by the Secretary to develop and implement improvement \nstrategies that address the factors that led to failure and that will \nensure the state meets AYP under Title I and its English proficiency \nobjectives under Title III. I believe that this process will enable the \nSecretary to better follow the progress of states and take steps to \nhelp ensure that State meet their own established goals.\n  In addition, the conference report states:\n\n       Conferees stress that a fundamental purpose of Title I as \n     established under this Act is to hold States, local \n     educational agencies, and schools accountable for improving \n     the academic achievement of all students, and for identifying \n     and turning around low-performing schools. As a result, \n     Conferees expect States to meet their definition of adequate \n     yearly progress to the same degree as local school districts \n     and schools. The Conferees further urge Congress and the \n     Secretary to thoroughly examine the data collected from the \n     State assessment systems and factor such information into \n     future discussions on accountability measures for States, \n     which should include consideration of the use of fiscal \n     sanctions to hold those States that continually fail to \n     meet their definition of adequate yearly progress and fail \n     to improve the academic achievement of all students \n     accountable.\n\n  Although I believe that more improvements could be made to better \nhold State accountable for academic progress, I do believe that the \nconference report contains strong requirements under sections 1111 and \n1116 of Title I, Part A of Title II, and subpart 2 of Part A of Title \nIII, to hold districts and schools accountable for meeting the goals of \nthis Act. Such provisions take a new approach to accountability by \nrequiring districts and/or schools to meet annual goals, make \nimprovements after initial failure, and eventually imposing tough \npenalties on those that continually fail to improve.\n  Furthermore, the reporting requirements for state and district report \ncards in section 1111, and annual reports by States to the Secretary, \nin section 1111, annual reports by the Secretary to Congress, in \nsection 1111 and section 6161, and the information provided under the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress as outlined in section \n6302, will provide an uncomparable wealth of information on academic \nachievement for parents, communities and the public. This unprecedented \nstream of annual information, combined with the substantial increase in \npublic school choice provided to parents in Title I, section 1116, and \nTitle V--Part B, under the Charter Schools Programs and the Voluntary \nPublic School Choice Programs, will provide an infusion of the market \nforces of transparency, accessibility,\n\n[[Page S13416]]\n\nand competition into our nation's public school system. This dynamic \nwill create for some of the greatest accountability that can exist--\naccountability by parents.\n  Regarding the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the \nconference report builds on the basic concept in the Three R's bill to \nprovide parents and communities with greater awareness of the \nperformance of schools as compared to other schools in a local school \ndistrict, and as compared to other schools in the State. This \nconference report expands that aim by requiring in section 6302 of Part \nC of Title VI that States participate biennially in the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress--NAEP--of fourth and eighth grade \nreading and mathematics. States shall not be penalized based on their \nperformance on the NAEP, but it is the intent that public knowledge of \nstate performance will help drive states to develop more rigorous \ncontent and student academic achievement standards and assessments.\n  Mr. President, I want to end by briefly thanking my fellow Conference \nmembers and their staff for their hard work on this historic conference \nreport, particularly Elizabeth Fay with Senator Bayh, Danica Petroshius \nwith Senator Kennedy, Denzel McGuire with Senator Gregg, Sally Lovejoy \nwith Representative Boehner, Charles Barone with Representative Miller, \nas well as all the Conference Committee staff. And, I would like to \ngive a special thanks to Sandy Kress of the White House for all of his \nefforts in this process, and to Will Marshall and Andy Rotherham of the \nProgressive Policy Institute as well as Amy Wilkins of the Education \nTrust for their policy expertise. Finally, I want to thank my own staff \nfor their hard work, particularly Michele Stockwell, Dan Gerstein, and \nJennifer Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to my friend from Iowa, the champion \nfor the disabled, the leader in our full funding for IDEA. He has also \nbeen a leader in terms of school construction. On so many of these \nissues, we have profited from his intervention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his kind words and \nI thank him for his leadership. There is no doubt we need to make \neducation the top priority in this Nation. No one in the entire \ncountry, let alone this Congress, has made this more of a top priority \nover all of the years we have been working on this issue than the \nchairman of our committee, Senator Kennedy. I commend him and I commend \nSenator Gregg for their leadership and for working to bring this bill \nto fruition.\n  There is a lot in this bill. We know kids are behind in science. We \nknow it has been level in the fourth and eighth grades, but we know by \nthe time they get to the twelfth grade they fall way behind. There is \nno doubt in my mind we need to make schools accountable and we need to \nmake teachers and principals accountable. In order to do that we have \nto have the resources for it, and that is why I commend my friend, the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, who has fought so hard and so \neloquently to keep pointing out time and time again we cannot demand \naccountability unless we include resources. I am hopeful, having passed \nthis bill, that the Bush administration will follow through with \nsupport for the appropriations process.\n  I happen to chair the appropriations subcommittee that funds \neducation. Now that we have the bill and we have the authorization, the \nnext step is to get the appropriations.\n  I await the Bush budget next year. I want to see the budget President \nBush is going to send down and I want to see if he is going to put the \nmoney behind the rhetoric and leave no child behind. That is really \ngoing to be the true test next year, the budget the President sends \ndown.\n  Lastly, I want to thank all of the Senators who have worked so hard \nto try to get full funding for special education, to get it on the \nmandatory side, to get it off the plate where we are pitting kids with \ndisabilities against other kids in our schools, to just get rid of that \nonce and for all and make special education a mandatory funding item.\n  We had that in our bill. It was supported in the Senate by both \nRepublicans and Democrats, and in conference, I might add. It was only \nbecause of the intransigence of the administration, in holding the \nRepublicans on the House side, that we did not get full funding and we \ndid not get mandatory funding for special education. One of the biggest \nlosses in this bill is that we did not get mandatory full funding for \nspecial education because now we are going to be right back in that \nsame rut again, with kids with special needs in schools fighting with \ntheir parents saying why should they get all this money, what about our \nkids in schools? And you are going to have continued problems until we \nstep to the plate and we provide that 40 percent of funding we promised \n26 years ago.\n  Lastly, I thank the chairman and Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg \nfor including two provisions which I think are extremely important. One \nis the elementary and secondary school counseling program. I believe a \nlot of this violence is because kids are not getting good counseling. I \nthank them for keeping it in.\n  The second is the effort and equity formula for title I. It is \nimportant that States put in more money and equalize their funding so \nour poor kids get the money they need in the schools.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for keeping those two \nprovisions in the final bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to our friend from Michigan, Senator \nStabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Gregg for their leadership and the tremendous amount of \nmanhours to bring this legislation to this point. I thank all my \ncolleagues deeply involved in this issue.\n  It is said that knowledge is power. We know that our country's \neconomic engine is fueled by a skilled workforce. It is critical we \nfocus on education. I know the main goal of the compromise bill is to \nnarrow, over a 12-year period, the educational achievement gap between \nthe poor, disadvantaged students and their more affluent peers, and \nbetween minority and nonminority students. Wide achievement gaps \nbetween these groups have been tolerated for decades at great personal \nand social cost.\n  We need to constantly repeat the fact that accountability is not just \na test. It is parents, teachers, administrators, communities, and, yes, \nit is resources. I appreciate the fact there are additional resources \ndesignated in this bill.\n  However, while I intend to support this legislation, I am deeply \ndisturbed and disappointed that we are not taking the opportunity to \nfinally fulfill a 25-year promise regarding special education in this \ncountry. Fully funding IDEA is something whose time is past due. While \nit is not in this legislation, I am very concerned that we continue the \nfight so next year IDEA is reauthorized and we finally get it done.\n  As I talk to schools in Michigan, they tell me there would have been \nan additional $460 million available to children in Michigan this year \nif we had just kept our promise.\n  Congratulations to all involved. We have more work to do and I look \nforward to working together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Florida who took a \nspecial interest in bringing greater targeting of funds to be used more \neffectively and also for further evaluation of the students to consider \nsome of the challenges they are facing in their ability to learn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Kennedy for the leadership he has given \nover many years which has brought us to this point today.\n  I am very supportive of this legislation and will vote for it with \nenthusiasm. I do point out there are some areas where I think further \naction will be required. As we began this debate, there was an \nassumption, maybe a tacit assumption, that there was a common set of \nreasons for school failures. That tacit assumption was reinforced by \nthe suggestion that for every\n\n[[Page S13417]]\n\nschool failure there would be a one-size-fits-all prescription. That \nwas school vouchers. The Senate and the conferees have wisely not \nadopted this approach.\n  However, there still remains the issue of an intelligent process to \ndetermine why schools fail. The reality is, anyone who has spent time \nin a variety of schools, as I know our Presiding Officer and I have had \nthe opportunity to do, there are a variety of reasons why a school \nmight be considered failing. Some of the reasons have to do with what \nis happening inside the school. Some of those reasons have to do with \nthe neighborhood, the environment, the circumstances from which the \nstudents come and which adverse circumstances they bring to the \nschools.\n  For instance, it might be that an absence of effective health care \ncauses students to come to school with a limited ability to learn. It \nmay be because of nutritional restrictions. It may be because there are \nnot sufficient activities in the communities to support what is \nhappening inside the school. This legislation recognizes that and \nprovides for a diagnostic process in which, when a school is identified \nlargely based on the testing process, there will be a determination \nmade as to what the reasons were for that specific school failing to \neducate its students.\n  This will put new responsibilities on a variety of institutions. It \nwill put responsibilities on the community to provide resources through \nthings such as public health services as well as nongovernmental \nagencies such as the United Way, YMCA, and the Boys and Girls Club, and \non the Federal Government to bring to bear its agencies, particularly \nthe Health and Human Services, to provide assistance in dealing with \nthose out of the classroom reasons why schools are failing.\n  Again, I commend the conferees for their good work. I point out that \nthis is an important chapter, but we have more chapters yet to be \nwritten. They will require the cooperation of all groups I have \nreferred to in order to see we comprehensively deal and provide the \nappropriate description to why that specific school is failing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When I think of teacher recruitment, principal \nrecruitment, rebuilding schools, or full funding, I think of the \nSenator from New York. I yield to the Senator from New York for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank our chairman for his \nextraordinary work. I also appreciate the leadership of our ranking \nmember and indeed the entire committee that has worked so hard for \nnearly a year and has finished the work in a conference that has \nresulted in a bill which will in many respects increase the \nopportunities that our students will have for achieving the kind of \neducational levels for which every child deserves to strive.\n  We know this bill is far from perfect. However, we do know we have \nmade a step forward. I appreciate greatly the targeting of title I \nfunding, particularly for the highest need school districts in the \nState of New York. We will receive a 25-percent increase in title I \nfunds and a 40-percent increase in teacher quality funds. For our \nneediest communities, that means a dramatic improvement in the \nresources available to focus their attention on those children for whom \nthis bill is intended.\n  I share the disappointment of many of my colleagues that we were not \nable to bring about the full funding of special education. That is the \nNo. 1 issue in New York that I hear about, whether I am in an urban, \nrural, or suburban district. I pledge to work with my colleagues in a \nbipartisan manner and to work with the administration so that next year \nwhen we reauthorize IDEA, we also fully fund it and make good on a \npromise that we gave to the American people more than 25 years ago.\n  I also appreciate the kind words of the chairman about teacher and \nprincipal recruitment, which was one of my highest priorities. If we do \nnot attract and keep quality teachers in our classroom, everything that \nis in this bill will not amount to very much. We have to be sure we get \nthe teachers and principals we need.\n  I am glad we have taken this step forward. I hope my colleagues will \ncontinue to support education for every child.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Gregg, we will try to do this again.\n  First of all, I thank my colleagues for their fine work. Second, it \nis a little frustrating for me. There are many provisions in this bill \nthat I had a chance to work on and to write. I am proud of it. But I \nhave to say to the Senator and especially my conservative friends that \nthis is a stunning unfunded mandate. You are taking the essence of \ngrassroots political culture and school districts and telling every \nschool district and every school to test every child in grades 3, 4, 5, \n6, and 7--not just title I but every child in every school.\n\n  I have heard discussions about national priorities. This bill now \nmakes education a national priority. But the only thing we have done is \nhave a Federal mandate that every child will be tested every year, but \nwe don't have a Federal mandate that every child will have the same \nopportunity to do well in these tests. If they do not do well, they \nwill need additional help.\n  Colleagues, just because there is money for the administration of the \ntests doesn't mean this isn't one gigantic unfunded mandate.\n  Look at this in the context of recession, hard times, and the \ncutbacks in State budgets and cutbacks in education. Look at this in \nthe context of our now adding a whole new requirement and telling every \ndistrict they have to test, having high stakes and holding the schools \naccountable.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire said: Senator Wellstone, you are \ntalking about the IDEA program, but that is not really ESEA, and that \nis separate from title I.\n  That is not what I hear in Minnesota.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for championing this cause. What I hear at the \nlocal level is if we had given Minnesota the $2 billion they would have \ngotten if we made it mandatory on a glidepath for full funding over the \nnext 10 years, and $45 million this year, I was told we would put 50 \npercent of it into children with special needs. But then we could have \nadditional dollars for other programs. Right now, the Federal \nGovernment has not lived up to its promise. We are now taking our own \nmoney that we could be using for afterschool, for technology, for \ntextbooks, for teacher recruitment, and we have to spend that money; \nwhereas, we would have that additional money available if you would \njust provide the funding for IDEA. You can't separate funding for IDEA \nfrom any of the other educational programs.\n  This is not just about the children who have a constitutional right \nto have the best education. That is Senator Harkin's, and it is his \nsoul. He has made that happen.\n  This is also about all the other children and support for educational \nprograms at the local level. Title I money has gone up. But in the \ncontext of economic hard times and all the additional families and \nchildren who are becoming barely eligible, I will tell you something. I \nknow that some Senators do not like to hear this. We are in profound \ndisagreement on this.\n  I think in our States we are going to hear from school board members \nand teachers, and we are going to hear from the educational community. \nThey are going to say to us: What did you do to us? You gave us the \ntests, and then you gave us hardly anything that you said you would \ngive us when it came to IDEA. You didn't provide the resources. You \nmade this a giant unfunded mandate. You say you are going to hold our \nschools accountable, but by the same token, you haven't been \naccountable because you have not lived up to your promise.\n  They are right. I think there is going to be a real negative reaction \nfrom a lot of States. In my State of Minnesota, we have hard economic \ntimes. We are cutting back on education. We are laying off teachers.\n\n  I have two children who teach in our public schools. I have been to a \nschool about every 2 weeks for the last 11 years. I believe I know this \nissue well. We are seeing all of these cutbacks. Minnesota is going to \nsay: Why didn't you live up to your promise? You have given the tests \nand all this rhetoric about how it is a national priority, and I don't \nbelieve the Bush administration is going to make this a commitment next \nyear. I do not know that you do.\n\n[[Page S13418]]\n\n  Frankly, they now have this education bill. This was our leverage, \nwhich was to say we can't realize this goal of leaving no child \nbehind--not on a tin cup budget--not unless you make this commitment. \nAnd there will be no education reform bill because it can't be reformed \nunless we live up to our commitment of providing the resources. And we \nhave not.\n  I was in a school yesterday--the Phalen Lake School. I loved being \nthere. It is on the east side of St. Paul. I don't think one of the \nstudents comes from a family with an income of over $15,000, or maybe \n$10,000 a year. It is just a rainbow of children with all kinds of \nculture and history. They are low-income children in the inner city.\n  Do you know why I went. They raised money to help the children in \nAfghanistan. The President asked them to do so. They are all beautiful. \nI loved being there. But do you want to know something. I know what \nthose children need because there are teachers who tell me what they \nneed. They need the resources for more good teachers and to retain \nthose teachers. They need to come to kindergarten ready to learn \nwithout being so far behind.\n  Where is our commitment to affordable child care? We have $2 trillion \nin tax cuts, and $35 billion or $40 billion in the energy bill as tax \ncuts for producers. Where is the commitment to developmental child care \nfrom this Congress?\n  I know what they need. They need more afterschool programs. They need \na lot more title I money--not just 33 percent or 34 percent of these \nchildren but many more children, and more help for reading and smaller \nclass size. They need all of that. We could have provided them a lot \nmore, and we didn't.\n  I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I again thank Senator Kennedy and all the \nmembers of our staffs. I went over that in some length, and I \nspecifically thanked our staff yesterday. I want to renew my thanks for \ntheir efforts. It has been extraordinary.\n  I also thank other members of the committee who worked with me from \nboth sides of the aisle, and also the White House for its assistance.\n  I think it is important to note as we go into the final moments of \nthis debate that we would not have gotten to this point unless we had \nthe President, who understood how to lead on an issue of national \nimportance.\n  The fact is that President Bush understands almost in a visceral \nsense--it totally absorbs him and his wife--that children are being \nleft behind because our educational system is not working, and that we \nneed fundamental reform of that system in order to try to improve it.\n  He came into office and was willing to lay out a very clear path for \nus as a Congress and as a Government to follow in trying to assist in \nthe Federal role in elementary and secondary education. Because he was \nwilling to lay out that path, we were able to pass a bill which takes \nmajor strides down the road to try to improve education in this \ncountry.\n  We all understand this is neither the end nor the beginning of the \nissue. We all understand that the Federal role in education is the tail \nof the dog.\n  We also understand, however, that the Federal role in education is \nnot working, that we had 35 years of effort, that we had spent $130 \nbillion, and that we still have low-income children falling further and \nfurther behind and that something has to be done to try to address \nthat. He has readjusted the whole approach. He has set up a program \nwhich is, No. 1, child-centered rather than bureaucracy-centered; that \nempowers parents and gives parents, especially of low-income children, \nan opportunity to do something when their children are locked into \nfailing schools, gives them choices; gives the local communities much \nmore flexibility over the dollars they are going to get from the \nFederal Government. But in exchange for that flexibility, we are going \nto expect academic achievement, and we are going to have accountability \nstandards that show us whether or not the academic achievement is being \nobtained.\n  In the end, what we are doing with this bill essentially is creating \nopportunities for local school districts, States, and especially \nparents to take advantage of using their Federal dollars in a more \neffective way to educate the low-income child, and hopefully have that \nchild be competitive with his or her peers.\n  In the end, we also understand that it will be the responsibility of \nthe parents, of the schoolteacher, of the principal, and of the school \nsystem that is locally based to make the tough decisions and do the \nwork that is necessary to produce the results and have the children \ncompete.\n  At least that is the Federal role. We are now setting up a framework \nwhich will greatly assist parents, schools, and teachers in \naccomplishing that goal of making the low-income child competitive in \nAmerica so they can participate in the American dream.\n  I especially want to thank the chairman of the committee for his \nefforts and for his courtesy during the markup of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes of the leader's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have had a very good discussion and \ndebate today and yesterday. I expect we will have an overwhelming vote \nin support of the conference report by Senators from all different \nparts of the country who have varying views on educational issues. We \nrecognize this is an important step forward.\n  I want to acknowledge, as I have on other occasions, the strong \nleadership of President Bush. This was a unique undertaking on his \npart. I can remember, as I am sure the Senator from New Hampshire can, \nbeing in this Chamber 2\\1/2\\ years ago when we had 3 weeks of debate in \nthe Chamber and were unable to come to any kind of common position. We \nwere facing the fact that the program that reaches out to the neediest \nof children was effectively going to be awash at sea.\n  That has changed. The President deserves great credit for that. \nCredit also goes to the able chairman of our conference, Congressman \nBoehner, our leader over in the House on education issues. There are \nmany who contributed to this conference report, but George Miller \nbrings a special commitment to education, as does my friend and \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg.\n  The reason this issue is so important is that it affects every family \nin this country; it is one that goes back to the earliest times of our \nNation. Our Founding Fathers understood the importance of educating the \nwhole of the public. It isn't just an accident that the first public \nschools were developed in this country. It was a really fundamental \ncommitment that all the children were going to be educated. Virtually \nall the constitutions of our States are committed to the States \nensuring a quality education for all the children of this Nation. That \nhas not always been the case.\n  We have seen the great social movements that have taken place in this \nNation. We understand the strong drive of parents for a quality \neducation. It was at the heart of the women's movement. It was not only \nthe right to vote, but the women's movement understood that young \nladies, young girls ought to be able to receive a quality education. It \ntook a long time, and now it would be unthinkable if we said we were \ngoing to educate everyone but women in our society.\n  Then it became the principal civil rights issue in the 1950s. Long \nbefore Dr. King and others spoke about civil rights, the principal \ncivil rights issue was, were minorities going to be able to gain an \neducation by opening up the doors of education? It became the principal \ncivil rights issue.\n  We can understand why we have seen the progress we have made for the \ndisabled in recent times. We have heard the statements by the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the Senator from Nebraska, and the Senator from Vermont \nabout trying to assure a quality education for those students, which \nreally follows a national concern and commitment that has been part of \nour tradition. We have\n\n[[Page S13419]]\n\nnot always reached that commitment. But I think, when history examines \nwhere we have been and where we are going, those who have followed this \nissue will believe this is a historic piece of legislation and one that \ndeserves the support of all of the Members of this body.\n\n  The legislation before us today is a blueprint for progress in all of \nthe Nation's schools. It proclaims that every child matters--every \nchild, in every school, in every community in this country. That is why \nthis legislation is so important. School improvement and school reform \nare not optional; they are mandatory for us to achieve if we are going \nto meet our responsibilities to the next generation. When we fail our \nstudents, we fail our country. We cannot expect the next generation of \nAmericans to carry the banner of progress and opportunity if they are \nnot well prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.\n  This is a defining issue about the future of our Nation and about the \nfuture of democracy, the future of liberty, and the future of the \nUnited States in leading the free world. No piece of legislation will \nhave a greater impact or influence on that.\n  In conclusion, what are we really trying to do? Now that we have put \nthis issue into some kind of framework, we are assuring American \nfamilies this is what this legislation is really all about: Greater \nopportunity for all of our students to achieve high standards. Extra \nhelp will be there for students in need. We are committed to high-\nquality teachers. We are committed to extra help in mastering the \nbasics. We are committed to reducing the dropout rate. We are committed \nto providing guidance counselors. We are committed to assist young \nchildren who need mental health counseling. We are committed as well to \nthe advanced placement in foreign language, American history, civics, \neconomics, the arts, physical education, and the gifted and talented, \nand character education.\n  We have the pathways to American excellence. We are saying to \nfamilies: If your child is doing well, with this legislation your child \nwill do even better; if your child is failing in the public schools, \nwith this legislation they will get the help they need.\n  This is the challenge for the schools: Reform in our American \nschools, having high standards, high expectations. We are going to \ninsist on teacher training and mentoring, high-quality teachers in \nevery classroom, smaller class size, early reading support, violence \nand drug prevention programs, more classroom technology, afterschool \nopportunities, high-quality bilingual instruction, new books for school \nlibraries, and greater parental involvement.\n  This is the third and the important final dimension. This is the \npower we are going to be giving parents in States and local schools all \nacross this country so that they will know what the achievement is for \nall the students, not only their own but the other children who are in \nthe classes, including children with disabilities and those with \nlimited English proficiency, and minority and poor children. They will \nbe able to find out what their graduation rates are, what the quality \nis of the teachers in those classrooms in high-poverty and low-poverty \nschools, and the percentage of highly qualified teachers.\n  This is our commitment. We are challenging the children in this \nNation. We are challenging the schools in this Nation. And we are \nchallenging the parents in this Nation. As has been pointed out in the \ncourse of the debate, finally, we are going to challenge ourselves. Are \nwe in this Congress going to make this kind of an opportunity realized \nfor all children in America, not just a third, but for all children to \nmove along? That is a battle that is going to be fought on this Senate \nfloor day in and day out over the years in the future. Are we going to \nexpect that the States are going to meet their responsibilities in \nfulfilling this kind of a promise?\n  Those are the kinds of challenges we welcome. But we are giving the \nassurance to the American families that help is on its way.\n  This legislation deserves our support. I hope we will have an \noverwhelming vote on its adoption.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of this vote, the staff be entitled to be make technical \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, soon we will vote on passing H.R. 1--the \nBetter Education for Students and Teachers, BEST, Act. As everyone \nknows, President Bush campaigned last year with a promise to do all \nthat he could in the realm of education so that we as a nation would \n``Leave No Child Behind.''\n  The Republican majorities in the Senate and the House responded to \nthe President's focus on comprehensive education reform by putting it \nat the top of the agenda in both chambers. The first bills introduced \nin both the Senate and the House--S. 1 and H.R. 1--were both named the \nBetter Education for Students and Teachers Act. It is the conference \nreport to that legislation that we are about to vote on, pass, and send \nto the President for him to sign into law as he promised.\n  President Bush recognizes that with almost 70 percent of our fourth \ngraders who are unable to read at even a basic level, our children were \nand are at risk of being unable to compete in an increasingly complex \njob market. We all recognize that the ability to read the English \nlanguage with fluency and comprehension is essential if individuals, \nold and young, are to reach their full potential in any field of \nendeavor. As the saying goes: Reading Is Fundamental. And again, as \nPresident Bush has said, none of our children should be left behind \nbecause they can't read.\n  In reforming education, Republicans have always sought to maximize \nlocal control and flexibility over both education policy and federal \nfunding while requiring schools to be accountable for the ultimate \nperformance of their students. School accountability means schools must \nrespect the rights of parents to know about their child's performance \nas well as the quality of a child's instructors and learning \nenvironment.\n  That is why the most significant change under the new law is that \nparents are empowered with new options. For the first time, parents \nwhose children are trapped in failing public schools will be able to \ndemand that a local school district give them a portion of the money \navailable for their child under the Title I Disadvantaged Children \nprogram--approximately $500 to $1,000--so the parents can use it to get \ntheir child outside private tutorial support. Such tutorial support can \ncome from public institutions, private providers or faith-based \neducators. Groups such as the Sylvan Learning Center, Catholic schools, \nthe Boys & Girls Club, and a variety of other agencies will be able to \nhelp these children come up to speed in the areas of math and English. \nThis provision has the potential to fundamentally impact the way low-\nincome children are educated in America.\n  Not only will parents have the right to demand money for tutorial \nassistance for their children, but whenever their children are trapped \nin failing public schools they will also be able to demand that their \nchild be able to attend another public school which is not failing--and \nto have their child's transportation costs to the new school paid for \nby the local school district. This ensures parents are able to access \nbetter performing schools for their children.\n\n  So, while the bill does not allow parents to access private schools \nas some have proposed, it does allow a parent to get their child out of \na failing public school and move them to a public school where they can \nget adequate education. The effect of this strong public school choice \nprovision will be to put pressure on those public schools within a \nmajor school system that are failing to improve or find itself without \nany students. But fundamentally, this provision gives parents a viable \noption for giving their child a chance to succeed not just in school, \nbut in life.\n  Groups of concerned parents and educators will also have enhanced \nrights under the BEST Act. The bill creates a major new expansion of \nself-governing Charter Schools. Charter Schools enable parents, \neducators, and interested community leaders to create schools\n\n[[Page S13420]]\n\noutside the normal bureaucratic structure of moribund educational \nestablishments and much of the red tape contained in local, state, and \nfederal regulations. This legislation will significantly expand the \nopportunity for parents, foundations, and other groups to create \nCharter Schools and help them succeed without interference from \neducation bureaucrats and politicians who are hostile to Charter \nSchools.\n  One of our primary goals in this bill as Republicans was to give \nstates and local communities significantly more flexibility over the \nmanagement of Federal dollars they receive, and to pared down the \namount of red tape that comes with the Federal dollars. While not as \nstrong as we would have liked, there are a series of initiatives in \nthis bill that offer significant help in this regard.\n  State and local governments, and local school districts, will be able \nto move up to 50 percent of their non-title I funds from one account to \nanother without Federal approval. This means funding for teacher \nquality, technology innovation programs, safe and drug-free schools, \nand other programs would all be open to movement of Federal funds from \naccount to account depending on where a State or local community, and \nnot Washington, DC, feels that it can get the most benefit from the \ndollars.\n  In addition, 150 school districts--at least three per State--would be \nable to apply for waivers from virtually all Federal education rules \nand requirements associated with a variety of ESEA programs, in \nexchange for agreeing to obtain higher than required levels of \nachievement for their low-income students. This provision gives local \ncommunities dramatic new flexibility in running their schools.\n  Seven whole States, if they volunteer, may participate in a \ndemonstration program which would allow Federal funds--other than title \nI funds--to be used by the State for any educational activity \nauthorized by H.R. 1. Therefore, States would have greater control over \nsuch funds as the innovative block grant program, State administration \ncomponent of title I, State administration/State activities components \nof title I, Part B and other Federal funds.\n  Another significant accomplishment of this bill is the streamlining \nand consolidation of the number of Federal education programs, which \noften led to confusion and duplication of efforts. Under current law \nthere are 55 Federal education programs for elementary and secondary \nschools. This bill makes a down payment on further consolidation by \nreducing the total number of programs to 45, despite creating several \nnew programs in the bill. This consolidation, although not as dramatic \nas one would like, is a significant improvement.\n  The bill also includes reforms to improve teacher quality and \ntraining. It includes the Teacher Empowerment Act which takes numerous \nexisting professional development programs for Teachers and the current \nClass Size Program and merges them into one flexible program which \nallows local districts to use the funds as they see best for the \npurposes of hiring teachers, improving teacher professional \ndevelopment, or providing merit pay or other innovative ways to reward \nand retain high quality teachers.\n  The bill continues the initiative in current law called the Troops to \nTeachers program that encourages retired members of the Armed Services \nto become teachers. The bill also directs that 95 percent of the \nFederal funds targeted for teacher quality go directly to local school \ndistricts. And while the bill provides funds to be used for the \nrecruitment of hiring qualified teachers, it explicitly prohibits funds \nfrom being used to plan, develop, implement or administer any mandatory \nnational teacher or professional test or certification. In other words, \nFederal funds cannot be used to create a national teacher certification \nsystem.\n  Teachers are also given legal protection under the Teacher Liability \nAct contained within the bill which will shield teachers, principals \nand other school professionals from frivolous lawsuits. It is a major \npiece of lawsuit reform that will help ensure that teachers and other \nschool professionals have the ability to maintain discipline, order, \nand a proper learning environment in the classroom without having to \nfear losing their home or their life savings.\n  H.R. 1, the BEST Act, also reorganizes bilingual education \ninitiatives so that the emphasis is now on teaching English rather than \nseparating children who do not speak English and putting them into an \natmosphere where they never actually learn English. It also gives the \nparents of bilingual children the right to demand information about the \nclasses and instructional programs their children are placed in. Most \nimportantly, they are given the right to object to their children's \nplacement or classes to ensure that their children do not end up being \nlocked in a limited-English situation. This is one of the bill's most \nsignificant achievements as it involves much needed reforms to a \nprogram critical to the success of students with limited English \nproficiency. It provides accountability to a program which has been \nmisdirected for too long.\n  The final major accomplishment of H.R. 1 is that it imposes stringent \naccountability standards on schools and their performance with the goal \nof assuring that low income students are learning at a level that is \nequal to their peers. In accomplishing this goal, the bill specifically \nprohibits federally sponsored national testing or Federal control over \ncurriculum. It sets up a series of tests to ensure that any national \ntest, such as NAEP, which is used for evaluation purposes is fair and \nobjective, and does not test or evaluate a child's views, opinions, or \nbeliefs.\n\n  The bill also includes a trigger mechanism so that State based \ntesting requirements are paid for by the Federal Government, not states \nor local school districts, thus avoiding an unfunded mandate.\n  Finally, the bill contains several provisions which are important to \nensure that Federal funds are used appropriately and objectively \nwithout bias. The bill denies Federal funds to any school district that \nprevents or otherwise denies participation in constitutionally-\nprotected voluntary school prayer. Funding is also denied any public \nschool or educational agency that discriminates against or denies equal \naccess to any group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America. It \nrequires that the Nation's Armed Forces recruiters have the same access \nto high school students as college recruiters and job recruiters have. \nSchools will also be required to transfer student disciplinary records \nfrom local school districts to a student's new private or public school \nso discipline and safety issues are fully appreciated and anticipated \nby administrators, teachers, parents, and, of course, new classmates at \ntheir new school.\n  President Bush's agenda for education reform as embodied in this bill \nserves as a framework for common action, encouraging all of us, \nDemocrat, Republican, and Independent, to work in concert to strengthen \nour elementary and secondary schools to, as the President says, ``build \nthe mind and character of every child, from every background, in every \npart of America.''\n  Madam President, I do want to say, since we are about to begin the \nvote, how much I appreciate the outstanding leadership and work that \nhas been done by Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy. Without their \nindomitable spirit, it would not have happened. We are indebted to \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it has been said that free schools \npreserve us as a free Nation. I believe that this education bill will \nstrengthen our schools, and strengthen our Nation long into the future.\n  Much has happened since we began work on this bill to update Federal \nelementary and secondary education programs.\n  We were well on our way to reaching a bipartisan consensus on this \nbill last spring when control of this institution changed.\n  That unprecedented shift could have thrown this effort into the limbo \nof partisan gridlock. But we continued to move forward and in June, we \npassed a strong, bipartisan bill.\n  Then came the terrible events of September 11 and, a month after \nthat, the anthrax attacks.\n  Even as we focused on urgent national security concerns, from \nstrengthening airline security to making sure our military has what it \nneeds to dismantle the terrorists' networks, members of the education \nconference\n\n[[Page S13421]]\n\ncommittee continued to work together and iron out differences between \nthe Senate and House versions of this bill.\n  No one deserves more credit for getting this bill done this year than \nTed Kennedy, a man who has spent the last 40 years of his life working \nto make sure that every child in America has the opportunity to go to a \ngood public school.\n  I want to commend Chairman Kennedy, and all the members of the \nconference committee who worked long and hard on this bill, and kept \ntheir eyes on the prize, even during the turmoil of the last three \nmonths.\n  President Bush also deserves credit for helping to put education \nfirst, and convincing the doubters in his party that the Federal \nGovernment must be a partner in the effort to strengthen America's \npublic schools for all children.\n  The last time we authorized the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, there were those in the President's party who advocated abolishing \nthe Federal role in education. Instead, President Bush came to us with \na serious proposal and a serious commitment to make progress for our \nchildren.\n  He built his proposal around the principle that all children must be \ngiven the chance to succeed in school. He agreed that we must have high \nstandards for success in every classroom in every school in every \ncommunity.\n\n  He recognized that reading is, indeed, the foundation of all \nlearning. Without reading, the job manuals and newspapers stay closed, \nthe Internet is a dark screen, the world of discovery is worlds away, \nand the promise of America is, simply a closed book.\n  He said we have to measure results, so parents and communities can \nknow what is working, and what isn't.\n  We were pleased that the President was willing to support several \nmeasures Democrats have long advocated.\n  This new law sets high standards for all teachers. It also provides \ncommunities with help, if they need it, to recruit, hire and train new \nteachers so that every classroom can be led by a qualified, effective \nteacher.\n  Under this law, low-performing schools will get the help they need to \nturn around, and face consequences if they fail.\n  Immigrant and bilingual children who need extra help to succeed in \nschool and learn English will get that help.\n  And communities that require help meeting the needs of their most \ndisadvantaged students will get it.\n  I am pleased that the conferees stripped provisions that many of us \nthought would ultimately be damaging to public schools. The bill does \nnot allow limited Federal resources to be siphoned off to private \nschools through ill-advised voucher schemes. It also does not give \nStates blank checks with no accountability, as had been proposed by \nsupporters of the Straight As block grant program.\n  I am disappointed, however, that this bill does not provide full \nfunding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. \nSenator Jeffords is right: we made a commitment more than 25 years ago \nto provide 40 percent of the cost of this program; so far, we have \nfailed in that commitment. We need to do better.\n  Though we finish this bill today, the work of improving our \nchildren's schools does not end. This bill lays out a blueprint for \nreform. But we know that real reform cannot occur without real \nresources.\n  Our schools face real challenges: the generation now passing through \nour schools has surpassed the Baby Boom in size, and school enrollments \nare expected to rise for the next decade; a large part of the teaching \ncorps is getting ready to retire. Schools will have to hire more than 2 \nmillion new teachers over the next decade; diversity in the classroom \nis increasing, bringing new languages, cultures, and challenges; \ntechnology is revolutionizing the workplace and our society as a whole. \nSchools must keep up with the pace of change, by helping students gain \nimportant skills in technology, and by taking advantage of \ntechnological capabilities to advance learning for all children.\n  The first test of whether we are serious about meeting those \nchallenges and keeping the commitments this bill makes will occur this \nweek, when we take up the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  The details of that bill are still being finalized, but we expect it \nwill provide communities with an additional $4 billion to meet their \nnew responsibilities under these programs. We must make sure that money \nis there not only next year, but every year.\n  This bill meets many of our greatest education challenges in word. I \nhope that this and future Congresses will ensure the resources are \nthere to meet them in deed.\n  That is the only way that we can strengthen our schools and move our \nNation closer to becoming a land of opportunity for every child.\n  It is with the understanding that we still have work ahead of us, I \ngive this bill my strong support, and I urge my colleagues to do so as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, actually, I think I have said what I \nwanted to say. I feel as though I was speaking for a lot of people in \nMinnesota and around the country.\n  My colleagues, I have figures I will leave everyone in terms of our \nnational commitment.\n  In 1979, close to 12 percent of the Federal budget was devoted to \neducation. It is now down to 7 percent.\n  If we just were where we were in 1979, 30 some years ago, we would be \nallocating an additional $21 billion to education today. I have heard \ncolleagues say that this is all about equal opportunity for every \nchild. There is nothing I believe in more. I know Senators can agree to \ndisagree.\n  If I had one vision, one hope, one dream that I cared more about for \nMinnesota and the country than any other, it would be that every child, \nstarting with the littlest of the children, regardless of color of \nskin, urban/rural, income, gender, every child would have the same \nchance to reach her or his full potential. That is the goodness of our \ncountry.\n  When I was in Phalen Lake school yesterday, that was the goodness of \nthat school, those teachers and what they were trying to do under \nincredibly difficult circumstances. I wish I could believe that this \nbill lived up to that promise. When I look at the resources, it \ndoesn't.\n  Make no mistake about it, a test every year doesn't give our schools \nthe resources to either recruit or to retain more teachers. A test \nevery year does not lead to smaller class size. It doesn't lead to \nbetter lab facilities. It doesn't lead to more reading help for \nchildren who need the help. It doesn't lead to better technology. It \ndoesn't lead to more books. It doesn't lead to making sure the children \nare prepared when they come to kindergarten. Many of them are so far \nbehind. It doesn't mean we will have afterschool programs. It doesn't \nmean any of that.\n  I am all for accountability. I am all for testing and accountability \nto see how the reform is doing. I am not for the argument that the \nactual testing represents the reform.\n  We have done one piece, the accountability.

We \nalways hear the speeches on the floor of the Senate extolling the \nvirtues of the people who really make the businesses of our country \ngrow; the place where all of the growth of the Nation exists--not in \nthe Fortune 500 companies but in the small businesses.\n  Many of those businesses simply need a small tide-over with access to \ncredit that they have been denied because of the downturn in the \neconomy.\n  If you talk about stimulus, helping small businesses at this point in \ntime is one of the most important ways we can invigorate our economy.\n  I hope and plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I \nhave yet to have the administration come to us and say, here is the way \nwe can improve your bill, or here is a change we really would like \nbesides gutting the bill altogether, or simply not spending any money \non small business.\n  In fact, by creating lending through the program that 63 of our \ncolleagues have joined as cosponsors, we would, in fact, be making loan \nguarantees. This is not direct lending. These are loan guarantees that \nwould be made at a less expensive rate than the disaster assistance \nloans currently being made. This is a way to get much more leverage for \nthe dollars we invest.\n\n[[Page S13424]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I see the \nminority assistant leader is here. I hope we can try to break through \non this small business bill this afternoon and find a way to reach some \nkind of compromise so those 63 colleagues could have their interests \nmet.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13424-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are moving into the \nseason of festivities. Hopefully, we will get an opportunity to \ncelebrate the holidays. Unfortunately, for many in my State of New \nHampshire and in other States across the country, this is a holiday \nseason filled with the anxiety that comes with knowing their water is \ncontaminated.\n  This contamination is caused by a Federal mandate that I believe is \nwrong. Another year has gone by and Congress has still done nothing to \nright that wrong.\n  Over the past few years, a good deal of the Nation has learned \nfirsthand of the damage that MTBE has done to our drinking water \nsupply. That certainly is true of many communities in New Hampshire \nwhere it has become a crisis where people cannot even drink their water \nor shower with it.\n  I have been fighting for the past 2 years to get the Senate to vote \non a bill that will solve this problem. I am pleased that last week the \nmajority leader made a commitment to me that the Senate would at least \nvote on this issue before the end of next February. I am grateful for \nthat. Until that day arrives, though, I plan to come to this Chamber on \na regular basis, while we are in session, to remind Senators of the \nterrible impact that MTBE is having on our Nation and on so many \nthousands of people and to remind them that it is very important that \nwe act now.\n  For the past 2 years, I have met with a number of small businesses \nand families across New Hampshire who have been devastated by this \nproblem. They cannot sell their homes. They cannot drink their water. \nThey cannot shower with water. They have filters in their basements to \nget the MTBE out of the water.\n  According to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, \nthere may be up to 40,000 private wells with MTBE contamination. Of \nthose, 8,000 may have MTBE contamination of above State health \nstandards.\n  This is a crisis. We have to deal with this. I know it is nice to say \nwe can make money by replacing MTBE with ethanol and all that. That is \nfine. Make all the money you want. But we need to get this issue \nresolved.\n  In many instances, the State has had to provide bottled water to my \nconstituents. They are installing and maintaining extremely expensive \ntreatment equipment. These costs are high. Particularly hard hit have \nbeen communities in the southern tier of my State: Arlington Lake in \nSalem, Frost Road in Derry, Green Hills Estates in Raymond, and so many \nmore. But I want to briefly tell you a story about one particular site \nin Richmond, NH. It is in the southwestern part of the State. It is a \nbeautiful area, and the type of beauty for which New Hampshire is so \nwell known.\n\n  In August, I visited the Four Corners Store and several surrounding \nhomes in the town of Richmond. It is called the Four Corners Store \nbecause it is at a rural crossroad, like so many in America, and takes \nup one of the four corners. Common sense is very pervasive in New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Stickles are the store's proprietors. When they \npurchased that country store a few years ago, they believed the MTBE \ncontamination problem had been solved. They do have new underground \nstorage tanks and are completely in compliance with the law.\n  Unfortunately, the MTBE plume from years ago still persists. A number \nof the nearby homes are having their wells polluted. It has \ncontaminated a number of homes near the Four Corners Store.\n  I met with the owners of the store and visited those homes. The \nGoulas and the Frampton families were kind enough to invite me into \ntheir homes. They showed me the treatment systems that had been \ninstalled by the State. They shared their concerns about their health \nand their children's health. At one of the homes lives a young couple \nwith small children.\n  First and foremost, they are worried about the long-term health \nimpacts on their children. They told me about the daily inconveniences \nof having to deal with this contamination in their wells. They were \ntold the water was safe for showers; however, showers should only be \nwith cold water, limited to 10 minutes, and well ventilated. That is \nwhat they were told. So take a cold shower and make sure it is well \nventilated.\n  It is outrageous that we would stand by and allow this to continue in \nour country while the debate rages about replacing the MTBE additive \nwith ethanol. Let's get real. We need to deal with this problem now. I \nintend to fight for these constituents throughout the rest of this \nsession and also early into next year until we get this legislation \npassed. It is not right. Sometimes you just have to speak out when \nthings are not right--that somebody should make a profit at the expense \nof somebody else getting sick and not being able to use their water.\n  Making a profit is wonderful. That is the American way. I am all for \nit. But we do not need a guaranteed MTBE market. We do not need a \nguaranteed ethanol market. We do not need a guaranteed anything.\n  Let the market play, but we have to be able to replace MTBE with \nsomething, and we cannot mandate that it be ethanol. It is not right \nfor those of you in ethanol States to make the people in my State have \nto suffer.\n  It seems to me the passage of this bill should be easy. I tried for \nweeks and months and years to reach an accommodation. I have debated \nevery Senator who deals with ethanol privately and publicly, behind the \nscenes and in committee, but we cannot seem to get agreement.\n  I urge my colleagues from all States to join with me to pass this \nlegislation now so we can get the MTBE out of the wells in New \nHampshire and many other wells and water supplies throughout the \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Hampshire has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13424-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13424-S13456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the order \nbefore the Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment No. 2608 \noffered by the Senator from Montana to the substitute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are on the farm bill and the pending business is an \namendment offered by the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns; is that \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S13425]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I want to take a little bit of time \nright now to once again respond to my friends on the other side of the \naisle and wonder why 1 week before Christmas, less than 2 weeks before \nthe end of this year, they continue to hold up the farm bill. We had \nanother cloture vote today in good faith, thinking that maybe over the \nweekend some minds might be changed; they might think secondly about \nstopping a farm bill that is so important to farmers in rural America. \nBut on the vote we just had a little bit ago, I believe, if I am not \nmistaken, we had three Republicans vote for cloture. I am sorry, four \nRepublicans voted for cloture. We picked up one.\n  I am told by my friend from Mississippi we had four all along.\n  Again, we see this stalling tactic, dragging out the farm bill. One \nof the press people outside just stopped me and said that a Senator on \nthe other side said the reason this bill has so much trouble is because \nit is such a partisan bill. I would like to point out again to my \nfriends and my farmers in Iowa and all over this country, this bill \ncame out of the Agriculture Committee, every single title, on a \nunanimous vote, Republicans and Democrats. You can't get much more \nbipartisanship than that. Quite frankly, I will submit this is the most \nbipartisan bill to come out of our committee since I have been serving \non it for the last 17 years in terms of support on both sides of the \naisle on the final bill that came out of committee.\n  Obviously, we disagreed on the commodities title, but that was still \nbipartisan. It was not unanimous, but it was still bipartisan.\n  To those who say this is some kind of a partisan bill, I say: Look \nout the window. It is daylight out there. It is not midnight. It is \ndaytime. Look at the bill for the facts of what happened when that bill \ncame from committee. This bill has very strong bipartisan support.\n  Again, there is a lot of politics now being played on this bill--a \nlot of politics being played. It is a shame. It is a shame that our \nfarmers and their families, farm families all over America, facing the \nuncertainty of what is going to happen next year, are being held \nhostage by certain political games that may be going on here. It is \njust a darn shame. It is about time that we bring this bill to a close. \nWe have the votes. We can have the debate, and we can have the votes. \nBut it is obvious that for whatever reason, people on the other side of \nthe aisle do not want this farm bill passed this year.\n  I have said before we could finish this farm bill. We could have \nfinished it today. If we had had cloture, we could have finished this \nthing today. This morning I talked on the phone to Chairman Combest \nfrom the other side. I said: If we finish this bill, can we go to \nconference?\n  He said: Sure, we will go to it right away.\n  So they are willing in a bipartisan way. The Republican leader of the \nAgriculture Committee on the House side said to me this morning: If you \npass the bill, we are ready to go to conference today, tonight, \ntomorrow and begin to work this thing out.\n\n  I am disappointed and saddened, not for me but for our farm families, \nespecially in my State of Iowa and all over this country, who are being \nheld hostage for whatever reason I can't discern.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Iowa will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I share the disappointment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa that we were not able to invoke cloture today for the second \ntime. My belief is that we have a couple of major amendments remaining \nto be offered. In fact, the authors of one of them are both in the \nChamber, Senators Roberts and Cochran. There is an alternative \namendment to the commodities title which I understand they will offer. \nI hope at some point to offer an amendment that does some targeting, \nand my hope is that we can make some progress and move ahead.\n  I still don't understand what the filibuster is about. My hope is \nthat if we have major issues, let's move ahead with the issues, offer \namendments, and have debates on the amendments.\n  It is the case, is it not, that Senators Roberts and Cochran simply \nhave a different idea with respect to how the commodity title ought to \nbe applied and so they are intending to offer an amendment? I ask the \nSenator from Iowa if he has some notion of when that amendment would \ncome; has he consulted with the authors of that major amendment? If so, \nwhat does that consultation disclose to us about when that amendment \nwould be offered?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry. I was conversing with a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. I missed the question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was asking the Senator from Iowa if he has been able to \nconsult with the authors of the other major amendment on the \ncommodities title about when that might be offered. My hope is we could \njust proceed with the amendments, dispose of the amendments, at which \npoint I hope we will reach the end of the consideration of this bill \nand be able to report out the bill.\n  Has the Senator consulted with the major authors of that amendment, \nand what might we expect from that consultation?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield without losing \nhis right to the floor, I will respond.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have indicated to the manager of the \nbill that we would be prepared to offer the amendment now and have a \ntime agreement on the Cochran-Roberts amendment. I have suggested 2 \nhours evenly divided so that both sides will have ample opportunity to \ntalk about the amendment. We have already talked about this amendment \nFriday morning. Senator Roberts and I were here to discuss the \namendment and talked about an hour and a half at that time.\n  That is what I would suggest we do, and that would get us moving \nalong. This would be a major alternative to the committee-passed bill, \nand we think that that would be one way to start moving toward final \ndisposition of this legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator from Iowa will yield further, might I say \nthat is a very hopeful sign. It is certainly up to the chairman of the \ncommittee to decide whether that time agreement is sufficient. \nCertainly, it sounds reasonable to me. After that, we would be able to \ndispose of one of the major amendments and move through the bill and \nperhaps late today or tomorrow we would be able to complete \nconsideration of the farm bill. That is the most hopeful sign I have \nheard for some long while.\n\n  As I indicated, the authors of this legislation have been deeply \ninvolved in farm legislation for many years. They just have a different \napproach on the commodities title. The best way to resolve that is to \nhave the discussion and vote and see where it comes out. I encourage \nthe Senator from Iowa to proceed along the lines suggested.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator, that is encouraging news. We will \nget to that. I see the Senator from Arizona is on the floor and has \noffered an amendment. I would like to ask him, if I could, without \nlosing my right to the floor for right now, is the Senator wishing to \ndebate the amendment that he laid down last week?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct, without losing your right to the floor. \nI will be glad to enter into a reasonable time agreement, including a \nhalf hour equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside; that the Senator from Arizona be recognized to \ndebate his amendment that is pending; that the time be limited to a \nhalf an hour evenly divided, at the end of which either a motion to \ntable or an up-or-down vote would be in order.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we just received a call from \none Senator, and we have to find out how much time that Senator wants \nto speak in opposition to this amendment. We could do that real \nquickly. We can't do it right now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator to yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would it be agreeable to start the debate? I will be glad \nto\n\n[[Page S13426]]\n\nagree to any time limit that is agreeable to the other side on this \namendment--5 minutes, half an hour, whatever is agreeable to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am willing, obviously, as the Senator knows, to enter \ninto this time agreement. We seem to have an objection over here. I see \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. There are Senators who have expressed interest in \nthis amendment and who wanted to speak. I will object to any time \nagreement until we are able to check with those Senators to see how \nmuch time they require.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Why don't we start debate on the McCain amendment, as \nthe Senator suggested? He will agree to any time agreement. It is just \na matter of how many people want to talk in opposition to it. And we \ncan get unanimous consent that following disposition of the McCain \namendment we proceed to consideration of the Cochran-Roberts amendment, \nwith 2 hours of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the problem is if we start the McCain \namendment and people start filibustering, we will have another \nfilibuster going here. The Senator from Arizona has been forthright.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, if it \nappears to be a filibuster, there is nothing I can do about that. We \nare going to move forward with the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Arizona is a gentleman. I appreciate \nthat. I wonder if we can then agree--I will yield the floor and the \nSenator from Arizona will be recognized. I will ask unanimous consent \nthat on the disposition of the McCain amendment, the Senator from \nMississippi be recognized to offer his amendment; that there be a time \nagreement on the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi, with 2 \nhours evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator repeat the \nrequest?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that when I yield the floor, the \nSenator from Arizona be recognized to speak on his amendment; that on \nthe disposition of the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, be recognized to offer his \namendment; that there be 2 hours for debate on the Cochran amendment, \nevenly divided, and at the end of that time, there be a vote on or in \nrelation to the Cochran amendment, without further amendment to the \nCochran amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I would not expect a \nsecond degree, but I think it would be important to see the amendment \nthat Senators Roberts and Cochran intend to file. I would not expect a \nsecond degree to be offered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I assume the amendment is the same as was filed on \nFriday; is that right?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes. In response to the Senator, the amendment is at the \ndesk, and it has been there. It is the one we discussed Friday. There \nwere no changes since that time, to my knowledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the McCain amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2603\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The McCain amendment No. 2603 is now the \npending question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is kind of an interesting situation \nthat we are facing. It is instructive of a lot of things that are \nhappening around here in the Senate and in the country. Even though it \nis only about catfish--the lowly catfish--it has a lot of implications. \nThere are implications for trade and our relations with Vietnam. It has \nimplications as to how we do business in the Senate. It has a lot of \ninteresting implications, including the rise of protectionism in the \nUnited States of America, how a certain special interest with enough \nlobbying money and enough special interest money and campaign \ncontributions can get most anything done.\n  During consideration of the Senate version of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002, it was late at night and I \nvoiced concern about the managers' decision to clear a package of 35 \namendments just before the final passage of the bill. I said: Has \nanyone seen these amendments? It was late in the evening. There was \ndead silence in the Senate. It was late in the evening so, \nunfortunately, I agreed for this so-called managers' amendment to be \npassed by voice vote, remembering that managers' amendments are \ntechnical in nature; they are to clean up paperwork or clerical errors.\n  Well, in this package of 35 amendments, 15 were earmarked to members \nof the Appropriations Committee--several million dollars. I have \nforgotten exactly how much. And this is a so-called catfish amendment. \nMy good friend from Mississippi will say the issue was discussed \nbefore. If it was, why didn't we have a vote on it? Why didn't we have \nthe amendment up and have a vote on it as we do regular amendments? The \nreason is because the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from \nTexas, I, and many others--and I believe we are going to find that a \nmajority of the Senate--would have rejected such a thing.\n  As it turns out, I had good reason to be concerned. Included was an \namendment banning the FDA from using any funds to process imports of \nfish or fish products labeled as catfish, unless the fish have a \ncertain Latin family name. In fact, of the 2,500 species of catfish on \nEarth, this amendment allows the FDA to process only a certain type \nraised in North America--specifically, those that grow in six Southern \nStates. The program's effect is to restrict all catfish imports into \nour country by requiring they be labeled as something other than \ncatfish, an underhanded way for catfish producers to shut out the \ncompetition. With a clever trick of Latin phraseology and without even \na ceremonial nod to the vast body of trade laws and practices we \nrigorously observe, this damaging amendment, slipped into the managers' \npackage and ultimately signed into law as part of an appropriations \nbill--an appropriations bill--literally bans Federal officials from \nprocessing any and all catfish imports labeled as they are--catfish.\n  It is going to be ludicrous around here and entertaining because we \nare going to talk about what is and what is not a catfish. Over there, \nwe may see one with an American flag on it, which would be an \ninteresting species. When is a catfish other than a catfish.\n  On this chart is a giant catfish with a name I can't pronounce. Here \nis a yellowtail catfish. I didn't do well in Latin. Here is another \none, a basa catfish--yes, the culprit. Here is the channel catfish. \nThey are all catfish. There are 2,500 of them. I don't have pictures of \nall of them. Now there is only going to be one recognized as a catfish \nin America, which are those which are raised in America--born and \nraised in America. These are interesting pictures. We will have a lot \nof pictures back and forth. I think we will see more pictures of \ncatfish than any time in the history of the Senate of the United States \nof America.\n  As you can see, these are common catfish characteristics: Single \ndorsal fin and adipose fin, strong spines in the dorsal and pectoral \nfins, whisker-like sensory barbels on the upper and lower jaws, all \npart of the order of Siluriformes. We are going to only call catfish \nthe kind that are raised in the southeastern part of the United States.\n  Proponents of this ban used the insidious technique of granting \nownership of the term ``catfish'' to only North American catfish \ngrowers--as if Southern agribusinesses have exclusive rights to the \nname of a fish that is farmed around the world, from Brazil to \nThailand. According to the FDA and the American Fisheries Society, the \nPangasius species of catfish imported from Vietnam and other countries \nare ``freshwater catfishes of Africa and southern Asia.'' In addition, \ncurrent FDA regulations prohibit these products from being labeled \nsimply as ``catfish''. Under existing regulations, a qualifier such as \n``basa,'' or ``striped'' must accompany the term ``catfish'' so that \nconsumers are able to make an informed choice about what they are \neating.\n  These fish were indeed catfish, until Congress, with little review \nand no debate, determined them not to be. No other animal or plant name \nhas been defined in statute this way.\n\n[[Page S13427]]\n\n  All other acceptable market names for fish are determined by the FDA \nin cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service after review \nof scientific literature and market practices.\n  What are the effects of this import restriction? As with any \nprotectionist measure, blocking trade and relying only on domestic \nproduction will increase the price of catfish for the many Americans \nwho enjoy eating it. One in three seafood restaurants in America serves \ncatfish, attesting to its popularity.\n  This trade ban will raise the prices wholesalers and retail customers \npay for catfish, and Americans who eat catfish will feel that price \nincrease--a price increase imposed purely to line the pockets of \nSouthern agribusinesses and their lobbyists who have conducted a \nscurrilous campaign against foreign catfish for the most parochial \nreasons.\n  The ban on catfish imports has other grave implications. It patently \nviolates our solemn trade agreement with Vietnam, the very same trade \nagreement the Senate ratified by a vote of 88 to 12 only 2 months ago. \nThe ink was not dry on that agreement when the catfish lobby and its \ncongressional allies slipped the catfish amendment into a must-pass \nappropriations bill.\n  A lot of things come over the Internet these days. This is one called \nthe Nelson Report. The title of it is the ``Catfish War.'' It talks \nabout an obscure amendment to the agricultural bill that puts the U.S. \nin violation of the Vietnam BTA barely days after it goes into effect, \nand it is not just a bilateral problem. The labeling requirement goes \nto the heart of the U.S. fight with European use of GMO protectionism. \nIt has already forced the USTR to back off from supporting Peruvian \nsardines.\n\n       No. 1, don't get us wrong: We here at Nelson Report World \n     Headquarters flat out love fresh Arkansas catfish. Serve it \n     all the time at our house, with Paul Prudhomme's spicy \n     seasoning. Tasty and nutritious. So nothing in the Report \n     which follows should be interpreted as bad mouthing, you \n     should pardon the expression, catfish from the good old U.S. \n     of A.\n       --and we will confess going along with the crowd, every \n     time Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas launched into one of \n     her lectures on the inequities of lower priced Vietnamese \n     catfish coming into the U.S. All of us at the press table, \n     and back in the high priced lobby gallery, were too smart for \n     our britches. So we missed the FY '02 Agriculture \n     Appropriations amendment, now signed into law, requiring that \n     only U.S.-grown catfish of a certain biological genus can \n     actually be called catfish.\n       That's right: U.S. law now says you can be ugly, you can \n     have whiskers, you can feed on unspeakable things off the \n     bottom of whatever bit of god's creation you happen to be \n     swimming around in, but if you ain't in the same genus as \n     your Arkansas cousins, you ain't a catfish. Or, rather, you \n     can't be called a catfish. That's now the law of the U.S., to \n     be enforced by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\n       --so what, you may ask? Ask your spousal unit, or friends, \n     who does the grocery shopping. Except maybe in Little Rock, \n     catfish isn't marketed by brand name. You look for a package \n     that says ``catfish.'' That's it. So now, if a catfish from \n     Vietnam, or Thailand, or some of the places in Africa that \n     export catfish happens to be in your supermarket, you may \n     never find out, since they've got to be called something \n     else.\n\n  The amendment Senator Gramm and I offered will repeal this import \nrestriction on catfish. The amendment would define catfish according to \nexisting FDA procedures that follow scientific standards and market \npractices. Not only is restrictive catfish language offensive in \nprinciple to our free trade policies, our recent overwhelming \nratification of the bilateral trade agreement and our relationship with \nVietnam, it also flagrantly disregards the facts about the catfish \ntrade.\n\n  I would like to rebut this campaign of misinformation by setting \nstraight these facts as reported by agricultural officials at our \nEmbassy in Vietnam who have investigated the Vietnamese catfish \nindustry in depth. The U.S. Embassy in Vietnam summarizes the situation \nin this way. This is the exact language from our Embassy in Vietnam:\n\n       Based on embassy discussions with Vietnamese government and \n     industry officials and a review of recent reports by U.S.-\n     based experts, the embassy does not believe there is evidence \n     to support claims that Vietnamese catfish exports to the \n     United States are subsidized, unhealthy, undermining, or \n     having an ``injurious'' impact on the catfish market in the \n     U.S.\n\n  Our Embassy goes on to state:\n\n       In the case of catfish, the embassy has found little or no \n     evidence that the U.S. industry or health of the consuming \n     public is facing a threat from Vietnam's emerging catfish \n     export industry. . . . Nor does there appear to be substance \n     to claims that catfish raised in Vietnam are less healthy \n     than [those raised in] other countries.\n\n  The U.S. Embassy reported the following:\n  Subsidies: American officials indicate that the Vietnamese Government \nprovides no direct subsidies to its catfish industry.\n  Health and safety standards: The Embassy is unable to identify any \nevidence to support claims that Vietnamese catfish are of questionable \nquality and may pose health risks. FDA officials have visited Vietnam \nand have confirmed quality standards there. U.S. importers of \nVietnamese catfish are required to certify that their imports comply \nwith FDA requirements and FDA inspectors certify these imports meet \nAmerican standards.\n  A normal increase in imports: The Embassy finds no evidence to \nsuggest that Vietnam is purposely directing catfish exports to the \nUnited States to establish a market there.\n  Labeling: The Vietnamese reached an agreement with the FDA on a \nlabeling scheme to differentiate Vietnamese catfish from U.S. catfish \nin U.S. retail markets. As our Embassy reports, the primary objective \nshould be to provide Americans consumers with informed choices, not \ndiminish choice by restricting imports.\n  The facts are clear. The midnight amendment passed without a vote is \nbased not on any concern for the health and well-being of the American \nconsumer. The restriction on catfish imports slipped into the \nAgriculture appropriations bill serves only the interests of the \ncatfish producers in six Southern States that profit by restricting the \nchoice of the American consumer by banning the competition.\n  The catfish lobby's advertising campaign on behalf of its \nprotectionist agenda has few facts to rely on to support its case, so \nit stands on scurrilous fear-mongering to make its claim that catfish \nraised in good old Mississippi mud are the only fish with whiskers safe \nto eat. One of these negative advertisements which ran in the national \ntrade weekly ``Supermarket News'' tells us in shrill tones:\n\n       Never trust a catfish with a foreign accent.\n\n  This ad characterizes Vietnamese catfish as dirty and goes on to say:\n\n       They've grown up flapping around in Third World rivers and \n     dining on whatever they can get their fins on. . . . Those \n     other guys probably couldn't spell U.S. even if they tried.\n\n  How enlightened. I believe a far more accurate assessment is provided \nin the Far Eastern Economic Review in its feature article on this \nissue:\n\n       For a bunch of profit-starved fisherfolk, the U.S. catfish \n     lobby had deep enough pockets to wage a highly xenophobic \n     advertising campaign against their Vietnamese competitors.\n\n  Unfortunately, this protectionist campaign against catfish imports \nhas global repercussions. Peru has brought a case against the European \nUnion in the World Trade Organization because the Europeans have \nclaimed exclusive rights to the word ``sardine'' for trade purposes. \nThe Europeans would define sardines to be sardines only if they are \ncaught in European waters, thereby threatening the sardine fisheries in \nthe Western Hemisphere. Prior to passage of the catfish-labeling \nlanguage in the Agriculture appropriations bill, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative had committed to file a brief supporting Peru's position \nbefore the WTO that such a restrictive definition unfairly protected \nEuropean fishermen at the expense of sardine fishermen in the Western \nHemisphere. As the Peruvians, a large number of American fishermen \nwould suffer the effects of an implicit European import ban on the \nsardines that are their livelihood.\n  Yet as a direct consequence of the passage of the restrictive \ncatfish-labeling language in the Agriculture appropriations bill, the \nUSTR has withdrawn its brief supporting the Peruvian position in the \nsardine case against the European Union because the catfish amendment \nwritten into law makes the United States guilty of the same type of \nprotectionist labeling scheme for which we have brought suit against \nthe Europeans in the WTO.\n  Mr. President, I obviously do have a lot more to say. I know the \nopponents\n\n[[Page S13428]]\n\nof this amendment have a lot to say as well. I would take heed, \nhowever, to the admonishments of the managers of the bill, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the Senator from Mississippi, and I would be glad to enter \ninto a time agreement so we can dispense with this amendment as quickly \nas possible.\n  I do not know how both Senators from Arkansas feel, but I would \npropose a half hour--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage \nin a colloquy with the Senators from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Arkansas, is he prepared to have a \ntime agreement?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say at this time I am not prepared to enter into a \ntime agreement. There are a number of Senators, and I don't know how \nlong they need to speak. An original agreement was full and open \ndebate. This is a good time for full and open debate, and it is not in \nthe best interests to enter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas. I know he would \nprobably not want to filibuster this bill. I think he agrees we would \nwant to have an up-or-down vote as he described. We are prepared to \nonly use another 20 minutes on this side. I hope the Senators from \nArkansas can find out who wants to speak and for how long so we can \nestablish a time agreement. We need to move on with the important \nCochran and Roberts amendment to the farm bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Speaking for myself, I agree with the Senator that we \ncan probably get through debate rapidly. I think the Senator from \nMississippi, and maybe Senator Hutchinson, and there may be a few other \nSenators who want to speak, but I don't foresee it taking a good deal \nof time, and we could conclude our comments rapidly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for her courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am delighted to engage in this debate. As my \ncolleagues listen to the facts concerning the Vietnam basa and the \nimpact on the domestic catfish industry, they will see things in a \ndifferent light. I voted for the Vietnamese Free Trade Agreement. I \nbelieve in free trade. I believe in fair trade. I also believe in \naccurate labeling and that the American people ought to know what they \nare buying.\n  We heard the term ``catfish lobby'' used frequently last week and \ntoday. It has an ominous ring to it. I am not sure what the catfish \nlobby is. I know this: I have thousands of people who are employed in \nthe catfish industry in Arkansas. I was in Lake Village, AR, on \nSaturday. Chicot County is one of the poorest counties in Arkansas--one \nof the poorest counties in the United States, as a matter of fact. We \nhad 70 or 80 catfish growers who were present on Saturday. I didn't see \nagribusiness. I didn't see wealthy landholders. I saw a group of small \nbusiness men and women struggling to survive in an industry that has \nbeen one of the bright spots in one of the poorest spots in the United \nStates in the last decade.\n  One of the farmers came up and said: I want to give you my books for \nthe last 5 years--and handed me spread sheets. When they talk about us \nbeing wealthy catfish growers, I will show my books. He had a net \nprofit last year of $8,000. This is a part of the country where the \nmedian household income is $19,000, about half of what it is in the \nState of Arizona.\n  I take exception when we talk about the catfish lobby as if it were a \npowerful, wealthy, devious, insidious group. This amendment cripples \nand potentially destroys the aquaculture industry in the State of \nArkansas. This industry has been in distress over the last year because \nof the influx of Vietnamese fish mislabeled as catfish. The Vietnamese \nbasa is not catfish.\n\n  On November 28, 2001, President Bush signed into law what was a great \nvictory for our Nation's catfish farmers, a provision that simply said \nthe Vietnamese basa would not be labeled ``catfish.'' It is a different \nspecies; it is a different order; it is a different fish.\n  This language attached to the Agriculture appropriations bill has \nalso been included in the farm bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives. Put in the bill was language that would limit the use \nof the common name ``catfish'' for the Vietnamese basa. Importers have \nhijacked the common name of catfish and applied it to a species of fish \nthat is not closely related or similar to what we commonly consider \ncatfish.\n  The domestic catfish industry has spent millions and millions and \nmillions of dollars to try to educate the American people as to the \nnutritional value and the health and safety conditions in which farm-\ngrown catfish are raised. All of that investment the domestic channel \ncatfish industry has made has been hijacked by importers who see a \nquick way to profits.\n  The language in the appropriations bill corrected this mislabeling of \nfish and misleading of American consumers. This limitation will give \nour domestic catfish producers a reprieve from unfair competition and \nmislabeling. I share Senator McCain's belief that competition is good \nwhen open and a competitive market benefits our Nation's economy and \nconsumers. However, misleading consumers and mislabeling a product is \nwrong. To allow it to continue at the expense of an entire industry is \nunthinkable.\n  The States of Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana produce \n95 percent of the Nation's catfish. If you look at the broad area of \naquaculture, 58 percent of fish grown in the United States are catfish. \nThis is a huge aspect of fisheries in general in the United States, and \n95 percent of those are grown in these four Southern States. These \ncatfish are grain fed, they are farm raised catfish, produced under \nstrict health and environmental regulations.\n  Arkansas rates second in the amount of catfish produced nationally, \nbut it is an industry that has grown and has thrived in one of the \npoorest areas of this country, the Mississippi Delta, an area that has \nsometimes been referred to as the Appalachia of the 1990s. When I say \nthat Chicot County and Desha County are two of the poorest counties in \nArkansas, it is true they are two of the poorest counties in the \nNation.\n  Despite the work ethic and strong spirit, economic opportunities have \nbeen few and far between. The aquaculture industry has been a shining \nsuccess story for this region of the country. I made a number of visits \nto southeast Arkansas and to the Mississippi Delta and to our \naquaculture regions of the State. I have been to the processing plants. \nI have seen them and talked to those who are employed in the catfish \nprocessing plants. I have gone to the ponds. I have seen the pristine \nconditions in which the fish are raised.\n  This past Saturday, I saw the pain and distress and concerns \nreflected in the faces of these catfish growers who have built an \nindustry and seen hope and are now seeing that hope ripped away from \nthem. It is estimated that as high as 25 percent of the catfish growers \nin Arkansas could go bankrupt within the next year. This is not some \nobscure debate about free trade; it is people's livelihoods, people's \nlives.\n  At a time when there is a lot of attention being paid to an economic \nstimulus package for the Nation, I suggest to my colleagues this is one \nof the poorest regions of our Nation. Just think of the economic damage \nthat can be done with this kind of amendment.\n  Some of my colleagues are making accusations that this legislation is \nin violation of trade practices, saying this legislation is unfair.\n  What is unfair is that our catfish farmers are being subjected to \ncompeting with an inferior product that simply adopts the name of a \nsuccessful product and gains acceptance. What is unfair is these fish \nare being pawned off as catfish to unsuspecting American consumers at a \ntime when the fears of unemployment and the reality of an economic \ndownturn in the wake of the September 11 attacks are weighing heavily \non the minds of Americans. It is not acceptable for us to sit back and \nwatch as an industry which employs thousands is allowed to be crushed \nby inferior imports because of the glitch in our regulatory system.\n  Vietnamese exports are being confused by the American public as being\n\n[[Page S13429]]\n\ncatfish due to labeling that allows them to be called basa catfish. \nThese Vietnam basa are being imported at record levels.\n  The chart to my right demonstrates what has happened. As late as \n1997, imports of Vietnam basa were almost nonexistent. Yet if you look \nat 1998 and 1999, and particularly this year, they have grown \nexponentially. In June of this year, 648,000 pounds were imported into \nthe United States. Over the last several months, imports have averaged \n382,000 pounds per month.\n  To put this in perspective, in all of 1997 there were only 500,000--\none-half million--pounds of Vietnam basa imported into the United \nStates. However, it is predicted that 15 million to 20 million pounds \ncould be imported next year.\n  The Vietnamese penetration in this market in the last year has more \nthan tripled. Market penetration has risen from 7 percent to 23 percent \nof the total market. As a result of that incredibly fast increase of \npenetration into the American market from 7 percent to 23 percent, \nAmerican catfish growers have seen their prices decrease 15 percent \njust in the last few months in 2001 alone.\n  For those who argue this is the result of a competitive market, let \nme offer a few facts.\n  When the fish were labeled and marketed as Vietnamese basa, when they \nimported it and put ``Vietnam basa'' on it, or they just put ``basa'' \non it, sales in this country were limited, almost nonexistent. Some \nimporters were so creative that they tried to label basa as white \ngrouper, still with very little success. It was only when these \nimporters discovered that labeling it as catfish added a lot of appeal \nthat sales began to skyrocket and imports began to skyrocket. Try this, \nand it didn't work. Try this, and it didn't work. And try catfish, \nbecause of the great investment this domestic industry made, and sales \ntook off.\n  Although the FDA issued an order on September 19, stating that the \ncorrect labeling of Vietnamese basa be a high priority, the FDA is \nallowing these fish to retain the label of ``catfish'' in the title.\n  Whether it is budget constraints or lack of personnel, it is obvious \nthat inspections have been lacking in the past and the inclusion of the \nterm catfish in the title only serves to promote confusion.\n  Prior to this ruling there were numerous instances where the \npackaging of these fish was blatantly misleading and even illegal.\n  This illustration shows how Vietnamese companies and rogue U.S. \nimporters are trying to confuse the American public.\n  Names such as ``Cajun Delight,'' ``Delta Fresh,'' and ``Farm \nSelect,'' lead consumers to believe the product is something that it is \nnot.\n  ``Catfish'' in large letters, ``Delta Fresh''--no one would suspect \nit is from the Mekong Delta.\n  The total impact of the catfish industry on the U.S. economy is \nestimated to exceed $4 billion annually. It has gone up dramatically. \nApproximately 12,000 people are employed by the industry.\n  When you talk about the catfish lobby and say it in such sinister \nterms, please think about the 12,000 people--thousands of them--in the \ndelta of Arkansas, the poorest part of this Nation, who are employed in \nthis industry. That is the catfish lobby.\n  It is estimated that 25 percent of my catfish farmers in Arkansas \nwill be forced out of business if this problem is not corrected.\n  Catfish farmers of this country have invested millions of dollars \neducating the American public about the nutritional attributes of \ncatfish. Through their efforts, American consumers have an expectation \nof what a catfish is and how it is raised.\n  They have an expectation that what they purchase is indeed a catfish.\n  Here you will see an official list of both scientific names and \nmarket or common names from the Food and Drug Administration. Almost \nall of these fish can contain the word catfish in their names under \ncurrent FDA rules.\n  All of these fish in this one order can use the term ``catfish'' \nunder current FDA rulings. It is the same order, if you look at the \nchannel catfish. The basa are here at the bottom. In fact, you will \nfind that while they are of the same order as Senator McCain rightly \npointed out, they are of a different family and a different species; \nthat is, channel catfish and the basa--totally different species. Even \nmore importantly, when we look at trade issues, they are a totally \ndifferent family.\n  This is a very important distinction to realize. Most people just \nlook and see the word ``catfish'' and they don't pay any attention to \nthe package. They are currently allowed to use that term.\n  In fact, you will notice, if you look a little farther down on the \nchart, the Atlantic salmon and the lake trout are of the same family or \nmore closely related to the channel catfish than the basa. Ask those \nwho are from the States where Atlantic salmon is an important fishery \nproduct whether they would appreciate lake trout being allowed under \nFDA rules to be labeled ``Atlantic salmon.'' Those two fish are more \nclosely related than the channel catfish is to the basa. You can see \nthat the Atlantic salmon and the lake trout are of the same family \nwhile channel catfish is of a different family entirely.\n  Most people are not able to make those distinctions and are being \nmisled when they see that word ``catfish'' put on the package.\n  When the average Arkansan hears the word ``catfish,'' the idea of a \ntypical channel catfish come to mind. When they sit down at a \nrestaurant and order a plate of fried catfish, that same channel \ncatfish is what they expect to be eating.\n  One cannot blame the restauranteur who is offered ``catfish'' for a \ndollar less a pound for buying it. However, in many cases they do not \nrealize that what they are buying is not really channel catfish.\n  It is obvious that this confusion has been exploited and will \ncontinue to be exploited unless something is done to correct the \nobvious oversight that is jeopardizing American jobs.\n  Further, American catfish farmers raise their catfish in pristine and \nclosely controlled environments. The fish are fed pellets consisting of \ngrains composed of soybeans, corn, and cotton seed. These facilities \nare required to meet strict Federal and State regulations.\n  In fact, this upper picture is a very accurate reflection both of \nU.S. farm-raised catfish--what it looks like--and the conditions in \nwhich it is grown. I was there this Saturday. I have flown over our \ncatfish ponds in delta Arkansas time and time again. They are clean, \nthey are pristine and well regulated, and they are inspected.\n  I understand the Vietnamese basa fish are raised in far different \nconditions. In the Mekong Delta, one of the most polluted watersheds in \nthe world, basa are often exposed to many foul and unhealthy elements, \nsometimes even feeding off raw sewage. In fact, because an importer \nsigns a statement saying he guarantees it was raised in conditions \ncomparable to the United States and meets health and safety \nrequirements of the United States is little assurance to the American \nconsumers.\n  There is, I believe, a pretty good indication of the comparison, and \nmost assuredly a comparison of the two different fish that are \ninvolved. One is Vietnamese basa, a different species, and a different \nfamily from United States farm-raised catfish, channel catfish.\n  I understand that my colleague from Arizona has a strong desire to \npromote competitive markets and encourage trade but markets must be \nhonest and trade must be fair.\n  I again emphasize that these are people's livelihoods. Congress acted \nproperly limiting the use of the common name ``catfish.'' This action \nwas warranted because exporters in Vietnam and importers in the United \nStates have used the term ``catfish'' improperly and unfairly to make \ninroads into an established market.\n  This provision does not exclude Vietnamese basa from being imported. \nLet me emphasize that it does not violate any trade agreements.\n  There can be as many Vietnam basa fish imported into the United \nStates as they can sell if it is properly labeled Vietnamese basa. My \nobjective under the provisions that were included in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill was to ensure that labeling is accurate and \ntruthful.\n  That language ends the practice of purposely misleading consumers at \nthe expense of an industry in one of the poorest parts of the Nation.\n\n[[Page S13430]]\n\n  Some people may argue that the restriction of the use of the name \n``catfish'' to members of the family Ictaluridae runs counter to past \ninternational seafood trade policy, and may hinder our progress of \nincreasing trade. In fact, that is the very argument that has been \nmade.\n  Two examples of attempted nomenclature restrictions used to support \nthis argument are name restrictions for scallops proposed by the French \nGovernment and one for sardines proposed by the EU. Both of these \nefforts have been strongly opposed by American producers. We do not \ndispute that; in the cases of the scallops and the sardines, these \nnomenclature restrictions are unfair.\n\n  However, both of these examples--and I suspect the Senator from Texas \nwill talk about these examples and try to make it identical to the \nissue of catfish; and, in fact, it is not at all--are based on groups \nof animals that are much more closely related taxonomically than are \nbasa and channel catfish. Channel catfish and the Vietnamese basa are \nclassified in different taxonomic families--Ictaluridae for channel \ncatfish and Pangasidae for basa. As is shown on this chart, the \nfamilies are entirely different for the channel catfish and the \nVietnamese basa.\n  This is a very distant relationship, analogous to the difference \nbetween giraffes and cattle, which differ at the level of family within \nthe mammal grouping. However, the scallop issue involves members of a \nsingle molluscan family, the Pectenidae. That is, the molluscs at issue \nin the French case differ only at the genus or species level.\n  The European Union sardine issue likewise involves members of a \nsingle family of fish, the Clupeidae. Again, the fish species allowed \nby the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Codex \nAlimentarius standard to be sold under the common name ``sardine'' \ndiffer only at the genus--that is shown here on the chart--and species \nlevel, not at the family level.\n  The Vietnamese basa and the American channel catfish are in different \nfamilies. They are only in the same order--Siluriformes--which has more \nthan 2,200 different species in it. This order is characterized by the \npresence, as Senator McCain has said, of barbels or whiskers. Some will \nsay: If it has whiskers, then it is a catfish. I heard my colleague \nmake that statement. So should all of these fish be allowed to be sold \nas catfish--these 2,000 different species? Do you think it is all right \nwith consumers to sell them nurse shark labeled as catfish? They have \nthe barbels or the whiskers. They have the pictures here to show that. \nDo you not think that would be a little bit deceptive for the nurse \nshark to be labeled as catfish?\n  Now think about if that nurse shark were raised in salt water under \nhealth inspection conditions that only require the producer to sign a \npiece of paper that states that health standards are being upheld.\n  Now imagine that because of the way this nurse shark is raised--it is \ncheaper, significantly cheaper. What if that nurse shark, raised in \nsalt water under questionable health conditions, was allowed to be sold \nas catfish? Is that fair trade? That is exactly analogous of what is \nbeing done today when Vietnamese basa is being labeled as catfish. It \nis not fair trade.\n  Now imagine that they tried to sell it as nurse shark and couldn't \ndevelop a market--understandably--but suddenly, when they labeled it as \ncatfish, they saw their market grow by not 100 percent, not 400 \npercent, but 700 percent. Because they took the nurse shark and labeled \nit as catfish, wouldn't that be considered deceptive and considered \nunfair? The answer is obvious.\n  This is exactly the case that our catfish farmers in Arkansas, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama are facing. And it is not fair.\n  Black drum fish have whiskers. That should not be labeled as catfish. \nSturgeon have whiskers and barbels. It should not be labeled as \ncatfish. The blind fish, the blind cave fish uses whiskers or barbels \nto feel its way around, but no one would suggest they should be \nmarketed as catfish.\n\n  That is why we introduced S. 1494 on October 3, 2001. Many of us, \nincluding my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, came to this \nChamber and described the situation in great detail at that time. \nNothing was hidden. We had an open and full debate. Afterwards, we \nworked to include this needed legislation in a number of bills, finally \nbeing successful in getting it into the Agriculture appropriations \nbill.\n  I remind my colleagues, again, as they will hear of the wealthy \ncatfish growers, they will hear of agribusiness. They will hear of the \ncatfish lobby. Two counties in Arkansas that grow the most catfish are \nChicot County and Desha County.\n  In Chicot County, 33.8 percent of the residents live in poverty--33.8 \npercent. The median household income in Chicot County is $19,604. That \nis the average household income.\n  In Desha County, 27.5 percent of the residents live in poverty, with \nthe median household income being $23,361.\n  By contrast, in the State of Arizona, 15 percent of the residents \nlive in poverty. That is one-half the poverty rate of Chicot County. \nAnd the median household income in Arizona is $34,751--$15,000 per \nfamily more than Chicot County.\n  I would not suggest that we should try to hurt, destroy, undermine, \nor undercut industries in the State of Arizona because they are \nprospering more than these two poor counties in the delta of Arkansas. \nBut I assure you, I am going to stand in this Senate Chamber and fight \nfor the thousands of people who are employed in this industry and the \none ray of light in that delta economy.\n  When they talk about large agribusinesses and wealthy catfish \ngrowers, it should be remembered that 70 percent of the catfish growers \nin the United States qualify under the Small Business Administration as \nsmall businesses. And many of that 70 percent are fighting for their \nsurvival.\n  So, Mr. President, and my colleagues, I ask we keep very much in mind \nthat this is not a free trade issue. This is a fair trade issue. It is \na truth-in-labeling issue. It is calling Vietnamese basa what they \nare--basa--and allowing that term ``catfish,'' which has been part of \nan important educational and nutritional campaign in this country, to \nnot be kidnapped by those importers that seek to make a quick buck.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote down the McCain-Gramm amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for \nbeing in this Chamber and so eloquently describing the issue with which \nwe are dealing, particularly in our home State of Arkansas, \nparticularly in the area of the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas \nthat has been so hard hit by the unfairness of the influx of trade from \nthe Vietnamese basa fish.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for his continued leadership and his \nwork in keeping us focused on making sure we are on the straight and \nnarrow and that we are doing business in the Senate in the way that \nbusiness should be handled. He is always there working diligently in \nthat regard.\n  Today I rise to respectfully oppose the amendment that Senator McCain \nhas offered on catfish and, again, thanking him for his leadership and \ndoing many things in keeping us straight in the Senate. But I \nrespectfully disagree with him on this one.\n  Our distinguished colleagues who support this amendment argue that \nthis issue is about free trade. They argue this amendment is about \npreserving the integrity and the spirit of our trade agreements, in \nparticular, the bilateral agreement with Vietnam this body approved \nearlier this fall. And they are right on both of these points, but not \nfor the reasons they describe.\n  This issue does touch on free trade and on the integrity of our \nagreements. It touches on the fairness of trade and on the trust that \nwe ask our citizens in this country to put into our trade agreements.\n  For global market liberalization to succeed, it must be built on a \nstrong foundation of rules. This rules-based market system must be \ntransparent and fair. It must be reliable and it must encourage market \nconfidence.\n  That is one reason we worked so hard to negotiate our trade \nagreements within the auspices of a stable, multilateral institution \nsuch as the WTO. If\n\n[[Page S13431]]\n\nwe do not work within a reliable, predictable rules-based system, then \npeople lose faith in the promise of free trade and the free trade \nagenda is undermined. I do not think anyone in this body with the state \nof the economy wants to undermine the opportunities that free trade \nbrings to this great Nation.\n  Many of our farmers have lost faith in our promises of free trade \nbecause they sense that their trading partners are not playing by the \nsame rules. The House barely approved TPA last week in large part \nbecause rural Members and their constituents have lost faith in free \ntrade. Our catfish farmers are now having to confront this issue of \nfairness and trust. They are having to confront imports of a wholly \ndifferent kind of fish that is brought into this country but that is \nlabeled as catfish.\n  Let's remember what it is we are talking about when we talk about \ncatfish. As a young girl, I learned how to shoot using target driftwood \non the Mississippi River. I also learned how to enjoy the outdoors and \nfishing by catching some big catfish in many of our lakes and streams \nin Arkansas, the thrill of being able to be a part of the environment \nand something that is a part of our heritage in Arkansas and in the \nMississippi Delta region.\n  Some of us have in mind a specific kind of fish, the catfish that we \ngrew up catching and eating. If we look at the chart, which has been \nshown to you by my colleague from Arkansas, which was prepared by the \nNational Warmwater Aquaculture Center in Stoneville, MI, we see, as my \ncolleague pointed out, what catfish consumers in this country think of \nas classified taxonomically under the family known as Ictaluridae.\n  It is a week before Christmas, a time when we should all be focused \non family and getting home to our families so we can celebrate this \nChristmas. Let's look at this family column of what we are talking \nabout. Look at the Ictaluridae area of the family column, more \nspecifically known by its genus species as the channel catfish, which \nis what we are talking about today. In contrast, the basa fish that is \nbeing imported and labeled as ``catfish'' is classified under the \nfamily name here known as Pangasiidae. So not only are the channel \ncatfish and the basa fish not members of the same genus species, they \nare not even members of the same family. They are only members of the \nsame taxonomic order.\n  To get an idea of what this means or of how different these fish are, \nlet's look at classifications of other items that we buy and consume. I \nmentioned this in my comments when we did bring up this amendment on \nthe floor and talked about the bill we had introduced.\n  An Atlantic salmon and a lake trout, as my colleague mentioned, are \nmembers of the same family. So they are closer relatives than are the \nchannel fish, catfish, and the basa fish. I suppose if we are prepared \nto say that basa would be sold under the label of ``catfish,'' then \nlake trout can be masqueraded as Atlantic salmon. I imagine many of my \ncolleagues in this body would disagree with that.\n  Here is another one: A cow and a yak are members of the same family; \nonce again, closer relatives than the channel catfish and the basa. So \nif we are prepared to say that the basa can be sold under the label of \n``catfish,'' then we are more justified in saying that yak meat can be \nlabeled and sold as New York strip steak. Or how about a camel or a \ngiraffe? Both are members of the same order as a cow so just as close \nas the channel catfish and the basa fish. I suppose our opponents \nbelieve that an importer ought to be able to label a camel or a giraffe \nas beef and deceive the consumers into thinking they are buying filet \nmignon. Of course, it would be absurd to let a business deceive a \nconsumer in such an egregious manner. To do so is nothing more than \noutrageous deception.\n  Do not let the other side fool you by suggestions that all fish are \nthe same. It is not true, not any more than saying all four-legged \nmammals can be sold as beef.\n\n  These basa fish are brought into this country, packaged to mimic \nAmerican brand names, even to mimic U.S. brand emblems for catfish, \nthen labeled and sold to consumers as catfish in a blatant attempt to \ndeceive the consumer into thinking he or she was buying a certain kind \nof catfish. That catfish they think they are buying is the North \nAmerican channel catfish, not a basa fish.\n  This issue really hits home in Arkansas. As was mentioned by my \ncolleague, we are talking about the Mississippi River Delta region of \nArkansas where I grew up, one of the poorest regions in the Nation, one \nof the areas where our catfish farmers have contributed significantly \nto the economic viability of our Mississippi Delta counties, an area \nwhich has already been hit hard by the downturn in the rural economy \nwhich occurred over 4 years ago or better.\n  At a time when terribly low prices of other crops have been sending \nmore and more farmers into bankruptcy, our catfish farmers have been \nable to scratch out a living by carving out a new market in this stable \neconomy. These are farmers who in years past have left row cropping, \nwho have found an environmentally efficient way to take their lands, \ntheir productive lands, and put them into aquaculture, thereby not only \nlooking at the environmental impact statement they can make, the \neconomic impact they can make, because they will hire more individuals \nand put more individuals to work, but also carving out a niche in the \neconomy that needed to be filled.\n  So many of these farmers and workers once worked in production of \nother crops. As we have seen, the market for those crops has gone in \nthe tank. There wasn't a very proud commercial market in catfish to \nspeak of, but these farmers and these workers, after finding it nearly \nimpossible to make a living in other crops, saw an opportunity to \ndevelop a market and build an industry. That is exactly what they have \ndone over the last 15 to 20 years. They have built from scratch this \nmarket for aquaculture. So many of these communities, these farmers, \ntheir families and related industries invested millions and millions of \ndollars into building a catfish industry and into developing a catfish \nmarket. It has taken years, but they have done it. They are still doing \nit.\n  But now, just as they are seeing the fruits of their years of labor \nand investment, just as they are finding a light at the end of the \nrural economic tunnel, they find themselves facing a new and even more \ndevious form of unfair trading practice. The people importing these \nVietnamese fish see a growing market of which they can take advantage. \nIt is irrelevant to them that what they are selling is not really \ncatfish.\n  Why are they doing it? Because the catfish market in America is \ngrowing. Americans like catfish. As the Senator from Arizona mentioned, \nit is wholesome and healthy. It is safe. But as in any other crop in \nthis Nation, as we continue to demand of our producers in this great \nNation that they produce the safest--environmentally safest and product \nsafest--economical product, we must be willing to stand by them, \nwhether it is in an incredibly good farm bill, which the chairman has \nproduced, or whether it is in trading practices to ensure that we stand \nby our producers.\n  American-raised catfish is farm raised and grain fed, grown in \nspecially built ponds, cared for in closely regulated and closely \nscrutinized environments that ensure the safest supply of the cleanest \nfish a consumer could purchase.\n  Some basa fish are grown in cages in the Mekong River in conditions \nthat are far below the standards which our catfish farmers must meet. \nDo consumers know that? Are they aware of the product they are getting? \nIt is an unfair irony that our catfish farmers, many of whom left other \nagricultural pursuits, find themselves once again in the headlights of \nan onslaught of unfair trade from another country.\n  It is not true, as Senator McCain has suggested, that these are \nsimply wealthy agribusiness corporations with deep pockets. These are \nfarmers and workers and families who have built their lives around a \nproductive aquaculture business, who have been scraping out of the land \nand the mud of the Mississippi Delta a living in an area that has been \nso traditionally downtrodden.\n  In fact, 70 percent of the catfish processing workforce consists of \nsingle mothers in their first jobs. These are single working mothers, \nmany of whom\n\n[[Page S13432]]\n\nare coming off the welfare rolls in one of the poorest regions in the \ncountry. One of the farmers from Arkansas whom I know, a gentleman \nnamed Randy Evans, is a Vietnam veteran himself who has sunk his life \nsavings into his catfish farm. Another year like the last one, he tells \nme, and he will be out of business. His story is a common one.\n  Another farmer, Philip Jones, also from Arkansas, decided to quit \nfarming in other crops 4 years ago because it was too tough to make a \nliving and decided to throw his and his wife's savings into the catfish \nbusiness. Now, as Randy Evans, they face losing all of their savings \nand going out of business if the next year is like the last.\n\n  To hear the other side describe, the troubles these farmers are \nfacing couldn't possibly have anything to do with increasing sales of \nbasa as catfish. They will try to point out that basa imports represent \nonly 4 percent of the catfish market. But that's only if you look at \nthe entire catfish market. What they don't tell you is that basa \nimports are primarily in the frozen filet market, which is the most \nprofitable market within the catfish business. And within the frozen \nfilet market, basa imports have tripled--tripled--each of the last \ncouple of years--from 7 million pounds to 20 million pounds annually.\n  Looking at that trend line, it is easy to understand how imports of \nthese misleadingly labeled basa fish will very soon have a devastating \neffect on the catfish industry; that is, unless something is done to \nbring some fairness to the marketplace.\n  My colleagues and I felt that this problem could best be resolved by \naddressing the unfair trading practice where it occurs--at the labeling \nstage. That is exactly what the language included in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill does, which was signed into law by President Bush \non November 28, just 3 weeks ago. It simply prohibits the labeling of \nany fish as ``catfish'' that is in fact not an actual member of the \ncatfish family ``Ictalariidae.''\n  We are not trying to stop other countries from growing catfish and \nselling it into this country. We simply want to make sure that if they \nsay they are selling catfish--then that is what they are really doing. \nIt does not violate the ``national treatment'' rules in our trade \nagreements, nor should it violate our bilateral agreement with Vietnam, \nas some may argue. That is because the language included in the \nAgriculture appropriations law applies to anybody who tries to mislabel \nfish as ``catfish,'' whether that mislabeled fish has been grown in \nAsia or in Arkansas.\n  I have heard some people mention a case involving sardines and the \nEuropean Union. In that case, the EU is trying to limit the label of \n``sardines'' to a specific genus species that is harvested in the \nMediterranean. That case is different from ours for three reasons.\n  First of all, the European action violates an applicable \ninternational standard that is binding on the EU under the Technical \nBarriers to Trade Agreement. There is no applicable international \nstandard that applies to catfish. So one of the main objections to the \nEU sardines case is not even relevant to our case.\n\n  Second, the EU action would change the way sardines imports had \nalready been handled. So the EU action represented an about-face of \nsorts against the way the sardines importing industry had been doing \nbusiness. This is different from our case because these basa imports \nhave only recently begun to deluge our market. So there is no existing \nway we have dealt with the catfish labeling issue. We are establishing \nthat manner right now.\n  Third, as I mentioned earlier, the EU action would limit the label of \nsardines to within the specific genus species that is harvested in the \nMediterranean. So sardines that are within the same taxonomic family as \nthe European species could not use the sardines label. This is \ndifferent from our case because we're talking about fish that is not \neven a member of the same taxonomic family.\n  And do not let others sell you on the argument that we would violate \nthe ``national treatment'' and most-favored-nation provisions of our \ntrade agreements. Our language focuses only on the types of fish, not \non the place of origin, so it would apply equally whether the fish is \ngrown in Asia or in the Mississippi Delta.\n  If our trading partners want to raise catfish of the ``Ictaluridae'' \nfamily overseas and import it into this country under the label of \n``catfish,'' then they can do that. Our language does not seek to stop \nthem. It only requires them to deal with the consumer honestly. It only \nprohibits them from deceiving the consumer.\n  This is about truth and fairness and that is what the language \nincluded in the Agriculture appropriations law accomplishes. So our \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue are right when they say this \nis about preserving the integrity of our trade agreements.\n  What is at stake is whether we will honor the spirit of a rules-based \nglobal trading system that relies on transparency and fairness. Will we \nencourage our farmers and workers to trust increased trade? If so, then \nvote against this amendment.\n  I, once again, would like to go to and reconfirm that this is not an \nissue of campaign finance reform. This is an issue of jobs--jobs in an \narea of our country that has traditionally suffered unbelievable \npoverty and unemployment. These are about hard-working families, in an \narea of our country that, again, has been downtrodden for years. It is \nabout encouraging diversity in an industry, particularly agriculture, \nwhere we have seen our agricultural producers in this great Nation who \nhave been farming away the equity in their farms that their fathers and \ngrandfathers and great-grandfathers built up before them because we \nhaven't provided them the kind of agriculture policy that could sustain \nthem in business. It is providing the diversity that when row crops \ncan't provide that stability, they can diversify into aquaculture, into \nan area where they can employ more people and preserve the environment, \nand they can make an effort at building a part of the economy that \nneeds to be built in this great Nation.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona again for his leadership and for \nalways coming forward to try to set us straight. I respectfully \ndisagree with him. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the \npeople of the Mississippi Delta, the farmers of this Nation who have \nbeen willing to diversify and to seize a marketplace that needed to be \nseized, and to give them fairness so that once again the American \nfarmer, the American producer, can have faith in the integrity of the \nfree trade that this Nation stands behind on their behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, surely God must be smiling that we are here \non December 18th talking about catfish. I would like to try to address \nall these issues that have been raised as quickly as I can and get to \nthe bottom line of what this issue is about.\n  Let me first say I take a back seat to no man or woman on the issue \nof catfish. I have eaten as many or more catfish than anyone in the \nSenate. In fact, as a boy growing up on the Chattahoochee River, I can \nremember buying catfish from people along River Road who had up a sign: \n``Our catfish slept in the Chattahoochee river last night.''\n  I think it is an incredible commentary on how poorly we understand \ntrade that we have heard an endless debate today about what the income \nlevel of catfish producers is while nobody has mentioned catfish \nconsumers. Is there anybody here who would be willing to wager whether \nthe average catfish consumer in America is substantially poorer than \nthe average catfish producer? Nobody would make that wager. Nobody \nthinks there is any question about it.\n  The amazing thing about the debate on trade is that nobody cares \nabout the consumer. The consumer is absolutely irrelevant in the trade \ndebate. The trade debate is basically about single-entry bookkeeping. \nNobody looks at all the agricultural products that the\nVietnamese buy from America. Nobody looks at all the jobs that creates. \nNobody looks at the fact that every American dollar that goes to \nVietnam, or any other country, for that matter, comes back to America \nin purchases. We are focused on single-entry bookkeeping, and in this \nsort of naive world of the Senate trade debate, the end of all \nactivities is exports. Imports seem to be terrible things.\n  If that is true, I wonder why my colleagues go to the grocery store. \nThey\n\n[[Page S13433]]\n\ntalk about free trade. But when is the last time Kroger or Safeway \nbought anything from you? They have never bought anything from me. I \nhave never sold anything to a grocery store. I am engaged in absolutely \none-way unfair trade with the grocery store. The groceries sell things \nto me but they do not buy things from me. If I listen to the logic of \nthis debate, we should be putting up barriers to people getting in the \ngrocery store because of unfair trade.\n\n  Maybe I have been following these debates for too long, but I thought \nthe end of all economic activity was consumption. Does no one care \nabout what impact this provision will have on consumers? Does anybody \ndoubt that limiting competition in the sale of catfish will hurt poor \npeople? It will, and it will hurt them everywhere--not just in \nArkansas, not just in Texas, but everywhere.\n  I also do not understand the point about people in Arizona being \nricher than people in Arkansas. On that logic, why don't we simply have \namendments to redistribute wealth? I do not think any of that is \nrelevant.\n  My point is that no one can dispute that the average consumer of \ncatfish is poorer than the average producer of catfish. So if we are \nhere choosing up sides based on income, we would all be against the \nprovision that limits competition in catfish. But obviously, that is \nnot what we are about.\n  Let me try to address some of the issues that have been raised. First \nof all, many comments have been made today that I do not think comport \nwith existing regulations and laws. I have here a September 27 \ndirective by Phillip Spiller, who is director of the Seafood Center for \nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition, about labeling of Vietnamese \ncatfish. I will ask that it be printed in the Record when I get through \nspeaking. He lists about 30 commercial catfish labels, none of which is \njust plain catfish. You can label it basa catfish. You can label it \nbocourti catfish. You can label it short barbel catfish. You can label \nit sutchi catfish. You can label it striped catfish. But you certainly \ncannot label it plain catfish. So the idea that we have no way to \nindicate whether or not catfish is U.S. catfish just does not comport \nwith the regulations in place today.\n  In looking into this issue, and trying to find a neutral source, we \npulled up www.fishbase.org, which is a taxonomic database on the \nInternet that serves as a reference for fisheries scientists. Rather \nthan going to an old dusty library and pulling out a reference book and \nblowing the dust off it, you now can call up this information from a \ndatabase on the Internet. And up pops various kinds of catfish.\n  It is interesting to me that our colleagues are so adamant that the \ncatfish grown in Vietnam is not catfish. That will come as a surprise \nto the scientists who compiled the taxonomic database at fishbase, \nbecause sure enough, right there on the database--and I challenge my \ncolleagues to look it up--is this basa catfish. So apparently the \nscientists are confused. They may call this a basa catfish, and they \nmay have a picture that goes with it that sure looks like a catfish to \nme. But we, of course, have in-depth knowledge of the catfish and the \ncatfish family and its scientific names.\n  I went to great trouble to actually get a photograph of this \nnefarious catfish. Just the growth of this catfish puts people out of \nwork, and spreads hunger and disaster across the globe. Here is a \npicture of a very young one. If you put that before any child in \nAmerica over the age of 3 and asked, what is that fish, what would they \nsay? Mama, it's a catfish.\n  I have a blowup of this picture. See those whiskers? Do you think \nthat is a crab or a bass or a salmon? It is a catfish. Not only does it \nlook like a catfish, but it acts like a catfish. And the people who \nmake a living in fisheries science call it a catfish.\n\n  Why do we want to call it anything other than a catfish? We want to \ncall it something other than a catfish because of protectionism. I have \nnever run into a man or woman serving in public office who said: I am a \nprotectionist. Nobody says that. They are always for free trade, but \nthey are never for free trade in anything that in any way affects \nanybody they represent. It never ceases to amaze me. I do not know what \nfree trade they favor other than something their state does not \nproduce. But that is not the way trade works.\n  Let me address the many other issues raised. One argument we hear is \nthat this Vietnamese catfish is an inferior import. If it is inferior, \nwhy do restaurants buy it in such overwhelming volume? Do they not want \npeople to come back to their restaurant? Are they not interested in \ncustomer loyalty? And if it is inferior, why has no one presented us \nwith taste test results? I do not know that such a test has ever been \ndone. Do you know why I do not think it has been done? Because people \nwould not be able to tell the difference. There obviously is a \ndifference between a mud cat and a channel cat. I prefer the channel \ncat. If you tried to serve mud cat in a restaurant, you would not have \nmany repeat customers.\n  Restaurants are serving basa catfish because it is good catfish, \npeople like it, and it is cheaper. You might say that there is \nsomething wrong with it being cheaper. What is trade about except \nseeing products become cheaper? Why would we trade with anybody for any \nitem unless we could buy it cheaper from them than we could produce it \nfor ourselves? That is what trade is about. That is where we gain from \ntrade. But all that gets lost in this debate.\n  What about a nutrition study? Does Vietnamese catfish have the same \nnutritional value as U.S. catfish? Is it nutritionally inferior? When \nconsumed by the human species are its digestive qualities different? I \nsuspect not, because certainly the proponents of preventing this \ncatfish from being called a catfish would have done these studies if \nthey thought there were any possibility of generating data in their \nfavor.\n  On the argument regarding a surge in imports, it all depends on where \nyou start. It is true that between 1997 and 2000, there was a big surge \nin catfish imports, from .9 million pounds to 8.2 million pounds. But \nif you go back to 1986, the level of imports then was 8.2 million \npounds. So the level of imports has not changed, at least as measured \nin million-pound increments, since 1986. It may have declined in 1997, \nbut in terms of imports, we are not appreciably different today than we \nwere in 1986. This data is data from the State Department. It is \nunclassified and available for everyone to look at, and I ask my \ncolleagues to look at it.\n  In terms of dirty conditions, where is the evidence? The State \nDepartment was asked to go out and look at how the Vietnamese catfish \nwere grown, and they have come back and tell us that the conditions are \nhighly sanitary. It is interesting that at this very moment, the \nChinese are beginning to produce channel cat from American strains. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that the Vietnamese could not \nultimately produce channel cat. What would the argument be then?\n\n  It seems to me all of the arguments we are hearing today come down to \nan argument against trade. The question turns on what is in a name.\n  Imagine for a moment that Alaskan king crab were required to be \nlabeled as ``giant sea spiders.'' Just imagine that I am in France and \nI don't want these Alaskan king crab brought into France because they \nare good, relatively inexpensive, and superior to the crab we have in \nFrance. The Alaskan king crab is a different subspecies. As everyone \nwho has ever seen a blue crab and an Alaskan king crab knows, one is a \nNo. 1 jimmy, the very top one you can get, at about 6 inches across. \nThen there are various gradations in the Maryland blue crab.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? Shouldn't we change the name of \none of those?\n  Mr. GRAMM. My point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They don't look as much alike as the catfish shown in the \npictures, yet we will make sure that the term ``catfish'' is removed. I \ndon't see why either the dungeness or the blue, one of those, should \nclearly not be called ``crab.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. The point is, what is the purpose of a name? The purpose \nof a name is to convey information. A blue crab, a dungeness crab, a \nking crab--all are labeled as crab because, while they look very \ndifferent and are very different sizes, they basically are similar \ncreatures and a very high quality food source. Why would you call\n\n[[Page S13434]]\n\nthem anything but the same thing unless the objective was to try to \nreduce or remove one of the products from the market?\n  Now, we produce Alaskan king crab. It is a superior product. I don't \nknow whether people that produce it are rich or poor. I know anybody \nwho has enough income to afford Alaskan king crab likes to eat it. I \ndo. But if I were in France and I were in the crab business and I \ndidn't want to compete against Alaskan king crab, what would I do? I \nwould say this is not a crab. I would say that our French crab is a \nsuperior product and this Alaskan king crab is an inferior product that \nis being foisted off on French consumers by French chefs.\n  What about the Florida stone crab that is so expensive and that \npeople like so much? Now, I will say, and I speak with some authority, \npoor people do not eat stone crabs because it is expensive. It is very \nexpensive. And it is very, very good. If I am in France, I have this \ncrummy little crab they grow in France. It is good, but it does not \ncompare to the Florida stone crab or the Maryland blue crab--I sing its \nvirtues--or the Alaskan king crab. I don't know whether God didn't love \nthem as much as he loves us, but he gave us this great variety of \ncrabs. If I am a French crab grower--a ``water man'' as they call it on \nthe eastern shore of Maryland--I might start a campaign because I don't \nwant to compete against these crabs by going to a French \nparliamentarian.\n  Do you think that parliamentarian would stand up and say: Although \nthe American crab are better and cheaper, we don't want them in France \nbecause we think consumers in France are not paying enough for crab. We \nwant to literally steal the crab right out of their mouths. We want to \nrip them off.\n  Do you think you would stand up and say that, even in the French \nparliament? I think not. You know what I think the parliamentarian \nwould say? He would get a picture of a glorious French crab and he \nwould say: Monsieur, this is a crab. And then he would talk about the \nFrench water men who go out in the North Sea, with the winds blowing, \nwhere it is cold and risky. He would have a picture of a water man who \nfell and broke his leg during a storm, and with tears in his eyes, he \nwould say: Are we going to take bread out of their mouths? Are we going \nto let Americans continue to send these inferior crabs into France? And \nthen they would take down the picture of the French crab, with its \nscientific name, and he would put up a picture of the Alaskan king \ncrab, and he would say: Can anyone say that is a crab?\n\n  Then he would put up a table showing a family tree of the crab. He \nwould show the crummy little French crab at the top, and the Florida \nstone crab and the Alaskan king crab, way down here. He might even \nargue that genetically, the Alaskan king crab is closer to being a \nlobster than to being a crab. I don't know. I have not looked at the \ncrab family tree.\n  Then he would say: We cannot allow these Americans to call this thing \na crab. So he might suggest to the French parliament: Let us call it \nsome scientific name that would scare consumers to death, like a giant \nsea spider.\n  Now you go into a grocery store in France, and you see these Alaskan \nking crab--superior to any crab grown in France, and cheaper to boot--\nand it is labeled in French ``giant sea spider.'' Why would it be \ncalled a giant sea spider instead of a crab? Because the French crab \ngrower does not want people to buy it.\n  That sums up what this debate is about. How can you sell catfish when \nyou can't call it catfish? If the suggestion were to require that the \ncatfish be labeled ``Vietnamese catfish,'' I would vote for it. I don't \nthink that is a good idea nor one that would benefit me. I don't get \nall these arguments about it being unpatriotic to buy some product from \nanother country at the same time that we want them to buy things from \nus. I don't understand it. I think that view is a road to poverty. I \nthink that that view is what politicians have done to their people for \nthousands of years.\n  The new thinking, the new revolution is trade. But what this is \nabout--with the best of intentions--is the fact that we have \ncompetition in catfish. It has gotten cheaper. The consumer has \nbenefitted, real income has risen, and nutrition levels are up because \ncatfish now is cheaper.\n  What we are debating now is an effort to take what the Internet \nreference database used by the scientists call a ``catfish'' and say \nthey don't know what they are talking about because it is not a \ncatfish. Just like the French might say the Alaskan king crab is not a \ncrab. Instead we will force the Vietnamese catfish farmers to market \ntheir catfish under a name that nobody knows. Who knows what ``basa'' \nis?\n  Let us say that I am a low-income person. I am looking at every \npenny. I am working. I have gotten off welfare. I am going to the \ngrocery store to buy a product: catfish. So I go to the catfish \ncounter, and I see catfish. It looks kind of high in price. Then I see \nbasa over here. It looks like catfish, but I don't know if it is \ncatfish.\n  Is forcing sellers to call a product by a name that has nothing to do \nwith our common knowledge of the product an insurmountable obstacle to \ntrade? I believe that it is. I believe that any trade panel impaneled \nanywhere in the world would rule that this practice is an unfair trade \npractice. If scientists say it is a catfish, why don't we say it is a \ncatfish? Why would we say it is not a catfish? If there were no \nsignificant imports of Vietnamese catfish, would we be in a debate \nabout whether this is catfish?\n  If this were a gathering of ichthyologists--the name for people who \nstudy fish--would we be debating whether this catfish is a catfish? No, \nwe would not be debating it. We are debating it because people want \nprotection. I understand why they want it. I am not saying some people \nmay not be hurt without the protection, without destroying the ability \nof a competitor to compete.\n  But my point is this: We are the greatest exporting nation in the \nworld. Protectionist efforts are being directed at us all over the \nworld. Similar debates are occurring in every parliament and every \ncongress on Earth. In fact, right now there are efforts in the European \nCommunity to change our ability to market U.S. sardines. And the French \nhave tried to label foreign scallops as not being scallops. I can't \npronounce the French name for scallops. Why are they doing that? Is not \na scallop a scallop? Quite frankly, even though the French scallops are \nsmaller, they are superior to ocean scallops. Why are they doing that \nin France?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that the suit was \nbrought against France for exactly that--mislabeling scallops? The \nUnited States is one of them. WTO ultimately ruled against the French \nand changed the regulation, as they will rule against this. But it \nwould take years to do it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why do the French want to say a scallop is not a scallop? \nBecause they wanted to cheat French consumers. They wanted to make \nFrench consumers consume their domestically produced scallops rather \nthan being able to buy scallops from around the whole world.\n  Why is concern focused only on the people who produce things and not \nthe people who consume things? How extraordinarily different that world \nview is. Quite frankly, when I look to the future, it frightens me that \nat the very time when we are seeing developing countries start to open \nup trade, developed countries are restricting trade. We are the \ngreatest trading country in the world, with the largest export and the \nlargest import base of any country on the planet. Yet somehow something \nis said to be wrong.\n  I am reminded of Pericles, who gave the funeral oration each year in \nAthens to honor those who had died during the Peloponnesian War. Other \nthan the Gettysburg Address, probably the most famous speech ever given \nwas Pericles's funeral oration. It is very interesting that of all the \nthings Pericles could have chosen to show the greatness about Athens, \nhe picked out trade, and specifically, imports. He didn't pick out \nexports, although he could have said that if you go all over the world \nyou will find products from Athens. But he didn't say that. He said: \n``Because of the greatness of our city, the fruits of the whole earth \nflow in upon us, so that we enjoy the goods of other countries as \nfreely as of our own.'' To Pericles, that fact represented the \ngreatness of Athens.\n\n[[Page S13435]]\n\n  But yet, in America, the greatest, richest, freest country in \nhistory, we are debating a proposal that a catfish is not a catfish \nbecause catfish are too cheap and we want to restrict competition by \nforcing people who produce catfish in Vietnam to call it something \nother than catfish. Quite frankly I think that is a problem.\n  Let me make a couple of other points.\n  What is a red snapper? I thought I knew what a red snapper from the \ngulf was. I am sure the Presiding Officer, if I asked him to draw a \npicture of a red snapper, would draw the same picture of a red snapper: \na red fish that is kind of flat. But if you asked Senator Stevens or \nSenator Murkowski to draw a red snapper, they would draw a very \ndifferent fish because, in fact, the red snapper of the gulf coast is a \nvery different product from the red snapper of Alaska. Should we pass a \nlaw that says you can call one a red snapper but not the other? Would \nthat make any sense?\n  I have already talked about crab, and the example of the French \nparliamentarian. Can you imagine the great passion he could muster in \nmaking his argument--an argument that quite frankly, would be a better \ncase than we have here? The difference between the Alaskan king crab \nand the crummy little French crab is far starker than the difference \nbetween these two catfish.\n  All over the world today, this very same debate is going on about \nwhat is crab and what is not crab, what are scallops and what are not \nscallops, or what are sardines and what are not sardines. Does this \ndebate serve any purpose other than to cheat people, to limit trade, \nand to produce declining living standards?\n  Finally, let me say that this effort won't end with seafood. Is pima \ncotton the same thing as short-strand cotton? Is the cotton produced in \nArizona and West Texas the same cotton that is produced in Georgia and \ncentral Texas? Is Egyptian cotton the same as U.S. cotton? Could we not \nfind ourselves in a similar debate over, literally, buying sheets?\n  I have a son who is getting married on the 19th of January. I have \nbecome an expert on bedding. When you want to give someone the nicest \nsheets, you get sheets made of pima cotton or Egyptian cotton, because \nthat is long-strand cotton. And you look for a large number of threads \nper square inch.\n  If the United States Senate changes by legislation what catfish is \nfor the purpose of trade--even though scientists classify catfish \ndifferently--is it hard to imagine that we might actually see a \nproposal that says Egyptian cotton is not cotton? Is that out of \nanybody's imagination? It is not out of my imagination. We could \nliterally have a situation where a superior product--long-strand \ncotton--could not be sold because it was not allowed to be called \ncotton and consumers were not able to know what it was.\n  I understand cotton. I must be like every other Member of Congress in \nthat I have been given thousands of T-shirts every year. If it is not \n100-percent cotton, I give it away. First I give it to my staff. If \nthey don't want it, I send it off to somebody who is collecting \nclothes. It is not that I would take it if it said ``Free Love'' or \nsomething like that on it. But I want 100-percent cotton.\n  What if, for political reasons, we started saying that some kinds of \ncotton are not cotton? The only reason someone would want to do that \nwould be to impede trade. The purpose of this effort to prevent the use \nof the name ``catfish''--the name used by fisheries scientists--for \nimported catfish is to impede trade.\n  Catfish, at the end of the day, is important to our trading partners \nin Vietnam. We could cheat them. And we could cheat catfish consumers, \nwho probably would never know it. The millions of people who eat \ncatfish have no idea that we are debating this today.\n  I am guessing that some catfish producers are looking over my \nshoulder and sending letters back to Texarkana or the Golden Triangle--\nwhere people grow catfish--asking whether Phil Gramm cares about \ncatfish producers. Yet nobody is looking over my shoulder asking \nwhether I care about the catfish consumer.\n  This is how bad law is made. Even though nobody other than a few \ncatfish producers is ever going to know how senators vote, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote with Senator McCain because this is an important \nissue. If we start changing names to impede trade, who is more \nvulnerable to this kind of cheating than the United States of America? \nIf we can do this to Vietnamese catfish, it can be done to every \nagricultural product that we produce.\n  In fact, it is being done to our beef exports today in Europe using \nphony science. The scientific community says growth hormones have no \nimpact. Yet the Europeans, for protectionist reasons, have reached the \nconclusion they do. It is limiting American cattle growers and it is \ncheating Europeans out of a superior diet.\n  The problem with cheating in little ways in trade is that it \nundercuts our credibility when we tell other nations to treat people \nfairly and to respect free trade.\n  I want to make one final argument. I know people flinch when I say \nit, but it needs to be said. I personally do not believe that the \nVietnamese or the Chinese or anybody else will put us out of the \ncatfish industry. But God did not guarantee that people have a right to \nbe in the catfish business. I did not get to play in the NBA or the \nNFL. I did not get to act in movies. Nobody guaranteed me those rights. \nIf other people can produce a catfish product that is better and \ncheaper than our catfish, what is wrong with letting consumers buy that \ncatfish and letting us engage in the production of products that we do \nbetter?\n  One final point, and then I will end my statement. Trade creates \nprogress and increases living standards. Take textiles. For years, \npolitical representatives of the South tried to protect textiles--a \nlow-wage industry that in the old days provided very poor working \nconditions and very poor benefits. By the way, Americans pay twice as \nmuch for their clothing as they would pay if we had free trade in \ntextiles. Our textile policy literally steals money out of the pockets \nof working men and women in America, and cheats them every day through \nprotectionism in textiles.\n  Now any job is a godsend to anybody who wants to work. But Senator \nMcCain and I recently were in South Carolina together campaigning at a \nBMW plant. I was struck by the fact that the old textile plants had \ngone broke anyway, and the same people who had worked in the textile \nmills now were working at BMW at three times the wages and with \nsubstantially better working conditions.\n  I urge my colleagues: Let's not get into the business of saying that \na catfish is not a catfish for a quick benefit today, because in 100 or \n1,000 or 10,000 other ways the same game can be practiced on us. And we \nare far more vulnerable than the poor Vietnamese because they do not \nproduce and sell many things. We produce and sell things all over the \nworld. And when we start this kind of business, it encourages others to \ndo the same against us. Certainly then the impact would become \nsignificant enough that people would pay attention.\n  So I thank Senator McCain. His objection to this proposal is in part \nbecause the proposal is unfair, and in part because of the way the \nproposal was enacted. But as trivial as this issue may seem now, at \n4:35 on the 18th of December, when we should long ago have gone to our \nhomes and made merry with our families--as trivial as it sounds at the \nmoment, saying that a catfish is not a catfish for political reasons is \ndangerous business. It may benefit a few producers--although not the \nconsumers, who nobody cares about--in a couple of States today, but it \ncould hurt every State in the Union and every consumer in the world \ntomorrow. That is why Senator McCain is right on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that Senator McCain is offering \nan amendment to the farm bill which would strike a key provision of the \nfiscal year 2002 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report. Earlier \nthis year, the House and Senate sent to the President an Agriculture \nAppropriations report which contained language banning the commercial \nand legal use of the word ``catfish'' by importers and restaurants for \nthe Vietnamese basafish. I rise to support our earlier conference \nagreement, and I voice my opposition to the McCain amendment to the \nfarm bill. As many of you know, the domestic catfish industry is very \nimportant to my home State of Mississippi. Commercially-raised North\n\n[[Page S13436]]\n\nAmerican catfish farms and processing facilities bring jobs and \nbenefits to many people living in the communities of the Mississippi \nDelta, one of the poorest regions in America. I fear that the McCain \namendment will undo much of the hard work by private companies and \ngovernment officials to bring economic development to this region.\n  I have heard from catfish producers and processors in Mississippi, \nAlabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana regarding the unfair marketing of the \nVietnamese basafish as a ``catfish'' in stores and markets across the \nentire country. I agree with their arguments that by permitting this \nVietnamese fish to be imported and marketed as a ``catfish'' the Food \nand Drug Administration, FDA, is allowing customers to be misinformed \nand defrauded. Domestic catfish industry officials rightfully fear they \nwill lose revenue and that their businesses and workers' livelihoods \nwill be endangered.\n  The scientific fact is that the basafish is not closely related to \nthe North American channel catfish and thus should be commercially and \nlegally identified as a separate variety of fish so that American \nconsumers are fully informed as to what they are buying.\n  The Vietnamese basafish and the North American channel catfish are as \ngenetically-related to one another as a cow and a pig. All we want is \nfor the FDA to provide the same scientifically-based commercial \ndistinction between these two items as they give between beef and pork. \nWe want sound science to define what is a catfish and what is not. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the attached taxonomic chart be \nprinted in the Record following my statement to reinforce the above \nargument.\n  Now, some will argue that the fiscal year 2002 Agriculture \nAppropriations report discourages free trade. I disagree with such an \nassessment. It is not our intention to ban the importation of the \nVietnamese basafish into the United States through this legislation. \nThe fiscal year 2002 Agriculture Appropriations report will only \nrequire the FDA to recognize what science does, that this fish is not a \n``catfish.''\n  I believe that the Agriculture Appropriations report actually \nencourages fair trade between America and emerging markets like \nVietnam. Throughout this past year, my constituent catfish producers \nand processors have expressed their willingness and ability to compete \nhead-to-head with consumers against the Vietnamese basafish for the \nfrozen filet market demand, provided that Federal and State regulators \ndirect importers and restaurants to honestly and correctly market the \nVietnamese basafish as a Vietnamese basafish and not as a ``catfish''. \nUnder a regulatory system based on sound science my constituents are \nconfident that the North American channel catfish will easily outsell \nthe Vietnamese basafish in the United States.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for fair trade, sound science, and \ninformed consumers by opposing the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to draw my colleagues' attention to \nan action Congress recently took, but which they most likely know \nnothing about, a severe restriction on all catfish imports into the \nUnited States. Much more is at stake here than trade in strange-looking \nfish with whiskers. In fact, this import barrier has grave implications \nfor the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement, for our trade relations \nwith a host of nations, and for American consumers and fishermen. \nAmerica's commitment to free trade, and the prosperity we enjoy as a \nresult of open trade policies, have been put at risk by a small group \nof Members of Congress on behalf of the catfish industry in their \nStates, without debate or a vote in the Congress. Consequently, \nSenators Gramm, Kerry, and I are offering an amendment to the farm bill \nto elevate the national interest over these parochial interests by \nstripping this narrow-minded import restriction from the books and \nensuring that we define ``catfish'' for trade purposes in a way that \nreflects sound science, not the politics of protectionism.\n  During consideration of the Senate version of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2002, I voiced deep concern about \nthe managers' decision to ``clear'' a package of 35 amendments just \nbefore final passage of the bill. The vast majority of Senators had \nreceived no information about the content of these amendments and had \nhad no chance to review them.\n  As it turns out, I had good reason to be concerned. Included in the \nmanagers' package was an innocuous-sounding amendment banning the Food \nand Drug Administration from using any funds to process imports of fish \nor fish products labeled as ``catfish'' unless the fish have a certain \nLatin family name. In fact, of the 2,500 species of catfish on Earth, \nthis amendment allows the FDA to process only a certain type raised in \nNorth America, and specifically those that grow in six southern States. \nThe practical effect is to restrict all catfish imports into our \ncountry by requiring that they be labeled as something other than \ncatfish, an underhanded way for U.S. catfish producers to shut out the \ncompetition. With a clever trick of Latin phraseology and without even \na ceremonial nod to the vast body of trade laws and practices we \nrigorously observe, this damaging amendment, slipped into the managers' \npackage and ultimately signed into law as part of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, literally bans Federal officials from processing \nany and all catfish imports labeled as what they are, catfish.\n  Proponents of this ban used the insidious technique of granting \nownership of the term ``catfish'' to only North American catfish \ngrowers, as if southern agribusinesses have exclusive rights to the \nname of a fish that is farmed around the world, from Brazil to \nThailand. According to the Food and Drug Administration and the \nAmerican Fisheries Society, the Pangasius species of catfish imported \nfrom Vietnam and other countries are ``freshwater catfishes of Africa \nand southern Asia.'' In addition, current FDA regulations prohibit \nthese products from being labeled simply as ``catfish.'' Under existing \nregulations, a qualifier such as ``basa'' or ``striped'' must accompany \nthe term ``catfish'' so that consumers are able to make an informed \nchoice about what they're eating.\n  These fish were indeed catfish until Congress, with little review and \nno debate, determined them not to be. No other animal or plant name has \nbeen defined in statute this way. All other acceptable market names for \nfish are determined by the FDA, in cooperation with the National Marine \nFisheries Service, after a review of scientific literature and market \npractices.\n  What are the effects of this import restriction? As with any \nprotectionist measure, blocking trade and relying on only domestic \nproduction will increase the price of catfish for the many Americans \nwho enjoy eating it. One in three seafood restaurants in America serves \ncatfish, attesting to its popularity. This trade ban will raise the \nprices wholesalers and their retail customers pay for catfish, and \nAmericans who eat catfish will feel that price increase, a price \nincrease imposed purely to line the pockets of Southern agribusinesses \nand their lobbyists, who have conducted a scurrilous campaign against \nforeign catfish for the most parochial reasons.\n  The ban on catfish imports has other grave implications. It patently \nviolates our solemn trade agreement with Vietnam, the very same trade \nagreement the Senate ratified by a vote of 88-12 only two months ago. \nThe ink was not yet dry on that agreement when the catfish lobby and \ntheir Congressional allies slipped their midnight amendment into a \nmust-pass appropriations bill.\n  Over the last 10 years, our Nation has engaged in a gradual process \nof normalizing diplomatic and trade relations with Vietnam. Our \nengagement has yielded results: the prosperity and daily freedoms of \nthe Vietnamese people have increased as Vietnam has opened to the \nworld. The engine of this change has been the rapid economic growth \nbrought about by an end to the closed economy under which the \nVietnamese people stagnated during the 1980s. Many Americans, including \nmany veterans, who have visited Vietnam have been struck by these \nchanges, and the potential for capitalism in Vietnam to advance our \ninterest in freedom and democracy there. We have a long way to go, but \nwe are planting the seeds of progress through our engagement with the \nVietnamese, as reflected most recently in ratification of the bilateral \ntrade agreement\n\n[[Page S13437]]\n\nby both the United States Senate and the Vietnamese National Assembly. \nIndeed, the trade agreement only took effect this week.\n  This trade agreement is the pinnacle of the normalization process \nbetween our countries. It completes the efforts of four American \npresidents to establish normal relations between the United States and \nVietnam. It is the institutional anchor of our relationship with \nVietnam, the 14th-largest nation on Earth, and one with which we share \na number of important interests.\n  Yet in the wake of such historic progress, and after preaching for \nyears to the Vietnamese about the need to get government out of the \nbusiness of micromanaging the economy, we have sadly implicated \nourselves in the very sin our trade policy claims to reject. The \namendment slipped into the Agriculture Appropriations bill openly \nviolates the national treatment provisions of our trade agreement with \nVietnam, in a troubling example of the very parochialism we have urged \nthe Vietnamese government to abandon by ratifying the agreement.\n  The amendment Senator Gramm and I are offering today would repeal \nthis import restriction on catfish. Our amendment would define \n``catfish'' according to existing FDA procedures that follow scientific \nstandards and market practices.\n  Not only is the restrictive catfish language offensive in principle \nto our free trade policies, our recent overwhelming ratification of the \nBilateral Trade Agreement, and our relationship with Vietnam; it also \nflagrantly disregards the facts about the catfish trade. I'd like to \nrebut this campaign of misinformation by setting straight these facts, \nas reported by agricultural officials at our embassy in Hanoi who have \ninvestigated the Vietnamese catfish industry in depth.\n  The U.S. Embassy in Vietnam summarizes the situation in this way: \n``Based on embassy discussions with Vietnamese government and industry \nofficials and a review of recent reports by U.S.-based experts, the \nembassy does not believe there is evidence to support claims that \nVietnamese catfish exports to the United States are subsidized, \nunhealthy, undermining, or having an `injurious' impact on the catfish \nmarket in the U.S.'' Our embassy goes on to state: ``In the case of \ncatfish, the embassy has found little or no evidence that the U.S. \nindustry or health of the consuming public is facing a threat from \nVietnam's emerging catfish export industry. . . .Nor does there appear \nto be substance to claims that catfish raised in Vietnam are less \nhealthy than [those raised in] other countries.'' The U.S. embassy \nreports the following: Subsidies: American officials indicate that the \nVietnamese government provides no direct subsidies to its catfish \nindustry; Health and Safety Standards: The embassy is unable to \nidentify any evidence to support claims that Vietnamese catfish are of \nquestionable quality and may pose health risks. FDA officials have \nvisited Vietnam and have confirmed quality standards there. U.S. \nimporters of Vietnamese catfish are required to certify that their \nimports comply with FDA requirements, and FDA inspections certify that \nthese imports meet American standards; A normal increase in imports: \nThe embassy finds no evidence to suggest that Vietnam is purposely \ndirecting catfish exports to the United States to establish market \nshare; and Labeling: The Vietnamese reached an agreement with the FDA \non a labeling scheme to differentiate Vietnamese catfish from American \ncatfish in U.S. retail markets. As our embassy reports, the primary \nobjective should be to provide American consumers with informed \nchoices, not diminish the choice by restricting imports.\n  The facts are clear, the midnight amendment passed without a vote is \nbased not on any concern for the health and well-being of the American \nconsumer. The restriction on catfish imports slipped into the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill serves only the interests of the \ncatfish producers in six southern States who profit by restricting the \nchoice of the American consumer by banning the competition.\n  The catfish lobby's advertising campaign on behalf of its \nprotectionist agenda has few facts to rely on to support its case, so \nit stands on scurrilous fear-mongering to make its claim that catfish \nraised in good old Mississippi mud are the only fish with whiskers safe \nto eat. One of these negative advertisements, which ran in the national \ntrade weekly Supermarket News, tells us in shrill tones, ``Never trust \na catfish with a foreign accent!'' This ad characterizes Vietnamese \ncatfish as dirty and goes on to say, ``They've grown up flapping around \nin Third World rivers and dining on whatever they can get their fins \non. . . .Those other guys probably couldn't spell U.S. even if they \ntried.'' How enlightened.\n  I believe a far more accurate assessment is provided in the Far \nEastern Economic Review, in its feature article on this issue: ``For a \nbunch of profit-starved fisherfolk, the U.S. catfish lobby had deep \nenough pockets to wage a highly xenophobic advertising campaign against \ntheir Vietnamese competitors.''\n  Unfortunately, this protectionist campaign against catfish imports \nhas global repercussions. Peru has brought a case against the European \nUnion in the World Trade Organization because the Europeans have \nclaimed exclusive rights to the use of the word ``sardine'' for trade \npurposes. The Europeans would define sardines to be sardines only if \nthey are caught off European waters, thereby threatening the sardine \nfisheries in the Western Hemisphere. Prior to passage of the catfish-\nlabeling language in the Agriculture Appropriations bill, the United \nStates Trade Representative had committed to file a brief supporting \nPeru's position before the WTO that such a restrictive definition \nunfairly protected European fishermen at the expense of sardine \nfishermen in the Western Hemisphere. Like the Peruvians, a large number \nof American fishermen would suffer the effects of an implicit European \nimport ban on the sardines that are their livelihood.\n  Yet as a direct consequence of the passage of the restrictive \ncatfish-labeling language in the Agriculture Appropriations bill, USTR \nhas withdrawn its brief supporting the Peruvian position in the sardine \ncase against the European Union because the catfish amendment written \ninto law makes the United States guilty of the same type of \nprotectionist labeling scheme for which we have brought suit against \nthe Europeans in the WTO. The WTO has previously ruled against such \nmanipulation of trade definitions which, if allowed to stand in this \ncase, could be used as a precedent to close off foreign markets to a \nnumber of U.S. products. I doubt the sponsors of the restrictive \ncatfish language in the Agriculture Appropriations bill happily \ncontemplate the potential of the Pandora's Box they have opened.\n  This blanket restriction on catfish imports, passed without debate \nand without a vote on its merits, has no place in our laws. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in striking it from the books and allowing \nscience, not politics, to define what a catfish is by supporting our \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of Senator McCain's \namendment. This amendment would repeal a provision in the recently \nenacted Agriculture Appropriations bill that prohibits for the current \nfiscal year, the FDA from using any funds to process imports of fish or \nfish products labeled as ``catfish'' unless the fish have a certain \nscientific family name that is only found in North America. The House-\npassed version of the Farm bill contains a similar provision that would \nmake the ban on imports permanent. The amendment we are offering seeks \nto reverse this position as well.\n  A number of scientific classification organizations have identified \nover 30 distinct families of catfish world-wide and over 2,500 \ndifferent species within these families. Quite frankly, the \nclassification of species is a subject that I think is best left with \nthe scientific community and the experts at the National Marine \nFisheries Service and the Food and Drug Administration. I understand \nthe concerns of the American catfish industry, however these kinds of \ntrade wars only lead to our trading partners enacting similar \nprotectionist measures against U.S. food producers.\n  For example, the European Union has passed a provision that prohibits \nthe use of the word sardine for anything other than the European \nspecies of sardine. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative was \narguing to the World\n\n[[Page S13438]]\n\nTrade Organization that the EU's new import policy restricting the \nlabeling of sardines was unfair. After all, North American herring are \na part of the sardine family, just like Vietnamese basa is part of the \ncatfish family. Once the Agriculture Conference Report became law \nhowever, with its one year ban on imported catfish, everything stopped. \nAmerican fishermen and processors in the Northeast have the Peruvian \nand Canadian governments to thank for stepping in to file a complaint \nwith the WTO; otherwise American fishermen and processors have little \nhope of ever entering into the EU export market.\n  Back in 1993 the French government attempted a similar provision for \nscallops. Only European caught scallops could be sold as ``Noix de \nCoquille Saint-Jacques'', which reduced the market value of imported \nscallops by 25 percent. The U.S. and a number of other nations \nprotested to the WTO and overturned the decision.\n  The U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement, which came into force \nthis week, requires that each country give ``national treatment'' to \nthe products of the other country when those products share a likeness \nwith domestic products. By denying American importers the right to \nbring in Vietnamese catfish under the name ``catfish'', the provision \nenacted in the Agricultural Appropriations Conference report, and the \nlanguage in the House-passed farm bill, violate the trade agreement by \ndenying the same treatment to Vietnamese catfish as we give to American \nraised catfish.\n  The U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement is a vehicle for opening the \nVietnamese economy to American goods and services. It is the precursor \nto a WTO agreement. For the United States to violate the letter and the \nspirit of that agreement by restricting the importation of Vietnamese \ncatfish will undermine the process of implementation of that agreement \nbefore it has even begun.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that Brazil, Thailand, and Guyana are \nall members of the WTO and all three countries also export catfish to \nthe U.S. This provision would deny them access to our markets as well, \nand I would not be surprised if they successfully protest this matter \nto the WTO should we choose not to repeal this provision.\n  I understand the desire of my colleagues in the Senate and the House \nto try to help their domestic catfish farmers who have hit on hard \ntimes. I believe one of the ways to do this is to make it clear to the \nAmerican consumer where the fish that they are purchasing comes from. \nExisting FDA and Customers regulations require country of origin \nlabeling on catfish that is imported by U.S. companies. In fact, one of \nthose importers in my home State of Massachusetts has shown me the \nlabel on his catfish. It leaves no doubt about the origin of the fish. \nHowever, I believe we should go a step further to include country of \norigin labeling for fish products at the consumer level as well. \nConsumers have a right to know where their food comes from.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the precedent of \narbitrarily determining the acceptable market name of any fish. We have \nnever before set into statute a market name for any animal or plant. In \nthe case of fish, the Food and Drug Administration works with the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service to review the available scientific \nliterature and common market practices. They will then provide the \nfishing industry with guidance on acceptable names for their catch. \nThis is to ensure that the consumers are getting what they expect.\n  We have seen other countries draw arbitrary lines in the sand. In \n1995, the French tried to say that only the local French scallop could \nbe called by their common name, ``coquilles St. Jacques.'' The result \nwas that scallop fishermen in the United States who export their catch \nto France were essentially blocked from the market. You simply can't \ncreate a new name for a scallop and have consumers recognize what it \nis.\n  Peru and Chile challenged the French restriction at the WTO. The \nUnited States filed briefs in support of that challenge. The WTO ruled \nthat the French restriction had no scientific basis and could not \nstand.\n  Unfortunately, that was not the end of this trend of discriminatory \nnaming practices. Right now, the European Union has a restriction in \nplace that prevents U.S. sardine fishermen from both the east and west \ncoasts from selling their catch using any form of the word ``sardine.'' \nFishermen in my home State are even prevented from clearly identifying \ntheir product as not being from the EU and selling their fish as \n``Maine sardines'' as they had in the past.\n  This restriction is also being appealed at the WTO by Peru. The U.S. \nTrade Representative had been working with the U.S. sardine fishermen \nto file a brief in support of this challenge. As a result of the \nlanguage included into the Fiscal Year 2002 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill, however, the USTR determined that filing such a brief would be \ncontrary to statute. As a result, the U.S. sardine fishermen have to \nrely on the Peruvian Government to prove the scientific merits of the \ncase and regain their market access.\n  We must put a stop to this trend of arbitrary and discriminatory \nfisheries naming practices. In 2000, the United States exported over \n$10 billion worth of edible and non-edible fish and shellfish. This was \na $900 million increase over 1999. Access to foreign markets is \nabsolutely critical to our fishermen, and these naming practices only \nserve to undercut their efforts. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \njoin with me in supporting the amendment before us.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to an \namendment which would repeal a provision in current law restricting the \nuse of the term ``catfish.''\n  The FY 2002 Agriculture appropriations conference report, recently \nsigned into law, restricts the use of the term catfish to the family of \nfish that is present in North America.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a campaign of misinformation about what \nthis provision does, and I want to take this opportunity to set the \nrecord straight.\n  First, the provision in the agriculture appropriations bill does NOT \nstop the importation of Vietnamese fish into the U.S. That would be a \nviolation of the recently approved Vietnam trade agreement.\n  Rather, this provision only requires the fish to be called what they \nreally are--they are ``basa'' fish and not catfish.\n  We learned in biology class about the classification of living \nthings. We classify living organisms from kingdom on down to species.\n  Specifically, the subcategories are: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, \nFamily, Genus, Species.\n  Vietnamese ``basa'' fish are not the same species as North American \nchannel catfish. They are not of the same genus either. They aren't \neven in the same family of fish.\n  These two fish are only in the same order.\n  Well guess what. Humans are in the same order--primates--as gorillas \nand lemurs.\n  We don't say that lemurs and humans are close enough to call them the \nsame thing.\n  What about other animals? Pigs and cows are in the same order.\n  If an importer was shipping pork into the U.S. and passing it off to \nconsumers as beef, we would rightly be outraged.\n  Some in the Senate may say that the taxonomy of fish is different. So \nlet's take a look at an example of my point using trout and salmon.\n  Atlantic salmon and lake trout are closer to each other than basa \nfish and North American channel catfish.\n  They are in the same family of fish, yet we do not say that salmon \nand trout should both be called salmon.\n  It is a similar story here: the closest a Vietnamese basa fish is to \na North American channel catfish is that they are in the same order. \nThere are over 2,200 species in this order of fish.\n  The opponents of this provision say that because both fish have \nwhiskers, they both must be catfish.\n  Do we call all animals with stripes zebras? Do we call all animals \nwith spots leopards? Of course we don't. Similarly, because the fish \nhas whiskers does not mean that it is a catfish.\n  The whiskers on fish are called barbels, and a number of species have \nthem, including the black drum, some sturgeon, the goat fish, the blind \nfish, and the nurse shark.\n\n[[Page S13439]]\n\n  By restricting the use of the word catfish to those species that \nactually ARE catfish, we can reduce widespread consumer confusion. \nSubstituting species is extremely misleading to consumers.\n  These ``basa'' fish are being shipped into the United States labeled \nas catfish. These labels claim that the frozen fish filets are cajun \ncatfish or imply that they are from the Mississippi Delta.\n  In fact, they are from the Mekong Delta in South Vietnam.\n  As a result, American consumers believe that they are purchasing and \neating U.S. farm-raised catfish when in fact they are eating Vietnamese \n``basa.''\n  The Vietnamese fish sold as catfish continue to be found to be \nfraudulently marketed under names that the Food and Drug Administration \nhas determined to be fictitious.\n  These names are used to misrepresent imports as U.S. farm-raised \nfish. The provision that we have previously passed will reduce this \nconsumer confusion.\n  Since 1997, the import volume of frozen fish fillets from Vietnam \nthat are imported and sold as ``catfish'' has increased at incredibly \nhigh rates.\n  The volume has risen from less than 500,000 pounds to over 7 million \npounds per year in the previous 3 years.\n  The trend has continued this year--the Vietnamese penetration into \nthe U.S. catfish filet market alone has tripled in the last year from \nabout 7 percent of the market to 23 percent.\n  The law of the United States and most countries seek to protect \nconsumers by preventing one species of fish to be marketed under the \npreexisting established market name of another species.\n  When the Vietnamese fish in question first started to be marketed \nsignificantly in the U.S., importers sought and received approval of \nthe name ``basa'' from the FDA.\n  However, some importers of the lower priced Vietnamese fish sold that \nfish as ``catfish'' to customers.\n  The name ``catfish'' was already established in the U.S. market for \nthe North American species.\n  FDA has the legal responsibility to prevent ``economic adulteration'' \nof food products in the U.S. market.\n  FDA has described ``species substitution'' in seafood as an example \nof ``economic adulteration.''\n  FDA in recent years, however, has not taken an active role in \nenforcing these laws, and efforts made by the American farm-raised \ncatfish industry to obtain enforcement went largely ignored.\n  To make matters worse, the FDA in August of 2000, at the request of \nimport interests, authorized the Vietnamese fish to be marketed under \nthe name ``basa catfish.''\n  My colleague from Arizona has mentioned on the Senate floor that this \nprovision was done to protect the interests of ``rich'' agribusinesses \nin Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana.\n  I invite him to come visit the Alabama Black Belt, one of the poorest \nareas in the United States, and see these operations for himself.\n  It is clear to me that this effort to go back and strike \nappropriations language is an effort being made on behalf of rich \nimporters who are substituting this Vietnamese fish for channel \ncatfish.\n  In spite of full knowledge of the legality of substituting one fish \nspecies for another, importers are making more and more money passing \noff basa fish as channel catfish.\n  U.S. catfish producers and processors have spent years creating a \nsuccessful market for their fish.\n  The Vietnamese and importers are taking advantage of this established \nmarket by substituting the basa fish for catfish.\n  The provision in the agriculture appropriations bill makes it clear \nto importers that the practice of species substitution is unlawful. \nThis is no change in substantive law.\n  Nothing in the legislation imposes any restriction on the importation \nof Vietnamese fish of any kind. Nor does it prevent Vietnam or \nimporters from establishing a market for Vietnamese fish.\n  I encourage them to expand their market. Just don't substitute it for \nsomething that it is not.\n  U.S. catfish farm production, which occurs mainly in Alabama, \nMississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, accounts for 68 percent of the \npounds of fish sold and 50 percent of the total value of all U.S. \naquaculture, or fish farming, production. The areas where catfish \nproduction is greatest are in the Blackbelt of Alabama and the \nMississippi Delta.\n  These are some of the poorest areas of the United States, with \ndouble-digit unemployment rates. With depressed prices for almost all \nother agricultural commodities, catfish production is critical to the \nU.S. economy, and particularly to the economy of the South.\n  U.S. catfish farming is one of the few successful industries in these \nareas of the South, and the farmers, processors, and the regions are \nsuffering tremendously because of this dramatic surge in imports.\n  If the Vietnamese were raising North American channel catfish of good \nquality and importing them into the U.S., I would have no problem. That \nis fair trade.\n  Fair trade is not importing ``basa'' fish, labeling them as catfish, \nthereby taking advantage of an already established market, and passing \nthem off to American consumers as American catfish.\n  The Vietnamese and the importers need to play by the rules.\n  The provision in the agriculture appropriations bill simply clarifies \nexisting guidelines and sends a message that substituting these two \nspecies is fraud.\n  A vote in favor of the McCain amendment is a vote in favor of fraud, \nconsumer confusion and species substitution. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I feel constrained to say a couple things \nabout what my friend from Texas has said. I wrote this down when he \nsaid it because I thought it was a pretty astounding statement. He said \nthe end result of all economic activity is consumption. Think about \nthat: The end result of all economic activity is consumption.\n  Whether that is true or not, and if I were to go ahead and assert \nthat it was true, I do not think there is anything inconsistent with \nsaying people ought to know what they are consuming. But I would even \ngo further than that and say, from a learned former professor of \neconomics, I still find that an astounding statement; that the end \nresult of all economic activity is consumption. If that is the case, \nlet's bring back slavery. Hey, the cheapest thing for the consumers is \nto have free labor. Why not? Let's do away with all environmental laws \nthat protect the environment. Why not? If the end result is \nconsumption, then forget about all that nonsense. Worker safety laws? \nForget about all that nonsense, if the end result is simply \nconsumption.\n  I really think what this amendment is about, and others that are like \nit, is really more about transparency in markets, I say to my friend \nfrom Texas, who is an economist, transparency in markets, truth in \nlabeling, transparency, and information to the consumer.\n  If a country wanted to all of a sudden say that the horse meat they \neat is beef, could they sell it in this country as beef if that is what \nthey call it? It is red meat. They are in the same family of animals as \ncattle. They just call it beef. Why can't they sell it in this county? \nTruth in labeling, letting the consumer know what they are consuming, \nthat is what it is all about.\n  We have had a long discussion on this. I would like to bring this to \na close. I am going to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nArkansas get 5 minutes, the Senator from Mississippi wants 1 minute, \nand then for wrapup the Senator from Arizona will be recognized for 1 \nminute, after which time I would be recognized for a motion to table. I \nask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in my 5 minutes, I just want to say to \nthe Senator from Texas, I wish I could have been in his economics \nclass. I would have said ``amen'' to everything he said except his \ninitial supposition.\n\n[[Page S13440]]\n\n His initial supposition was that we are trying to change the name of \ncatfish. His initial supposition was there is no difference between a \nchannel catfish and a basa catfish, that they are all catfish so just \nsell them as catfish. After all, we do not want to change, we don't \nwant to get the truth. His basic supposition was wrong. And following \neverything after that initial supposition, you come to the wrong \nconclusion.\n  He said: Nobody cares about the consumer. What is best for the \nconsumer? Why isn't somebody asking about the consumer?\n  Let me just this one time associate myself with the Senator from \nIowa. I am concerned about the consumer. I am concerned about what the \nconsumer is going to consume, what he is going to eat. Doesn't he have \na right to know whether he is getting Vietnamese basa or he is getting \nchannel catfish? He ought to have the right to know that when he goes \nin that restaurant, that when they are selling it as channel catfish \nthat it is, in fact, channel catfish.\n  The Senator from Texas, in great eloquence and great entertainment, \nsaid what we want is protection. I don't want protection. I want \nhonesty.\n  I want truth. I want fairness. At some point a name has to mean \nsomething. We pointed out--this is not me; this isn't something I \ndreamed up; this is science--the reality is that a channel catfish and \na basa are not members of the same species. They are not members of the \nsame scientific family. The truth is, the fact is, Atlantic salmon and \na lake trout are more closely related than a channel catfish and basa.\n  I don't want protection. I want truth. I want the consumer to know \nwhat he or she is consuming. That is all in the world this provision \nwas in the Agriculture appropriations bill this year. It doesn't need \nto be rescinded. It needs to be sustained in this vote.\n  The Senator from Texas asked, what is the purpose of a name? The \npurpose of a name is to identify. If, in fact, basa was the same as \nchannel catfish, then I would say I am totally wrong; the catfish \ngrowers in the delta are totally wrong. But they are not the same. They \nare not the same fish. That should be reflected in what is labeled and \nwhat the American consumer knows he is getting.\n  I ask my colleagues not to help poor people in the delta--that \nobviously doesn't move some--I ask my colleagues to demand that our \ntrade be fair and that the American consumer be told the truth. It is, \nin fact, about transparency. I ask my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas for his very persuasive arguments on this issue today. He \nis absolutely right. There is not any effort being made to be unfair or \nto act inappropriately toward any legitimate importing concern selling \nfish or any other product in the United States.\n  What is important is that the consumers in the United States have the \ninformation so they know what they are buying. I have seen logos and \nadvertisements stamped on these fish cartons that say ``cajun \ncatfish.'' Immediately one assumes that it is from south Louisiana. \nThat is a distinctive name. It means something to the consumer in the \nsouthern part of the United States. That fish is basa fish from \nVietnam. It does not say so on the package.\n  Another package said ``delta catfish.'' You immediately assume you \nare talking about the Mississippi Delta from where 50 percent of the \naquaculture in the United States comes. But, no, that is the Mekong \nDelta that is being referred to in that package. It is misleading. It \nis unfair. It is unfair to those who have spent $50 million over time \nto develop a market for Lower Mississippi River Valley pond-raised \ncatfish. That is how much has been invested over a period of years.\n  Now it has become a food of choice for many Americans. They go into \nthe supermarket and now they buy what they see is delta catfish. But it \nis not what they think it is. That is unfair to them. That is what this \namendment seeks to correct. It simply says the Food and Drug \nAdministration ought to ensure that these fish are labeled so consumers \nknow what they are.\n  We have it from the National Warmwater Aquaculture Center that this \nbasa fish is not of the same family. It is not of the same species as \nis the delta pond-raised catfish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 1 minute.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think we ought to do something right \naway about dungeness crab and blue crabs. This is a remarkable argument \nwe have been having. This is about several issues. This is why it is \nimportant.\n  One, it is about process. In this place there are three kinds of \nSenators: Republican Senators, Democrat Senators, and appropriators. \nThis was done on an appropriations bill. This is a major policy change \nthat affects the lives of thousands and thousands of people. It was \ndone on an appropriations bill.\n  Two, it was inserted in a managers' amendment, in a managers' \namendment which none of us saw because I asked this body if anybody \nknew what was in the managers' amendment. Not one person said they \nknew, including the managers of the bill themselves.\n  Three, this is all about protectionism and free trade. If we do it \nhere, we will do it on something else, and we will do it on something \nelse, and we will do it on something else, whether it be crabs or \nwhether it be scallops or whether it be cattle or whatever it be in the \nname of protectionism and jobs.\n  I am a little bit offended when we talk about poor people. I will \ntake you where the poorest people in America live. That is on our \nIndian reservations in the State of Arizona. Let's not talk about poor \npeople. Those poor people who live on these Indian reservations would \nlike to eat catfish. They don't want it priced out of the market \nbecause we put some phony name on it.\n  There is a lot to do with this amendment besides the name of a \ncatfish. I hope my colleagues will restore a normal process where we \nhave an open and honest debate on major policies such as this rather \nthan being stuck in a managers' amendment. I hope we will recognize \nthat protectionism is not good for America. This is another \nmanifestation of it.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent, I move to \ntable the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms), the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Lott), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank both of the Senators from \nArkansas and the Senators from Mississippi. Senator Breaux and I join \nwith them in sponsoring this provision in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. I thank my colleagues for wisely defeating this \namendment.\n  Allow me to take a few moments to say that for Louisiana this is a \nvery important industry. Catfish farmers in Catahoula Parish, Franklin \nParish, and other parishes throughout our Mississippi Delta have spent \nyears and a lot of money, as the Senator from Mississippi knows, in \ndeveloping these farms and investing their hard-earned dollars in \nmarketing this product to a nation that was somewhat reluctant some \nyears ago to accept this. Now catfish is commonplace in restaurants \nacross the country.\n  Speaking for a State that represents the greatest restaurants in this \nNation, let me say it is not only the farmers who benefit, but also our \nrestaurants and our consumers. I thank the Senate for their wise \ntabling of the McCain amendment. I am for free trade but fair trade, \nand tabling this amendment was a step in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry for the information \nof all Senators: Am I correct the next order of business under the \nunanimous consent agreement is the Cochran-Roberts amendment, 2 hours \nevenly divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2671 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Roberts proposes an amendment numbered 2671 to amendment \n     No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, because the distinguished Senator from \nIowa is involved in a very important discussion on the economic \nstimulus bill, as a high ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, he is supposed to be in a meeting discussing that right now. \nHe is interested in this legislation, and I yield such time as he may \nconsume to comment on the Cochran-Roberts amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding me time. I will address one specific issue of the bill, which \nis the farmer savings account, and then I would like to speak to the \ntrade-distorting aspects of the farm bill legislation that is before \nus, which the Cochran-Roberts amendment takes into consideration and \nalleviates a lot of problems that other farm proposals before us have.\n  I will start with the farmer savings account. I want to make clear \nthe farmer savings account is not an idea that comes only from America. \nOther countries, not exactly as in this bill, have come up with the \nidea of farmer savings accounts to help sustain family farmers from two \nstandpoints: One, in a way that is not trade distorting and violative \nof the trading agreements; and, two, to continue support for the family \nfarmer in a way that is not trade distorting.\n  Few occupations face more uncertainties than agriculture. Each \nspring, farmers across the nation put their seed in the ground and pray \nfor sufficient rain and heat. A single storm during the growing season \ncan wipe out an entire year's work and place farmers in dire financial \ndistress. Each fall, farmers go to the fields to harvest their crops, \nthe value of which is completely subject to volatile and unpredictable \ncommodity markets.\n  As a result of these factors, farmers experience frequent cyclical \ndownturns in income which can make it difficult to continue their \noperations from one year to the next. Farmers need the ability to \noffset these cyclical downturns by deferring income from more \nprosperous years to use during the lean years.\n  The farmer savings accounts provision in the Roberts-Cochran title \nwould allow a producer to establish a farm counter-cyclical savings \naccount in the name of the producer in a bank or financial institution \nthat has been approved by the Ag Secretary. The Secretary would provide \na matching contribution that is equal to the amount deposited by the \nproducer into the account, up to a maximum of 2 percent of the average \nadjusted gross revenue of the producer.\n  A producer could withdraw the account funds from the account if the \nestimated net income for a year from the agricultural enterprises of \nthe producer is less than the adjusted gross revenue of the producer.\n  It is important to keep in mind that unlike other counter-cyclical \nprograms before the Senate, this counter-cyclical approach is not \ndependent on commodity prices, farm production, or farm income. \nTherefore, this approach is ``green-box,'' or fully compliant with our \ninternational trade obligations. It would not subject our farmers to \nthe possibility of retaliation by our trading partners.\n  Moreover, this amendment benefits producers of non-program \ncommodities that would otherwise be ineligible for assistance under our \nfederal farm support programs. Producers of livestock, fruits, and \nvegetables are often overlooked by our federal farm programs. This \namendment would give these producers the same counter-cyclical self-\nhelp program that it gives producers of program commodities.\n  In recent years, I have strongly advocated the creation of FARRM \naccounts to allow farmers to deposit funds in an account and defer \nincome taxes for 5 years. Of course, this legislation would have to be \nconsidered within the context of the Finance Committee.\n  The provision we are considering would ensure that matching \ncontributions equal to the amount deposited by the family farmer, up to \na maximum of 2 percent of the average adjusted gross revenue of the \nproducer, would be placed in special savings accounts.\n  I have been an advocate of this idea for a very long time. In fact, \nthis is similar to the provision I introduced in my own commodity title \nworking draft earlier this fall. This type of proposal will provide \nfarmers an incentive to save money when they have the money to save. \nWith this type of program, farmers can begin to fashion their own \ncountercyclical protection.\n  Now, this program sometimes is belittled with the fact that farmers \nare not making enough money to put away anything in savings. Let's not \ntry to set a pattern and assume something for 2.5 million farmers, \nbecause 2.5 million farmers are not one to the other the same; they \neach have different circumstances. We can provide an environment where \nthe farmer can make a determination for himself. This bill does that.\n  In addition, if we are successful in advancing this concept through \nthe Senate, I will push hard to protect these funds from up-front \ntaxable consequences by modifying the bipartsan farm accounts \nlegislation I have already introduced in the Senate.\n  In conclusion, I urge my Senate colleagues to support the Roberts-\nCochran amendment. This amendment will give all farmers the much-needed \nopportunity to help themselves through less prosperous years. And it \nmeets this need without risking a violation of our international trade \nagreements.\n  Now, when it comes to the trade issues, I don't think there has been \nenough discussion either in the other body or this body on the impact \nof various proposals on our trade agreements with the concern about \nwhether or not they violate trade agreements so we can be retaliated \nagainst. The Cochran-Roberts proposal takes that into consideration.\n\n[[Page S13442]]\n\n  Our family farmers are highly dependent on exports. For instance, in \na given year, the United States exports about one-quarter to one-third \nof the farm products it produces, either as agricultural commodities or \nin a value-added form. For the past 25 years, the U.S. has exported far \nmore agricultural goods than it has imported.\n  One of the principal benefits of the Uruguay Round negotiations, \nperhaps the most important benefit for U.S. agriculture, was the \nimproved condition of market access. For the first time, all \nagricultural tariffs were ``bound,'' and agricultural tariffs were \nreduced by 36 percent on average over a 6-year period.\n  In addition, the U.S. made a binding commitment not to exceed its \namber box spending limitation. Because we take our legally binding \ncommitments seriously, and because we want our trading partners to do \nthe same, we have never violated those commitments. Were we to do so, \nthe United States and its trading partners would likely be subjected to \nharmful trade retaliation.\n  What would retaliation mean for our family farmers?\n  If a WTO complaint were brought against the United States for \nexceeding its domestic support commitments, it is possible that many \ncountries could become complainants in the case and allege injury to \ntheir farmers and their economy.\n  If the U.S. were found in violation of our trade obligations, we \nwould be expected to change our current farm program, midstream. If we \nwere not able to, the complaining countries would receive authorization \nto retaliate by raising duties on U.S. goods.\n  The likely first target of any retaliation would be U.S. agricultural \nexports, because countries fashion their retaliation lists to pressure \nthe non-complaint country to change its practices. The products chosen \nfor retaliation are those that are the most successful exports.\n  For example, U.S. exports of animal feed products and components \ncould be targeted. This could affect corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, pork, \nor any of our agricultural exports. However, a country would not be \nlimited to agricultural goods only; if it did not import significant \namounts of U.S. agricultural goods, a successful complaining party \ncould also target industrial products.\n  Tariff retaliation against U.S. agricultural products would back \nproducts into the U.S. market placing ever greater downward pressure on \ndomestic price. U.S. farm domestic prices would weaken even further, \nand this could cause the price of U.S. farm programs to rise \ndramatically.\n  This would particularly be true in basic farm commodities such as \nwheat, corn, and soybeans where a large portion of the U.S. crop is \nexported. But if the programs that supported the commodity price were \nthe same programs that were violating our trade commitments, we would \nnot be allowed to provide our family farmers any support, at least \nabove that limit.\n  If our farmers experience a bad year and our farm programs pay out \nlarge amounts in no-trade compliant payments, we would be forced to \nfreeze or alter our farm assistance payments. Simply put, the type of \nprogram the Senate Agriculture Committee approved would fail family \nfarmers when their need is the greatest.\n  Also, tariff retaliation against U.S. industrial goods due to \nexcessive ``amber-box'' ag spending could create a substantial \npolitical backlash against U.S. farm programs. U.S. exporters of non-\nagricultural products who might suddenly be caught in the crossfire of \nretaliation would demand that their government officials correct the \nproblem so that they can regain their hard-earned access to foreign \nexports.\n  U.S. credibility would be undercut if it were determined that the \nUnited States was not living up to its current commitments. It's very \nrealistic that the Democratic farm bill we are considering would cause \nU.S. farmers to become increasingly dependent upon government payments \nthat could vanish at a time when the economic situation is worsening \nand the federal budget surplus is disappearing.\n  A decision by the United States to exceed its WTO domestic subsidy \ncommitments would undermine the current Uruguay Round arrangement and \nmake it much harder for the United States to achieve a workable \nmultilateral agreement in the new WTO trade negotiations. This could be \nextremely important to farmers if the budget surplus evaporates and \nCongress is unable, or unwilling, in more difficult economic times to \ncontinue to fund farm programs at recent levels.\n  It is very important the farm bill we pass be one that advances our \ntrade agenda and does not hinder it. The farm bill needs to help family \nfarmers, not limit their potential marketplace. Family farmers in Iowa \nand across the United States need profitability, and there is no \nprofitability check from the Federal Government. The profitability \ncomes from the marketplace. The Government cannot provide \nprofitability, only that marketplace can. I think the Cochran-Roberts \nlegislation has taken us to a point where we can be WTO compliant, help \nour farmers, and move ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for his \ncomments. His leadership in the areas of trade and agriculture have \nbeen very helpful in the Senate over the years as we have been called \nupon to legislate in this subject area. I am grateful to him for his \ncomplements to this legislation as they relate to our obligations in \nthe World Trade Organization and likewise in the importance and support \nfrom the Government for those engaged in production agriculture.\n  This legislation attempts to preserve the best of current farm law, \nimprove programs that have proven to work in the areas of conservation \nand income protection.\n  The Marketing Loan Program, which has been a centerpiece of our \nagricultural programs in the last two farm bills, is carried forward in \nthis legislation. We have a predictable level of income support that is \nnot coupled to planting decisions by farmers. This leaves them with the \nfreedom to make planting decisions not based on what the Government \nwill pay them for doing or not doing but on the basis of what they \nthink is best for their farm and their individual circumstances. Their \nfreedom in this farm bill to make those planting decisions will be very \npopular with farmers and for those who will depend on this legislation \nin the years ahead.\n  That is one of the distinguishing characteristics between the \nCochran-Roberts approach and the committee bill that is pending before \nthe Senate. The committee bill depends upon high loan rates guaranteed \nto distort the market to encourage overproduction. That is not going to \nbe the result under the Cochran-Roberts amendment.\n  The Cochran-Roberts amendment provides, as the Senator from Iowa \npoints out, for a new way to encourage farmers to save. It provides a \nmatching formula for the Government to come in and help encourage the \nsavings by farmers, much as a 401-K program does for others engaged in \nbusiness in our country. Farmers will be able to use their funds to \ndeal with the countercyclical price distortion if prices go down as \nthey customarily do. There are good years and bad years. We all know \nthat. This will offer an opportunity to hedge against those bad years.\n  There is a substantial emphasis in this legislation on conservation. \nTwo billion dollars in additional funding is authorized in this \namendment for conservation programs and to provide technical assistance \nto farmers to help them make decisions that are consistent with good \nmanagement practices to protect soil and water resources.\n  There are also reauthorization provisions for the Conservation \nReserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives Program, all of which have helped assure that those gradual \nand marginal lands are not farmed. The encouragement of benefits from \nthe Government for making decisions not to plant on marginal lands will \nbe carried forward and expanded in this legislation.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will look with favor at the difference \nbetween this bill and the committee bill in the area of rural \ndevelopment. The rural development title of the committee bill mandates \nthat certain levels of spending be made on a lot of new programs that \nare authorized and funded in this legislation.\n\n[[Page S13443]]\n\n  Our approach is to authorize a wide range of rural development \nprograms, rural water and sewer system programs, other infrastructure \nprograms, and housing programs that will help those who live in small \ntowns and rural communities enjoy the full benefits that those who live \nin more urban areas would enjoy. It costs more in many of these areas \nto provide those kinds of services. So the Federal Government is \nauthorized to provide funding to help ensure that the quality of life \nfor those in rural America is enhanced. But the programs are not \nmandated at certain high levels.\n  The program managers in the Department of Agriculture and Department \nof Agriculture officials are given more latitude. The Congress is given \nmore flexibility in appropriating each year the levels of funding that \nshould be made available to those specific programs, rather than \nmandating certain high levels. This gives us budget flexibility. We \nknow we are entering an era now where we are going to be hard pressed \nto stay within our budgets. This is important in this area of \nlegislation as well.\n\n  We are not on a certain path towards deficit spending, but I am \nafraid if we follow the course that is outlined in the committee bill, \nthat will be the result.\n  There are others who want to speak on this legislation. We have a \ntime limitation of 1 hour per side.\n  Let me at this point say that the distinguished Senator from Kansas, \nwho is the cosponsor of this amendment, is due in large part the credit \nfor coming up with the strategy for this amendment and a lot of the \ncontent for this amendment. He was chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee in the House of Representatives before he came to the Senate. \nHe has long been a leader in agriculture in America. I respect his \njudgment. It has been a pleasure working with him in crafting this \namendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, a good \nfriend whom I think every farmer understands. Every farmer and rancher \nunderstands that it has been Senator Thad Cochran who has provided the \ninvestment in American agriculture so as to keep our heads above water \nand invest in the man and woman whose job it is to feed America and a \nvery troubled and hungry world. I thank him for his contribution.\n  As Senator Cochran said, we want to preserve the best in the current \nfarm bill--much criticized, I understand, but basically build on that. \nMy concern in regard to the Daschle-Harkin bill is that changing the \nDaschle-Harkin bill really takes us back to the past. I am talking \nabout agricultural program policy that was built several decades ago. I \nused to support those bills. But I don't think it really fits the \nmodern reality that faces agriculture today. I think it will lead us \nright back to calls for additional emergency assistance which we have \ntried to avoid.\n  With all due respect, I do not think the proposal that is before us \ntoday is strictly bipartisan in the true sense of the word. When I say \nthat, I understand we all have partisan differences. I understand we \nall have serious intent. I am not challenging anybody's intent or \nquestioning anybody's intent.\n  But especially on the commodity and conservation titles--and as the \ndistinguished Senator pointed out on the rural development title--it \nhas been a one-way street. I guess you could call it bipartisan. As a \nmatter of fact, someone on the other side indicated the Republican \nposition on this bill has been one of stalling. I don't think that is \nthe case. I think we had very important amendments. I think we have a \nvery strong difference of opinion as to where our farm program policy \nought to go. But I guess you could call this bill bipartisan except for \nthe front loading of the funding. We have $73 billion over a 10-year \nperiod. This farm bill is 5 years. Based on budget, it is already \noutdated. As a matter of fact, the administration says it is not the \nmoney, it is the policy we worry about.\n  But if you look at the underlying bill, the Daschle-Harkin bill, it \nis front loaded to the tune of about $46 billion. That only leaves $28 \nmillion in regard to any future bill or any baseline we would use in \nthe future.\n  That is something on which there is a strong difference of opinion. \nIf you want to say that is partisan, I suppose you can. I think that is \na significant difference of opinion. I guess you could call it \nbipartisan, except that the underlying bill is opposed by the \nadministration and by the President.\n  I suppose then you could say, well, yes, the President, the Secretary \nof Agriculture, the Trade Ambassador, don't think it is a good idea for \nall the reasons the distinguished Senator from Iowa has pointed out, \nbut I wouldn't say it is exactly bipartisan in that regard.\n  Then, of course, you could say it is bipartisan except for the WTO \nproblems down the road. The Senator from Iowa did point this out: What \nif we reach a WTO agreement--that is a mighty big if; I know we are \ngoing to have a difficult time doing that--and all of a sudden in this \nbill that ``amber box''--and all that is is a box that all of a sudden \nis flashing ``amber'' as fast as it can--indicates you are over the \nlimit in regard to the WTO cap. Then you have to come back in, and you \ncould be fined. You could be in the business of trade retaliation. You \ncould even, conceivably, have the Secretary of Agriculture come back \nand ask farmers and ranchers to give back some of the investment they \nhave already received. I don't think we want that. So it is bipartisan \nexcept for, of course, that little minor disagreement.\n  Then it could be bipartisan except for the farm savings account. We \nhave the farm savings account in our bill. The Daschle bill does not \nhave that. I am not saying they would not have it or they are not \nacceptable to some portion of it, but that is not bipartisan either.\n  It is not bipartisan in regard to the situation of going back to loan \nrates and target prices as the investment by which we are going to \nprotect our farmers as opposed to direct payments. We have a strong \ndifference of opinion. So that really isn't a bipartisan situation \neither.\n  It certainly isn't bipartisan in regard to how we use crop insurance. \nCrop insurance reform: It took us 18 months--us, meaning Senator Bob \nKerrey, the former Senator from Nebraska, myself, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Burns, and others--to forge together and put together crop \ninsurance reform.\n  Where does the Daschle bill, and also the Harkin bill, get the money \nto increase loan rates? From crop insurance. That is not very \nbipartisan. We had a strong difference of opinion.\n  It would be very bipartisan if in fact it were not for the really \nstrong difference of opinion in regard to State water rights. That is \nthe bill that was introduced by Senator Reid. It has Senator Crapo of \nIdaho and others from the West very worried about it. So it isn't very \nbipartisan in that regard either.\n  Then we have mandatory conservation programs. And then we have this \nstatement that we could go to conference a lot more quickly if in fact \nwe would just pass the Daschle bill.\n  My colleagues, the differences between the bill that is referred to \nas Daschle-Harkin and the House bill are enormous. You are not going to \nget that done until next year anyway. On the contrary, in the Cochran-\nRoberts approach I think we could probably go to conference and settle \nit out in a day or two. We could get that done.\n  So when people say it is partisan or bipartisan, or there are strong \ndifferences of opinion, or people are stalling, I think a little \nclarification certainly is in order.\n  Let me just say I have touched on some of the specifics I had in my \nprepared remarks. I am not going to go over the process. If anybody \nwants to talk about process and what we deem as a better way to \napproach the process of this bill, they can go back to the statements \nSenator Cochran and I made last Friday.\n  But let me say, again, that I believe the commodity title in the bill \nwould really take us back to the past. Our producers will receive \nhigher payments through higher loan rates--if they have a crop to \nharvest. If they have no crop to harvest, they receive no loan \ndeficiency payments.\n  The bill also includes a ``technical correction'' to the bill that \naddresses a $15.5 billion scoring problem in the dairy title of the \ncommittee-passed\n\n[[Page S13444]]\n\nbill. That is quite a technical correction. Again, that is a strong \ndifference of opinion.\n  If you are going to return to target prices, I would say to my \ncolleagues, that only results in payments to the producers if the price \nfor that crop year is below the target price. And it has happened time \nand time again when a State up in the Dakotas, or a State such as \nKansas, in high-risk agriculture will lose a crop, and the price rises \nabove the target price, and then, when the farmer needs the payments \nthe worst, then is when he does not get it, either from the target \nprice or the loan rate. That is something we tried to fix in 1996 with \nour direct payment program. And that is basically the feature of our \nbill.\n  I talked a little bit about the front-loading of the bill, which I \nthink leaves us in a very precarious situation in the years of the \ncoming deficits if in fact that takes place.\n  Senator Cochran also pointed out that the underlying bill, the \nDaschle bill, front-loads spending for the popular programs, including \nEQIP, the Wetlands Reserve Program, WHIP, and the Farmland Protection \nProgram.\n  I think we could make a pretty good case, I say to Senator Cochran, \nthat our bill is better in regard to the environment and conservation \nthan the underlying bill. So we are basically mortgaging future farm \nbills simply to buy off votes on this one. I do not think that is good \npolicy, and it is not good for the future of our farmers.\n  We think we have the better approach. We take a very commonsense \napproach to conservation. It puts funding into those popular programs I \njust mentioned. It ramps up the funding so we have a significant \nbaseline as we head into the next farm bill. I think the Senator from \nMississippi indicated $2 billion in that regard. That is a big \ninvestment. We don't go ``Back to the Future.'' We don't raise loan \nrates or return to the target prices of the past. Instead, we increase \nthe direct payment--listen up, all farmers, ranchers, and their \nlenders--we increase the direct payment levels back to near their 1997 \nlevels while adding a payment for soybeans and minor oilseeds.\n  This does create a guaranteed payment that the producers and their \nbankers can count on, even in years of crop losses when they need it \nthe most. They do not have that guarantee in the committee-passed bill.\n  Again, I would like to reflect on what the Senator from Iowa said. It \nis WTO legal. It will not really shoot our negotiators in the foot in \nthese international trade negotiations. He is directly on point in \nwarning what could happen on down the road.\n  Our bill is supported by President Bush and Secretary of Agriculture \nAnn Veneman. So you are past that, and I think, obviously, you get to \nconference a lot quicker.\n  Let me say that to the Kansas farmer and, for that matter, to the \nMississippi farmer or the Montana farmer, or any of our colleagues who \nare privileged to represent agriculture and they say: Wait a minute, if \nyou are stalling a bill, and you are going to hold up this bill, and \nyou are not going to get progress, and you are not going to get the \nmoney invested--that the administration has said, over and over again, \nit is not the money, it is the policy, so the investment in agriculture \nwill be there--if somebody comes to me and says, Pat, let's pass the \nfarm bill, I would love to pass the farm bill in an odd-numbered year \nas opposed to an even-numbered year because it does get to be a tad \npolitical. But if I said: Now, wait a minute, Mr. Kansas farmer, what \nif that bill that you want to move, or that others on the other side \nwant to move, contained $46 billion up front and left no money for \nfuture farm bills, would you support that? They would probably say: No, \nPat, I don't think that is a very good idea.\n\n  What if I said: Do you want to go back to loan rates? They might say: \nWell, I am not too sure. We never figured out whether that was income \nprotection or market clearing. I don't know.\n  We need that debate. We are having that debate.\n  Actually, we are not having that debate. Nobody spoke to that. How \nare you going to pay for that? We are going to take it out of your crop \ninsurance reform we had only last year. I don't think they will buy \nthat and say: Pat, I don't want that kind of bill.\n  Then if I said: Well, Mr. Farmer in Kansas, if this bill is supported \nby the President and the Secretary of Agriculture, and we could \nconference it more quickly with the House, would you prefer this than \nthe other? Is that stalling? They would say: No, Pat, I don't think so.\n  What if I said: Is it consistent with the WTO negotiations? They \nwould look at me and say: Pat, do you think we are going to get that \ndone? I would say: We haven't yet, but we are going to keep trying.\n  Lord knows, it is a difficult process. But if the bill that we passed \nalready has more money, so that the ``amber box'' is flashing so you \ncan't even see past it, they are going to say: Well, Pat, I don't think \nwe want that bill either.\n  If they say, we are going to maintain the integrity of the crop \ninsurance program in our better substitute, I think most farmers would \nsay yes.\n  Then there is an analysis by the Food and Agriculture Policy Research \nInstitute that says the Cochran-Roberts proposal will result in higher \nmarket prices for farmers in the program crops than the committee-\npassed bill. It says it right there. In Kansas, every Kansas farmer \nwill understand we are losing $1.3 billion over the life of the bill if \nwe go with the committee bill as opposed to our substitute.\n  I could go on, but I think I have used up enough time and have made \nthe points I tried to make. I do not want to go back to the old, failed \npolicies of the past.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Mississippi has indicated, let's \npreserve the best, and let's improve it.\n  I say to the Senator from Mississippi, I think you control the time, \nsir. So I yield back to you.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncomments and his leadership on this issue.\n  We have some time left.\n  Does the senior Senator from Montana wish to speak at this time or \nwill we reserve the time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Whenever you all run out of gas.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We have not run out of gas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield so I can make a unanimous consent \nrequest at this point?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator for that purpose.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I neglected to ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Gordon Smith be added as a cosponsor of the amendment offered \nby Senator McCain in regard to catfish. We want to make sure the \ncatfish cosponsors are, indeed, added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I reserve the remainder of our time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to the discussion. The \nchairman of our committee is now chairing a conference committee on one \nof the appropriations subcommittees. He will be back in the Chamber in \na few moments. Let me consume some time to respond to a couple of the \narguments.\n  First of all, my colleagues ably described their proposal. Their \nproposal is different than the proposal brought to the Chamber by the \nSenate Agriculture Committee. I have listened to a substantial amount \nof discussion about the amber box. I suspect it is probably confusing \nto people listening to this debate about family farming to hear about \nthe amber box. I heard someone say perhaps if we took the wrong turn \nhere or made the wrong decision, we would shoot our trade negotiators \nin the foot. With all due respect, our trade negotiators have shot \nthemselves in the foot. In fact, they took aim before they did it which \nreally compounds the felony.\n  This amber box is not of great interest to me. I understand it is \npart of our current trade regime. The amber box exists. So does unfair \ntrade with stuffed molasses, so does unfair trade with potato flakes, \nwith Canadian wheat, so does unfair trade with T-bone steaks to Tokyo. \nI could go on forever. While that amber box up there is shining amber \nfor somebody, all I see are trade negotiators who negotiate bad trade \ndeals for American farmers.\n\n[[Page S13445]]\n\n  Let me talk about boxes, not amber boxes. Let me talk about the box \nthat the American farmers are in. That is the only box I really care \nabout. Here is the box the American farmer is in. The American farmer \nis farming under a farm program whose presumption was to transition \nthem out of a farm program, give them 7 years of fixed and declining \npayments at the end of which there would be no farm program. The whole \npoint was to transition to the marketplace. That all sounded good \nbecause wheat was $5 or so a bushel back then. Just like people thought \nthat the budget surplus was going to last forever, everybody thought--I \ndid not--that the price of wheat would be $5. So let's give 7 years of \nfixed payments, farmers can put it in the bank, draw interest and be \nable to transition into a market economy.\n  Almost immediately the market collapsed. The price of grain just \ncollapsed. So then this farm program of fixed and declining payments \ndidn't look good at all. Each year at the end of the year we had to \npass an emergency bill to make up the difference for a farm program \nthat didn't work.\n  So this is the box the farmers have been put in: They are trying to \ndo business, selling a product whose price has collapsed. That is a \nbox. They are trying to do business and ship their product over \nrailroads that are monopolies in most cases. That is a box. They are \ntrying to do business when they buy chemicals from chemical companies \nthat are getting bigger. These companies are exacting the prices they \nwant to exact. That is a box. When our farmers sell their grain into \nthe grain trade, they face concentrations in virtually every area of \neconomic activity. That is a box. Everywhere the farmer looks they are \nput in a box. It is not the amber box. It is just the box driving them \nflat broke.\n  Then they turned to see a farm program that at its roots was wrong. \nThe farm program said: We won't relate at all to what is happening in \nthe marketplace. If the grain prices are higher, we will give you a \npayment. Wheat is $5.50 a bushel. Under our plan, you get a payment. \nFarmers don't need a payment. If wheat is $5 or $5.50 a bushel, family \nfarmers don't need help from the Federal Government. That was the \nbankruptcy of that idea in the first place. It didn't recognize the \ntimes when farmers did not need assistance.\n\n  We have had a real struggle to get this farm bill to the floor. We \nhad the Secretary of Agriculture calling around to our colleagues \nsaying: Don't do this; you shouldn't write a farm bill now. The current \nfarm bill is just dandy. Wait until next year.\n  We had colleagues say: The current farm bill is working just fine. \nGive it time. We shouldn't write a new farm bill this year.\n  It was a long struggle. We have overcome that. We are on the floor. \nWe have a farm bill. Now we have a filibuster. We have had two cloture \nvotes, and we have not been able to break the filibuster. Eventually we \nwill. Debating the Cochran-Roberts amendment is an important step \nforward, because this is the major amendment to the commodities title.\n  I hope perhaps when we get past this we will be able to move through \nthe rest of the amendments and get this bill completed. That is our \ngoal. The idea in the Cochran-Roberts amendment with respect to the \ncommodities title is a bad idea, but I am not trying to be pejorative \nabout what they are doing. They have a different idea. I don't happen \nto think it works. I think it is almost identical to Freedom to Farm. \nThe Freedom to Farm idea was fixed payments, not withstanding what is \nhappening in the marketplace. We know that didn't work. We can do it \nagain, but we know that won't work.\n  So the question is, Do we want to revisit what we have done for the \nlast 7 years with a few pieces of chrome added here and there, maybe a \nhood ornament here and there, but essentially the same basic \nphilosophy? Or do we want countercyclical price protection so when \ntimes are tough, family farmers understand there is a bridge over these \nprice valleys?\n  That seems to me to be the right approach. That is the approach in \nthe underlying bill offered by the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  The entire purpose of a farm program should be nothing more than \nhelping this country maintain a network of family farms producing \nAmerica's food. If it is not for that purpose, then let's just not have \na farm program. Let's get rid of USDA. We don't need it. It was started \nunder Abe Lincoln with nine employees over 140 years ago. We just don't \nneed it if the purpose isn't to try to maintain a network of family \nfarmers and ranchers who produce America's food supply.\n  Why is there some special attention to those family producers? \nBecause those family producers work under conditions that almost no one \nelse in the country does. They don't know whether they are going to get \na crop. They planted a seed. It may rain too much, or not enough. \nInsects might come and eat it up; they may not. It might hail; it might \nnot. You might get crop disease; you might not. If you survive all of \nthose ``mights'' and get to harvest time and get that crop, get it in \nthe back of a two-ton truck, haul it to an elevator, what might happen \nto you, and almost certainly did happen to you every year under Freedom \nto Farm, is that elevator would say: On behalf of the grain trade, we \nmust tell you your food has no value.\n  That is the problem. That is the problem we are trying to fix. During \ntough times, can we create a farm program that offers a helping hand. \nThat is the bill that was brought from the Agriculture Committee. It is \na good bill. It has a commodity title that is now the target of this \nsubstitute. My hope is that we will defeat the Cochran-Roberts \namendment.\n  I have the greatest respect for both of the Senators who offered this \namendment. We have worked together on a wide range of issues. They are \nterrific Senators. But this is a bad idea. This idea needs to be \ndefeated so we can move on with the commodity title brought to the \nfloor from the Agriculture Committee by Senators Harkin and Daschle. I \nhope we do that soon.\n  I yield 10 minutes to Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I thank our \ncolleagues, Senator Roberts and Senator Cochran, who are valuable \nmembers of the Senate Agriculture Committee and have a sincere \ndedication to agriculture. We have appreciated working together even \nwhen we have had disagreements, some of them strenuous disagreements on \nfarm policy. There is no doubt in my mind about the genuine commitment \nof Senator Roberts and Senator Cochran to the rural parts of our \ncountry and to agriculture in America. Certainly their hearts are in \nthe right place, and they are thoughtful and valuable members of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  With that said, we do have a profound disagreement with respect to \nthis amendment. If you liked the Freedom to Farm policy, then this is \nthe amendment for you. This is a Freedom to Farm policy warmed over. \nFreedom to Farm had a shelf life of about a year. We were promised \nunder that policy permanently high farm prices. That is what we were \ntold over and over. What we saw was something quite different. What we \nsaw was a collapse of farm prices after that legislation was put in \nplace. In fact, I have shown on the floor many times the chart that \nshows the prices that farmers pay going up continually and the prices \nthat farmers receive dropping like a rock after Freedom to Farm was \npassed in 1996. The prices farmers receive have been straight down, \nlike a one-way escalator going down, ever since Freedom to Farm passed.\n  We have had to pass four economic disaster assistance bills for \nagriculture since Freedom to Farm passed, four economic disaster bills \ncosting over $25 billion because Freedom to Farm was a disaster itself. \nThis amendment before us would continue that failed policy.\n  Senator Roberts keeps warning about a return to the failed policies \nof the past. How about the failed policies of the present?\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how about the failed policies of the \nFreedom to Farm bill, which has been such a disaster that each and \nevery year for the last 4 years we have had to come to the Congress and \npass an economic disaster assistance package for our farmers or see \nliterally tens of thousands of them forced off the land.\n  Even the authors of the House-passed bill labeled Freedom to Farm a \nfailure.\n\n[[Page S13446]]\n\n After 18 months of hearings, they concluded that one major change was \nneeded in current policy. The change that the House agricultural \nleadership agreed upon was the addition of a countercyclical form of \npayments--payments that would increase if prices fell. That one feature \nsets the House bill apart from current policy. Yet the Cochran-Roberts \nbill and the Bush administration reject this fundamental feature. After \n18 months of hearings, the House concluded there was one critical \nmissing element. They put it in their bill. It is in the underlying \nbill, but it is not in this amendment. It is a countercyclical form of \nincome support.\n  Compared to the committee-approved bill, this amendment is \nparticularly unfriendly to the so-called minor crops--commodities such \nas sugar, barley, sunflowers, and canola, which are crops that are \ncritically important in my home State--and not just in my home State \nbut in dozens of other States as well.\n  For example, the Cochran-Roberts amendment fails to repeal the loan \nforfeiture penalty for sugar. If you are a cane or beet sugar producer, \nthat one shortcoming will reduce the effective support rate of the \nsugar loan program and directly reduce the income of sugar producers.\n  I find it particularly puzzling that the administration has endorsed \nthe Roberts-Cochran amendment. After months of urging that we delay the \nprocess until next year, after months of opposing the additional farm \nmoney set aside in the budget resolution, and after issuing a policy \nreport that indicts current policy for transferring the majority of \nfarm dollars to a minority of large farmers, the administration has \napparently done a double flip and has now endorsed the amendment before \nus that is a testimony to the status quo. The very thing the \nadministration has opposed they now endorse. I guess one could ask: Are \nyou surprised?\n  Well, after the administration's performance in the farm bill \ndiscussion, nothing would surprise me anymore. First of all, they came \nout and said: Don't do a farm bill this year. Don't use the money in \nthe budget resolution. Just wait, the money will be there next year. \nThen they came out and endorsed Senator Lugar's approach. And then the \nnext week they took back that endorsement. Then they called the farm \ngroup leaders to the White House and said: Call the members of the \nAgriculture Committee and tell them not to write a farm bill this year. \nThe money will be there next year.\n  Well, anybody with an ounce of common sense could look at our fiscal \ncondition and see what is abundantly clear to anybody who cares to \nlook: The expenses of the Federal Government are going up with the war, \nthe income is going down with economic conditions. That means every \npart of the budget is going to be squeezed. And we have a Secretary of \nAgriculture calling members of the committee telling them don't act \nthis year, wait until next year, the money will be there.\n  How is the money going to be there? How is the money going to be \nthere, Madam Secretary? How can that be?\n  The Cochran-Roberts amendment also maintains the status quo with \nregard to loan rates. It freezes them in place rather than increasing \nthem as the committee bill does. The amendment continues direct \npayments to farmers regardless of whether prices are high or low. It \ndoesn't matter, send checks.\n\n  Let me just look at the differences commodity by commodity--the \ndifference in the effective support level between the committee bill \nand Cochran-Roberts. Let's start with wheat. That is No. 1 in my State. \nYou can see on this chart that the loan rate in the committee version \nis $3 a bushel. Cochran-Roberts keeps it at the current level of $2.58. \nOn payments, the committee bill has 44 cents a bushel; Cochran-Roberts, \n51 cents. The effective support level of the committee bill, $3.44; \n$3.09 under Cochran-Roberts.\n  On barley, the committee bill, which is before us, has a loan rate of \n$2; Cochran-Roberts has a loan rate of $1.65. The payments are 18 cents \na bushel in the committee bill, for a total support level of $2.18. \nCochran-Roberts has a loan rate of $1.65 and payments of 21 cents, for \na total support level of $1.86.\n  On corn, the committee bill has a loan rate of $2.08, with payments \nof 25 cents, for a total of $2.33. Cochran-Roberts has a loan rate of \n$1.89, payments of 26 cents, for a total of $2.15.\n  On soybeans, the committee bill has a loan rate of $5.20, coupled \nwith payments of 52 cents, for an effective support level of $5.72. \nCochran-Roberts has a loan rate of $4.92, payments of 36 cents, and an \neffective support level of $5.28.\n  On rice, the committee bill has a loan rate of $6.85, payments of \n$2.40, an effective support level of $9.25. Cochran-Roberts has a loan \nrate of $6.50, payments of $2.19, and an effective support level of \n$8.69.\n  Finally, cotton. The committee bill has a loan rate of $55, payments \nof $12.81, and a total effective support level of $67.81. Cochran-\nRoberts has a loan rate of $51.92, payments of $11.38, an effective \nsupport level of $63.30.\n  On each and every commodity, the advantage goes to the underlying \ncommittee bill--the same amount of money, but it has been done in a \ndifferent way in the committee bill. It gives a higher level of support \nfor each of these major commodities than the amendment before us.\n  Let me address one other element of Cochran-Roberts that I think is \nparticularly deficient--the so-called farm accounts. There has been a \nlot of talk here about targeting of benefits of the farm bill to \nfamily-size farmers. But in this area, Cochran-Roberts has targeting in \nreverse. They are targeting to the best-off farmers, those who have the \nhighest incomes; they are targeting to those who have the biggest \nprofit margins because they have set up a circumstance of matching \nfunds that requires a farmer to have $10,000 to set aside. In my State, \na significant majority of farmers don't have $10,000 to set aside to \nqualify for the matching funds, or to fully qualify for the matching \nfunds.\n  So what you have here is Robin Hood in reverse. They are going to \ntake from those who have the most need and give to those who have the \nmost resources. I don't think that is a policy that can be sustained. I \ndon't think that policy can be supported.\n  Madam President, I add that the previous discussions on this proposal \nhave had the program administered by the IRS that has the information \non the money that people have to put in the program. To avoid a \njurisdictional problem, they have decided to convert USDA into the IRS. \nThey have decided to make the USDA all of a sudden administer tens of \nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of these accounts, but they \ndo not have the information upon which to make the judgment of whether \nsomebody qualifies for these accounts.\n  This is big government writ large. This is an invitation to a \nmassive,, expansion of bureaucracy and a duplication of bureaucracy. \nThese are the records that the IRS has, and all of a sudden we are \ngoing to duplicate these records at USDA. That is an administrative \ndebacle that will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  How many tens of thousands of employees are they going to have to \nhire at USDA to administer these accounts? They do not have the \ninformation. They are going to have to gather the information. Can you \nimagine the potential for fraud? Talk about waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nwill have everybody and their mother's uncle writing asking for their \n$10,000, and who is going to--I do not know how this ever got morphed \ninto a program from IRS that has the information to administer such a \nprogram to one being run by USDA.\n  They have 100,000 employees at IRS. We are going to have to have \n20,000 employees at USDA to run this program. We are going to have to \nhire 20,000 new Federal employees to run this program. Can you imagine \nthe invitation to fraud when you say to any farmer out there if they \nput aside $10,000, they can get a matching amount from USDA and they do \nnot have the information upon which to make these judgments? That alone \nought to defeat this amendment because that is an invitation to a \ndisaster. That is an invitation to an expansion of bureaucracy unlike \none we have seen in the 15 years I have been in the Senate, and that is \nan invitation to waste and taxpayer abuse that I think in and of itself \nshould defeat this amendment.\n\n[[Page S13447]]\n\n  I end as I began. Although I have been tough and direct with respect \nto my criticisms of this amendment, I do have great respect and \naffection for the authors. Senator Cochran and Senator Roberts are very \nlevel-headed people who have done everything they can in the light of \ntheir philosophical leanings to support farmers across this Nation, and \nfor that I respect them and I am grateful to them. But I very much hope \nthis amendment, which I think is terribly flawed, will be rejected.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I guess we are nice \nguys; it is just that the program is not worth anything.\n  I want to set the record straight with regard to the payments. The \ndistinguished Senator is very fond of charts, but in this particular \ncase his chart is wrong. In regard to the direct payment rate for 2002, \nwheat is 76 cents. I believe the Senator indicated it was 51 cents or \nsomething like that. For corn, it is 43; grain sorghum, 52; barley, 36; \nfor oats about 3.5; 14.9 for cotton seed; 3.39 for rice; and soybeans, \n60 cents. That is not reflected in those charts. The charts are simply \nnot accurate. Coming close to the truth is coming pretty close but it \nstill is not the truth. I think we better get our facts and figures \nstraight with regard to the payments.\n  I also point out that if the market price gets above $3.43 in regard \nto wheat--I will use wheat because I am familiar with that--the farmer \ndoes not get a payment from the Daschle bill. In addition, their target \nprices do not come into effect until 2004.\n  They were talking about a bridge. That is a mighty long bridge. The \nbridge is washed out, the farmer cannot swim, and the farmer cannot get \nto the other side.\n  In regard to the $3 loan rate, that is just going to encourage market \ndistortion, but if you are really going to use the loan rate in regard \nto income protection, why not raise it to $5 or $4? Take out all direct \npayments and just go with the loan rate. Many of the constituencies my \nfriend represents would find that more in keeping.\n  Yes, I know that Freedom to Farm in terms of restoring decisionmaking \npower to the producer was not as successful in regard to market prices \nworldwide, but we never passed the component parts to Freedom to Farm. \nThere was a world glut of farm product. We lost our markets--the Asian \nmarket and the South American market. The value of the dollar hindered \nit. We did not get Presidential trade authority. We tried twice. We \nexported about $61 billion in agricultural commodities back during the \nfirst years of Freedom to Farm. That is down now to around $50 billion. \nSubtract the difference and that is what we have had to do with the \nemergency funding.\n  Every commodity-producing country has gone through the same travail \nthat our farmers are going through, but yet none of those farmers \npassed Freedom to Farm. For those on the other side of the aisle, \nFreedom to Farm is to blame for virtually everything that goes wrong in \nfarm country; or if your alma mater loses a football game or if your \ndaughter has a pimple on her nose, it is somehow the fault of Freedom \nto Farm with a chart to prove it.\n  With regard to the safety net, our safety net is a safety net; it is \nnot a hammock as indicated by the majority.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Montana for \nwhatever purpose he may like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Kansas. I was \ninterested in the remarks of my good friend from North Dakota. \nYellowstone River separates us, so we are northern tier farmers. I want \nto bring up a couple points. I probably will not use my 10 minutes \nbecause I think the principal sponsors of this amendment have explained \nit very well.\n  I also want to correct another thing that we do not want to overlook. \nIf farm programs that contain target prices were going to save the \nfamily farm, we have 50 years of that experiment to study and still we \nare losing farmers from the land. If they were going to work in the \nlast 50 years, surely we would have gone through some economic cycles \nwhere we would have found something that was successful for \nagriculture. Nothing more is going on in agriculture that is not going \non in other sections of our economy.\n  I have heard a lot of farmers say there is nothing wrong on the farm \nexcept the price. Our share of the consumer dollar that should go back \nto the farm is not getting back to the farm. We used to live on 10 \ncents, 15 cents, 20 cents of the consumer dollar getting back to the \nfarm. Now we are living with around 8 cents or 9 cents. Therein lies \nthe problem.\n  I supported and had a little to do with--not very much--putting \ntogether the Cochran-Roberts amendment. The real design in Freedom to \nFarm was to transfer the decisionmaking of what they want to do on \ntheir farms and ranches back to the farmer and the rancher and also \ngive them the tools to minimize their risk.\n  We failed to do two or three of those items during the life of \nFreedom to Farm. We never did get reform on crop insurance, and there \nwere several other elements in this whole era when that legislation was \nin effect.\n  Nobody has to say, when there are four major economists on the \nPacific rim, it does not impact us who live in the Northwest because \njust about all of our production goes to the Pacific rim. When \nThailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea, all of \nthose economies went in the tank at the same time, and the value of our \ndollar went up, it tells me that was an element that was out of the \ncontrol of anybody.\n  What we finally did was reform crop insurance so it would work, so \nthat the farmer and rancher could go out and protect his investment \nagainst those natural elements. We are in basically the third, fourth \nyear of drought in our part of the world. Last year was the worst we \nhave ever had.\n  To give an example, we had no snowpack and that impacts our irrigated \nfarmers. To give another example, the Yellowstone River, which is the \nlongest river in this Nation, is unmarred by dams. That river could \nprobably be crossed east of Billings to Williston, ND, and one's knees \nwould never get wet.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Montana has been going through some mighty bad weather. \nI have been to Montana with the Senator and looked at the drought \nconditions. My question is: If one does not have a crop, under their \nbill, one does not get a loan rate. And if one does not have a crop \nwhen they need it, the most--they do not get a target price, and the \ntarget price for wheat is capped anyway at $3.45. So at the time the \nfarmer needs it the most--and the Senator has been through that big \ntime in his State. We do that in Kansas a lot, and I know they do it in \nthe Dakotas year after year--this bill does not help them. There is no \ncountercyclical payment. There is no help. There is no safety payment.\n  Mr. BURNS. The committee bill?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, the committee bill, the Daschle bill. So exactly \nthe conditions the Senator is describing, under this bill, one would \nnot have any help.\n  I know what happened. The Senator from Montana knows what happened. \nThey would be back to the Senate asking for emergency help, which we \nwould have to provide, because the man whose job it is to feed the \ncountry needs to be provided for.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator for his question. That was a point I \nwas going to get to, but the Senator got to it a lot quicker and maybe \nexplained it a lot better than I would.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BURNS. Building on what the Senator from Kansas said, plus the \nfact we protect the integrity and improve insurance again, we add some \nmore dollars to it so the farmer can deal with the risk of losing a \ncrop. On the point made by the Senator from Kansas, should nothing be \ncut, nothing is gotten from the committee bill. That was not a correct \napproach.\n  I am someone who wants to change the CRP, the Conservation Reserve \nProgram, to make it work as it was set up to work. I have a couple of \namendments on file now that I think would do that. Conservation reserve \nwas to accomplish a couple of things. It was to set aside the \nundesirable land and the highly erodable land that should never\n\n[[Page S13448]]\n\nhave been broken by the plow in the history of the land. It should have \nnever been broken up, but it was because we had high prices and farmers \nhad the freedom to plant from fence row to fence row. Of course, with \nthe downturn of the economy, of foreign economies, and the high dollar, \nthe timing could not have been worse.\n  Nonetheless, if I hear my farmers right, they still want the \nflexibility. They want to still make the decision and plant and sow for \nthe market to make those decisions, especially new crops.\n  When we try to write a farm bill that pertains to all of America, in \nthe northern tier of States our flexibility is limited to very few \ncrops because of a short growing season. In some areas, we cannot grow \nwinter wheat; we must grow spring wheat. So our decisions on what to \nplant are limited because of where we are and the kind of soil we have.\n  When we add up all the factors, small grain producers in the State of \nMontana will fair better under Cochran-Roberts--or Roberts-Cochran, \nwhichever is preferred--than the committee bill. Plus the fact we also \nknow what it is to lose a crop. We cut a lot of acres, by law. We cut a \nlot of one bushel to the acre crop this year. It is the worst I have \never seen.\n  Of course, we have all the elements that North Dakota has also. We \ncould talk about normalization of farm chemicals, the labels on farm \nchemicals. We can talk about captive shippers. I have some report \nlanguage I would like to offer later on, depending on whatever \nsurvives, to deal with normalization of those labels because we have \ngreat challenges in our free trade agreements.\n  Now the real risk is this: If the committee bill is not WTO \ncompliant--one can argue about our trade agreements, our trade \nnegotiations, and one might not like it, but basically we are tied to \nthem by law. If we are not compliant, and we lose a WTO challenge, what \ndo we do? The Secretary of Agriculture suspends the program until it is \nironed out, and it could be suspended at a time when our agricultural \nproducers need it most. That is risky, and I ask my colleagues to \nconsider that.\n  I thank my good friend from Kansas, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first I inquire of the Chair as to the \namount of time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 36\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Kansas has 12 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, while I rise to oppose the Cochran-\nRoberts amendment, I want to congratulate my colleagues for their \ndedication as members of the Agriculture Committee. I have great \nrespect for both Senator Cochran and Senator Roberts and realize they \ncome to this from their respective States and how they view the needs \nof agriculture in our country. I come from the great State of Michigan. \nWe have more diversity of crops than any other State, other than \nCalifornia. It is very heartening for me to have worked on a bill \ncoming out of committee that for the first time addresses a number of \ncrops and concerns of Michigan farmers that have not been addressed \nbefore.\n  Our farmers stock the kitchen tables of America and the world, as we \nknow, but they have the right to put food on their own family's table \nas well. That is what we are debating, the best way to make that \nhappen.\n  I was a member of the House Agriculture Committee for 4 years, and \nnow I am honored to be on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Every year \nI have been in the Congress, we have had to pass an emergency \nsupplemental because the Freedom to Farm Act was not enough to address \nthe needs of American agriculture. I think now is the time to correct \nwhat was not working in the past farm bill.\n  In Michigan this year, we have had such an extensive drought that 82 \nof the 83 counties have been declared disaster areas.\n  We have seen 30 percent of our corn crop wiped out as a result of the \ndrought. Everything from Christmas trees--and as a caveat, I indicate \nto my colleagues we are proud that the Capitol Christmas tree this year \nis from the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. We have had tough times for \nour Christmas tree farmers. Dry beans, potatoes, and hay all have been \nhurt by the drought. One farm official said there is no difference \nbetween what has happened to us and watching your house burn.\n  These are pretty dramatic times. Besides the drought, Fireblight has \nkilled between 350,000 and 450,000 apple trees in Michigan at a cost of \nmillions of dollars. It has just not been a good time for our farmers.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, between 1992 and 1997 in \nMichigan we lost over 215,000 acres of productive farmland. As part of \nthat loss, 500 family farms vanished and 2,400 full-time farmers \nliterally left the fields.\n  We can do better than we have done for agriculture and the farmers of \nour country. I argue that the best approach is the bill before the \nSenate, as the committee reported it out, where every title we worked \non in committee was reported out unanimously except the commodity \ntitle.\n  I will speak about the commodity title in a moment. For the first \ntime, we address in the commodity title of the U.S. farm bill the issue \nof specialty crops through a commodity purchase. We have been able to \nput in place what I believe is a win-win situation: A commodity \npurchase every year of fresh fruits and vegetables for our School Lunch \nProgram and for our other food programs. It is a win-win for our \nfarmers. It supports our specialty crops, and it is a win-win for our \nchildren and for families and seniors who benefit by the nutritional \nprograms.\n  Unfortunately, this substitute wipes out all the work that we did, \nputting together this commodity purchase program for the first time, \nwith $780 million in commodity purchases for specialty crops. I very \nmuch want to see that continued in this legislation.\n  We know the bill that came out of committee is a four-pronged \napproach: Marketing loans, fixed payments, countercyclical payments, \nand conservation security payments. The Conservation Security Act, now, \nwhat everybody calls the innovative act of payments for all farmers on \nworking lands, is another way we address specialty crops that have not \nbeen addressed before.\n  I was pleased as a Member of the House of Representatives to help \nfashion crop insurance to begin to move it in a direction to address \nspecialty crops. But it has only been moving in a very small direction. \nThe Conservation Security Act is a way to provide security again and \nfocus on conservation and support for our specialty crops.\n  The farm program, unfortunately, under the Cochran-Roberts amendment \ndoes not include a countercyclical program that will help farmers in \ntimes of low prices. Without such a program, there is simply no way the \nprogram can provide an adequate safety net. That is what I believe \nought to be the goal.\n  Under the substitute, when prices are high, farmers get large \npayments. In bad times, when prices are low, farmers will suffer, since \nthere will not be a mechanism to respond to those conditions. That \nmakes no sense to me. Fixed payments may seem attractive and bankers \ncertainly want to know exactly what to expect each year, but we ought \nto be responding to the highs and lows of the marketplace and providing \nthe help when it is needed. Fixed payments are not responsive to \nmarket conditions. They are not budget responsive. The taxpayers should \nsave money when crop prices are higher. We should be paying less when \nthey are higher and more when they are lower.\n\n  I believe the substitute is not balanced. It is weighted toward fixed \npayments. The loan rates are low and would be allowed to go even lower. \nThe committee bill phases down fixed payments and phases in a \ncountercyclical program that is market and budget sensitive.\n  Despite overwhelming calls for reforming Freedom to Farm, this \nsubstitute, in my opinion, is little more than a continuation of the \nexisting program of marketing loans and fixed payments. In Michigan, \nthis policy has left our farmers without income protection and \nnecessitated over $30 billion of supplemental payments over the past \nfew years. The substitute loan rates are low, as I indicated. The \ncommittee bill, on the other hand, sought to help farmers by making \nmodest increases in the loan rates.\n\n[[Page S13449]]\n\n  The other point I make is in the area of conservation. Conservation \nis the most significant problem with the amendment other than, in my \nmind, what is left out in terms of specialty crops which are so \ncritical to Michigan. The committee bill includes the Conservation \nSecurity Program which is a new innovative program that provides \npayments to farmers who make the effort to practice good conservation \non working farmlands. It has received growing enthusiasm. I hope that \nwill be included in the final document.\n  The Cochran-Roberts amendment provides significantly less funding for \nconservation. Under the substitute, my own farmers in Michigan would \nreceive $40 million less in conservation payments than under the \ncommittee bill.\n  I believe we have reported out a balanced bill that reflects the \ndiversity of American agriculture and the diversity of Michigan \nagriculture. It addresses innovative new approaches in energy. It \nencourages a number of different new options and alternative energy \nsources that are not only good for farmers but are good for all \nAmericans in terms of foreign energy dependence. It addresses \nconservation and nutrition and the commodity program in a way I think \nmakes the most sense.\n  Despite my great respect for the authors of the amendment, and I do \nmean that sincerely, I rise to encourage my colleagues to support the \nbill reported from committee, to oppose the substitute, and to join in \nan approach that broadly supports agriculture and provides the safety \nnet necessary for our farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the manager.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia who has been an absolute champion of Virginia peanuts.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my dear friend and colleague. I have done my best \nover the 23 years I have been privileged to represent the Commonwealth \nof Virginia to look out for the interests of our peanut farmers. I \nremember so well Senator Howard Heflin of Alabama. I remember Senators \nfrom Georgia. We got together through the years and worked out a fair \ntreatment of our peanut farmers.\n  The peanut program is such a small crop in the overall agricultural \npicture of the United States of America, but it is crucial to the \neconomy of Virginia.\n  History will reflect in the marking up of these bills in committee \nthat somehow the Virginia peanut grower did not fare as well as those \nin some other States. To correct this inequity, Senator Helms and I sat \ndown with our distinguished ranking member and we showed him what had \noccurred, largely through oversight. I believe this oversight occurred \nbecause Virginia's peanut farms are unique when compared with other \npeanut States. We have very small farms compared to other areas in the \nUnited States of America.\n  For family farmers, oftentimes peanuts are one of their principal \nsources of income, if not their only agricultural source of income. \nThey take a lot of pride as their fathers and forefathers have taken \nfor many, many years. Nevertheless, the committee bill--I say this with \nall respect to my good friend and chairman, Senator Harkin, with whom I \nhave worked with over these many years--somehow did not work out for \nVirginia.\n  After consulting--and Senator Allen joined me every step of the way \non this--after consulting with Senators Roberts and Cochran, they \nagreed to incorporate the best provisions we could manage into this \nsubstitute amendment.\n  Consequently, we are ready to strongly support the Cochran-Roberts \nsubstitute because, for the time being, it gives us the best hope in \nVirginia to allow this industry to ride through this transition period \nof several years as the current quota program is phased out. But these \nindividuals, unless they get a little bit of help, cannot survive \nthrough this transition. We have to help them.\n  I thank my good friends, both Senator Cochran and Senator Roberts, \nfor helping.\n  We have achieved the following: For example, we will significantly \nraise the per ton target price. The current quota price per ton is \n$610. The House passed Farm Bill contains a target price of $480 and \nthe Senate committee bill is currently $520. But under the Cochran-\nRoberts substitute we were able to raise the target price from $520 up \nto $550 which will enable our peanut growers to survive this period of \ntransition. This will make a big difference to Virginia peanut farmers. \nIt will enable them to simply survive.\n  This is not a big moneymaking business. While many people nationwide \nenjoy the specialty Virginia peanut, it is expensive to grow. These \nprovisions will allow Virginians to continue to grow this peanut as \nthey have for generations.\n  In addition to the increased target price, there are several \ntechnical provisions dealing with peanuts in Cochran-Roberts. For \ninstance, producers will be allowed to re-assign their base for each of \nthe 5 years of the farm bill. All edible peanuts will be inspected to \nmaintain quality control. And the marketing associations will now be \nallowed to build their own warehouse facilities.\n  Each of these small incremental steps will enable this very small but \ncrucial industry in Virginia and parts of North Carolina to survive.\n  I thank Senators Cochran, Roberts, Helms, and others. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Allen, for helping me. I am hopeful that we can \nprovide help to these farmers.\n  I see my good friend, the chairman of the committee. I remember very \nwell when he joined the Senate and came to this committee.\n  All I am asking for is a little bit of help for these peanut farmers. \nAll through the years--with Senator Heflin and others around here from \nthe peanut States--we always got together. We didn't ask for much, only \njust enough to survive.\n  I hope the distinguished Chair will allow me to yield so the chairman \nmay reply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my friend for yielding. I say to \nmy friend from Virginia that the very issues he is talking about in \npeanuts is in the committee bill. He doesn't have to vote for Cochran-\nRoberts. The same provision is in our bill. It is the same thing for \nthe peanut farmers of Virginia. We took care of that in our bill.\n  I know my friend from Virginia is also a strong conservationist. I \nknow he believes in good conservation. I think my friend from Virginia, \nif he looks at the peanut program, will see what we do in our bill. \nThey just copied the same thing that we already voted on unanimously, I \nthink, in committee on the peanut provisions. That is in the bill.\n  I hope he will take a look at the other things that are in the \namendment that Cochran-Roberts cut--such as conservation and some other \nthings which they cut in the bill. I know my friend from Virginia is a \nstrong conservationist. He is a good hunter. I know that. He believes \nin the right of hunters and sportsmen. That is what we have in our \nbill. Our bill is strongly supported by the sportsmen of America.\n  There is a lot of conservation that they took out. I wish the Senator \nwould look at that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I \nremember Herman Talmadge. When I came to the Senate, he said: Young \nman. He didn't call me Senator. He said: Young man. You just stick with \nme and you will make it work.\n  So I hope your bill does reflect this higher $550 per ton and a few \nother things, including allowing the producers to be able to move their \nbase.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will give him a couple more minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I am fine. I appreciate that courtesy. I thank the \nChair for the indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 6 minutes and the \nSenator from Iowa has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I might, Senator Crapo has asked for 5 minutes. I \nhope I might have a little time to sum up along with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee. It would take me hours to respond perhaps in \nsome small way. That is why I asked the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nif he could\n\n[[Page S13450]]\n\nlend 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming who is a \nmember of the committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be more than honored to give my friend from \nWyoming 5 minutes off our time to speak against my own bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Bless your heart, sir.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor sharing some of his time.\n  The Agriculture bill is a very complicated matter, of course. This is \nthe first year I have served on the Agriculture Committee. I have been \ninvolved with agriculture all my life. In fact, of course, agriculture \nin different places means different things. But I am glad we are having \nthis debate.\n  I hope we take enough time to really have a look at all the things \nthat are involved in a farm bill. First, I think in many cases this \nbill has been pushed a little too quickly. I think it was pushed too \nhard by the committee. I have never been on a committee with a \ncomplicated bill such as this which was brought to the Members at \nmidnight one night and expected to be voted on at 9:30 the next \nmorning. We did that consistently through all the titles of this bill.\n  I have a sense that is what is happening. It is being pushed by our \nminority friends on the other side of the aisle with the political \nquestion. I think it is too important for that. It is something that is \ngoing to impact all of us a great deal over a good long time. I don't \nagree with the idea that if we don't get it done this week we will \nlose. I don't agree with that. I don't think that is the case at all.\n  I think if we had a chance to be here and deal with it in January and \nFebruary, we would have the same opportunity, plus the advantage of \nknowing more about what we are doing and having a chance to go home and \ntalk to our folks about how it works.\n  I continue to support a bill that moves more towards market-oriented \npolicy, not one that is increasingly controlled by the Government, as \nhas been the case over a period of time, but one that places more \nemphasis on all of agriculture as opposed to focusing on the so-called \nprogram crops as it has been in the past, one that recognizes the \nimportance of our WTO obligations.\n  We have, of course, a great percentage of agricultural products that \ngo into foreign trade. If we are not careful about how we do this, we \nmay run into the so-called amber box and find problems. I think we want \nto recognize the value of keeping working lands in production and not \nsetting aside land for production only to increase the production on \nthat land.\n  In many cases, I believe the Harkin bill takes us in the wrong \ndirection. It endorses higher rates. It encourages production of U.S. \nproducts that are already losing in the world market and which could \neven lose more. On the other hand, I think Cochran-Roberts is a really \ngood option for us to consider.\n  The commodity title provides substantial support for crop \nproducers. But it provides support in a non-market-distorting manner.\n\n  I think, as in most every issue--but maybe this one more than most--\nwe ought to take a look at where we want agriculture to be 10 years \nfrom now, what directions we want agriculture to take. Do we want \nfarmers to become more and more dependent on Government subsidies? Do \nwe want all those decisions to be based on what the Federal Government \nis going to provide or, indeed, do we want to have a safety net so that \nwe can keep family farmers in business, and help do that, but also that \nthat production is reflected in the marketplace, and that those things \nthat are marketable are the ones that are sold?\n  I think that is very important. That is what we try to do in the \nCochran-Roberts amendment.\n  The payments are considered to be WTO ``green box'' payments, so that \nimportant foreign trade will be there without being impeded or \nchallenged by other countries.\n  The Cochran-Roberts amendment allows producers who have never \nreceived Government assistance to obtain support through the farm \nsavings account. Producers are able to be matched by Federal funds, but \nthey are able to set aside for a rainy day. That is a market-oriented, \nprivate-property oriented type of approach.\n  The conservation title boosts programs that keep our working lands in \nproduction. It recognizes the value of keeping people on the land in \noperation versus land retirement. Keeping working lands in production \nbenefits open space and wildlife. Those are aspects that are terribly \nimportant to my State where much of agriculture, of course, is \nlivestock, with the idea of keeping open space. The EQIP program helps \ngive technical help to conservation programs and financial assistance \nfor improving environmental quality. I think those are so important.\n  It provides a bonus incentive for producers who have adopted long-\nterm conservation programs. It creates a new program for the protection \nof Native grasslands. The loss of open space and crop land is a severe \nproblem, particularly, I suppose, in the West.\n  There are some important distinctions between the Harkin bill and the \nCochran-Roberts substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I hope my colleagues will give great consideration to the \namendment and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have 18 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes, and ask the \nChair to remind me when my 10 minutes are up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I want the talk, literally, about five \nthings that I think Senators should consider before they vote on the \npending Cochran-Roberts amendment: direct payments, loan rates, the \nissue of WTO and our trade agreements, conservation, and then I want to \nmention a little bit about total spending in the bill itself.\n  There seems to be some confusion that somehow the Cochran-Roberts \nproposal is bigger in direct payments than what we have. But I would \npoint to this chart which shows why looks can be deceiving.\n  Under the Cochran-Roberts amendment, for example, on soybeans--I just \nused one crop; it could be any of them--the payment rate on direct \npayments is 60 cents a bushel. Actually, it is 60.68 cents per bushel. \nUnder our bill, it is 55 cents a bushel. So to the casual observer, \nlooking at this, you would say: Well, of course, Cochran-Roberts is \nbetter; it gives more in direct payments than what you do, Harkin, in \nthe committee bill.\n  But here is the catch. Under our bill, we pay for the whole base. We \nhave 100 acres of soybeans. So we take 100 acres, and we just took an \naverage of 38.25 bushels per acre, times 55 cents a bushel; that is a \ndirect payment of $2,104 for that 100 acres of soybean base.\n  Under Cochran-Roberts, take the same 100 acres, and they use the old \ntriple base back. That is a 15-percent reduction. Actually, that came \nin the 1990 budget reconciliation bill, if I am not mistaken. It was \nthat triple base rule, and they put it in there. So now it is not paid \non 100 acres, but it is paid on 85 acres.\n  They have the same 38.25 bushels an acre, just like we have--the same \nyield--and they pay on 85 acres. And then they only pay 78.4 percent of \nthat. Where did that 78.4 percent come from? That is comparing the \nyield during the base period from 1981 to 1985 to the yield from 1998 \nto 2001. And it comes out to 78.4 percent.\n  So when you get through all the convoluted workings of the Cochran-\nRoberts amendment, the same 100 acres of soybeans that a farmer would \nraise next year, they would pay $1,547 for that 100 acres under \nCochran-Roberts. We pay $2,104, even though our payment rate is 55 \ncents a bushel. Theirs is more than 60 cents a bushel. But we do it \nhonestly, openly. Update your base\n\n[[Page S13451]]\n\nand update your yield: 100 acres times your yield, times 55 cents.\n  They say, oh, they are paying 60 cents a bushel, but it is on 85 \nacres--15 percent less than the 100 acres--times your yield, times 78.4 \npercent.\n  So I hope no one is going to be fooled that somehow Cochran-Roberts \nhas more direct payments out there than we do. It is just not so. It \nmay be higher, but it is on fewer acres, and it is on 78.4 percent of \nthe yield of that field.\n  So, again, when it comes to direct payments, Cochran-Roberts is \nconvoluted. They go back to all these old payment acres and outdated \nyields. But we actually pay more.\n\n  Next, I would like to cover loan rates. Under Cochran-Roberts, they \ncontinue current law, which establishes maximum loan rates and allows \nthe Secretary to lower the loan rates according to a formula of 85 \npercent of the 5-year average price for grains and oilseeds. You drop \nhigh and low-price years. So we can look at this. This will be the loan \nrates shown right here on this chart.\n  Let's just take wheat. I know the Senator from Kansas likes wheat. It \nis a big crop in his area. It is a good crop for the country.\n  Under our bill, the loan rate for wheat, right now, is $3 per bushel. \nNow, Cochran and Roberts might tell you that really their loan rate is \ngoing to be $2--what is it?--$2.53.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is $2.58.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry. It is $2.58. That is what they are saying, \n$2.58 per bushel. But that is the highest they can go. It is not the \nlowest they can go. Under their loan rates, because they use this old \nformula, it can go down from $2.58 to $2.30. If we have a high stocks-\nto-use ratio, which we do right now in wheat, the Secretary has the \nauthority to lower that another 10 percent, down to $2.07 a bushel. So, \nagain, under Cochran-Roberts, the loan rate can go to $2.07 a bushel \nfor wheat. Under our bill, it can go no lower than $3 a bushel.\n  On corn, it is the same thing. Under corn, Cochran-Roberts caps it at \n$1.89, as shown right here on the chart. We are at $2.08. They say: \nHey, cap it at $1.89. That is all the higher it can go, but it can go a \nlot lower. It can go down to, I think, $1.56 a bushel, as shown on this \nchart right here.\n  So don't think that this is the Cochran-Roberts loan rate, as shown \non this chart right here, not by a minute. It is down in here \nsomeplace, down around in here, as shown on this chart.\n  This is our loan rate: $2.08. The same is true of all the other \ngrains--sorghum, barley, and oats.\n  So when it comes to loan rates, Cochran-Roberts, again, is trying to \nfool you. They are trying to say: Their loan rate is less than ours, \nbut it is pretty high. That is not so. Because under the formula, it \ncan be reduced down, and then the Secretary has the authority to reduce \nit even lower.\n  We do not give the Secretary that authority. We take that authority \naway from the Secretary. Our loan rates are honest. It is $3 for wheat. \nYou cannot go a nickel lower than that. The Secretary does not have the \nauthority to lower it.\n\n  On WTO, there have been some questions raised about WTO compliance, \nwhether or not we are going to be okay on the WTO. Under WTO, we have \nwhat is called an amber box. This is product specific, what we spend on \nour crops. Under the WTO provisions, we are allowed to spend $19.1 \nbillion a year. I understand some people over here have said that under \nthe committee bill we might exceed that; then we will be not in \ncompliance with WTO.\n  Well, we used CBO estimates to determine how much we might spend. \nRight now under the current levels of spending, we are spending about \n$11 billion. We are allowed 19.1, but we are spending about 11. Under \n1731, using CBO estimates we will be spending about $13.6 billion. The \nmaximum that we would spend under 1731 would be $16.6 billion, a far \ncry from $19.1 billion. Again, if we are allowed to spend $19.1 billion \nto support farm income and to support family farmers and get them a \nbetter price for their grains, why should we be down here at $11.1 \nbillion? Why don't we get closer to $19.1 billion?\n  Again, even under the worst case scenario, using CBO estimates we are \ngoing to be almost $3 billion less than what we are allowed. Why should \nwe handcuff ourselves? I ask--I hope my friend will respond--why do we \nhave to be down here at such low levels? We might as well take \nadvantage of what WTO has given us, $19.1 billion, and use as much as \nwe can without exceeding this.\n  Under the WTO rules and under our bill, if it looks as though we ever \nare going to exceed this, the Secretary has the authority to cut \npayments. So there is an escape hatch. If the worst possible case \nscenario happened--worst case happened--it would have to be about like \nit was in 1985. If we had a year like 1985, we might get close to 19.1. \nBut that was 16 years ago. We haven't had a year like that since, and I \ndon't think it is likely we ever will. Again, under WTO we are in full \ncompliance. That is a red herring.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself another 5 minutes.\n  If anybody tells you we are going to violate WTO, that is nonsense; \nabsolute, utter poppycock.\n  Then under the amber box, we also have nonproduct specific. This is \nwhat we spend on crop insurance and conservation, things such as that. \nUnder this nonproduct specific, right now, I believe, again, we are \nallowed $10 billion. This is 5 percent. We are allowed 5 percent of the \nvalue of our total agricultural production that we can use here for \nthings such as for countercyclical and for crop insurance, we are \nallowed to spend 5 percent. We are right now, I believe, at about $7 \nbillion. Under 1731, we will be even lower than that. We will never \neven get close to that 5 percent, or $10 billion cap.\n  I also draw your attention to the green box. This is conservation, \nrural development. We are allowed to spend anything we want, anything \nwithout violating WTO. So what does Cochran-Roberts do? They take money \nout of this. They cut funding for conservation. They cut funding for \nrural development. They even cut some money out of research, when we \nhave no limits on how much we can spend there. So don't let anybody \nfool you to think that somehow we are not compliant with WTO. We are.\n  The last thing I will discuss--and this is not specific--is to show \nwhat they were cutting in conservation. Under the wildlife incentives \nprogram, wildlife habitat, we put in $1.25 billion. They put in only \n$350 million. This is for 5 years. Under the farmland protection \nprogram, where we buy up farmland and keep it from going into urban \ndevelopment, we put in $1.75 billion. They only put in $432 million. \nThe conservation security program, $387 million, we put in 5 years; \nthey zeroed it out.\n\n  The Secretary of Agriculture earlier put out a book. It is called \n``Food and Agriculture Policy, Taking Stock for the New Century.'' Here \nit is on page 10, conservation and the environment. They say, the \nprinciples for conservation: Sustained past environmental gains.\n  Then on page 81--if I remember this book right, on page 81 it says \n``the new approach.'' They are talking about incentives for stewardship \non working farmlands.\n\n       The new approach is broader. It may be the best option for \n     compensating farmers for the environmental amenities they \n     provide as well as recognizing the past efforts of ``good \n     actors'' who already practice enhanced stewardship. The \n     Department of Agriculture and the administration have \n     supported conservation on working lands, helping farmers who \n     have been good stewards in the past.\n\n  That is what we do. We put the money in there, $387 million, just \nwhat the administration said they wanted. Cochran-Roberts zeroes it \nout. And guess what. I am told the administration supports Cochran-\nRoberts. They zero it out.\n  Something is not adding up here. Something is not adding up here on \nthis because the administration now is saying they support Cochran-\nRoberts. I don't know if they do. Does the administration support your \namendment?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The administration is supporting the Cochran-Roberts \namendment even though earlier this year they wanted money in a program \nlike this to pay farmers on working lands. They zero it out. I guess \nthis administration doesn't give a hoot about conservation. That is \nexactly it. They want to talk about it. They want to put it in a nice, \nfancy book. But they don't want to pay for it. They don't\n\n[[Page S13452]]\n\nwant to pay farmers for being good conservationists. They want to \nsupport Cochran-Roberts.\n  This is why I talked about conservation, maintaining and paying \nfarmers for what they are already doing.\n  This is the one chart on which I think even Mr. Roberts will agree \nwith me. Last week we had an editorial in the newspaper saying this is \na piggy farm bill, we are spending too much money. I mentioned this \nlast Friday. I asked my staff to make up a chart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes remaining in total.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thought I had 7 minutes. I can't squeeze 1 more minute \nout of--didn't we say 7 minutes before we got into the colloquy on \nSenator Harkin's time, the distinguished Senator from Virginia who was \nextolling great virtue and compliments to the distinguished Senator on \nhis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to give wide latitude to \nthe Senator from Kansas, but the Senator from Virginia exceeded his \ntime.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thought the Senator from Iowa had yielded his time to \nhear all the accolades directed toward his personage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That part of the Senator's statement was \ncharged to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So then I have 7 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes, and not counting the time just \nused by the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I was just making an inquiry to the Chair about the \ntiming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Understood. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from Idaho who \nhas been a champion for State water rights in an amendment introduced \non the committee bill. There is an option there for the State to opt \nout. This is a very important issue to the entire West--for that \nmatter, any State. I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the leader with \nregard to this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nproposed by Senators Cochran and Roberts, not only because of the \nreasons that have been discussed already but because of important \nprovisions contained in the underlying bill that are unnecessary.\n  We have already spent a tremendous amount of time in this Chamber \ndebating the dairy provisions that were not removed from the \nlegislation. For that reason alone, we ought to substitute the Cochran-\nRoberts provisions.\n  Moreover, as Senator Roberts has indicated, the underlying bill \ncontains very dangerous provisions relating to water rights that \nrepresent a new intrusion of the Federal Government into the domain of \nState-controlled sovereignty over water rights. We will be debating \nthat later if we are not successful at this point in substituting the \nCochran-Roberts amendment. For those two reasons alone, we ought to \nsubstitute the Cochran-Roberts provisions for the amendments in the \nunderlying legislation to prevent unfortunate and inappropriate farm \npolicy from proceeding in the Senate farm bill.\n  I also congratulate Senator Roberts and Senator Cochran on their \ninnovative farm countercyclical payments account. This farm savings \naccount allows farmers to deposit money into an account and receive a \nmatch from the Federal Government. This assistance is nonmarket \ndistorting and, importantly, available to all agricultural producers, \nincluding specialty crops and ranchers.\n  I also thank our Senators for not weakening the planting restrictions \nin their proposal. These, too, help specialty crop farmers in America. \nI realize our time is short, so I will cut short my remarks.\n  I will conclude on this point. Comment has been made that the \nCochran-Roberts amendment is not sufficient in the area of \nconservation. I differ with that. I commend Senators Roberts and \nCochran for the strong commitment in their provision to protect \nconservation. Our farm bill, as many people in America don't realize, \nis one of the strongest protections of the environment that we have and \nthat we consider in Congress on a regular basis. The provisions in the \nCochran-Roberts proposal are strong commitments to continuing and \nstrengthening our conservation programs across this country.\n  Some of the charts show differences in numbers that look dramatic. \nBut one must remember that there is a numbers game being played. The \nnumbers used in the Cochran-Roberts proposal utilize the farm budget \nover a 10-year cycle, which is the way that our budget is established \nto appropriate it. The numbers utilized in the underlying bill squeeze \nall of that into 5 years and say nothing about what happens in the \noutlying 5 years, appearing that they are spending more money when, in \nreality, they are squeezing it into a front-loaded proposal. We have to \ncompare apples and apples. When we do, we will see that the Cochran-\nRoberts proposal has strong protections for farmers and commodity \ndealers, and protections and improvements in our conservation programs, \nand it doesn't contain the unfortunate attacks on State water \nsovereignty and unfortunate dairy provisions that the underlying \nprovision contains.\n  For those reasons, I strongly encourage the Senate to support the \nCochran-Roberts proposal.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today for two purposes: first, \nto support the amendment from my friend and colleague from Kansas, and \nsecond to briefly discuss an important priority of mine, carbon \nsequestration.\n  Shortly, we will vote on the Cochran-Roberts amendment, which is in \nessence, a substitute farm bill, with the main difference lying in the \ncommodity title. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for a \nvariety of reasons: this proposal helps farmers during hard times by \nretaining loan rates and increasing the fixed, decoupled payments that \nfarmers now get, but in place of the target price programs, Cochran-\nRoberts adds a farm savings account. These savings accounts will be \navailable to all producers to help with the risks of production and \nmarket risks. These savings accounts give farmers the tools they need \nto manage their finances and provides up to $1.2 billion in matching \nfunds annually.\n  The Cochran-Roberts proposal provides market-oriented loan rates and \npromotes dependable policy. This proposal provides farmers a \nconsistent, predictable income safety net and maintains flexibility in \nmarket-oriented planting.\n  The current Marketing Loan Program is continued for traditional \nprogram crops under this legislation. Overproduction is minimized by \nensuring more market-oriented loan rates. In times of low prices \nfarmers are protected through counter-cyclical income protection.\n  The reason these changes are so important is that we must guard \nagainst locking into place policies that guarantee overproduction and \nlow prices while also providing adequate protection against market \nlows. This is a very difficult balance to achieve, but it is curious \nthat the same opponents of freedom to farm, who chided the policy as \nguaranteeing overproduction, are now advocating policies which will do \nfar more to increase overproduction because they distort the market \nforces that would otherwise instruct farmers to pull back.\n  I understand the desire to complete action on a farm bill before the \nend of this year, of the concern that there won't be as much money \navailable in next year's farm bill. But I say to my colleagues, this \nbill is too important to rush through and do poorly merely for the sake \nof time.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, in \nsupporting this legislation. This is responsible farm legislation that \nwill help the hard working farmers of my State. The President and \nSecretary Veneman have stated their support for this legislation and I \nencourage my colleagues in Senate to pass this responsible farm \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S13453]]\n\n  Last week, this body adopted an amendment from Senator Wyden and my \nself to establish a carbon trading pilot program through farmer owned \ncooperatives. This will allow our farmers an opportunity to explore the \nmarket realities of this promising process that reduces carbon dioxide, \na greenhouse gas linked to climate change, while also improving water \nand soil quality. Co-ops will now be able to aggregate sequestered soil \ncarbon into tons and market it to utilities and other industries eager \nto offset their emissions. This is all still an experimental idea, \nwhich is exactly why we need to pilot program to explore the numerous \nquestions surrounding this issue. This pilot program will help us \nmeasure both the environmental gain and the economic potential for a \ncarbon market farmers can participate in.\n  Although I have concerns about much of the existing farm bill, I \napplaud the leadership of Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar on the \nsubject of conservation in this farm bill and specifically, the \nresearch and grant money for carbon sequestration contained in their \nbill. This is a critically important new market opportunity for farmers \nand the energy title of Senator Harkin's bill moves us to great deal \nforward on a number of important fronts.\n  I am pleased that the Cochran-Roberts amendment recognizes this \nstrength and keeps this title largely in tact.\n  In closing, I urge my colleague to vote for the Cochran-Roberts \namendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to speak on behalf of the \nfarm bill legislation and, specifically, the substitute being offered \nby Senators Cochran and Roberts. This is important legislation. Farm \npolicy is always important, not only to farmers but to America. This \nlegislation is also important to the State of Colorado because farming \nis important to the State of Colorado.\n  As a member of the House Agriculture Committee I participated in the \ndrafting of the current farm legislation and, as a member of the Senate \nAgricultural Committee, I participated in the drafting of the farm bill \nwe are about to consider. The drafting of farm policy is an interesting \nprocedure and I am happy that I have twice had the opportunity to be a \npart of it.\n  Many of the provisions in the Committee-passed version of the farm \nbill were bipartisan and have remained virtually the same in the \nCochran-Roberts substitute. The provisions in the Nutrition, Rural \nDevelopment, Credit, Energy, Research and Forestry titles have remained \nlargely unchanged. There are, however, some provisions in Cochran-\nRoberts that I believe will be very helpful to our farmers.\n  This bill allows for the implementation of a farm savings account \nprogram. Farmers can, in good times, contribute their own funds, which \ncan be matched dollar-for-dollar up to certain amounts, by the USDA. I \nthink that this is a wonderful way to help our farmers help themselves. \nIt is not unlike the Thrift Savings Plan that we offer our own staffers \nhere in the Senate. By putting back their own money for harder years of \nimprovements like new farm equipment farmers can begin to set \nthemselves back on their own feet and decrease their reliance on the \nU.S. Government.\n  Cochran-Roberts also maintains the integrity of the crop insurance \nprogram reforms. Specifically this legislation provides farmers with \nessential risk management if there is a crop failure. And, according to \nan analysis by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute the \nCochran-Roberts bill will result in higher market prices for farmers \nthan the committee-passed version. This is because the high loan rates \nin the committee-passed bill will provide incentives for over-\nproduction of crops. This, obviously, will result in lower market \nprices and increase the need for additional agricultural assistance. \nThat is not what we want for America's farms.\n  Cochran-Roberts will also provide for reasonable conservation \nfunding. Under this legislation, funding for conservation programs \nwould increase. Let me give you a few examples. Funding for EQIP, the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, would ramp up to $1.65 \nbillion by 2006. The conservation on Working Lands program is a new \nprogram that is included in EQIP and would receive funding in the \namount of $100 million in 2002. This funding would increase to $300 \nmillion by 2006. EQIP is a program which I strongly support. The \nessence of this program came from legislation I introduced while in the \nHouse and serving on the House Agriculture Committee to provide money \nfor cost share practices to reduce soil erosion and protect water \nquality. It is an important program that has tremendous environmental \nbenefits in rural and urban areas. The acreage cap in the Wetlands \nReserve Program would be increased so that up to 250,000 acres could be \nenrolled annually. Funding for the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program \nwould increase from $50 million in 2002 to $100 million in 2006.\n\n  I want to spend a little time on the Farmland Protection Program. \nWhen this program was established in the 1996 farm bill, funding was \nlimited to $35 million over the life of the bill. Now, due to the \nimmense popularity and success of the program we are funding at its \nhighest level ever, $435 million over the course of the bill. The \nfunding for the program ramps up from $65 million in fiscal year 02 to \n$100 million in fiscal year 06. This voluntary program provides funds \nto help purchase development rights to keep productive farmland in \nagricultural uses. In Colorado, the program has been successfully used \nto leverage additional State and private funding to help farmers and \nranchers stay on the land. In addition, Farmland Protection Program \nwould be clarified to provide that agricultural lands include ranch-\nlands and allows participation by non-profits and would require \nconservation plans for lands under easement.\n  Forty million dollars would also be provided for conservation on \nprivate grazing lands and the Natural Resources Conservation Service \nwould be funded to provide coordinated technical, educational and other \nrelated assistance programs to conserve and enhance private grazing \nland resources, and related benefits, to all citizens of the United \nStates.\n  In addition to providing increased funding to many conservation \nprograms this legislation would establish a new program, the Grasslands \nReserve program, that would aid in preserving native grasslands. \nEnrollment in this program would be 30-year, permanent easements and \ntotal enrollment would be capped at 2 million acres. Technical \nassistance and cost-sharing would be provided for the restoration of \ngrasslands.\n  I would also like to point out that this bill sticks to the trade \nobligations that we have made. I believe it is very important that we \nprovide responsible assistance to our farmers. However, I believe it is \nequally important that we adhere to the responsibilities that we have \nas a result of WTO agreements. In addition, this Farm Bill substitute \ncomes in under the budget allocation of $73.5 billion that was agreed \nto in the budget resolution. While many think that we can buy our way \nout of hard times, as a member of the Budget Committee, I believe that \nit is very important that we stick to the numbers outlined for in the \nbudget resolution.\n  Finally, equally important to getting a farm bill passed, is passing \na farm bill that can be signed into law. Secretary Veneman and the \nadministration are behind this bill. Secretary Veneman sent a letter \nindicating her strong support for this legislation and the White House \nhas also expressed their support for the provisions contained in \nCochran-Roberts.\n  Now I would like to talk to something that is very important to me. I \nthink that it is very important we focus on in the farm bill is \nresearch. As a veterinarian, this is an area that I believe in \nstrongly. In order for our nation to continue to have one of the most \nabundant and safest food supplies in the world we must continue funding \nour research priorities. Our world is one that has continued to become \nmore integrated. We can no longer assume that because a disease does \nnot occur naturally in our country we need not worry about it. We must \nalso be aware of the potential impact of diseases that are not \nnaturally occurring.\n\n  To this end, I worked to include several provisions in the research \nand forestry titles. The first allows for research and extension grants \non infectious animal diseases. This will assist in developing programs \nfor prevention and control methodologies for infectious animal diseases \nthat impact\n\n[[Page S13454]]\n\ntrade, including vesicular stomatitis, bovine tuberculosis, \ntransmissible spongiform encephalopathy, brucellosis and E. coli \n0157:H7 infection, which is the pathogenic form of E. coli infections. \nIt also set aside laboratory tests for quicker detection of infected \nanimals and the presence of diseases among herds; and prevention \nstrategies, including vaccination programs.\n  The second research provision that I included in the Research Title \nestablishes research and extension grants for beef cattle genetics \nevaluation research. It provides that the USDA shall give priority to \nproposals to establish and coordinate priorities for the genetic \nevaluation of domestic beef cattle. It consolidates research efforts in \norder to reduce duplication of efforts and maximize the return to the \nbeef industry and streamlines the process between the development and \nadoption of new genetic evaluation methodologies by the industries. The \nresearch will also identify new traits and technologies for inclusion \nin genetic programs in order to reduce the cost of beef production and \nprovide consumers with a healthy and affordable protein source.\n  The Forestry Title includes a provision which I sponsored to \nestablish Forest Fire Research Centers. There is an increasing threat \nto fire in millions of acres of forestlands and rangelands throughout \nthe United States. This threat is especially great in the interior \nStates of the western United States, where the Forest Service estimates \nthat 39,000,000 acres of National Forest System lands are at high risk \nof catastrophic wildfire.\n  Today's forestlands and rangelands are the consequences of land \nmanagement practices that emphasized the control and prevention of \nfires, and such practices disrupted the occurrence of frequent low-\nintensity fires that had periodically removed flammable undergrowth. As \na result of these management practices, forestlands and rangelands in \nthe United States are no longer naturally functioning ecosystems, and \ndrought cycles and the invasion of insects and disease have resulted in \nvast areas of dead or dying trees, overstocked stands and the invasion \nof undesirable species.\n  Population movement into wildland/urban interface areas exacerbate \nthe fire danger, and the increasing number of larger, more intense \nfires pose grave hazards to human health, safety, property and \ninfrastructure in these areas. In addition smoke from wildfires, which \ncontain fine particulate matter and other hazardous pollutants, pose \nsubstantial health risks to people living in the wildland/urban \ninterface.\n  The budgets and resources of local, State, and Federal entities \nsupporting firefighting efforts have been stretched to their limits. In \naddition, diminishing Federal resources (including personnel) have \nlimited the ability of Federal fire researchers to respond to \nmanagement needs, and to utilize technological advancements for \nanalyzing fire management costs.\n  This legislation will require the Secretary of Agriculture shall \nestablish at least two forest fire research centers at institutions of \nhigher education that have expertise in natural resource development \nand are located in close proximity to other Federal natural resource, \nforest management and land management agencies. The two forest fire \nresearch centers shall be located in--A. California, Idaho, Montana, \nOregon, or Washington and B. Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, or \nWyoming.\n\n  The purpose of the Research Center is to conduct integrative, \ninterdisciplinary research into the ecological, socio-economic, and \nenvironmental impacts of fire control and use managing ecosystems and \nlandscapes; and develop mechanisms to rapidly transfer new fire control \nand management technologies to fire and land managers.\n  Lastly, the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Interior, shall establish an advisory committee composed \nof fire and land managers and fire researchers to determine the areas \nof emphasis and establish priorities for research projects conducted at \nforest fire research centers.\n  Again, I believe that research of all kinds is fundamental. Which is \nwhy I am pleased that the committee-passed legislation also contains \nseveral provisions that allow for the enhancement and expansion of \nresearch in the area of renewable energy. A number of grants were \ncreated to help increase the use of renewable resources. These grants \nwill provide funds for biorefineries to convert biomass into fuel and \nassistance for rural electric co-ops to develop renewable energy \nsources to help serve their area's energy needs. These grants will also \nprovide education and technical assistance to help farmers develop and \nmarket renewable energy resources and programs to educate the public \nabout the benefits of biodiesel fuel use.\n  Before I close I want to talk again about the need for the inclusion \nof the language that would include fighting birds in the interstate \nshipment ban that exists in the Animal Welfare Act. I would like to \npoint out that the need for this stems largely from the need to give \nindividual states the ability to enforce their laws. When a state \nlegislature passes a law they expect to be able to enforce it. But when \na loophole in Federal law allows for that law to be ``ducked'' there is \na problem. The current provisions in the interstate shipment section of \nthe Animal Welfare Act provides just such a loophole. Because live \nbirds are specifically excluded from inclusion in the interstate \ntransport ban they are the only animal that can legally be taken across \nstate lines for the purpose of fighting. There is absolutely no need \nfor this exclusion. When a person is caught in a State where \ncockfighting is illegal they can simply claim that they are \ntransporting the birds to one of the 3 States where cockfighting is \nlegal. And, law enforcement has to let them go. There is no way for law \nenforcement officers to determine if they really are transporting the \nbirds or if the cockfight will be held right down the road. States \nshould not have to trip over Federal law in the pursuit of enforcing \ntheir own laws.\n  As I and many of my colleagues have previously stated, this is an \nimportant issue and I hope that we can do what makes the most sense, \nand will be best for, all of America's farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 13 seconds for the Senator \nfrom Kansas, and 2 minutes 39 seconds for the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will let the Senator from Kansas, my \ngood friend, close. It is his amendment.\n  Senator Roberts is a great friend of mine. We have worked together \nfor many years. We have a different philosophy and a different policy \non agriculture. Senator Roberts believes very strongly in Freedom to \nFarm. I understand and respect that. Quite frankly, there were some \ngood things I said earlier in committee that shocked him to death about \nFreedom to Farm. Planning flexibility, for example, we keep that in \nthere.\n  But what I have heard from my farmers in Iowa, and all over this \ncountry, is that we need to modify Freedom to Farm. We don't need to \nthrow it all out the window, but we need to modify it because what has \nbeen lacking is a decent income farm safety net. That is why we are \nhere every year, year after year, with billions of dollars to help bail \nout farmers.\n  So what we have done in our bill is kept the best of the old Freedom \nto Farm, but we put in a good safety net. We have four legs to our \nchair, or stool, of support: Direct payments, good loan rates, \nconservation payments, and a countercyclical payment when prices are \nlow. Cochran-Roberts has two legs; that is all. They have direct \npayments, and they have some modest lower loan rates, and that is all.\n  Our farmers are saying they need a better safety net. That is what we \ndid. We modified Freedom to Farm. Farmers want more conservation. We \nhave the money for conservation in that, which Cochran-Roberts takes \nout.\n  Energy: We put in a new title on energy. Our farmers are saying that \nis the market for the future. They say: We are going to make ethanol, \nsoy diesel, and we will create biomass energy. That is going to be our \nmarket for the future.\n  Mr. President, they gut that program.\n  Rural development: Every farmer I have ever spoken to says: It \ndoesn't do anything good if you save my farm and\n\n[[Page S13455]]\n\nour small towns go down the drain. We need better job opportunities in \nrural communities.\n  That is what we have in our bill. That is what Cochran-Roberts takes \naway. If all you want to do is continue what we have been doing for the \npast 5 years on Freedom to Farm, then you will want to support Cochran-\nRoberts. But if you want to modify Freedom to Farm, not throw it all \nout, but have a good safety net, good conservation programs, and energy \nprograms so we will have more ethanol in the country and develop more \nsoy diesel and other things, and if you want a strong rural development \nprogram that will provide for jobs and economic opportunity for off-\nfarm income in rural America, that is in the committee bill.\n  That is why Cochran-Roberts should be defeated. We don't need to \ncontinue down the road just with Freedom to Farm as we have in the past \n5 years. Let's modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, there are several basic reasons I urge \ncolleagues to support the Cochran-Roberts amendment.\n  No. 1, there has been a great deal of discussion about which bill \nserves small farmers versus big farmers--most especially from the \nSenator from North Dakota. Under Cochran-Roberts, the payment \nlimitation is $165,000 total for direct payments for the farm accounts \nthat are in the bill, and then also the loan deficiency payments.\n\n  Second, truth in budgeting: The committee bill spends $46 billion \nover the first 5 years, allotted over a 10-year part of the bill, only \nleaving $28 billion. We are robbing the future to pay for the current \nbill.\n  Then we have the issue of the guaranteed payments. Again, again, and \nagain I say if the farmer loses a crop, he is not eligible for the loan \nrate at the target price. The target price is capped. It only goes to \nabout $3.45. There is more protection under our bill. Under the WTO, \nlet me quote from the Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute:\n\n       Given the structure of the changes, we calculate a 30 \n     percent chance that the U.S. will exceed this limit in the \n     2000 marketing year.\n\n  And they also go ahead and say:\n\n       The countercyclical program begins payments in the 2004 \n     marketing year essentially replacing green box expenditures \n     with amber box expenditures.\n\n  I think it is too dangerous a road to go down. The President and the \nadministration support this amendment, and we can conference it more \nquickly with the House. This is not a stalling bill. This is an \namendment to get this farm bill done.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I assume all time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Cochran-Roberts \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Lott), and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Gramm) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 374 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Akaka\n     Gramm\n     Helms\n     Lott\n     Murkowski\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the motion was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are making progress. We had a good \ndebate on the Cochran-Roberts amendment. Two good friends and two very \nvaluable members of the Agriculture Committee have had a good debate on \nthis. It was the substantive vote on whether or not we were going to \nstick with the committee bill. There are other amendments that will be \noffered that might change things on the edges, but this was the \nsubstantive vote on whether or not we would go with the committee bill.\n  I hope now that we can begin to dispose of some amendments in a \ntimely fashion. Right now, if I am not mistaken, one of the underlying \namendments is the amendment offered by Senator Smith, and there was a \nsecond degree offered by Senator Torricelli. I would like to move to \ntable that amendment, but obviously they want to speak a little bit \nlonger on it. I checked with them and Senator Smith and Senator \nTorricelli and Senator Dorgan agreed on 3 minutes each on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent the author of the amendment, Senator Smith, \nbe allowed to speak for 3 minutes; following him, Senator Torricelli \nfor 3 minutes, and Senator Dorgan for 3 minutes, and at the end of that \ntime, all time end and I be recognized for a motion to table the \nunderlying Smith amendment.\n  I call for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2596\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Smith amendment numbered 2596 is now \npending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nHampshire be allowed to speak for 3 minutes, Senator Torricelli for 3 \nminutes, and Senator Dorgan for 3 minutes, and at the end of that time \nI be recognized to move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, \nSenator Torricelli, for his cooperation in working together on two \namendments which are slightly different but share the same goals. I am \npleased to work with him.\n  Cuba is currently one of the nations listed by the State Department \nas a state sponsor of terrorism. They are in good company: Iraq, North \nKorea, Iran, Syria, Libya, and the Sudan.\n  Until the State Department removes Cuba from this list of state \nsponsors of terrorism, the U.S. Government should not permit the \nprivate financing of agricultural sales to prop up that regime. That is \nessentially what Senator Torricelli and I are talking about.\n  The administration is opposed to the language in the bill and Senator \nTorricelli and I modify that language. If the President certifies that \nCuba has stopped sponsoring terrorism or that American fugitives who \nare hiding in Cuba who committed atrocious crimes--some of the crimes \nin the home State of Senator Torricelli from New Jersey--they ought to \nbe returned.\n  That is the gist of the amendments. I remind my colleagues what \nPresident Bush said: Every nation in every region has a decision to \nmake. Either you are\n\n[[Page S13456]]\n\nwith us or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any \nnation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded \nby the United States as a hostile regime.\n\n  It seems to me reasonable that if there are murderers who Fidel \nCastro is hiding in Cuba, he could easily return them so they could be \nprosecuted in New Jersey or other States where they committed the \nterrible crimes. If Cuba is on the State Department list of terrorist \nnations, it seems reasonable they ought to be removed before we give \nthem help. I rest my case.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Torricelli-Smith amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent request, the \nSenator from New Jersey is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank Senators Smith, Helms, Ensign, Graham, and \nNelson for being part of this effort.\n  The administration supports these amendments and opposes the \nprovision in the bill. It would be shocking if the President of the \nUnited States did not support us. President Bush has made very clear, \nin this world, you are with us in the fight against terrorism or you \nare against us.\n  We are in the middle of a worldwide fight against terrorism and \nalmost unbelievably in this Senate this bill contains a provision that \nthe United States would allow private banks, guaranteed by the U.S. \nGovernment, to sell products to Fidel Castro's Cuba while the State \nDepartment has listed Cuba as harboring terrorists--not one terrorist \ngroup but four terrorist groups.\n  Further, it is amending the bill to say to Fidel Castro: If you want \nthe privilege of our finance, get yourself off the terrorist list; if \nyou want the privilege of our finance, return the 77 fugitives living \nin Cuba wanted for murder, hijacking, and terrorist activities.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about what we are doing, what kind of a \nmessage we are sending. We send troops halfway around the world to \nfight terrorists. But now on the floor of the Senate, before our troops \neven come home, we are authorizing the financing of exports to a \ncountry we have identified as harboring terrorists. It doesn't make \nsense. Of course, the President is opposed to it. Of course, we should \nbe opposed to it. But it will be argued that we need this for business, \nthat we need this to help our farmers. I don't believe there is a \nfarmer in America who wants to make a buck selling products to people \nwho harbor fugitives from justice. But even if they did, what kind of a \nbusiness proposition is this?\n  Fidel Castro owes $11 billion to financial institutions, he has not \npaid it back; $20 billion to former Soviet Union; he hasn't paid it \nback. His current account deficit is $700 million. He can't meet the \nbills. Even if you loaned him the money, he couldn't pay it back.\n  Don't let anybody tell you that in doing this we are not being a \ngenerous people. Fidel Castro can buy American food. He has to pay for \nit. The United States has given more food and medicine to Cuba in the \nlast 10 years than any one nation has given to any other nation in \nmodern history. He is getting donations. He can buy our food. We just \nshould not finance it because he can't bay it back and he doesn't \ndeserve it.\n  Consistency in America foreign policy; financing sales to a nation on \nour terrorist list, never.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, does anyone in the Senate Chamber think \nFidel Castro has ever missed a meal because for 40 years we have said \nto family farmers in America: You can't sell food to Cuba? What meal \nhas he missed? You know and I know this 40-year failed policy is a \npolicy that takes a swing at Fidel Castro and it hits poor people, and \nsick people, and hungry people in Cuba. And it hurts American farmers \nhere at home. We know that.\n  Let me ask the question about consistency. We hear these discussions \nabout Cuba. Is there a sanction against private financing to send food \nto Communist China? No, there is not. Is there a prohibition against \nprivate financing to send food to Vietnam, which is a Communist \ncountry? No, there is not. Is there a prohibition against sending food \nto North Korea, a Communist country? No. Is there a prohibition of \nprivate financing to send food to Libya or Iran? The answer is no. No.\n  So we are told that somehow there needs to be a sanction, or a \ncontinued sanction for the past 40 years, to prohibit private financing \nto send food to Cuba. It is a foolish failed public policy, and \neveryone knows it.\n  How long does it take to understand that a policy doesn't work? Ten \nyears? Twenty years? With Cuba, it has been 40 years.\n  American farmers are told they should pay the price for this foreign \npolicy. What is the price? The price is your Canadian neighbors can \nsell food to Cuba. The French can sell, the English can sell, and all \nof the European countries can sell. It is just the United States \nfarmers who are told: You can't sell food to Cuba.\n  That is a foolish public policy. It is time to stop it, this notion \nabout a Communist country. This is the only country in the world which \nemploys this policy, and it doesn't work.\n  As I said when I started, Fidel Castro has not missed a meal because \nof this policy. But hungry people, sick people, and poor people have \nbeen severely disadvantaged for a long while. That is not what this \ncountry ought to be doing in foreign policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Smith amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I filed an amendment. I know I cannot \ncall it up tonight. I hoped to be able to lay down this amendment this \nevening. At this point, I can't. But hopefully we will be able to work \nout a means by which I can lay that amendment down tomorrow morning \nbefore the cloture vote tomorrow afternoon.\n  The amendment I filed this evening is the bipartisan farm bill that \nhad been filed earlier by Senator Lincoln, myself, Senator Helms, \nSenator Miller, Senator Sessions, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Breaux. \nIt is truly the only bipartisan farm bill we have had out here, with \nfour Democrats and three Republicans. It is basically the House bill \nthat was passed by the House of Representatives.\n  At this late date, I have done everything I can to move a farm bill \nforward. I again reiterate my strong support for passing and completing \na farm bill this year.\n  Farmers in the State of Arkansas have been very clear with me on this \nissue, just as I think they have been clear with most Members of the \nSenate. They want to see a farm bill completed before we leave for \nChristmas.\n  When the farm bill debate seemed to be dragging, I urged my \ncolleagues to move forward. We introduced a bipartisan bill closely \nresembling that which was passed in the House in hopes that it would \nstart the Agriculture Committee moving forward. I commend Senator \nHarkin, the chairman, for pushing a markup late in this session. After \nall of the time and energy that was spent on a lot of issues important \nto this country--the war on terror--Senator Harkin was determined that \nwe get the bill out of committee. I supported that. I supported the \nCochran-Roberts proposal and turned around and supported the chairman's \nproposal. I thought we had to get something out this year. If it took \ncompromise on my part, I was willing to make it.\n  I was not the only Republican member of the Agriculture Committee to \nsupport the Harkin commodity title. I don't think it is necessarily the \nbest policy, but it is far better than what our farmers are dealing \nwith right now.\n  When the farm bill came to the floor, I was assured that now was the \ntime we would seek the final compromise to get this farm bill passed. \nHowever, the process has broken down along partisan lines. We have not \nbeen able to come to a consensus.\n  I am deeply disappointed that we are at risk of now leaving without a \nfarm bill. I don't blame my colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle. I don't blame my colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle. \nBut it is time we achieve a compromise. We must not dig in our heels at \nthis point.\n  I believe the House bill is the best possible chance we have of \ngetting a bill to the President. Again, this bill is sponsored by four \nDemocrats and three Republicans. It was one about which I talked with \nthe chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. It could be \nconferenced very quickly--in a matter of probably an hour's time--and \nwe could have a bill to the President. While all of us may have our \npreferences, this is our chance to get something to the President this \nyear.\n  I voted for cloture repeatedly, and I am going to continue to vote \nfor cloture. I have crossed the lines to do so many times. Some have \nsuggested where that line is right now.\n  I know my farmers want a farm bill. In an effort to move that process \nforward, I offered this bipartisan alternative. I filed it tonight. It \nis cosponsored by Senator Lott and Senator Sessions. I am hopeful the \ncosponsors of the legislation when it was first introduced will join in \nsupport of this bill and that we will be able to get a bill signed into \nlaw.\n\n  Even if we were able to get cloture tomorrow and get it passed at \nthis late date, there is no possible way the differences between the \nHarkin bill and the House-passed bill could be reconciled in time to \nhelp our farmers.\n  This past weekend I heard the farmers in Arkansas saying if we don't \nget it done before the new year, it is too late--in effect, that they \nare now going to their bankers and making the loans. They are making \ntheir preparations for crops next year. To wait until after we come \nback on January 23 before we put together a conference to begin to try \nto work out differences in the House and Senate bill is not good news \nfor the farmers of this country. The best chance we have of getting \nthis bill signed into law this year is to adopt this House bill, the \nsubstitute, and send it to a quick conference, and on to the President \nfor his signature.\n  I hope we will have the opportunity in the morning to get this laid \ndown. Depending on the outcome of that cloture vote, we will have a \nfull and thorough debate. An opportunity to vote on this substitute is \nreally our last chance to get a bill signed into law before we leave \nfor Christmas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, farm-related issues are very important to \nthe people of Nevada. We raise cattle. We have dairies. We grow a lot \nof garlic. We have one place in the State of Nevada which raises the \nlargest amount of white onions than any place in the United States. \nEven though it is not a great contributor to our economy, it is a very \nimportant contributor to our economy.\n  For someone who is not involved in the nitty-gritty of the farm bill, \nI know there is one section I worked on which is extremely important to \nthe people of our country--especially the western part of the United \nStates--dealing with conservation.\n  It is too bad there is a concerted effort to kill this legislation. \nThis bill is extremely important to our country. Farm bills have been \npart of this country since we became a country. I hope that tomorrow \nwhen we vote again to invoke cloture, people will understand that it \nmay be the last attempt to get a farm bill this year.\n  With all the plaintive cry, Well, I think we should pass the bill \nthat the House passed some time ago--I am familiar, generally speaking, \nwith the House bill. I am also familiar with what has happened in the \nSenate. I may not know every line and verse of the Senate bill, but I \nknow, because I have been involved in putting together that bill \nprocedurally, how difficult it has been to arrive at this point where \nthere is general agreement. More than 50 Senators want this bill to \npass. I will bet, if the truth were known, it would be a lot more than \n50 Senators. People want this legislation to pass.\n  This is an effort maybe to try to embarrass Senators, I guess. There \nis no other reason I can think of. I have never said this publicly, but \nthe fact of matter is the chairman of this committee is up for \nreelection this year. There is nothing more important to the majority \nleader's State than farm issues. Maybe it is an attempt to embarrass \nthe majority leader.\n  I could go on with reasons for attempting to kill this bill. But the \nfact of the matter is the only people being hurt--this is not about \nDemocrats and Republicans being hurt in this stalling procedure--are \nthe people of this country who need this bill. This bill is important \nto more than agricultural producers in this country. It is important to \npeople who consume these agricultural products.\n\n[[Page S13458]]\n\n  This is a delicately balanced bill that the majority of the Senate \nsupports. It is a shame--it is a shame, as I see it--there is an \nattempt being made to kill this legislation.\n\n  How many more times, with Christmas Eve being next Monday, can the \nleader call upon the Senate to vote on cloture? They think there is \nalways going to be another opportunity. Tomorrow may be the last \nopportunity.\n  I say to those Senators who are voting against cloture, the \nresponsibility is on their shoulders. This should not be a partisan \npolitical issue. This bill was reported out of the Agriculture \nCommittee on a bipartisan vote. So I think it is too bad we are at the \npoint where we are now.\n  I would hope that tomorrow, when we vote, there would be a sense of \nhow important this bill is to the country.\n  Tomorrow afternoon, we are going to vote. We are going to vote on \ninvoking cloture on this bill. If cloture were invoked on this bill, we \nwould finish this bill before Christmas. But if we do not, I think it \nis going to be very difficult to get a bill. I think that would be \nreally, really too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader for \nhis kind words and his observations on this farm bill.\n  It is obvious now to all--those in the press, any objective \nobserver--what has been going on here in the Senate, that there is a \nstall tactic going on. There is no doubt in my mind anymore. Earlier I \nthought we were just going to have our votes and have our debate and \nmove on. Now it looks as though, for whatever reason, there is politics \nbeing played here. It is just a darn shame that our farmers and our \nranchers and our people in rural America and in our small towns are \nbeing held hostage to a game of politics this late in the year on this \nfarm bill.\n  I have been through a lot of farm bills in 27 years. I have been \nthrough three in the Senate in 17 years. Again, I believe this bill \ncame out of committee with more bipartisan votes than any bill that has \never come out of the Agriculture Committee to the Senate floor.\n  Every single title of this bill was voted on by Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously, except for \none title, the commodities title. That got bipartisan support. The \nSenator from Arkansas voted for that.\n  I knew we were going to have to come on the floor and probably have \ndebate and amendments on the commodities title. I understood that. I \nsaid that when the bill was reported out of committee. But I \ncongratulated the Agriculture Committee for acting in a bipartisan \nfashion on the bill.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we had tough negotiations. This is a \nbig country. There is a lot of different agriculture. My agriculture in \nIowa is different than the agriculture in Georgia or in Arkansas or in \nCalifornia or in Oregon or in Maine. So we had to try to keep this in \nbalance. We had to try to balance all these interests. It was hard \nwork, but we did it. I did not do it. We did it. Republicans and \nDemocrats did it on the Agriculture Committee. We did it together.\n  I cannot say enough about the working relationship that we had with \nSenator Lugar and his staff in working out all these different titles \non research, on trade, on conservation, on nutrition, and all these \nthings. Maybe we did not always agree, but we recognized that you \ncannot always agree on everything. We worked it out. We worked it out \nto the point where we had a comprehensive, well-balanced bill passed \nout of committee.\n  Again, I knew we were going to have some votes on the floor on \ncommodities. That is fair game. But now I see all this other stuff \nhappening now. Now it is becoming clear to me, as we go toward the end \nof the year, that, for whatever reason, the leadership on the \nRepublican side of the aisle does not want a farm bill out of the \nSenate before we leave here.\n  Now, hope springs eternal. If we could get cloture tomorrow, and if \nwe could wrap up the farm bill tomorrow night, on Wednesday--I talked \nto Congressman Combest, who is the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee on the House side. I said: If we get it done, can we go to \nconference? He said he is ready. As soon as we get it done, we go to \nconference. Can we finish it before we get out of here? I assume we are \ngoing to get out of here this weekend. I hope. It is probably unlikely \nnow, but at least we would start. And the farmers and ranchers of this \ncountry, and the people in rural America, would know we were committed, \nwe passed the bill, we got it out of here, and we are in conference.\n  Even if we couldn't finish the conference by Friday or Saturday, it \nwould mean, I say to my friend from Nevada, that our staffs in the \nSenate and the House--Republican staff and Democratic staff--in early \nJanuary, before we come back here, could begin to work all these things \nout before we have to go to conference. When we come back on the 23rd \nof January, we could have it just about wrapped up. Maybe there would \nbe a few final things in conference. But we could get the bill passed \nand get it to the President by the end of January.\n\n  If we do not pass the bill in the Senate before we leave, it will not \nbe on the President's desk before the end of January. I will tell you \nsomething else. It will not be on the President's desk before the end \nof February, if we do not finish this bill in the Senate this week.\n  So for those who talk all the time about certainty for our farmers \nand for our bankers and for our lenders, and people who have to come in \nand get the money they need, I say to my friend from the South, you \nneed it before we need it in the Midwest. Your farmers are in the field \nbefore ours. And their lenders and their bankers want to know, with \ncertainty, what is out there.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, if we do not finish the bill in the \nSenate before we leave here, and our staffs cannot work on it to get to \nconference, and work out all these things so that when we come back on \nthe 23rd, the President will not have this bill, that means we will \nstill be on the farm bill when we come back here on the 23rd, and then \nit is ``Katie bar the door.'' You think you have amendments now? You \nwait until we come back here on the 23rd. We will have 200 amendments \nor more.\n  I will say it one more time so I am absolutely clear. If this bill is \nnot passed in the Senate before we leave here, the President will not \nhave it on his desk before the end of February. We will be lucky to \nhave it by March.\n  Then, if that is not enough, we are going to have January estimates \ncoming out of OMB. It is going to show that we are going to slide even \nfurther into deficit spending. And then guess what has happened to our \n$73.5 billion that we have over the next 10 years. Kiss it good-bye.\n  Now go home and tell your farmers how you stopped this bill in the \nSenate, and now we have less money for our farmers and people in rural \nAmerica because it was stopped before we could get out of here at the \nend of the year. That is what is at stake.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, who are \nslowing this down: You are playing a dangerous game. You may think you \nare getting me. You may think you are getting Majority Leader Daschle. \nBut you are getting the farmers. You may be shooting at us, but the \nbullets are hitting the farmers and ranchers of America. They are not \nhitting us, not at all.\n  We have done our job. We pulled this bill together. This is a good \nbill. It is a good bill for America. It is a balanced bill. Am I saying \nit is perfect? Of course it is not perfect. If I could write the farm \nbill by myself, I would put it all in Iowa. Then it would be perfect.\n  It is a balanced bill.\n  I understand that my friend from Arkansas has just filed an amendment \nwhich is the House-passed farm bill. The House passed its bill. He \nwants to offer the House bill. That way we don't even need to have a \nconference. It just goes to the President. Of course, that is the bill \nthe President said was unsatisfactory. If the House bill were to pass, \nit means we don't have a conference. That is the end of it. It undoes \nall the hard work we did, all of the hours that the occupant of the \nChair and I and Republicans working together, Senator Lugar, his staff, \nall of us working together to bring a balanced bill together.\n  Why are we Senators? If all we want is what the House does, why are \nwe Senators? Why do we spend this time?\n\n[[Page S13459]]\n\n  As a Senate and as Senators, we do tend to look at things in a \nbroader perspective. We have been Members of the House, most of us \nhere. We tend to take a broader perspective. That is what this bill \ndoes, it is broader based. It is for all of the country.\n  The House bill doesn't do enough for conservation. There is no energy \ntitle in it. This is a bill we ought to be proud of. We have an energy \ntitle for the first time ever in a farm bill, we have an energy title \nto promote ethanol and soy diesel and biomass and wind, all of the \ndifferent forms of energy--methane. That is in this bill. It is not in \nthe House bill. So we just throw that out the window, too.\n  Farmers want different markets. They want an energy provision. They \nwant to know that we are going to start promoting ethanol more than we \never have in the past. If you vote for the House bill, kiss it goodbye.\n  I say to my friends who are thinking of voting for the House bill, \nthey ought to think again. Take a look--I say to every Senator here--\nadd up, look at it first economically. Add up what happens to your \nState in the next 5 years under the committee-passed bill and under the \nHouse bill. I will wager that every single State represented in this \nChamber will do better overall under the committee bill than under the \nHouse-passed bill economically, in terms of commodities and everything \nelse. Add them all up, conservation payments, energy payments, all \nthose things, add them all up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Hope springs eternal. I will not give up. I will not \nquit. I will never give up in trying to get the best deal possible for \nall the farmers of this country. I don't care how long we have to stay \nhere, how late we have to stay here. I will fight to the last day, to \nthe last breath to get this bill out of here and get it out of the \nSenate because it is best for America and it is best for our farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have to assume that after listening to you and after \nlistening to Senator Harkin, you don't want to hear another point of \nview on this issue in conformity.\n  Mr. REID. I didn't say that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to speak before you speak.\n  Mr. REID. What I would do, to inform the Senator, I will go through \nthe wrap-up and then just indicate how much time each of you wish to \nspeak tonight.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then let's leave it this way. You are doing exactly \nwhat I said. I won't say anything, but I resent your saying that we are \nstalling on this side when I was here to offer an amendment even at \nthis late date. You told me less than an hour ago, no more amendments. \nSo have the record show that the Senator from Iowa, the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa, was ready to offer an amendment and go through a time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, who is the senior \nSenator from Iowa--and I have the greatest respect for him--we have \nbeen on this bill for a long time. People can go through all the \nmachinations they want, saying they were ready to offer amendments. The \nfact is, we voted on cloture on two separate occasions. It has been \nopposed. We are going to do it again tomorrow. The fact is, we had \nother votes to do tonight.\n  I actually was contacted by the assistant minority leader, and he \nasked that we not have another vote. I agreed with that. I felt it was \ntime to wrap things up. It was about 22-to-9 then.\n  As I told the Senator from Iowa, when we were not speaking publicly, \nbut I will say this publicly, no one has ever questioned the work ethic \nof the Senator from Iowa. He has been, since I have been here, one of \nthe first to get here and always one of the last to leave. No one \nquestions the work ethic of the Senator from Iowa. I want to make sure \nthe record is clear in that regard.\n  Does the Senator from Arkansas wish to speak tonight?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I could have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I speak today in support of Senator \nVoinovich's legislation, S. 1271, the Small Business Paperwork Relief \nAct of 2001, as well as my amendment to improve the legislation for the \nbenefit of America's small businesses.\n  While legislation such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act have made great \nstrides in helping to ease the regulatory burden on our small \nbusinesses, more work remains to be done.\n  In the report prepared by the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy on the recommendations of the White House Conference on \nSmall Business in 1995, the Office of Advocacy stated that, ``Federal, \nState and local governments impose numerous requirements on the \noperation of businesses. The burdens associated with these requirements \nare often exacerbated by substantial paperwork and record-keeping \nrequirements. In addition to the cost and administrative burdens, small \nand growing businesses have difficulty simply keeping abreast of the \nvarious regulatory and paperwork requirements.'' Six years later, this \nstatement is still true.\n  While I support the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act, I think it \nis important to point out that I objected to an original request to \npass this legislation by unanimous consent because the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, which I Chair, has jurisdiction \nover some of the issues included in this legislation. Additionally, the \nexpertise of the Committee on issues of importance to small businesses \ncan only serve to enhance any legislation designed to help our nation's \nsmall businesses. That being said, Senator Voinovich and I have \naddressed my questions about the legislation and agreed to an \namendment. I believe the bill is better because of our work.\n  The legislation originally called for the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, OMB, to appoint members to the ``Task Force'' \ncreated in the legislation from the various agencies listed in the \nbill. Although I had no objection to the Task Force being led by the \nOMB Director, I did have reservations about the OMB Director selecting \nthe participants, a function that should be vested with each agency \nhead. The amendment makes this change.\n  Additionally, my amendment has a provision stating that in any report \nissued by the Task Force, minority views must be included. This \nprovision has been added as a result of my consultations with SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy, who were concerned that reports issued on small \nbusiness issues may not reflect the views of small business advocates. \nBy allowing minority opinions, any report issued by the Task Force will \nat the very least contain concerns raised by the small business \ncommunity.\n  My amendment also adds the National Ombudsman to the list of \nrecipients receiving bi-annual reporting on the number of enforcement \nactions taken by agencies. The National Ombudsman, located at the SBA, \nserves as a confidential resource to field complaints and comments from \nsmall businesses about the regulatory process and actions taken by \nregulatory agencies. Additionally, the National Ombudsman rates Federal \nregulatory agencies on their treatment of small businesses and issues a \nreport card. Therefore, I felt it appropriate that agency information \nregarding regulatory enforcement be shared with the National Ombudsman.\n  Finally, my amendment makes a technical change in the legislation to\n\n[[Page S13460]]\n\nreflect the name change of the Senate Committee on Small Business to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, which occurred on \nJune 29 of this year.\n  I would just like to state that I believe the changes my amendment \nmakes will provide additional support for our small businesses \nsuffering from paperwork burdens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13460-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in November \n1996 in Charlottesville, VA. Three men abducted, robbed, and beat a gay \nman. One of the assailants, Billy Ray McKethan, 19, pleaded guilty to \ncharges brought against him in connection with the incident, and was \nsentenced to 20 years in prison without parole.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13460-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13460-S13461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAMES KEVIN O'CONNELL\n\n Mr. DODD.

I urge all my colleagues to take the \ntime to read this heartfelt tribute to a man who so touched Senator \nLieberman, as well as anyone else who had the pleasure to have known \nhim, as did I.\n  Jimmy O'Connell was best known as Senator Lieberman's driver for 30 \nyears, but as Senator Lieberman makes clear in his beautiful tribute, \nJimmy was much, much more than that. One could not have known Jimmy \nwithout thinking him a friend, someone to whom you could turn for a \nquick joke, or a deep philosophical insight.\n  Jimmy, born and raised in New Haven, was truly a great Nutmegger, and \na fine American. He spent his life caring for his family, his friends, \nand his community, Jimmy served for 3 decades as a proud member of the \nNew Haven Police force.\n  Senator Lieberman's tribute reminds us of the value of life, the \nvalue of relationships, and the special place in our hearts for Jimmy \nO'Connell.\n  The eulogy follows.\n       I want to thank Mrs. Agnes O'Connell, Brother Kevin \n     O'Connell and the rest of Jimmy's family for giving me the \n     honor of speaking at this funeral mass for him. And, I also \n     want to thank the O'Connell family for all they did to make \n     James Kevin the wonderful man he was.\n       When a newspaper reporter called on Sunday and asked how I \n     would describe what Jimmy did for me, the words that came out \n     of my mouth were that Jimmy's friendship was one of God's \n     greatest gifts to me. That is how I would describe what he \n     did for me. Jimmy was my friend.\n       For more than three decades, 31 years, I benefitted from \n     Jimmy's wise counsel, his extraordinary intelligence, his \n     warm wit, and his absolute loyalty. I didn't like it when \n     someone referred to Jimmy as my driver because he was so much \n     more than that. But he did drive, and together we had quite a \n     ride over these three decades and met quite a variety of \n     people along the way. We extended each other's reach. From \n     his original political hero Dick Lee to Donald Trump, from \n     Arthur Barbieri to Ariel Sharon, from Vinnie Mauro to Teddy \n     Kennedy. From Hank Parker to Hosni Mubarak, from Jose \n     Cabranes in his Federal Court Chambers in New Haven to Joe \n     Dougherty at his Federal prison cell in New York. Before I \n     left for Washington to become a U.S. Senator in 1989, Jimmy \n     took me for blessings from Archbishop Whalen in Hartford to \n     Rabbi Schneerson in Brooklyn. Together we went from \n     Ridgefield to Riverdale, Westville to Washington, from Legion \n     Avenue to Los Angeles, from Fairhaven to Florida. Now, I can \n     hear Jimmy saying, ``if there were a few more Fairhaveners \n     counting votes in Florida, you would have flown up here this \n     morning on Air Force Two.''\n       Every now and then during our travels, I would ask Jimmy \n     whether he was following the right directions, and he would \n     quickly and decisively instruct me as to my role in our \n     relationship. ``You take care of war and peace, and I'll get \n     us safely to our next stop.''\n       And he always did. In all our years and thousands of miles \n     on the road together, Jimmy never had an accident. Now, when \n     one considers how rapidly James drove and how often he drove \n     with one hand at most on the wheel, that safety record is \n     just one more proof of the existence of a caring God.\n       Yes, God watched out for Jimmy O'Connell, and Jimmy \n     O'Connell watched out for God.\n       His faith anchored his life. It gave him perspective, and \n     purpose, and humor and the courage and strength to face and \n     overcome the troubles and challenges he faced, as he did so \n     successfully and inspiringly. Jimmy didn't just go to church \n     faithfully; he lived a life of faith. You could see it in \n     this strength and in his selflessness, in the way he \n     treated everyone he met with the respect and interest and \n     joy due to each of God's children. He loved people. He \n     particularly loved talking to people. Part of that, of \n     course, was the Irish gift with language. But talking was \n     also Jimmy's way of connecting with people, of engaging \n     them, of sharing what he knew and learning what others had \n     to teach him. And, in that, he taught us all a lot about \n     life.\n       In the days since Jimmy's death, I have been impressed and \n     touched by how many people he knew and how many people knew \n     Jimmy, and by how many of them remember how interested he was \n     in them, and how much he cared about them.\n       Jimmy was a devoted and loving son and brother, a good and \n     trustworthy friend, and a generous and involved uncle, to his \n     own nieces and nephews, of whom he was so proud, and to so \n     many others he adopted, including my own children and \n     grandchildren for whom he became ``Uncle Jimmy.'' Warm, \n     caring, fun, I cannot remember an important event in the \n     lives of any of them or us, happy or sad, when Jimmy was not \n     there.\n       Jimmy's faith also helped to shape his politics. Of course, \n     he loved politics as process and got much pleasure from the \n     rich mix of people in it. But Jimmy also had a philosophy, a \n     point of view that I believe came from the social ethics of \n     his Church, and I learned it well in the thousands of \n     conversations we had in the car over the years. He respected \n     people of wealth, particularly those who made it on their \n     own, but Jimmy's heart was with the working men and women, \n     with people in need, particularly children, with poor people \n     trying hard to move up and build a better life for their \n     children. As our mutual friend, Jim Kennedy said, ``Some \n     politicians pay consultants to tell them what people are \n     thinking. Jimmy O'Connell was the voice of the people.'' He \n     wanted government to be there for them when they needed it, \n     as Jimmy himself was there for them when they needed him. He \n     was a doer of good deeds and was so proud of the work his \n     elementary school, St. Francis in Fairhaven, was doing to \n     educate the next generation of America's children who are \n     working their way up.\n       Jimmy was devoted to the Roman Catholic Church, as he liked \n     to call it, but he also had the greatest respect for, and \n     interest in other people's faith. I often said that James \n     Kevin O'Connell knew more about Judaism than most Jews. Over \n     the years he also taught me a lot about Catholicism, its \n     rituals and rules, and its history and heroes. In fact, \n     Jimmy's love of this church and love of his politics came \n     together in a great fascination with movements within the \n     church hierarchy.\n       For instance, when Edward Egan became the Bishop of \n     Bridgeport, Jimmy wryly prohesized to me that Bishop Egan \n     would not be buried in Bridgeport. In other words, that \n     Bridgeport would not be his last stop. And, of course, this \n     is the very same Edward Egan who is now Cardinal Egan of New \n     York.\n       Jimmy's love for politics was joined naturally with his \n     belief in public service and civil service. For almost three \n     decades he served the city of his birth with skill and honor \n     as a proud member of its police department, rising to the \n     rank of Lieutenant at his death. He loved his New Haven \n     Police colleagues and greatly enjoyed our meetings with \n     police around the state, and throughout the country, who \n     were members of what he thought of as a great fraternity.\n       Jimmy's passing early Sunday morning came much too soon. \n     But I can assure you, as a matter of faith, that he was more \n     prepared for his death than we were. The loss of Jimmy is \n     very painful to me. I will miss him deeply as will so many \n     others who are here today. But as we experience our grief, we \n     should remember Jimmy's faith and Jimmy's words.\n       He said to me more than once, ``Remember none of us is \n     getting out of here alive.'' And he believed with a perfect \n     faith that this life, as enjoyable as he found it, was just a \n     bridge to an even better place, and so he did not fear death.\n       Jimmy often asked me to do something for somebody else, but \n     he never asked me to do much of anything for himself. Years \n     ago a mutual friend told me that he had asked Jimmy what he \n     really wanted from me, and Jimmy said, ``I want to be there \n     to turn the lights off when he leaves the office for the last \n     time.'' That was Jimmy.\n       Well, if the good Lord gives me the privilege of exiting \n     the office on my own for the\n\n[[Page S13461]]\n\n     last time, I'm going to leave the lights on, for Jimmy.\n       Once in the car we were talking about our visions of the \n     world to come, and I thought I would end the conversation \n     when I said that I would probably go first because I was \n     older, and so I would send him a report on what it was like \n     up there. But Jimmy, as usual, had the last word.\n       ``You never know,'' he said, ``I might go first. And if I \n     do, when you get to the gates, just give me a call, and I'll \n     drive over and pick you up.''\n       I will do that, James, and I know we'll have a lot to talk \n     about.\n       The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh. Blessed be the Name of \n     the Lord.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13461-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING OUR NATION\n\n   Mr. LUGAR.

And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of \n     you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall \n     fall before you . . . For I will have respect unto you, and \n     make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my \n     covenant with you. (Lev 26:2-9)\n       And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor \n     my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but \n     that ye break my covenant: I also will do this unto you; I \n     will even appoint over you terror . . . and cause sorrow of \n     heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies \n     shall eat it.

(Lev 26:22)\n       If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble \n     themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their \n     wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive \n     their sin, and will heal their land.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service \nof one of my staff members, Teresa Poole, who works in my Springfield \nDistrict Office in Missouri. On January 3, 2002, Teresa will celebrate \nher 25th anniversary of working for the Senate. When Teresa started her \ncareer, Senator Strom Thurmond was a mere 74 years old. Teresa has \nworked for three U.S. Senators during her career. She began working for \nSenator John Danforth's office in 1977 until he retired in 1993. In \n1987 she started working with my office and continues that service \ntoday. When John Ashcroft came to the Senate in 1995, Teresa worked for \nboth of our offices until 2001 when Aschroft became Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  When I look back at Teresa's career two words come to mind, \ncommitment and loyalty.\n  For the past 25 years Teresa has been committed to handling the \nentire military academy nomination process for this office. Teresa has \nset a high standard for this process and fields numerous calls from \nother congressional offices throughout the State and country when they \nhave questions about academy nominations. Teresa is committed to \nhelping students who are interested in military careers receive all the \ninformation they need to complete their applications, and spends hours \neach week answering questions from parents and applicants about their \nfiles. Teresa loves to make those phone calls informing individuals of \ntheir acceptance into the various service academies.\n  For the past 25 years Teresa has been loyal to the Senators she has \nserved and the constituents they represent. Teresa has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of each of us ensuring that our positions are \nknown and communicated in an accurate and precise manner. Teresa is a \ntrue public servant and a faithful and constant part of this Senate \noffice. Attorney General John Ashcroft said, ``Congratulations are in \norder for Teresa Poole, who has served 25 years as staff in the U.S. \nSenate. Mrs. Poole was a great help to me during my 6 years in the \nSenate. My wife, Janet and I wish her all the best as she celebrates \nthis milestone in her life.''\n  It is an honor for me to join with my staff in Washington, DC, and in \nthe great State of Missouri to recognize Teresa Poole for the 25 years \nof distinguished service to the people of Missouri and three U.S. \nSenators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13461-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13461-S13462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING JOHN O'CONNOR\n\n   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, all of us in Massachusetts \ncontinue to mourn the loss of one of our State's most passionate, \ncommitted, and effective activists, John O'Connor, who died on Friday, \nDecember 7. John brought an enthusiasm and commitment to civic life \nthat inspired everyone around him. His legendary appetite for life was \nbound by a steady moral compass, one that envisioned a world where \nwater, air and land are free of pollution and every individual, from \nall walks of life, has access to the full measure of the American \nDream.\n  After John disclosed the fact that a small baseball field in his \nneighborhood of Stratford, CT, was actually built on the waste site of \nasbestos manufacturer Raybestos, he embarked on a journey that spanned \nfrom the fight to clean up sites like it all across the country to \nadvocating for universal health care. That early spark of environmental \nawareness proved to be a model for all the struggles he engaged in \nthroughout his life. As a young graduate of Clark University, he \norganized the poor neighborhoods of Worcester so that they could have a \nstronger voice in their community's policies, and joined up with \nMassachusetts Fair Share, a grassroots group that was pursuing the same \ngoal statewide. His humor and enthusiasm gained traction in the group's \nnewsletter, The Squeaky Wheel, as well as the street organizing\n\n[[Page S13462]]\n\nand guerilla theater strategy that helped illuminate the organization \nand its mission.\n  These community and State-wide efforts led to larger pursuits on the \nnational stage. One of John's crowning achievements, one that will \nreach generations into the future, was his work on the National Toxics \nCampaign. This watershed moment in the environmental movement resulted \nin the $8 billion Superfund legislation that turned the tide in \ncleaning up industrial waste sites, and it echoed back to the ballfield \nthat ushered John into the activism that defined his life. His campaign \nfor environmental protection inspired him to write two books, ``Getting \nthe Lead Out,'' and ``Who Owns The Sun,'' both of which elevated the \ndialogue surrounding the environmental issues that impact communities \nacross the country. Throughout all of this he realized the potent force \nthe market could be in the struggle to protect the environment, and \ntowards that end he founded Greenworks in 1991, which provided \nfinancial backing for fledgling environmental businesses.\n  John's national focus never took his attention far away from the \ncommunities he came to love. Along with his wife, Carolyn Mugar, he \nreached out to countless organizations in Watertown, Cambridge and \nGreater Boston, nourishing them with resources and copious amounts of \nhis own time and energy. He served on boards and fund-raising \ncommittees for shelters, after-school programs and local youth \nprograms, and was a fixture at City Year events. He helped start the \nIrish Famine Memorial Committee, which honored the victims of the Irish \nfamine with a statue in Cambridge Common that was unveiled by former \nPresident of Ireland Mary Robinson. This work, as well as his \ncommitment to other organizations like the Irish Immigration Center, \nreflected a deep love of his own history, but for John it was larger \nthan an effort just for the Irish. His commitment to immigrant advocacy \nevidenced a deep belief in this country's ability to improve and re-\ncreate itself through the welcoming of people from all over the world.\n  Nothing carries more grief than the loss of a young man of such \ntalent, full of life, brimming with the truly American notion that \neveryone can and must improve life for themselves and their community. \nSurely John O'Connor accomplished this and more--and that legacy, the \nfact that he filled 46 years with more than many achieve in many \nlifetimes will, I hope, make his family's sorrow today a little lighter \nand leave them knowing that his work lives on in the countless acts of \ngoodwill John performed before he was taken from us.\n  Even though John was taken from us long before nature intended, I \nthink an activist of his deep commitment would know that he leaves us \nwith more than just his record of good work--he leaves us with a \nchallenge, one that was presented to us over the course of his 46 \nyears. John's challenge to all of us is to expand our world and expand \nthe circle of people we care for and love. The compass that pointed him \nin the direction of taking on polluters and fighting for access to \nhealth care is with us still, pointing to the world he envisioned and \nbegan to realize through his work. Our mission now is to follow that \ncompass, take up those battles, and complete the work that John \nchallenged us with in his life and inspires us with in his death. We \nare better people for his time here, but, as he surely would remind us, \nthere is much work to be done. Now, we will set about doing it with \nJohn O'Connor as guide and inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13462-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAINTAINING HOLIDAY TRADITIONS\n\n   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during these troubled times, our \nneed to connect and communicate with family and friends becomes all the \nmore important. The tragic events of the last four months and questions \nabout the security of mail may cause some hesitation about continuing \nlong-held traditions in which we typically participate at this time of \nthe year. But now more than ever, renewing and maintaining ties to \nothers is vital.\n  One such holiday tradition is the mailing of seasonal greetings and \ngifts to friends and family far and wide. Did you know that the history \nof holiday greeting cards in America dates back as long ago as 1875 \nwhen Louis Prang, a German immigrant in Boston, produced the first line \nof printed Christmas cards? He even held contests across the country \noffering prizes for card designs, which helped popularize the practice.\n  The images and messages that have decorated cards typically reflect \npolitical trends and moods of the times. World War II era holiday cards \ndepicted Santa Claus and Uncle Sam holding American flags with messages \nsuch as ``missing you'' for servicemen fighting overseas. This year, \nholiday cards not only convey sentiments of peace and happiness, but \nfeelings of pride and patriotism in our Nation's heritage of faith and \nfreedom.\n  It is not surprising to note that around 1880, the post office began \nurging to ``post early for Christmas.'' The first U.S. Christmas stamp, \nwhich portrayed wreaths and trees, debuted in 1962. Since then various \ndesigns have graced holiday envelopes. This year, the Postal Service \noffers a variety of holiday postage stamps, commemorating Hanukkah; \nKwanzaa; Eid, for the two most important festivals in the Islamic \ncalendar, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and Christmas, including stamps \ndepicting old-fashioned Santas and traditional Madonna and Child \nartwork.\n  This holiday season the United States Postal Service and the greeting \ncard industry have been working hard to assure customers that despite \nthe recent anthrax scare printed cards are completely safe to send \nthrough the mail. The Postal Service has distributed information to \nevery postal address and post offices around the country have \nimplemented extra screening procedures. The more than 800,000 postal \nemployees nationwide have received extensive training on proper mail \nhandling. In recent speeches, Postmaster General Jack Potter has \nencouraged the sending of holiday cards, emphasizing that they would be \n``especially meaningful this year.''\n  Written greetings are a special way of making and maintaining \npersonal connections across the miles. Cards and letters with personal \nmessages can be read and reread, shared and displayed, and preserved \nfor posterity. I encourage you to take time to continue this holiday \nritual by sending holiday cards to family and friends this season and \nby supporting the work of the United States Postal Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13462-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13462-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13462-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13462-S13463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 483.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that individual \naccount plans protect workers by limiting the amount of empoloyer stock \neach worker may hold and encouraging diversification of investment of \nplan assets, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today Senator Corzine and I are \nintroducing the Pension Protection and Diversification Act of 2001, \n(PPDA).\n  I authored and Congress passed a bill in 1997 amending ERISA. That \nlaw bars employers from forcing employees to invest employee voluntary \ncontributions to their 401(k) in the employer's real estate or equities \nwith a couple of exceptions. I believe that what Enron did violated the \nlaw I authored. Enron ``locked down'' its pension fund for a period of \ntime during which the company's stock plummeted. That lockdown \neffectively forced Enron employees to have their voluntary \ncontributions and earnings on those contributions invested in Enron's \nplunging stock. That said, we are introducing the PPDA today in order \nto protect employees from losing their retirement savings in the future \nthe way that Enron employees lost theirs.\n  Enron employees were naturally drawn to Enron stock because of its \nmeteoric rise. But when the stock crashed, it took many Enron \nemployees' savings down with it. There are two lessons we should learn \nfrom this situation. First, Enron workers had far too much of their \nindividual 401(k) account plans invested in Enron stock. And second, \nEnron forced its employees to hold its matching contribution in Enron \nstock to the employee's 401(k) account for far too long.\n  Unfortunately, Enron employees are not alone in their 401(k) \ninvestment habits. There are far too many workers in far too many \ncompanies disproportionately investing their retirement savings in \nemployer stock.\n  The ``Pension Protection and Diversification Act of 2001'', PPDA, \nwill encourage workers to diversify their retirement savings and to \nencourage employers to give workers the power to diversify their \nretirement plans.\n  Toward that end, the bill limits to 20 percent the investment an \nemployee can have in any one stock across their individual account \nplans with an employer. Studies show that employees do not diversify \ntheir investments sufficiently even when they have the power to \ndiversify. In the Enron case, too many workers followed their \nemployer's lead and invested too much of their own money in Enron \nstock. This provision, based on the opinions that financial management \nexperts have expressed in numerous articles over the last few years, is \ndesigned to discourage that gamble.\n  The PPDA also limits to 90 days the time that an employer can force \nan employee to hold a matching employer stock contribution. Too often, \nthe current holding period on stock ownership in a retirement plan is \nprohibitive because it requires participants to keep their shares far \nlonger than might suit their needs.\n  There are typically two types of structures. Either the participant \nis required to hold the stock until a certain age, for example, at \nEnron they had to hold it until they were at least 50 years old or \nolder, or the participant is required to hold the stock for a certain \nperiod of time, for example, for 5 years or longer. These mandatory \nholding periods require investors to hang on to their company stock for \n5 to 25 years or more before they can properly divest themselves to a \nmore diversified portfolio. This bill will put an end to that practice.\n\n  To encourage cash matching contributions rather than matching \ncontributions in stock, the PPDA limits to 50 percent, instead of 100 \npercent, the tax deduction that an employer can take on a matching \ncontribution if that contribution is made in stock. Employees often \nreport that the employer match in employer stock to their 401(k) plans \nis seen as a tacit recommendation to put their voluntary contributions \nin employer stock as well. By encouraging cash over stock \ncontributions, this bill gives employees the power to determine where \ntheir funds are invested.\n  And, last, the PPDA lowers to 35 years of age and 5 years of service \nthe triggers that allow an employee to diversify his or her investments \nin an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, ESOP. The current diversification \nrules are too restrictive and leave employees too exposed.\n  ESOPs currently are required to allow employees to diversify only a \nportion of their employer stock; they can diversify only during limited \nwindow periods; and they can diversify only after they reach age 55 \nwith 10 years of plan participation. So, most employees most of the \ntime don't have current diversification rights in ESOPs. By the time \nthey are eligible to diversify, it may be too late.\n  There is another factor to bear in mind. A 401(k) or other defined \ncontribution plan that holds enough employer stock can readily be \nconverted to an ESOP. New worker protections enacted to apply to 401(k) \nplans could be circumvented by converting the portion of the 401(k) \nplan that is investing in company stock to an ESOP or by setting up an \nESOP from the outset. Allowing divestiture at an earlier date will help \navoid the situation.\n  We exempt ESOPs from the rest of this bill because there are other \nfactors at play, such as the basic purpose of ESOPs. I think there is \njustification for having 401(k) diversification rights that are far \nbroader then ESOP diversification rights; but I am including ESOP \ndiversification requirements in this bill because in their current \nform, those requirements are too narrow.\n  Whether or not Enron broke the law in the management of its pension \nplan is being determined in the courts. I believe that they did, but we \nmust make sure all workers are protected from losing their savings \nbefore an employer's stock collapses.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 1839.

A bill to modify the project for beach erosion control, \nTybee Island, Georgia; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the existing Federal shoreline protection project on Tybee \nIsland, GA to include the North Beach area of the island. This project, \nwhich originally began as an effort to protect the oceanfront beach, \nhas previously been expanded to include the southern tip of the island \nas well as a portion of the Back River. On November 8, 2001, at my \nrequest, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works passed a \nStudy Resolution asking the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a \nreconnaissance study to determine whether it is advisable to expand the \nproject to include North Beach. The legislation I am introducing today \nwill provide the necessary authorization to expand the project once the \nrequired studies are completed. Erosion of the dunes on North Beach is \nendangering one of my State's natural treasurers and this legislation \nwill help to preserve a truly beautiful beachfront for those who reside \non and visit Tybee Island.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1844. A bill to authorize a pilot program for purchasing buses by \npublic transit authorities that are recipients of assistance or grants \nfrom the Federal Transit Administration; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will benefit every public transit agency in America by \nstreamlining their purchasing of buses with Federal funding. I am \npleased to be joined in introducing this bill by my colleague, Senator \nDOMENICI, who has worked with me on developing this important \nlegislation.\n  Our bill is very simple. It authorizes a 5-year pilot program to \nallow State and local transit authorities that receive Federal transit \nassistance the option to purchase transit buses through the General \nServices Administration.\n  Allowing public transit agencies the option to purchase buses through \nthe GSA could result in substantial cost savings to the Federal \nGovernment. In addition, GSA's standardized options and prices would \nhelp streamline the procurement process for buses, which could be \nespecially valuable to smaller communities. I do believe our bill will \nhelp stretch each dollar of Federal transit funding a little bit \nfarther.\n  Currently only the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has \nthe option to purchase buses through the General Services \nAdministration. WMATA is today using this authority to purchase buses. \nThe pilot program authorized in our bill would open up the option to \nall public transit agencies around the country that receive Federal \ntransit assistance. However, as a pilot program, it is limited only to \nheavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches. Because of GSA's \nlimited experience with transit buses, the bill provides for the pilot \nprogram to be managed by the Federal Transit Administration.\n  The General Services Administration currently offers three heavy-duty \ntransit buses and two intercity coaches. GSA selected these suppliers \nin full and open competitive solicitations, and the companies had to \nbid attractive terms and prices in order to win those 5-year contracts. \nHowever, to ensure that all bus suppliers have an equal opportunity to \nprovide buses through the GSA, our bill requires GSA to reopen \nimmediately the original solicitation to provide a full and open \ncompetition\n\n[[Page S13468]]\n\nfor all bus manufacturers interested in selling buses through GSA \ncontracts. In addition, bus suppliers that already have GSA contracts \nwould be permitted to modify their proposals.\n  Finally, to ensure future fairness to all bus suppliers, the GSA will \nexpand the bus program to a full multiple-award schedule with a larger \nvariety of vehicles and choices of optional equipment. GSA indicates \nthis process will take 12 to 18 months. Therefore, our bill directs GSA \nto complete the multiple-award schedule by December 31, 2003, and \nauthorizes state and local transit authorities that receive Federal \ntransit assistance to purchase heavy-duty transit buses and intercity \ncoaches off these new GSA schedules. The pilot program ends after 5 \nyears on December 31, 2006.\n  I believe it is very important to point out that as a pilot program, \nour bill is limited only to transit buses and intercity coaches. It has \nno effect on companies that supply other types of vehicles, \npharmaceuticals, or any other product that currently can be purchased \nthrough the General Services Administration.\n  I believe transit buses are a unique situation. Public transit \nagencies should be allowed to use their Federal funding to purchase \nbuses through the GSA. There are only a few bus manufacturers in \nAmerica today and most buses are purchased using Federal funds provided \nby the Federal Transit Administration. In fact, our bill requires that \na majority of the cost of all buses purchased through the GSA be from \nFederal funds. We also believe that the pilot program authorized in our \nbill could provide valuable information on bus purchasing that Congress \nmay want to consider when the 6-year transportation bill is \nreauthorized in 2003.\n  Our bus manufacturers are not having an easy time in this recession. \nOur bill will help expedite bus companies by eliminating the cost of \nresponding to myriad requests for proposals from public transit \nagencies. That's why bus manufacturers, through the American Public \nTransportation Association, support our proposal. Our bill will also \nhelp the public transit agencies by reducing the cost of preparing the \nrequests for proposals and assessing the responses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for our bill from \nthe American Public Transportation Association be included in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I do believe this is a meritorious proposal and hope it will be \nenacted as soon as possible. I look forward to working with Senator \nSarbanes, chairman of the Banking Committee, and the members of his \ncommittee to see if prompt action can be taken on this bill.\n  The pilot program has the support of the Federal Transit \nAdministration, bus manufacturers, and public transit agencies across \nthe Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1844\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

While APTA's governing \n     body has not had an opportunity formally to consider your \n     bill, our public transit members are supportive of measures \n     that would simplify and standardize the federal procurement \n     process, as this provision would do. We are particularly\n\n[[Page S13469]]\n\n     pleased to note that under the provision GSA, with assistance \n     from the Federal Transit Administration, would be required to \n     establish and publish a multiple award schedule for heavy-\n     duty buses, which means that any heavy-duty or intercity bus \n     manufacturer would be provided an opportunity to participate \n     in the program.\n       Please have your staff contact Daniel Duff, APTA's Chief \n     Counsel & Vice President, Government Affairs, should you have \n     any questions about this matter. He may be reached at (202) \n     496-4860 or internet e-mail dduff@apta.com.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1845. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to create a \npresumption that disability of a Federal employee in fire protection \nactivities caused by certain conditions is presumed to result from the \nperformance of such employee's duty; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of thousands of Federal fire fighters and emergency response \npersonnel worldwide who, at great risk to their own personal health and \nsafety, protect America's defense, our veterans, Federal wildlands, and \nnational treasures. Although the majority of these important Federal \nemployees work for the Department of Defense, Federal fire fighters are \nalso employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the United \nStates Park Service. From first-response emergency care services on \nmilitary installations around the world to front-line defense against \nraging forest fires here at home, we call on these brave men and women \nto protect our national interests.\n  Yet under Federal law, compensation and retirement benefits are not \nprovided to Federal employees who suffer from occupational illnesses \nunless they can specify the conditions of employment which caused their \ndisease. This onerous requirement makes it nearly impossible for \nFederal fire fighters, who suffer from occupational diseases, to \nreceive fair and just compensation or retirement benefits. The \nbureaucratic nightmare they must endure is burdensome, unnecessary, and \nin many cases, overwhelming. It is ironic and unjust that the very \npeople we call on to protect our Federal interests are not afforded the \nvery best health care and retirement benefits our Federal Government \nhas to offer.\n  Today, I introduced legislation, the Federal Fire Fighters Fairness \nAct of 2001, which amends the Federal Employees Compensation Act to \ncreate a presumptive disability for fire fighters who become disabled \nby heart and lung disease, cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, and \ninfectious diseases like tuberculosis and hepatitis. Disabilities \nrelated to the cancers, heart, lung, and infectious diseases enumerated \nin this important legislation would be considered job related for \npurposes of workers compensation and disability retirement, entitling \nthose affected to the health care coverage and retirement benefits that \nthey deserve.\n  Too frequently, the poisonous gases, toxic byproducts, asbestos, and \nother hazardous substances with which Federal fire fighters and \nemergency response personnel come in contact, rob them of their health \nlivelihood, and professional careers. The Federal Government should not \nrob them of necessary benefits. Thirty-eight States have already \nenacted a similar disability presumption law for Federal fire fighters' \ncounterparts working in similar capacities on the State and local \nlevels.\n  The effort behind the Federal Fire Fighters Fairness Act of 2001 \nmarks a significant advancement for fire fighter health and safety. \nSince September 11, there has been an enhanced appreciation for the \nrisks that fire fighters and emergency response personnel face \neveryday. Federal fire fighters deserve our highest commendation and it \nis time to do the right thing for these important Federal employees.\n  The job of fire fighting continues to be complex and dangerous. The \nnationwide increase in the use of hazardous materials, the recent rise \nin both natural and manmade disasters, and the threat of terrorism pose \nnew threats to fire fighter health and safety. The Federal Fire \nFighters Fairness Act of 2001 will help protect the lives of our fire \nfighters and it will provide them with a vehicle to secure their health \nand safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to embrace this bipartisan effort and support \nthe Federal Fire Fighters Fairness Act of 2001 on behalf of our \nNation's Federal fire fighters and emergency response personnel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13469-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13469-S13470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2614.

FOREST LAND ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is a growing dependence on nonindustrial private \n     forest land to supply the necessary market commodities, and \n     nonmarket values (such as habitat for fish and wildlife, \n     aesthetics, outdoor recreation opportunities, and other \n     forest resources), required by a growing population;\n       (2) there is a strong demand for expanded assistance \n     programs for owners of nonindustrial private forest land \n     because the majority of the wood supply of the United States \n     is derived from nonindustrial private forest land;\n       (3) the soil, carbon stores, water quality, and air quality \n     of the United States can be maintained and improved through \n     good stewardship of nonindustrial private forest land;\n       (4) the products and services resulting from stewardship of \n     nonindustrial private forest land provide income and \n     employment that contribute to the economic health and \n     diversity of rural communities;\n       (5)(A) wildfires threaten human lives, property, forests, \n     and other resources; and\n       (B) Federal and State cooperation in forest fire prevention \n     and control has proven effective and valuable, in that \n     properly managed forest stands are less susceptible to \n     catastrophic fire as dramatized by the catastrophic fire \n     seasons of 1998 and 2000;\n       (6) owners of nonindustrial private forest land are being \n     faced with increased pressure to convert their forest land to \n     development and other uses;\n       (7)(A) complex, long-rotation forest investments, including \n     sustainable hardwood management, are often the most difficult \n     commitment for owners of small areas of nonindustrial private \n     forest land; and\n       (B) investments described in subparagraph (A) should \n     receive equal consideration under cost-sharing programs; and\n       (8) the investment of 1 Federal dollar in State and private \n     forestry programs is estimated to leverage on average $9 from \n     State, local, and private sources.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to strengthen the commitment of the Department of \n     Agriculture to sustainable forestry; and\n       (2) to establish a coordinated and cooperative Federal, \n     State, and local sustainable forest program for the \n     establishment, management, maintenance, enhancement, and \n     restoration of forests on nonindustrial private forest land \n     in the United States.\n       (c) Forest Land Enhancement Program.--The Cooperative \n     Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (as amended by section 804) \n     is amended by inserting after section 3 (16 U.S.C. 2102) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 4.

WATERSHED FORESTRY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there has been a dramatic shift in public attitudes and \n     perceptions about forest management, particularly in the \n     understanding and practice of sustainable forest management;\n       (2) it is commonly recognized that proper stewardship of \n     forest land is essential to--\n       (A) sustain and restore watershed health;\n       (B) produce clean water; and\n       (C) maintain healthy aquatic systems;\n       (3) forests are increasingly important to the protection \n     and sustainability of drinking water supplies for more than \n     1/2 of the population of the United States;\n       (4) forest loss and fragmentation in urbanizing areas are \n     contributing to flooding, degradation of urban stream habitat \n     and water quality, and public health concerns;\n       (5) scientific evidence and public awareness with respect \n     to the manner in which forest management can positively \n     affect water quality and quantity, and the manner in which \n     trees, forests, and forestry practices (such as forest \n     buffers) can serve as solutions to water quality problems in \n     rural and urban areas, are increasing;\n       (6) the application of forestry best management practices \n     developed at the State level has been found to greatly \n     facilitate the achievement of water quality goals;\n       (7) significant efforts are underway to revisit and make \n     improvements on needed forestry best management practices;\n       (8) according to the report of the Forest Service numbered \n     FS-660 and entitled ``Water and the Forest Service'', forests \n     are a requirement for maintenance of clean water because--\n       (A) approximately 66 percent of the freshwater resources of \n     the United States originate on forests; and\n       (B) forests cover approximately 1/3 of the land area of the \n     United States;\n       (9) because almost 500,000,000 acres, or approximately 2/3, \n     of the forest land of the United States is owned by non-\n     Federal entities, a significant burden is placed on private \n     forest landowners to provide or maintain the clean water \n     needed by the public for drinking, swimming, fishing, and a \n     number of other water uses;\n       (10) because the decisions made by individual landowners \n     and communities will affect the ability to maintain the \n     health of rural and urban watersheds in the future, there is \n     a need to integrate forest management, conservation, \n     restoration, and stewardship in watershed management;\n       (11) although water management is the primary \n     responsibility of States, the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to promote and encourage the ability of States \n     and private forest landowners to sustain the delivery of \n     clean, abundant water from forest land;\n       (12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     availability of Federal assistance to support forest \n     landowners to achieve the water goals identified in many \n     Federal laws (including regulations) is lacking; and\n       (13) increased research for, education for, and technical \n     and financial assistance provided to, forest landowners and \n     communities that relate to the protection of watersheds and \n     improvement of water quality, are needed to realize the \n     expectations of the general public for clean water and \n     healthy aquatic systems.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (1) improve the understanding of landowners and the public \n     with respect to the relationship between water quality and \n     forest management;\n       (2) encourage landowners to maintain tree cover and use \n     tree plantings and vegetative treatments as creative \n     solutions to water quality and quantity problems associated \n     with varying land uses;\n       (3) enhance and complement source water protection in \n     watersheds that provide drinking water for municipalities;\n       (4) establish new partnerships and collaborative watershed \n     approaches to forest management, stewardship, and protection; \n     and\n       (5) provide technical and financial assistance to States to \n     deliver a coordinated program that through the provision of \n     technical, financial, and educational assistance to qualified \n     individuals and entities--\n       (A) enhances State forestry best management practices \n     programs; and\n       (B) protects and improves water quality on forest land.\n       (c) Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n     1978 is amended by inserting after section 5A (as added by \n     section 806) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5B.

The producers \n     shall notify the Secretary of the election made by the \n     producers under such subsection not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Effect of Failure To Make Election.--If the producers \n     on a farm fail to make the election under subsection (a), or \n     fail to timely notify the Secretary of the selected option as \n     required by subsection (b), the producers shall be deemed to \n     have made the election described in subsection (a)(2) to \n     determine base acres for all covered commodities on the farm.\n       (d) Application of Election to All Covered Commodities.--\n     The election made under subsection (a) or deemed to be made \n     under subsection (c) with respect to a farm shall apply to \n     all of the covered commodities on the farm. Producers may not \n     make the election described in subsection (a)(1) for one \n     covered commodity and the election described in subsection \n     (a)(2) for other covered commodities on the farm.\n       (e) Treatment of Conservation Reserve Contract Acreage.--\n       (1) In general.--In the case of producers on a farm that \n     make the election described in subsection (a)(2), the \n     Secretary shall provide for an adjustment in the base acres \n     for the farm whenever either of the following circumstances \n     occur:\n       (A) A conservation reserve contract entered into under \n     section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. \n     3831) with respect to the farm expires or is voluntarily \n     terminated.\n       (B) Cropland is released from coverage under a conservation \n     reserve contract by the Secretary.\n       (2) Special payment rules.--For the fiscal year and crop \n     year in which a base acre adjustment under paragraph (1) is \n     first made, the producers on the farm shall elect to receive \n     either fixed decoupled payments and counter-cyclical payments \n     with respect to the acreage added to the farm under this \n     subsection or a prorated payment under the conservation \n     reserve contract, but not both.\n       (f) Payment Acres.--The payment acres for a covered \n     commodity on a farm shall be equal to 85 percent of the base \n     acres for the commodity.\n       (g) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--\n       (1) Required reduction.--If the sum of the base acres for a \n     farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2), \n     exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the \n     Secretary shall reduce the quantity of base acres for one or \n     more covered commodities for the farm or peanut acres for the \n     farm as necessary so that the sum of the base acres and \n     acreage described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual \n     cropland acreage of the farm. The Secretary shall give the \n     producers on the farm the opportunity to select the base \n     acres or peanut acres against which the reduction will be \n     made.\n       (2) Other acreage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall include the following:\n       (A) Any peanut acres for the farm under chapter 3 of \n     subtitle C.\n       (B) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the conservation \n     reserve program or wetlands reserve program under chapter 1 \n     of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 \n     (16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq.).\n       (C) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a \n     conservation program for which payments are made in exchange \n     for not producing an agricultural commodity on the acreage.\n       (3) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the \n     case of double cropping, as determined by the Secretary.\n\n[[Page S13596]]\n\n     SEC. 104.

FARMERS FOR AFRICA AND CARIBBEAN BASIN PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Many African farmers and farmers in Caribbean Basin \n     countries use antiquated techniques to produce their crops, \n     which result in poor crop quality and low crop yields.\n       (2) Many of these farmers are losing business to farmers in \n     European and Asian countries who use advanced planting and \n     production techniques and are supplying agricultural produce \n     to restaurants, resorts, tourists, grocery stores, and other \n     consumers in Africa and Caribbean Basin countries.\n       (3) A need exists for the training of African farmers and \n     farmers in Caribbean Basin countries and other developing \n     countries in farming techniques that are appropriate for the \n     majority of eligible farmers in African or Caribbean \n     countries, including standard growing practices, insecticide \n     and sanitation procedures, and other farming methods that \n     will produce increased yields of more nutritious and \n     healthful crops.\n       (4) African-American and other American farmers, as well as \n     banking and insurance professionals, are a ready source of \n     agribusiness expertise that would be invaluable for African \n     farmers and farmers in Caribbean Basin countries.\n       (5) A United States commitment is appropriate to support \n     the development of a comprehensive agricultural skills \n     training program for these farmers that focuses on--\n       (A) improving knowledge of insecticide and sanitation \n     procedures to prevent crop destruction;\n       (B) teaching modern farming techniques, including the \n     identification and development of standard growing practices \n     and the establishment of systems for recordkeeping, that \n     would facilitate a continual analysis of crop production;\n       (C) the use and maintenance of farming equipment that is \n     appropriate for the majority of eligible farmers in African \n     or Caribbean Basin countries;\n       (D) expansion of small farming operations into agribusiness \n     enterprises through the development and use of village \n     banking systems and the use of agricultural risk insurance \n     pilot products, resulting in increased access to credit for \n     these farmers; and\n       (E) marketing crop yields to prospective purchasers \n     (businesses and individuals) for local needs and export.\n       (6) The participation of African-American and other \n     American farmers and American agricultural farming \n     specialists in such a training program promises the added \n     benefit of improving access to African and Caribbean Basin \n     markets for American farmers and United States farm equipment \n     and products and business linkages for United States \n     insurance providers offering technical assistance on, among \n     other things, agricultural risk insurance products.\n       (7) Existing programs that promote the exchange of \n     agricultural knowledge and expertise through the exchange of \n     American and foreign farmers have been effective in promoting \n     improved agricultural techniques and food security, and, \n     thus, the extension of additional resources to such farmer-\n     to- farmer exchanges is warranted.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Agricultural farming specialist.--The term \n     ``agricultural farming specialist'' means an individual \n     trained to transfer information and technical support \n     relating to agribusiness, food security, the mitigation and \n     alleviation of hunger, the mitigation of agricultural and \n     farm risk, maximization of crop yields, agricultural trade, \n     and other needs specific to a geographical location as \n     determined by the President.\n       (2) Caribbean basin country.--The term ``Caribbean Basin \n     country'' means a country eligible for designation as a \n     beneficiary country under section 212 of the Caribbean Basin \n     Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2702).\n       (3) Eligible farmer.--The term ``eligible farmer'' means an \n     individual owning or working on farm land (as defined by a \n     particular country's laws relating to property) in the sub-\n     Saharan region of the continent of Africa, in a Caribbean \n     Basin country, or in any other developing country in which \n     the President determines there is a need for farming \n     expertise or for information or technical support described \n     in paragraph (1).\n       (4) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Farmers for \n     Africa and Caribbean Basin Program established under this \n     section.\n       (c) Establishment of Program.--The President shall \n     establish a grant program, to be known as the ``Farmers for \n     Africa and Caribbean Basin Program'', to assist eligible \n     organizations in carrying out bilateral exchange programs \n     whereby African-American and other American farmers and \n     American agricultural farming specialists share technical \n     knowledge with eligible farmers regarding--\n       (1) maximization of crop yields;\n       (2) use of agricultural risk insurance as financial tools \n     and a means of risk management (as allowed by Annex II of the \n     World Trade Organization rules);\n       (3) expansion of trade in agricultural products;\n       (4) enhancement of local food security;\n       (5) the mitigation and alleviation of hunger;\n       (6) marketing agricultural products in local, regional, and \n     international markets;

ESTABLISHMENT OF FOREST LAND ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There is a growing dependence on private nonindustrial \n     forest lands to supply the necessary market commodities and \n     nonmarket values, such as habitat for fish and wildlife, \n     aesthetics, outdoor recreation opportunities, and other \n     forest resources, required by a growing population.\n       (2) There is a strong demand for expanded assistance \n     programs for owners of nonindustrial private forest land \n     since the majority of the wood supply of the United States \n     comes from nonindustrial private forest land.\n       (3) The soil, carbon stores, water and air quality of the \n     United States can be maintained and improved through good \n     stewardship of nonindustrial private forest lands.\n       (4) The products and services resulting from stewardship of \n     nonindustrial private forest lands provide income and \n     employment that contribute to the economic health and \n     diversity of rural communities.\n       (5) Wildfires threaten human lives, property, forests, and \n     other resources, and Federal and State cooperation in forest \n     fire prevention and control has proven effective and \n     valuable, in that properly managed forest stands are less \n     susceptible to catastrophic fire, as dramatized by the \n     catastrophic fire seasons of 1998 and 2000.\n       (6) Owners of private nonindustrial forest lands are being \n     faced with increased pressure to convert their forestland to \n     development and other uses.\n       (7) Complex, long-rotation forest investments, including \n     sustainable hardwood management, are often the most difficult \n     commitment for small, nonindustrial private forest landowners \n     and, thus, should receive equal consideration under cost-\n     share programs.\n       (8) The investment of one Federal dollar in State and \n     private forestry programs is estimated to leverage $9 on \n     average from State, local, and private sources.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     strengthen the commitment of the Department of Agriculture to \n     sustainable forestry and to establish a coordinated and \n     cooperative Federal, State, and local sustainable forest \n     program for the establishment, management, maintenance, \n     enhancement, and restoration of forests on nonindustrial \n     private forest lands in the United States.\n       (c) Forest Land Enhancement Program.--The Cooperative \n     Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended by inserting after \n     section 3 (16 U.S.C. 2102) the following new section 4:\n\n     ``SEC. 4.

ENFORCEMENT OF THE HUMANE METHODS OF SLAUGHTER ACT \n                   OF 1958.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Public demand for passage of Public Law 85-765 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1901 et seq.; commonly known as the ``Humane Methods \n     of Slaughter Act of 1958'') was so great that when President \n     Eisenhower was asked at a press conference if he would sign \n     the bill, he replied, ``If I went by mail, I'd think no one \n     was interested in anything but humane slaughter''.\n       (2) The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 requires \n     that animals be rendered insensible to pain when they are \n     slaughtered.\n       (3) Scientific evidence indicates that treating animals \n     humanely results in tangible economic benefits.\n       (4) The United States Animal Health Association passed a \n     resolution at a meeting in October 1998 to encourage strong \n     enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 \n     and reiterated support for the resolution at a meeting in \n     2000.\n       (5) The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for fully \n     enforcing the Act, including monitoring compliance by the \n     slaughtering industry.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Agriculture should fully enforce Public Law \n     85-765 (7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.; commonly known as the ``Humane \n     Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958'') by ensuring that humane \n     methods in the slaughter of livestock--\n       (1) prevent needless suffering;\n       (2) result in safer and better working conditions for \n     persons engaged in the slaughtering industry;\n       (3) bring about improvement of products and economies in \n     slaughtering operations; and\n       (4) produce other benefits for producers, processors, and \n     consumers that tend to expedite an orderly flow of livestock \n     and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce.\n       (c) Policy of the United States.--It is the policy of the \n     United States that the slaughtering of livestock and the \n     handling of livestock in connection with slaughter shall be \n     carried out only by humane methods, as provided by Public Law \n     85-765 (7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.; commonly known as the ``Humane \n     Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958'').\n\n     SEC. 938.

Mr. President, I have the permission of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas to go first.\n  I do take offense at the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nsaying we do not want a farm bill. That is not true. I do want a farm \nbill. I do not think there is a Senator here who does not want one, and \nI would like to see one completed before we leave.\n  I have been talking to farmers back home in my State, and they tell \nme frankly they like Cochran-Roberts. I am pleased to support the \namendment that Senator Hutchinson has offered that has the House \nstructure with some additional language in it that we think makes the \nbill even better. That was my farm bill that I offered, along with \nSenator Hutchinson and four Democrats. There were four Democrats and \nthree Republicans on that bill. I believe the Presiding Officer was on \nthat bill. It was a good bipartisan bill.\n  As the bill went through the system, the committee dealt with it and \nthe majority leader dealt with it, and pretty soon we had a bill that \nwas not as balanced as we would like to see it.\n  A lot of people in this Senate who care about agriculture--and there \nare some other than Senator Harkin--are really concerned about the \nlegislation and want a good bill.\n  Senator Cochran from Mississippi who chair the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee is one of the most knowledgeable people in \nthis Senate on agricultural issues.\n  Senator Pat Roberts chaired the House Committee on Agriculture and is \none of the most knowledgeable people in this Senate on agriculture.\n  Senator Lugar, the former chairman of the Agriculture Committee and \none of the finest Members of this body, is not comfortable with this \nlegislation, and he certainly, as a farmer, cares about agriculture. So \ndoes Senator Grassley who spoke earlier, a farmer himself, and a senior \nmember of the Agriculture Committee.\n  They just do not agree with Senator Harkin on everything that is in a \nbill that he admits is not perfect.\n  What we ought to do, and what I would have expected to happen, is \nthat these responsible, experienced Senators and farm experts would be \nable to get together and work out some of the problems and not end up \nwith a problem with the House and a problem with the President.\n  How are we going to get a bill passed if it cannot be conferenced? \nHow are we going to get a bill passed if the President vetoes it? It is \nnot going to happen. Let's get together now. That is the problem.\n\n[[Page S13644]]\n\n  My farmers are telling me they believe all three of these bills can \nhelp them. They like all three of these bills, but we have to look at \nit in terms of a national policy and work out something with which \neverybody can work.\n  The problem has been, frankly, that the majority has not shown enough \nrespect, in my view, to Senators Cochran, Roberts, Grassley and Lugar \nwho have been trying to make some improvements in the bill. They have \nnot talked to them on any significant issue, only minor issues, and we \nend up at loggerheads. The President is very unhappy with what he sees.\n  Even if we pass something before we leave, if it is not legislation \nthat is likely to move forward, we have not done anything. That is why \nI appreciate Senator Hutchinson's offering of our original bipartisan \nbill that we know can get through the House, and we believe the \nPresident will sign it. I believe we will have a farm bill in a matter \nof days--hours, really. That would be good for agriculture.\n\n  The people with whom I have talked are concerned about delay. They \nwould like this bill passed as soon as possible. They want to make \ntheir plans for next year. They want to talk with their banks and see \nabout the financing they will need. We do need to move as fast as \npossible.\n  It would be quite preferable for us to move and have a bill passed \nthat the President would sign before we recess. There is no doubt about \nthat. I would like to see that done. But Senator Harkin and the \nmajority leader are basically saying: Take our bill just as we have \nwritten it, even though we have a vote or two over 50 for it, but we \nwill not talk with you.\n  I have seen Senator Daschle when he was the Democratic leader use the \npower of 40 votes and ask for compromise and get it time and again. \nThat is what this body is about. I just have not seen enough progress \nin a bipartisan way here. I believe there has just been an effort to \nstampede this bill through to try to gin up people and say: The Harkin \nbill is the only one that can do the job, and it must be passed now; \nand if you do not pass the Harkin bill now, you do not care about \nfarmers, you do not care about agriculture, you would just as soon \nleave them out there and let them go bankrupt. That is just not true. I \nresent that.\n  I come from a farming family. My daddy had a farm equipment \ndealership. My grandparents were farmers. I grew up in the country. I \nknow about farming. I have seen them come into my daddy's business with \na tractor broken down, with hay in the field, a hay baler not working, \nneeding help, knowing if the rain came and they did not get the crop \nin, they could lose most everything. And we did not have the programs \nthen that we have today. I understand that. I grew up in that \ncommunity. I want a farm bill, and I do not like it when somebody says \nI do not. And I do not like it when they say: If you do not agree with \nme and agree to vote on a bill I want on which we will accept no \nsignificant amendments, then we are going to accuse you of being \nagainst agriculture. I do not believe that is right.\n  That is where we are, and everybody knows it. There is no mystery \nabout where this deal is tonight.\n  I want to make one more point.\n  There are several problems with the Harkin bill. From what I am \nhearing, other people are also expressing those concerns. It seems to \nme that the Harkin bill will increase production at a time when our \nproduction is high. And if it goes higher it will be even harder to \nsustain legitimate crop prices. That is a real problem. We have pretty \nhigh production now. Cotton is up. None is down that I know of. We \ndon't need to institutionalize or create an incentive to do that.\n  We want to do this thing in a way that does not leave us subject to \nthe charge of the Europeans who say we are protectionists and that we \nare violating WTO commitments. If we can avoid violating them and \naccomplish the same thing, we ought to do it. I hope and pray that the \nEuropeans will see their extraordinary subsidies for agriculture are \nnot justified. I hope they will begin to reduce some of that, and we \nwill see increased exports around the world in other places besides \nEurope.\n  If we can avoid it, we ought not violate our trade agreements. I am \nafraid in a few years the experts will say we are in violation of our \ninternational trade commitments, putting us at a disadvantage when we \ntry to negotiate with our trading partners who I think have been \nviolating the law consistently. We will not be as authoritative with \nthe same moral basis to argue they need to get right with the law.\n  We need a bill that can go to conference and be signed by the \nPresident promptly. That is why I believe the legislation Senator \nHutchinson has offered tonight is a good vehicle for that.\n  There are two ways we can get a farm bill as I see it, just like \nthis. We can have a good-faith, compromise negotiation discussion \nbetween the slim majority and the leaders on this side who are fine \npeople, fine Senators, who have a history, a record, and a career of \nsupporting agriculture--Senators Grassley, Roberts, Cochran--and talk \nwith them and see if they cannot work out something. If they do not, we \nhave another vehicle, a vehicle Senator Hutchinson would offer, to \nsolve the problem. Those are the two ways. Maybe there will be another \nand cloture will be achieved.\n  I know one thing: If we did those two things, we would be out of here \nand we would have a bill the President would most likely sign and we \nwould have fulfilled our duty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama for \nhis cosponsorship of this legislation and for his excellent statement. \nI also commend the Presiding Officer this evening for his role and hard \nwork on the peanut program and his great victory on that issue and his \nhard work on the Agriculture bill and for his willingness to stay this \nlate. I am sure the Presiding Officer is ready to wind this up.\n  I wish my colleagues could have seen the farmers I met with this past \nSaturday. One asked the prospects for getting a bill completed and to \nthe President. I began to explain the Senate process. We have cloture; \nwe may not get it. If we get it, we get a bill that has to go to \nconference. There is a lot of difference between the House and the \nSenate. I explained that and their eyes glazed over. There were tears. \nThey said that would not do a lot of good for making loans and plans \nand getting ready for the upcoming planting season.\n  We have reached the point of finger pointing, both sides saying the \nother does not want a bill this year. I suggest Senator Sessions \noutlined two ways we have a chance of getting one. They are genuine \ncompromises. We can pass the House bill I filed this evening, which I \nurged in my floor speeches we move this year. I wrote Chairman Harkin \nand urged quick action and voted for the Harkin commodity title, and \nvoted for the committee bill, voted for cloture last week; I voted for \ncloture today. I want a farm bill.\n  The way I see it, Senator Harkin made a significant admission and \nsaid, if we invoke cloture and pass his bill tomorrow night, it will be \nweeks before a conference can work out the differences between the \nHouse and Senate and get a bill to the President.\n  There were a lot of Democrats who voted against Cochran-Roberts. But \ndo we say a lot of Democrats do not want a farm bill because they would \nnot support that? Of course not. We all have ideas of what the ideal \nfarm bill is. We cannot get an ideal farm bill in these closing days. \nNone of us would know exactly what it was.\n  There is one way we can get a bill this year. That is to move this \nHouse-like bill cosponsored by Republicans and Democrats--four \nDemocrats, three Republicans--and move it immediately to the President. \nTomorrow we will find out who is really wanting a bill this year and \nwho is really wanting to stall one out--whether it is pride of \nauthorship: my bill is the only bill, or whether we are willing to get \nan improvement in farm policy under this budget and to the President \nand signed into law.\n  I hope tomorrow there is good news this Christmas for America's \nfarmers.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S13645]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13643-5", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13643-S13645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WANTING A FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

I believe there has just been an effort to \nstampede this bill through to try to gin up people and say: The Harkin \nbill is the only one that can do the job, and it must be passed now; \nand if you do not pass the Harkin bill now, you do not care about \nfarmers, you do not care about agriculture, you would just as soon \nleave them out there and let them go bankrupt. That is just not true. I \nresent that.\n  I come from a farming family. My daddy had a farm equipment \ndealership. My grandparents were farmers. I grew up in the country. I \nknow about farming. I have seen them come into my daddy's business with \na tractor broken down, with hay in the field, a hay baler not working, \nneeding help, knowing if the rain came and they did not get the crop \nin, they could lose most everything. And we did not have the programs \nthen that we have today. I understand that. I grew up in that \ncommunity. I want a farm bill, and I do not like it when somebody says \nI do not. And I do not like it when they say: If you do not agree with \nme and agree to vote on a bill I want on which we will accept no \nsignificant amendments, then we are going to accuse you of being \nagainst agriculture. I do not believe that is right.\n  That is where we are, and everybody knows it. There is no mystery \nabout where this deal is tonight.\n  I want to make one more point.\n  There are several problems with the Harkin bill. From what I am \nhearing, other people are also expressing those concerns. It seems to \nme that the Harkin bill will increase production at a time when our \nproduction is high. And if it goes higher it will be even harder to \nsustain legitimate crop prices. That is a real problem. We have pretty \nhigh production now. Cotton is up. None is down that I know of. We \ndon't need to institutionalize or create an incentive to do that.\n  We want to do this thing in a way that does not leave us subject to \nthe charge of the Europeans who say we are protectionists and that we \nare violating WTO commitments. If we can avoid violating them and \naccomplish the same thing, we ought to do it. I hope and pray that the \nEuropeans will see their extraordinary subsidies for agriculture are \nnot justified. I hope they will begin to reduce some of that, and we \nwill see increased exports around the world in other places besides \nEurope.\n  If we can avoid it, we ought not violate our trade agreements. I am \nafraid in a few years the experts will say we are in violation of our \ninternational trade commitments, putting us at a disadvantage when we \ntry to negotiate with our trading partners who I think have been \nviolating the law consistently. We will not be as authoritative with \nthe same moral basis to argue they need to get right with the law.\n  We need a bill that can go to conference and be signed by the \nPresident promptly. That is why I believe the legislation Senator \nHutchinson has offered tonight is a good vehicle for that.\n  There are two ways we can get a farm bill as I see it, just like \nthis. We can have a good-faith, compromise negotiation discussion \nbetween the slim majority and the leaders on this side who are fine \npeople, fine Senators, who have a history, a record, and a career of \nsupporting agriculture--Senators Grassley, Roberts, Cochran--and talk \nwith them and see if they cannot work out something. If they do not, we \nhave another vehicle, a vehicle Senator Hutchinson would offer, to \nsolve the problem. Those are the two ways. Maybe there will be another \nand cloture will be achieved.\n  I know one thing: If we did those two things, we would be out of here \nand we would have a bill the President would most likely sign and we \nwould have fulfilled our duty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama for \nhis cosponsorship of this legislation and for his excellent statement. \nI also commend the Presiding Officer this evening for his role and hard \nwork on the peanut program and his great victory on that issue and his \nhard work on the Agriculture bill and for his willingness to stay this \nlate. I am sure the Presiding Officer is ready to wind this up.\n  I wish my colleagues could have seen the farmers I met with this past \nSaturday. One asked the prospects for getting a bill completed and to \nthe President. I began to explain the Senate process. We have cloture; \nwe may not get it. If we get it, we get a bill that has to go to \nconference. There is a lot of difference between the House and the \nSenate. I explained that and their eyes glazed over. There were tears. \nThey said that would not do a lot of good for making loans and plans \nand getting ready for the upcoming planting season.\n  We have reached the point of finger pointing, both sides saying the \nother does not want a bill this year. I suggest Senator Sessions \noutlined two ways we have a chance of getting one. They are genuine \ncompromises. We can pass the House bill I filed this evening, which I \nurged in my floor speeches we move this year. I wrote Chairman Harkin \nand urged quick action and voted for the Harkin commodity title, and \nvoted for the committee bill, voted for cloture last week; I voted for \ncloture today. I want a farm bill.\n  The way I see it, Senator Harkin made a significant admission and \nsaid, if we invoke cloture and pass his bill tomorrow night, it will be \nweeks before a conference can work out the differences between the \nHouse and Senate and get a bill to the President.\n  There were a lot of Democrats who voted against Cochran-Roberts. But \ndo we say a lot of Democrats do not want a farm bill because they would \nnot support that? Of course not. We all have ideas of what the ideal \nfarm bill is. We cannot get an ideal farm bill in these closing days. \nNone of us would know exactly what it was.\n  There is one way we can get a bill this year. That is to move this \nHouse-like bill cosponsored by Republicans and Democrats--four \nDemocrats, three Republicans--and move it immediately to the President. \nTomorrow we will find out who is really wanting a bill this year and \nwho is really wanting to stall one out--whether it is pride of \nauthorship: my bill is the only bill, or whether we are willing to get \nan improvement in farm policy under this budget and to the President \nand signed into law.\n  I hope tomorrow there is good news this Christmas for America's \nfarmers.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S13645]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/18/senate-section/article/S13645-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 11:30 A.M.
