Mr. President, today there will be 2 hours of debate on the \nJordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act. We are going to have our \nfirst rollcall vote at or near 2 p.m. today on the nomination of Kirk \nVan Tine to be the general counsel at the Department of Transportation.\n  Following that, the Senate is going to resume consideration of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. I have had a number of \nconversations this morning with the chairman of the committee and the \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle and Senator Levin. Although I have not \nspoken to Senator Warner, I am confident he also believes we should \ncomplete this legislation as quickly as possible. It is the intent of \nthe leader to finish this legislation tomorrow. There are a number of \namendments that need to be brought forward, one of which deals with \nbase closings, and we would hope that could be done as quickly as \npossible.\n  Also, Mr. President, the two managers of the bill will ask for a time \nfor disposing of the amendments, either a finite list or something that \nwould give the managers of the bill some idea of what amendments \nMembers are wanting to offer. Also, because of this very short week \nwhich is going to end Wednesday at 2 o'clock because of the Jewish \nholiday, Yom Kippur, it is important we complete the continuing \nresolution to get us through the first couple weeks of next month so we \ncan go forward working on appropriations bills.\n\n  I am happy to report to the membership that the House has appointed a \nnumber of conference committees on the appropriations bills, and that \nis a good sign that we can move forward in the usual process. I hope by \nthe time we have run out of time on the continuing resolution, we will \nhave made great progress in our appropriations bills. We would ask \ncooperation of all Members. This is going to be a very jampacked week. \nThe leader has indicated there may be other things he wishes to bring \nup in addition to the CR and the Defense bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9679-7", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1447\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 2 hours of debate on the bill with 1 hour under the control of the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and 1 hour under the control of the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, or his designee.\n  What is the will of the Senate? Time is running.\n  The Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to urge the adoption of H.R. 2603. \nThat is a bill to implement the United States-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement. The House passed the bill by a voice vote just before the \nAugust recess. The Finance Committee reported a virtually identical \nbill, also immediately before the August recess. Only two Members \ndissented when the Finance Committee reported that bill out.\n  I have advocated the approval of this agreement since it was \nnegotiated by the Clinton administration last year. Finally, after a \nnumber of hitches, a number of setbacks, the administration and \nCongress appear poised to give final approval to the United States-\nJordan Free Trade Agreement.\n  This implementing bill sends an unmistakable signal of support for an \nimportant friend, an important ally in the Middle East. That signal was \nimportant when the agreement was signed last October. It is even more \nimportant now. Jordan has been a steadfast friend in its support for \nthe United States' efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. We all \nremember the critical role played by King Hussein a few years ago. King \nAbdullah has maintained that support.\n  As we all know, Jordan has been steadfast in its support for America \nin the wake of the terrorist attacks against us. In a September 12 \nletter to President Bush, the King condemned the attacks and pledged \nJordan's support in our fight against terrorism. As he put it, Jordan \nis committed to work with the United States, ``to ensure that the \nenemies of peace and freedom do not prevail.''\n  This is precisely the kind of commitment we now need from our friends \nand our allies. Accordingly, we should do whatever we can to reinforce \nJordan's support. By implementing the free trade agreement, we will do \njust that.\n  But that is not the only reason we should pass the implementing bill. \nTo put it simply, it is a solid agreement that is not only good for \nJordan but it is also good for the United States and good for the world \ntrading system. The agreement itself is closely modeled upon the United \nStates-Israel Free Trade Agreement. It provides for the staged \nelimination of tariffs and other trade barriers, provides for extensive \nintellectual property protection, and extends trading rules to new \nissues such as electronic commerce.\n  The United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement is truly a 21st century \nfree trade agreement. But I do not just mean it addresses high-\ntechnology trade issues. Our free trade agreement with Jordan also \ndemonstrates a commitment to a progressive trade agenda, an agenda that \nrecognizes the links between trade and environmental standards and \nbetween trade and labor standards, an agenda that puts these important \nmatters on the same plane as market access, the protection of \nintellectual property rights, and other matters.\n  Some Senators have criticized the labor and environmental provisions \nin the Jordan agreement. Let me respond and explain why these \nprovisions are, in fact, positive developments that point the way \ntoward further progress.\n  In the areas of labor and environment, the United States and Jordan \nhave undertaken a straightforward, common-sense obligation. Both \ncountries have strong labor and environmental laws. Recognizing this, \nboth countries agree to effectively enforce their own laws.\n  This simple obligation reflects a recognition that as the more \nglaring tariff and nontariff barriers come down, measures such as a \nlowering of labor and environmental standards can have a trade \ndistorting effect as well.\n  Some have charged that the labor and environmental provisions in the \nJordan agreement encroach on the sovereignty of the United States. That \ncharge is basically--in fact, it is plainly--wrong.\n  The provisions of the agreement do not in any way prevent us from \nenacting and enforcing the laws and regulations that we decide are \nappropriate to protect our environment and the health and safety of our \nown workers. This is a critical issue, so I want to be specific. For a \nlabor or environmental measure to be challenged under the agreement, it \nmust meet each of three conditions. Remember, this is for a labor or \nenvironmental measure to be challenged under the agreement. I will now \nbriefly go over the three conditions that must be met.\n  First, it must constitute a sustained or recurring course of action \nor inaction--a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction. \nSecond, it must affect trade. It cannot be something that does not \naffect trade. It must affect trade. Third, it must be beyond the bounds \nof the reasonable exercise of discretion in such matters.\n  Further, no arbitrator can order the United States to change its \npractices pursuant to the agreement. Let me repeat that. No arbitrator \ncan order the United States to change its practices pursuant to the \nagreement.\n  Under the agreement, dispute settlement will be based on nonbinding \nmediation--not arbitration but nonbinding mediation. That is very \nimportant. In other words, even in the unlikely event that the three \nconditions are met, and a mediator--not an arbitrator--and a mediator \nfinds against the United States, that determination is purely advisory, \nintended only to guide the parties in resolving any disputes through \nconsultation.\n  To my mind, the approach to labor and environment in the Jordan \nagreement makes perfect sense. Consider the alternative. Would we \nreally want to enter into a trade agreement with a country intent on \nweakening enforcement of its labor and environmental laws in order to \ngain a trade advantage? I don't think so. Yet the opponents of the \nlabor and environmental provisions would permit precisely that result. \nThat is not just bad policy, it is bad environmental policy, it is bad \nlabor policy, and bad trade policy. Indeed, I hope that by including \nlabor and environmental provisions in the Jordan agreement we will set \na precedent for future trade agreements.\n  In conclusion, let me stress that getting the United States-Jordan \nagreement off the ground would be essential even if we were not \ncurrently mobilizing support for a global campaign against terrorism. \nThe agreement represents an important expression of American support \nfor a key partner in the Middle East as well as a model of a \nprogressive free trade agreement. I hope the President will sign it \nimmediately so the benefits to both the United States and Jordan can \nbegin to flow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The absence of a quorum has been \nsuggested. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in order to avoid dead time in the Senate \nwhile we are waiting for other Senators to speak, I would like to read \ninto the Record two letters. One by our United States Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Robert Zoellick, to Jordan's Ambassador to \nthe United States, and the other by Ambassador Muasher to USTR \nZoellick. The letters are identical. They were exchanged on July 23 of \nthis year in order to demonstrate common agreement on a critical point.\n\n       Should any differences arise under the Agreement, my \n     Government will make every effort to resolve them without \n     recourse to formal dispute settlement procedures.\n       In particular, my Government would not expect or intend to \n     apply the Agreement's dispute settlement enforcement \n     procedures to secure its rights under the Agreement in a \n     manner that results in blocking trade. In light of the wide \n     range of our bilateral ties and the spirit of collaboration \n     that characterizes our relations, my government considers \n     that appropriate measures for resolving any differences that \n     may arise regarding the Agreement would be bilateral \n     consultations and other procedures, particularly alternative \n     mechanisms, that will help to secure compliance without \n     recourse to traditional trade sanctions.\n\n  Mr. President, again, this is an exchange of letters between \nAmbassador Zoellick and the Ambassador representing Jordan.\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                             Washington, DC, 20508, July 23, 2001.\n     His Excellency Marwan Muasher,\n     Ambassador of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to the United \n         States.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: I wish to share my Government's views \n     on implementation of the dispute settlement provisions \n     included in the Agreement between the United States of \n     America and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in the \n     Establishment of a Free Trade Area, signed on October 24, \n     2000.\n       Given the close working relationship between our two \n     Governments, the volume of trade between our two countries, \n     and the clear rules of the Agreement, I would expect few if \n     any differences to arise between our two Governments over the \n     interpretation or application of the Agreement.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about these \nletters, since many have referred to them as the U.S.-Jordan Agreement \nhas moved through the Congress.\n  First, this exchange of letters should not have been necessary. We \nshould have passed this legislation months ago, without the exchange of \nletters.\n  Second, the exchange of letters does not change the U.S.-Jordan \nAgreement one jot. It simply reflects the views of the current \nAdministration and the Government of Jordan. It is not an amendment to \nthe Agreement. Indeed, it is not even binding on future \nAdministrations.\n  Clearly, the number of disputes between our two countries will be \nfew, if any. In the unlikely event we do go to formal dispute \nsettlement, we should avoid resorting to sanctions, whatever the \nsubject of the dispute. The exchange of letters expresses that view.\n  However, if in a particular case a future Administration should \ndecide that sanctions are appropriate, it will be free to act \naccordingly. Nothing in this exchange of letters changes that.\n  Mr. President, I now would like to read into the Record article 5 of \nthe agreement, pertaining to the environment.\n\n       1. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to \n     encourage trade by relaxing domestic environmental laws. \n     Accordingly, each Party shall strive to ensure that it does \n     not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or \n     otherwise derogate from, such laws as an encouragement for \n     trade with the other Party.\n       2. Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own \n     levels of domestic environmental protection and environmental \n     development policies and priorities, and to adopt or modify \n     accordingly its environmental laws, each Party shall strive \n     to ensure that its laws provide for high levels of \n     environmental protection and shall strive to continue to \n     improve those laws.\n       3. (a) A Party shall not fail to effectively enforce its \n     environmental laws, through a sustained or recurring course \n     of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between \n     the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this \n     Agreement.\n       (b) The Parties recognize that each Party retains the right \n     to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, \n     prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make \n     decisions regarding the allocation of resources to \n     enforcement with respect to other environmental matters \n     determined to have higher priorities. Accordingly, the \n     Parties understand that a Party is in compliance with \n     subparagraph (a) where a course of action or inaction \n     reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results \n     from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of \n     resources.\n       4. for purposes of this Article, ``environmental laws'' \n     mean any statutes or regulations of a Party, or provision \n     thereof, the primary purpose of which is the protection of \n     the environment, or the prevention of a danger to human, \n     animal, or plant life or health, through:\n       (a) the prevention, abatement or control of the release, \n     discharge, or emission of pollutants or environmental \n     contaminants;\n       (b) the control of environmentally hazardous or toxic \n     chemicals, substances, materials and wastes, and the \n     dissemination of information related thereto; or\n       (c) the protection or conservation of wild flora or fauna, \n     including endangered species, their habitat, and specially \n     protected natural areas in the Party's territory, but does \n     not include any statutes or regulations, or provision \n     thereof, directly related to worker safety or health.\n\n  Again, to summarize, Mr. President, the labor and environmental \nprovisions are somewhat contentious. They are framed in such a way that \nI think it helps labor and the environment in both the United States \nand Jordan, and in a way that does not in any way intrude upon American \nsovereignty.\n  Let me repeat: The simple obligation that the United States and \nJordan make reflects a recognition that as the more glaring tariff and \nnon-tariff barriers come down, measures such as labor and environmental \nstandards may have an effect on trade. Measures that may have a trade-\ndistorting effect have been dealt with in past trade agreements. Since \na lowering or a suppression of labor and environmental standards may \ndistort trade, these too should be dealt with in trade agreements.\n  The idea here is to encourage countries to protect labor and labor \nrights and to protect the environment in ways that do not distort \ntrade.\n  The provisions of this agreement do not in any way prevent us from \nenacting and enforcing the laws and regulations that we decide are \nappropriate to protect our environment and the health and safety of our \nworkers.\n  For a labor or environmental measure to be challenged under the \nagreement, it must meet three conditions. I think it is important to \nre-state what those three conditions are.\n  First, a measure must constitute a sustained or recurring action or \ninaction. It can't be just a single act by the President or by the \nCongress. It has to be a sustained or recurring action in order for a \nlabor or environmental provision to be deemed trade distorting.\n  Second, it must affect trade. An environmental action or labor action \nwhich may have a significant effect on the United States but does not \naffect trade is not actionable.\n  Third, it must be beyond the bounds of a reasonable exercise of \ndiscretion.\n  There are certainly matters that may slightly distort trade, and may \narguably be sustained or recurring. But if the action is within the \nbounds of a reasonable exercise of discretion by the United States, \nthen no action is permissible.\n  Even if those tests are met, we move to the question of what sort of \ndispute settlement is provided for in this agreement. In this agreement \nthere is no binding dispute settlement. There is consultation, but that \nis it. There is no arbitration in this agreement. There is no \narbitration panel, no judge, and no\n\n[[Page S9682]]\n\ntribunal. Rather, under this agreement, if one country thinks each of \nthe three conditions is met, it may request non-binding mediation, and \nnot arbitration. If a mediator finds that an action is inappropriate \nunder this agreement, that finding is non-binding. And the parties will \nthen move toward consultation, trying to work out what seems to make \nthe most sense. Even if the mediator finds against the United States, \nthe United States cannot be forced to follow the recommendation of the \nmediator.\n  The argument against this provision is that it intrudes upon American \nsovereignty, that it commits the United States to at least listen to a \nmediator, and at least consult with Jordan on labor and environmental \nmatters.\n  I think that is not much of an argument against the agreement, \nbecause I think we want to encourage labor and environmental standards \nthat are non-trade-distorting between the two countries.\n  Let's say in this case that Jordan implements a labor or \nenvironmental action that is trade distorting. Absent the provisions of \nthe agreement, it would be totally within bounds of Jordan to do so. \nBut at least here we would have the opportunity to discuss the matter \nwith Jordan. Consider what would happen if there were no labor or \nenvironment provisions in this agreement. In that case, could enact a \ntrade-distorting labor law or an environmental law that hurts American \ntrade and workers, and that hurts our economy, and we would have no \nrecourse whatsoever. I think we want some recourse.\n  The provisions in this agreement allow some recourse, in that both \nsides obligate themselves not to enact trade- distorting measures on \nlabor and the environment. If one country does, there is at least a \nprocess whereby the countries can discuss it. The action by the \nmediator, if he takes any action, is not binding upon either party.\n  So I think these are very good provisions. I think they are wise, and \ntherefore, the agreement is something our country should approve and \nthe President should sign very quickly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see my good friend from North Dakota is \nready to speak. But before he does speak, I would like to reemphasize \nand underline the point that trade agreements properly include not only \nthe very traditional trade matters, such as tariffs, quotas, and \nsubsidies, but they also include other matters which do have an effect \non trade. I would like to suggest what a few of them are.\n  For example, the length of product patents and copyrights on music \nhas only recently been addressed in trade agreements. These are not \ntariffs, quotas, or subsidies, but they certainly affect trade. Thus, \nthese issues were addressed in the Uruguay Round.\n  What about the use of names, such as ``champagne,'' on a product \nlabel? Some suggest that the use of the word ``champagne'' is not \ngeneric because it means a particular region of the world--in France, \nChampagne. That was an issue brought up and included in the Uruguay \nRound.\n  What about payments to farmers to promote conservation practices, \nsuch as land set-asides, or low till agriculture? These are not \ntariffs, quotas, or subsidies, but they definitely affect trade. In \nfact, this is a current trade issue with the Europeans. They are very \nconcerned about the actions of the United States in that area.\n  What about the placement of products on store shelves, just putting \nproducts on store shelves? For example, we had a dispute with Canada \nover distribution of beer and other alcoholic beverages. The point is, \nobviously, that trade agreements do include matters, and should include \nmatters, which could have the effect of distorting trade. And if a \ncountry enacts environmental laws or labor laws that have the effect of \ndistorting trade, I think most Americans would think that, if properly \nworded, in a common-sense way, they, too, should be addressed in trade \nagreements. That is what we are trying to do with this legislation. \nThis is not a huge leap. This is not unreasonable. This is not radical. \nThis is very modest, if you will, but very important.\n  I urge Senators to look at this legislation closely and look at it in \nthat light. When they do, I think they will recognize this is an \nagreement that should pass and be approved by the Senate and signed by \nthe President very quickly, particularly in light of the current \nsituation in the Mideast. But apart from the Mideast situation, on its \nmerits only, this is a very good agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend from North Dakota for--how many \nminutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to this Senate Chamber to \nsupport the trade agreement that is brought to the floor today. I \nbelieve it will be approved by the Senate by unanimous consent. Perhaps \nnot, but I am told that it will be approved by the Senate, in any \nevent.\n  I have been a critic of our trade policies. I have been a critic and \nhave voted against a fair number of trade agreements. This trade \nagreement, it seems to me, is a reasonable agreement. It is with an \nabiding friend, Jordan, that has been a very helpful country to us. We \nhave had a long and good friendship with the country of Jordan. This \ntrade agreement includes in it some provisions dealing with the \nenvironment and labor. I think this is a breakthrough and a step in the \nright direction.\n  While trade relations between the United States and Jordan are \nimportant, the size of our trade is not very extensive. As a trading \npartner, Jordan ranks 98th.\n  While I do not think the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement is going \nto, in one way or another, affect our country's trade balance, I want \nto say that at this time and place our country needs to worry about its \ntrade policies on a much broader context.\n  I have brought a chart with me that shows our country's ballooning \ntrade deficit. For years, we have seen relentless growth in it. At the \nsame time, there has been a systematic lack of concern among \npolicymakers about it. It's as if they say: Well, it is happening, so \nlet it happen.\n  It injures this country to have this kind of relentlessly growing \ntrade deficit. Last year the merchandise deficit was $452 billion. Our \ndeficit with China was $84 billion; with Japan, $81 billion; and with \nthe European Union, $55 billion. That is almost $1.25 billion a day. \nEvery single day, 7 days a week, we are buying more from abroad than we \nare exporting.\n  Now, what does that have to do with the current circumstances in the \nUnited States? Given the issues of national security, it is important \nfor us to understand that no country can long remain a strong country \nunless it has a strong, vibrant manufacturing base. We are eroding the \nmanufacturing base of this country.\n  One thing that is not in this trade agreement--and it has never been \nin any trade agreement that I am aware of--is something that deals with \ncurrency fluctuations.\n  Our manufacturing sector has now discovered that when it tries to \nsell abroad, it is much more difficult. Due to currency fluctuations, \nit 30 percent more expensive to sell a product abroad than it was 5 \nyears ago. This increase has nothing at all to do with the cost of \nmanufacturing the product. It is solely due to the value of our \ncurrency.\n  Because of currency fluctuation, our manufacturing base in this \ncountry is being hurt very substantially. There are some who say: Well, \nthe doctrine of comparative advantage ought to determine how we trade, \nand we ought not worry about whether we retain a strong manufacturing \nsector in this country. I strongly disagree with that belief.\n  No country can remain strong unless it has a very vibrant \nmanufacturing base. Yet, due to currency fluctuations that have not \nbeen accounted for in our trade agreements, our manufacturing base has \nbeen undercut.\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\n  We need to negotiate currency fluctuation mechanisms into our trade \nagreements. We may sign trade agreements that lead to reductions in \ntariffs. But if the currency fluctuates, and we don't have any \nmechanisms in place, U.S. exports may end up being more expensive, and \nU.S. imports may be less expensive.\n  Our currency has fluctuated dramatically over the last few years. The \nU.S. dollar has risen about 40 percent against the Canadian dollar in \nthe last 10 years. Generally speaking, the U.S. dollar has had a 30-\npercent increase in value versus 5 years ago. It is worth 10 percent \nmore just a year ago.\n  On the television news people talk about the ``strong dollar.'' That \nis the wrong term. They should be saying, the ``Expensive dollar''. The \ndollar is more expensive today relative to other currencies. When our \ndollar is more expensive relative to other currencies, it means our \nmanufacturers are at a disadvantage when competing against the rest of \nthe world.\n  My point is very simple: In these days, we are all very concerned \nabout national security. And we should be. We are concerned about what \nis going to happen around the world with respect to terrorism and our \naggressive approach in trying to deal with it. All of us want to speak \nas one; we want America to have one voice. With relentless \ndetermination, we want to take on terrorists and do what is necessary.\n  Part of national security is in the area of international trade. It \nis important that we straighten out the problems that have assisted in \neroding our manufacturing base and have, at the same time, weakened our \ncountry from the inside.\n  I met with the president of one of the Nation's large manufacturers \nthis morning. It was coincidental and had nothing to do with speaking \non this bill. The products that this country manufactures have been \nnamed, several times, by Fortune magazine as all-American products, the \nbest in the world. The products are made in the finest manufacturing \nplant in the world; a plant that uses the finest state-of-the-art \nrobotics. There is no manufacturing plant that is more high tech or \nmore modern than the one used by this company.\n  Yet, the company has discovered that, when trying to sell their \nproduct around the rest of the world, it has become more and more \ndifficult. It is not because their product can't compete, but, rather, \nit is because the fluctuation of currency has made their product more \nexpensive relative to the similar products manufactured in other \ncountries. The president of this company said: The value of the dollar \nis hurting our company badly. And it is not just his company. It is \ntrue all over America.\n  Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of \nManufacturers, recently remarked that the dollar is overvalued and that \nits strong value has led U.S. manufacturers to have little pricing \npower. In its annual report, the Association noted that: ``The dollar \nhas reached a point at which it is pricing many U.S. goods out of world \nmarkets and making it harder to compete against imports here at home.''\n  That was from the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  My only point is this: I am going to support this trade agreement \nwith Jordan because at this point in time it is the right thing to do. \nRight now, we are not talking about trade policy. With respect to trade \npolicy, I have been a constant critic and will remain so. I voted \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement. I voted against GATT. \nHad I had a chance to vote against the bilateral agreement with China, \nI would have voted against it in an instant.\n  If I might, as an aside, just point out, our negotiators, after long \nnegotiations, agreed to allow China to have a tariff on U.S. \nautomobiles that is 10 times higher than our tariff on Chinese \nautomobiles sold in the United States. We agreed to a 2.5-percent \ntariff on Chinese automobiles, while they have a 25-percent tariff on \nU.S. automobiles. This is just a small example of what has happened to \nus in every trade agreement of consequence.\n  It is long past time for our country to pay attention. The trade \ndeficit is injuring the United States. Our trade agreement with Jordan \nwill have almost nothing to do with the deficit and I will support it. \nIt is the first agreement I have supported in a long time.\n  The job in international trade is to bring NAFTA back and renegotiate \nit. We need to get rid of those bilateral trade agreements in which our \ncountry has a major disadvantage. We recently lost in the Chinese \nbilateral agreement. And we lost in the agreements we have had on GATT. \nPeople say: That is just the way things are. I say: It is not the way \nthings are. It is the way we allow them to be. We don't have the \nbackbone, the nerve, or the will to stand up and begin to say: We \nnegotiate on behalf of the United States of America and we demand fair \ntrade.\n\n  If I could have just another minute, let me go through a couple of \nexamples, lest people think this is all rhetoric.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I assume the Senator from Montana is delighted I am \nsupporting the bill and probably not happy that I would talk about \nother trade problems.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might ask how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will let the Senator speak for a few \nmore minutes. Progress is progress. This is the first time the Senator \nhas supported a trade agreement. I know in the future he will support \nothers. I very much appreciate his taking the time to support this \nagreement. I yield the Senator another couple minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am overwhelmed by the additional \nminutes.\n  I have a couple of examples, if I might, on trade issues. Ask those \nwho are working on these issues in the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice, in the Commerce Department, and those in Congress to try to \naddress these issues with us.\n  Motor Vehicles in Korea. Last year, we had about 570,000 vehicles \nshipped into the United States from Korea. Do you know how many \nvehicles we shipped to Korea? Seventeen hundred. Five hundred seventy \nthousand vehicles this way, 1,700 that way. Why? Because of the tariff \nand taxes, it raises substantially the price of American cars sold in \nKorea. It is not just price. There are other difficulties too in \nselling foreign vehicles in Korea. Standards and perceptions also play \nroles. The result is, we are not shipping cars to Korea. They are \nflooding our markets with theirs.\n  Canada and Stuffed Molasses. Go to Canada and watch them load up \nBrazilian sugar on top of liquid molasses so they can ship it down here \nin the form of stuffed molasses. Then they take the sugar out and send \nthe molasses back. Why? To violate U.S. trade laws.\n  Japan and Steak. Go to Tokyo and have a T-bone steak and understand, \nif it came from the United States, it had a 38.5-percent tariff on it, \n12 years after the last beef agreement.\n  People think this is all humorous and interesting. The fact is, it \nall represents the failure of this country to stand up for its \nproducers. This country ought not be bashful about standing up for its \nproducers, its manufacturers, American men and women and American \nbusinesses, who only demand the opportunity to compete fairly. It is \nnot fair when currency fluctuations make our products 40 percent more \nexpensive in foreign countries. We say that doesn't matter, but it does \nmatter. It is not fair. Unfairness matters. We should and must be \nwilling to compete in international trade, but the competition ought to \nbe fair.\n  I thank my colleague from Montana. I will support this trade \nagreement. It is a small one, not much of a trade consequence to us, in \nmy judgment. It is written marginally better than previous agreements \nbecause it has labor and environmental issues in it.\n  There is a big job ahead of us. We need to try and deal with the \nballooning trade deficit. We need to try to convince the American \npeople that what we are doing represents their best interests. We need \nto expand trade but it must be done in a manner that is fair to them.\n  I will have more to say about international trade at some future \npoint in time. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9684]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from North Dakota. \nHe raises a very good point. Clearly, currency fluctuation certainly in \nthe short term distorts trade almost to the magnitude which he \nsuggested, a 30 to 40 percent differential.\n  It is also true that, as imperfect as markets are in the long-term, \nthe relative economic strength of countries tends to reflect the value \nof a country's currency--not entirely but tends to. There have been \ntimes when the dollar is low; there are times when the dollar is high. \nIt is very difficult to write into an agreement how to manage currency \nfluctuations, extremely difficult, particularly with larger countries \nsuch as the United States, Japan, the EU, with a single-currency \nmarket.\n  If the United States were to peg exchange rates vis-a-vis those other \ncountries, it would be difficult for those countries to agree. I doubt \nthat they would. Japan tends to like a low yen. It kind of likes the \nUnited States having a high dollar. I doubt that Japan would want to \naddress exchange rates in a trade agreement. Could we force them to in \na trade agreement? I don't know. It would be difficult. The same \napplies to the EU.\n  Let's say we were able to peg an exchange rate. Let's say it happened \nthat the countries all agreed. Let's say that one of the country's \neconomies deteriorates, for example, the United States or Japan or some \nother one. If the currencies are pegged, then it is going to be harder \nfor that country to retain its economic strength, at least with respect \nto trade.\n  There will be other distortions. It is like a balloon. If we stop \nnatural competitive pressures worldwide from operating through exchange \nrates, the problem is going to pop up someplace else. I don't know that \nwe have fully thought through where the ``someplace else'' might be in \nany rational discussion of exchange rates to include an attempt to \naddress that consideration.\n\n  I might add that, to some degree, this is an external-internal \nmatter. It is much more complicated than what meets the eye. The U.S. \nGovernment, in many administrations, tends not to discourage a high \ndollar policy. Why is that? The reason is because the U.S. Government \ntends to be worried about inflation, as well as other considerations, \nin addition to the trade imbalance, the current imbalances.\n  As my friend from North Dakota said--and he is right--trade deficits \nhave been burgeoning, and it is a problem. To say that currency \nexchange provisions will solve the problem, I think, doesn't quite do \nit. The U.S. tends to be a country with a favored currency. We are \nperceived to be strong and to be dynamic, even in the wake of the \nevents in the last several weeks. Investors worldwide tend to like \ndollars as opposed to other currencies. That tends to drive up the \nvalue of the dollar.\n  There are a lot of factors to be considered here. Having said all \nthat, I do agree with the Senator that at least an attempt should be \nmade. We should at least have a more open discussion of these issues. I \ndon't think our Treasury Secretary, or our President, or anybody else \nof stature in the executive branch, or the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve should have an open discussion of these matters, for fear of \npeople misinterpreting what they may be saying. But I do think it is \nimportant for the Congress, in the appropriate setting and in the \nappropriate situation, to begin to examine all the ramifications of \nexchange rates. It is extremely complicated. In smaller countries we \ncan deal with it, but in larger countries, as in Japan, and with the EU \nbeginning next January, it is going to be difficult.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say that it was not my intent to say that solving \nthe issue of fluctuating currencies would solve the trade problem. You \ncannot solve the trade problem without addressing the fluctuation of \ncurrency values. There are many other issues--although the fluctuating \nvalue of currencies is a 500-pound gorilla issue, it is not the only \nissue. I don't mean to suggest that if you solve that, you solve the \nproblems. There are more.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve 10 minutes. How much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve myself 5 minutes. I reserve the \nmajority leader 5 minutes when he wishes to speak on the bill.\n  I yield to my good friend from Virginia who I think wants to speak on \nthe bill. Can the Senator take 5 minutes?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to the Senator from Montana that I will try to say \nwhat I want to say in support of this measure in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the United States-\nJordan Free Trade Agreement. First, I congratulate Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley for their work in producing this very important \nlegislation, which is a significant step forward in making Jordan a \nworld partner with the United States.\n  Most of the debate on this matter is centered on the new ground which \nthis measure makes in including multiple worker rights provisions in \nthe body of the U.S. trade agreement, rather than as a side agreement, \nfor the first time.\n  The volume of the bilateral trade between the United States and \nJordan throughout the 1990s was consistently modest. Therefore, it is \nthought, this agreement is unlikely to have any great immediate or \ndramatic impact on the volume of bilateral trade.\n  However, I wish to share with my colleagues what this agreement means \nto the Commonwealth of Virginia and, particularly, to the Albemarle \nCorporation, headquartered in Richmond, VA.\n  Albemarle is a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of specialty \nchemicals, such as bulk ibuprofen, biocide products, and flame \nretardants. Nearly 50 percent of the corporation's revenues are derived \nfrom products that are sold outside the United States.\n  Several years ago, Albemarle Corporation began negotiations with the \nArab Potash Company to create a joint venture company that will process \nbromine and bromine derivatives from the Dead Sea in Safi, Jordan. This \nagreement will allow Albemarle to bring the bromine into the United \nStates tariff free. It will be actually shipped to Albemarle's facility \nin Magnolia, AR, for final processing.\n  This will represent a multimillion-dollar investment and it will be \nused for a variety of products, such as flame retardants for TVs and \ncomputers, and other products, and it obviously will provide Albemarle \nwith increased marketing opportunities globally for these lines of \nproducts.\n  It is anticipated that the capital outlay for this joint venture will \nbe $150 million. This outlay makes this joint venture the largest U.S.-\nJordanian private venture in Jordan to date. At full operation, they \nwill be creating over 200 new jobs at the plant near Safi and its main \nAmman office.\n  I congratulate King Abdullah and his government for their efforts \nleading to Jordan's accession to the World Trade Organization. \nAcceptance by the World Trade Organization, combined with Jordan's \neconomic reforms, are significant steps forward to making Jordan a \nworld partner with the United States.\n  These developments also made Albemarle more excited about conducting \nbusiness with its Jordanian partners. This free trade agreement is \nanother step toward solidifying our relationship and placing Virginia \nproducts on the same tariff footing as products from other countries.\n  I believe fair and free trade is the best way to increase trade, \nencourage economic development, and improve investment opportunities \nfor all involved. It is important that the achievements made by King \nAbdullah and the signing of this free trade agreement be recognized and \nratified by the Senate. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Jordanian free \ntrade agreement, but I support it with reservations. I am determined \nthat the adoption of this agreement not set a precedent for the future. \nWhat I would like to try to do, even though I know it\n\n[[Page S9685]]\n\nmay take a little time to do so, is explain to my colleagues the \nproblems with this agreement, the problem that we have when we bring \nnon-trade matters into fast track, and the very real sovereignty \nquestions that are raised by this small and seemingly insignificant \ntrade agreement.\n  I would like to try to explain the logic of fast track and its \nhistory and, within that context, make it clear that, in the current \ninternational crisis in which we find ourselves, I have decided to \nwithdraw my opposition to this agreement and, in the process, see it \nbecome law. In withdrawing that opposition in a moment of crisis where \nwe need to reconfirm our bond of friendship with Jordan, I wish to make \nit very clear that in doing this we are not setting a precedent for the \nfuture.\n  Now, having outlined all that, let me start at the beginning and try \nto explain the logic of fast track and the problems we are going to \nhave to address. The plain truth is that no one wants to address these \nissues, but they are there whether we like them or not. Therefore, at \nsome point, we are going to have to come to grips with them when we \nadopt a bill that will provide what we used to call fast-track \nauthority and now call trade promotion authority.\n  Let me begin at the beginning. America, in the postwar period, \nimmediately following World War II, recognized that world trade was a \npowerful engine for creating wealth and democracy and, in essence, \nremaking the world in our image.\n  We had an incredible bipartisan consensus on trade: that neither \nparty would try to use trade to politically benefit itself in the \nAmerican electoral process because trade was too important in promoting \nprosperity and democracy and in fighting communism in the postwar \nperiod.\n  In that context, we adopted what was then called fast-track trade \nauthority, which gave the Executive some remarkable powers. Under fast \ntrack, a President could negotiate a trade agreement which, when it \ncame before Congress, would be unamendable, and all of the Senate rules \nrelated to unlimited debate and unlimited amendment would be waived; \nfurther, there would be a time limit for consideration, and Congress \nwould then simply have the ability to vote yes or no.\n  That made sense in the following context: No. 1, Presidents argued, \nand I believe persuasively, that if you are going to negotiate a trade \nagreement where both sides give and take, you cannot then have that \nagreement be subject to further change, by Congress, after the fact. \nThat is a persuasive argument, in my opinion.\n  The second argument was that we were talking about a limitation of \nthe constitutional prerogatives of Congress under article I of the \nConstitution, and we had agreed to limit those powers because we were \ntalking about only external matters, such as protective tariffs. We \nwere not making domestic law, but were simply setting out trade \nagreements that involved external pricing of American and foreign \nproducts but did not make law in America that would govern the well-\nbeing of our people.\n  With those two very strong arguments, we adopted fast-track \nauthority, and let me say, the evidence is overwhelming that we were \nsuccessful.\n  When the Berlin Wall came down, it came down in part because we had \nthe resolve to keep Ivan back from the gate, we were strong enough to \ndeter a war, and our program of peace through strength worked. But what \nhappened that really tore the wall down was that the growth of world \ntrade generated a wealth-creating engine that created massive economies \nin places such as South Korea and Taiwan where those economic engines \nhad never existed. It rebuilt Japan. It rebuilt Europe. The sheer power \nof that wealth-creating machine destroyed the Soviet Union.\n  If there is one principle I am committed to, it is free trade. I take \na back seat to no one in Congress in my defense of trade, and I make no \nexcuses, such as talk about ``fair trade.'' I do not engage in fair \ntrade with a grocery store; I buy food from them and sell them nothing. \nBut what I am in favor of is trade. Not going to the grocery store \nmight eliminate unfair trade with them, but it would mean I might go \nhungry, so I choose to go to the grocery store.\n  One might wonder what is it about the Jordanian ``free trade'' \nagreement that I am unhappy about, especially my colleagues who have \nlistened to me before talk about trade, knowing I am committed to it \nand have defended it under all circumstances against all opponents \neverywhere. What is wrong with the Jordanian free trade agreement?\n  What is wrong is, for the first time, it brings into a trade \nagreement items that have to do with domestic law. It brings into a \nfree trade agreement provisions that relate to labor law and labor \nstandards, and environmental law and environmental standards, in \nAmerica. And in the process, we are literally transferring a degree of \nAmerican sovereignty in labor and environmental areas to decision-\nmaking entities that will be beyond the control of the United States. \nThis is a very serious matter.\n  Let me talk generically about trade agreements that embody labor and \nenvironmental standards and then talk about this one in particular.\n  When we built a consensus on fast-track authority, the consensus was \nbased in part on the fact that the President was negotiating trade \nagreements, tariffs. It was clear that the intent of the negotiation \nwas to lower tariffs on foreign goods coming into our economy and lower \ntariffs on American goods going into the economy of the country with \nwhich we entered these trade agreements. That was the understanding. It \nwas clearly understood that, within that context, we were simply \nnegotiating tariffs but not making domestic law.\n  Someone who was going to debate this would immediately point out that \nin the last 10 years we have injected another issue: patent and \ncopyright. They would say: We were already a little bit pregnant when \nwe did that because that had a binding effect on America in terms of \nrespecting patents and copyrights.\n  I think that might score you a point in some debating class in high \nschool or college, but the plain truth is, America is in the patent and \ncopyright business. We own 90 percent of all the patents and copyrights \nin the world, and so when we negotiated to put into free trade \nagreements that countries would respect patent and copyright, that \nbasically was a provision that had no effect on us because we owned the \npatents and copyrights, but it had an effect on our trading partners by \ncommitting them, at least through moral suasion, if not retaliation, to \nrespecting patent rights and copyrights.\n  I would argue that element in free trade agreements was pretty much \nlike Britain being for freedom of the seas when they controlled the \nseas because they had the world's greatest navy. They were for British \nseas, just as we should be for freedom of the seas today.\n  Two substantial problems arise when labor and environmental issues, \nor any other issue related to the laws under which we live and function \nevery day in the United States, are brought into this fast-track \nprocess. One is a loss of power by Congress in ceding its rights under \narticle I of the Constitution, and the other is a loss of American \nsovereignty, and they are both bad things.\n  When you allow the President to negotiate labor and environmental \nlaws, and labor and environmental standards, under fast-track \nauthority, where the agreement cannot be debated and cannot be amended, \nwhat you are literally doing is giving the President of the United \nStates a unilateral power to write domestic law under fast-track \nauthority.\n  Under fast-track authority, where the President has this power to \nwrite labor and environmental standards into trade agreements, which \nthen become the law of the land when we adopt them, President Clinton, \nfor instance, in a free trade agreement, could literally have included \nthe Kyoto Environmental Treaty. It would have come to the Senate. It \nwould have been unamendable and undebatable, and we would have had a \ndramatic loss in our law-making powers, and a substantial diminution in \nthe effectiveness of fast-track had the Senate been forced to reject \nthe agreement because non-trade matters been included.\n  If we had a President who wanted to change environmental or labor \nlaw, and do it in a way to limit congressional power and authority, he \ncould do it unilaterally through fast track,\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\nthrough negotiations of trade agreements. We never, ever contemplated \nsuch an extension of power when we wrote fast track. Never did we \ncontemplate the Executive would make domestic law in these trade \nagreements. They were about tariffs. They were not about laws that \nwould govern America and Americans in our daily lives.\n  The second problem with allowing labor and environmental provisions \nin trade agreements that have expedited consideration is they represent \na ceding of American sovereignty. In my opinion, they are \nunconstitutional.\n  Let me explain how this would work in the context of a bilateral \nagreement and then in the context of GATT. I'll start with GATT. Using \nfast-track authority where labor and environmental issues can be \nincluded, let us say that we entered into a GATT agreement where we \nagreed--as we do in this agreement, and I will talk about it in \nparticular in a minute--on labor and environment provisions. Now, while \nwe have to give the Clinton administration some credit for writing all \nkinds of boilerplate protections for congressional authority, in the \nend they could not protect what the provision is about.\n  Under this bill, we agree with Jordan that we will not take any \nactions with regard to our labor or environmental laws that would \nadvantage us in our trading with Jordan. Now, let me take those \nprovisions and apply it to GATT and the World Trade Organization. Let \nus say this became the norm for trade agreements. Who decides whether a \nchange in environmental law affects our competitive position with our \ntrading partner? Who decides whether a change in regulation was made to \nbenefit us in trade or because it was made through the Executive power \nof the President basically to promote the general well-being of the \ncountry? Is it not true, at least to a small degree, every change in \nenvironmental law and every change in labor law or regulation has a \ntrade effect, making us more or less competitive?\n  If we had the Jordanian free trade agreement as part of GATT, it is \nliterally true, if we decided under the Clean Air Act to grant a clean \nair waiver to Atlanta, GA, which we have done in the past, and to \nDallas, TX, which we are doing today, or Houston, which we are doing \ntoday, literally if this agreement were in existence as part of GATT a \nquestion would arise as to whether granting this waiver under the Clean \nAir Act benefited us in trade. In the case of GATT the judgment would \nbe made by the World Trade Organization--a third party, a world \norganization, determining whether or not we are enforcing the Clean Air \nAct to benefit us in trade and, therefore, whether we should be \npenalized with protective tariffs against American products that put \nAmericans out of work.\n  If we had the provisions of this Jordanian free trade agreement in \neffect through GATT, and we then opened up ANWR to produce oil, the \nWorld Trade Organization and its decisionmaking body, which we are \nminority members of, could determine that by opening ANWR we have had \ndegradation in environmental standards that benefit us in terms of \ntrade and we could literally have protective tariffs imposed against \nAmerican products on the world market and put Americans out of work.\n\n  If we repealed Davis-Bacon, a special interest law that requires the \nGovernment to pay the highest prevailing wage for labor, it could be \nruled by the World Trade Organization, if these provisions were in \nforce worldwide, that we had violated the trade agreement, and we would \nthen be subject to reprisal and punishment imposed on the American \neconomy.\n  If we adopted provisions that gave workers flexibility to work 60 \nhours one week and 20 hours the next week by changing our antiquated \nwage and hour laws so that a working mom could go see her son play \nfootball on Friday afternoon, something that is eminently reasonable \nand long overdue, if the provisions of this bill were in effect \nworldwide through the World Trade Organization, we could have a \njudgment by a world decisionmaking body that we have violated our trade \nagreements by giving flexibility under the wage and hour laws, flex-\ntime/comp-time we call it; that we have benefited in trade and, \ntherefore, we are subject to reprisal.\n  My point is, as we go beyond the Jordanian free trade agreement, and \nas we go to fast-track authority and as this becomes part of our world \ntrading system, I ask my colleagues, are we ready to give to the \nPresident of the United States unilateral authority to write domestic \nlaw we cannot amend and cannot debate? I am not ready to do that. I \nlove our President. I do not think any Member of the Senate feels \ncloser to our current President than I do, but I am not willing to give \nthat authority to anybody. I do not know who is going to be President \nin the future. Are we willing, through a free trade agreement and \nthrough trade promotion authority, to put ourselves in a situation \nwhere the World Trade Organization can determine that by giving a \nwaiver to Atlanta, GA, under the Clean Air Act, we are violating our \ninternational trade agreements and, therefore, protective tariffs can \nbe imposed on American products to punish us for exercising our power \nunder articles I and III of the Constitution?\n  Is that not a loss of sovereignty that would be virtually \nunimaginable by the Founding Fathers? I think the answer is clearly \nyes.\n  So the first point I wanted to make today is I have decided, just as \none Member, to step aside and allow this Jordanian free trade agreement \nto become law, but not because I think these are good provisions. I \nthink inclusion of these matters is one of the most dangerous actions \nwe have taken since I have been a Member of the Senate. I am doing this \ntoday because we have a crisis in the world. We need to reaffirm our \nrelationship with Jordan, a critical country in a very important part \nof the world, when we are at the very moment beginning to look toward a \nwar with terrorism. So our relationship with Jordan is important.\n\n  I do it also because our trade with Jordan is relatively \ninsignificant. It is important to Jordan, of course, and we are \ngrateful for it. We want to trade 1,000 times as much with them, but \nrelatively speaking, we are not talking about any significant amount of \ntrade.\n  Finally, I am willing to do it, making it clear that this sets no \nprecedent for the future. If it were not for this current crisis, this \ntrade agreement negotiated by the Clinton administration would never \nhave become the law of the land. I am willing, today, to step aside and \nvote for it because it sets no precedent, and it is clearly important \ninternationally at this critical moment in a very important part of the \nworld.\n  However, I want my colleagues to understand that any efforts to take \nthis process forward would entail giving the President unilateral \npowers to make domestic law in the labor and the environmental area \nwithout Congress having the ability to amend it or to extensively \ndebate it. I am adamantly opposed to that, and I believe the American \npeople would be opposed to it if they understood it.\n  Second, if we go forward and embody the same provisions in major \ntrade agreements, we are ceding sovereignty to the World Trade \nOrganization and to dispute resolution organizations where we will \nliterally have third parties casting the deciding votes as to whether \nwe can grant waivers under the Clean Air Act, or open up ANWR, or \nchange our wage and hour standards, or repeal Davis-Bacon, or do other \nthings that make eminently good public policy. That is a ceding of \nsovereignty that has no popular support in this country, and it cannot \nbe allowed to go forward.\n  I turn to the Jordanian free trade agreement. First, if I could pick \nup this pen today and sign a free trade agreement with the world, I \nwould do it. I am in favor of free trade. I believe free trade promotes \nfreedom; I am for freedom. It promotes prosperity; I am for prosperity. \nMy concern about the Jordanian agreement is the nontrade provisions. It \nhas two provisions that may very well never be used in our trade with \nJordan but they are extraordinarily dangerous.\n  The first provision is related to the environment. It says, despite \nall the boilerplate efforts of the Clinton administration, that if \neither country--Jordan or the United States--did anything to change its \nenvironmental laws that improved its competitiveness with the other \ncountry, that would violate the trade agreement. Under the rules of \nworld trade, there would then be a dispute resolution that would \nultimately include a United States representative,\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\na Jordanian representative, and a third party, which would determine \nwhether a violation had occurred and, if so, whether the ``violating \nparty'' would be subject to penalties.\n  I understand the dollar value of our trade with Jordan is less than \nthe combined budgets of the two great universities in my State. It is \nnot significant in terms of the global picture. But principles are \nsignificant. And bad principles are set often in little, insignificant \nbills. This provision literally puts us in a position where an \ninternational dispute resolution could determine, in the name of the \nenvironment, that opening ANWR or granting waivers, which we do \nroutinely under the Clean Air Act, violate this agreement, and we could \nhave trade reprisals imposed against us as a result of it.\n  If we didn't sell anything to Jordan, it would obviously matter to \nthe companies involved. It would be a terrible thing, but economically \nit would not be a catastrophe. My objection to including these labor \nand environmental provisions is based on principle, and if inclusion of \nthese issues goes any further and is established worldwide, it is going \nto have a profound impact on the lawmaking authority of the U.S. \nCongress.\n\n  Now, granted the Clinton administration puts nice boilerplate \nlanguage that says to Jordan, you make your own laws; and it says to \nthe United States, you make your own laws. But it also says, if those \nlaws are judged to improve your competitiveness as a result of a \nreduction in your level of environmental protection, then there can be \nreprisals.\n  Who makes that determination? The problem is, the United States does \nnot make that determination. That determination is made by an \ninternational dispute resolution system. The same is true in this bill \nwith regard to labor law. Under this bill, you have an obvious \nquestion: When have you changed labor standards to benefit yourself in \nterms of competition? With Jordan, who makes the determination?\n  I would have no objection if the determination of whether we were \nmeeting our agreement were made by Americans. I think it would be \nfoolish to get into this area, because everyone who is the least bit \nobjective about trade understands, if you care about labor standards, \nyou are for trade, because trading countries are rich, and they have \nhigh wages, and they have good working conditions. If you care about \nthe environment, you are for trade, because trading countries are rich \nand they can protect their environment, and they do.\n  I know we have people talking about a race to the bottom in labor and \nenvironmental standards, but the truth is, trade is a race to the top, \nnot to the bottom. But these are the problems with this bill.\n  Now people do not want to deal with this issue. It was clear in the \nFinance Committee, people were not ready to come to grips with this \nissue. What is appealing about putting labor and environmental \nprovisions into the bill is that it lets us be on three sides of a two-\nsided issue. It lets us be with the people who want to have \ninternational labor and environmental standards, and yet be for trade. \nThe problem is, you are either for trade or you are against it. When we \nwrite these provisions into our trade agreement, we are setting \nourselves up for loss of sovereignty and we are ceding power to the \nexecutive branch of government. I think those are two extraordinarily \ndangerous things.\n  This agreement will be approved today. I am going to support it. But \nI am going to support it as a matter of foreign policy. The President \nwants this agreement to show to Jordan we are committed to our \nfriendship and our partnership. We need Jordan's support in this war on \nterrorism, and as a result, I, for one, intend to step aside and allow \nthis agreement to be adopted. But in doing so, I want to make it clear \nthat this sets no precedent in terms of our willingness to cede \nsovereignty over America's right to set its own environmental and labor \nlaws and to interpret and enforce those laws without being penalized in \nworld trade because some international decisionmaking body decides, in \ndoing so, we benefited ourselves in terms of trade.\n  I submit, why would you change these laws, if you were not in some \nway trying to benefit yourself, either by improving the environment or \nimproving your competitiveness?\n  Look at the application that Atlanta, GA, or Dallas, TX, or Houston, \nTX, submitted, asking for a waiver of the Clean Air Act. That \napplication is full of the dire impacts that are going to be had if \nthey stop building highways in Atlanta or Houston and if they have to \nshut down those refineries from Corpus Christi to Beaumont that produce \n50 percent of the petrochemicals in the world in the Houston area.\n  Their application for a waiver of the Clean Air Act is full of \nexactly the argument that, if we don't grant this waiver and give them \nmore time to meet these requirements, we are going to destroy hundreds \nof thousands of jobs and are going to adversely affect the ability of \nAmerica to compete on the world market.\n  If we expand this logic into the World Trade Organization, does \nanybody doubt that our competitors will take the application for a \nwaiver of the Clean Air Act from Atlanta or Houston that is full of \narguments, as it should be, about American competitiveness and say \n``not only did they not enforce their law by granting this waiver, but \nif you read the application from Houston, TX, it is full of the logic \nthat is going to hurt them competitively if they don't grant a \nwaiver?''\n  Do we really want the World Trade Organization or an international \ndispute resolution putting our people out of work in Georgia or Montana \nor Texas because they believe when we changed our law, or when we \nchanged the enforcement of it, that it benefited us in world trade? I \ndo not think we signed on to do that.\n  So that is where we are today. We have a trade agreement before us \nthat was negotiated in the previous administration that has a very \nsevere problem. If this agreement were with another country at another \ntime, I do not believe it would be adopted. But today, facing a war \nwith terrorism and given that this is with Jordan and given that the \namount of trade involved is insignificant, from the United States point \nof view, I for one am willing to step aside and to support this bill. \nBut I want to make it clear that any fast track or trade promotion \nauthority legislation that would transfer the making of domestic law to \nthe President, limiting--in this case eliminating--our power to amend \nor debate, or any future trade promotion agreement that would grant to \na world decisionmaking authority the right to determine whether we have \nexercised our article I rights under the Constitution of the United \nStates properly, where a world organization is making a determination \nas to whether our people are going to be put out of work because we \namended labor and environmental laws in conformity with our rights \nunder article I of the Constitution, that is something that I never, \never intend to support and never, ever within the ability to debate it \nand to fight it intend to see it accepted.\n  We have to come to grips with these issues. We are putting them off \ntoday because this bill needs to pass. But these are matters that are \ngoing to have to be understood. They are going to have to be debated as \nwe deal with fast-track authority, or as we now call it, trade \npromotion authority. To this point, everybody has tried to hide from \nthese issues. But they are very real. They represent an assault on our \nseparation of powers, they represent an assault on national \nsovereignty, and they do not belong in a fast-track or trade promotion \nagreement.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 24 minutes and the \nSenator from Montana has 8.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska, 4 or \n5 minutes?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Let's try 5 minutes. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes with the recognition there is only 3 \nminutes left after the 5 minutes are used.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Jordanian free \ntrade agreement. I wish also to strongly support the remarks just given \nby the distinguished senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. In my \nopinion, he\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\nhas calibrated this exactly right. He has framed it right. He has made \npoignant remarks about issues that are most important to this debate \nthis day but a continued debate on trade this body must have, a debate \nwhich will take us, I hope, at some point in the near future, to the \nquestion of granting to the President of the United States what has \nbeen referred to as fast-track authority but now is referred to as \ntrade promotion authority.\n  September 11 highlighted why we need to strengthen our relations with \nthe rest of the world. Tools that will be required to combat terrorism \ninclude more than just military power. I think most of us recognize \nthat terrorism is not about human destruction; it is about holding \nnations and societies and peoples captive, hostage to the fear of \nterror.\n  Terrorists are best able to harness the fears and prejudices of \nimpoverished people to gain support for terrorist acts such as those \nthat occurred on September 11. These areas are the breeding grounds of \nterrorism: the impoverished, the downtrodden, those people of the world \nwith little or no hope.\n  To combat terrorism and the support of terrorists, we need to broaden \nthe understanding of what America stands for and to continue to help \nimprove the lives of these impoverished people around the world. I \nbelieve trade helps do that. Trade also helps develop market economies \nand strengthens democracies. What does that mean? It is not an end unto \nitself but to stabilize regions of the world, stabilize governments, \nand help maintain responsible governments and relationships and \nstandards of living and accountability and responsible action. That is \nwhat trade can do and has done.\n  At our Banking Committee hearing last week, Chairman Greenspan stated \nthat global economics relies on the movement of people and goods. The \nopenness of economies is critical to that growth. We are talking about \none small part of that larger universe of trade today. But nonetheless, \nit is an important part of this debate.\n  The New York Times article by Tom Friedman last week pointed out that \nthrough all of the instability in the Middle East, Jordan last year \ngrew in real numbers at about 4 percent. And as we are able to \nencourage and participate with Jordan through these bilateral trade \nagreements, we will continue to help Jordan grow, which helps, again, \nstabilize a very important region of the world.\n  As Senator Gramm has pointed out, this agreement is far from perfect. \nIn my opinion, sanctions should never be part of a market-opening trade \nagreement for many of the same reasons Senator Gramm enunciated and \ndelineated with precision. Sanctions do not address the root of \nenvironmental or labor problems or other such problems. These are \ncurrently much better handled at other international organizations such \nas the United Nations and international labor organizations in other \nareas. I shall not go back and deal with the same area about which \nSenator Gramm talked. But sanctions will actually harm countries and \nwill limit the much-needed capital they receive from exporting to the \nUnited States.\n  For the reasons that have been stated before, the economy is a \nfundamental dynamic influencing a country's political stability, hence \nworld peace.\n  Trade contributes to a country's security for two reasons: It \nestablishes relationships and understandings between two nations, and \nit raises the standard of living for nations and encourages that \nstability.\n  In my opinion, this debate today is a good beginning to address a \ncomprehensive trade agenda this Congress must have.\n  This Congress must ultimately grant President Bush trade promotion \nauthority. TPA is in the clear and vital interests of this country, and \nsecurity and economic interests are interconnected and dependent on \neach other.\n  Today, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this agreement, as \nflawed as it may be. But I consider it a good opening for the bigger \ntrade debate issues that must come from this Congress. It is a good \nbeginning. But we are far from the kind of finish that will be required \nnot only for the trade interests of this country but the security \ninterests of America and the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand that we only have 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the distinguished ranking member 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to bring up the same \nissues the Senator from Texas brought up. But I had a chance to listen \nto his remarks. I share many of the concerns that he has.\n  Although I have been an enthusiastic supporter of this agreement from \nday 1 and have not found all of the considerations that he has to \nspecific parts of it, I have reservations about those parts, \nparticularly as they deal with labor and the environment, but to appeal \nto some extent through an exchange of letters that these issues have \nbeen taken care of at least enough to satisfy my concerns to move \nforward with this legislation.\n  I speak in favor of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. I \nurge my colleagues to support it. But before we move forward, I would \nlike to put this agreement in context--not a context different than \nother speakers have but to emphasize some things that have already been \nsaid.\n  First of all, this agreement is very important between two countries \nthat have been friends for a long time and that want to maintain that \nfriendship.\n  It has been almost a year since President Clinton and King Abdulla \nsigned the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. By all accounts the \nagreement should have passed Congress with little controversy.\n  The Kingdom of Jordan and King Abdullah are good friends of the \nUnited States. The agreement itself is a good agreement. It opens up \nnew markets for U.S. exports to Jordan. And it enhances Jordan's access \nto our markets. But there is one part of the agreement that caused \nproblems.\n  These are controversial labor and environment provisions that were \nput in the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. It is these labor and \nenvironment provisions which slowed passage of an agreement that should \nhave passed both Houses of Congress quickly.\n  In the Senate legislation was introduced by Max Baucus on March 28, \n2001 to implement the agreement. On July 17 the Finance Committee began \nto debate the bill.\n  During debate many Members expressed concern about the labor and \nenvironment provisions in the Jordan agreement.\n  Many others pushed hard for an amendment to the agreement which would \ngive the President trade negotiating authority, which was supported \nvery eloquently by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment was withdrawn because of the chairman's \nopposition.\n  To help move the agreement forward the U.S. Government and the \nGovernment of Jordan exchanged official letters on July 23, 2001.\n  These important letters clarified that neither government intends to \napply the labor and environment provisions in a way which blocks trade.\n  The exchange of letters was an important development.\n  After all, the purpose of a free trade agreement is to facilitate \ntrade.\n  After all, we are talking about an agreement that has the purpose of \nfacilitating trade. That is pretty clear with the term ``free trade \nagreement''--not to deal with a bunch of social and environmental \nissues.\n  While these commitments did not resolve every Senator's concern with \nthe agreement, it was an important step forward.\n  And because of these letters the Finance Committee was able to \ncomplete consideration of the bill on July 26, 2001.\n  Unfortunately, some tend to characterize the labor and environment \nprovisions in the Jordan FTA as a precedent for future trade \nlegislation.\n  I want it understood very clearly that I do not accept that, and I \nwant to say that loudly and clearly. This should not be considered as a \nprecedent.\n  It does not mean that the Jordan free trade agreement in other ways \ndoes not\n\n[[Page S9689]]\n\nset a precedent. It is the first free trade agreement we have entered \ninto with a Muslim country. I hope it is not the last.\n  I also hope this sends a loud signal to our Muslim friends and our \nfriends around the world. The United States wants close trading \nrelationships with these countries and their people.\n  We want to help your economies grow through trade.\n  I think it was President Kennedy who said ``trade, not aid.''\n  It enhances the prosperity throughout the world generally. But as the \nJordan agreement is precedent setting with a Muslim country, we would \nsurely expect it to enhance prosperity throughout the Middle East as \nwell as the entire world benefitting because we all know that free \ntrade is a very powerful engine of growth. It can lift millions out of \npoverty, as we have seen in the development of this regime since 1947 \nwhen these free trade agreements started--and under the GATT process \nthe revitalization of Japan and all of Western Europe. Countries that \nwere poverty stricken 50 years ago are very prosperous today--Japan, \nTaiwan, South Korea, to name a few.\n  Their prosperity depends a great deal upon trade. Lifting millions \nout of poverty also in the process opens the door to new hope for \npeople. It offers opportunity to people who have only known despair.\n  Trade can help undermine terrorism by taking away the fertile ground \nof poverty and hopelessness from which that terrorism is sown.\n  It can broaden horizons and lift human spirits to greatness.\n  Our friends and allies must know that we share their hope in the \nfuture. But trade and the regime for arriving at free trade agreements \nand further negotiations within the World Trade Organization are a way \nto show that we put our actions where our mouth is.\n  It also shows that we have history on our side--that there has been \nprogress made in the past. It can predict the good future that lies \nahead as a result of freeing up trade. They must know we will open up \nour arms and embrace them through trade. Just as trade lifted Germany \nand Japan from the ashes of World War II, it will lift nations today.\n\n  However, we have to have the tools to make it work. One of those \ntools, as you keep hearing in this debate--and a lot of other places--\nis the need to give the President of the United States trade promotion \nauthority. We ought to do this in the same apolitical or bipartisan way \nthat it has been done over a long period of time. And this is done \nbecause we do not put a lot of preconditions on these negotiations. \nPeople of good will sit down to work out their differences, each \nrespecting their own national interests. The President of the United \nStates will not negotiate away the interests of the United States of \nAmerica and its people.\n  So it is time to give the President the power to negotiate trade \nagreements with our friends and our allies, and even with countries \nthat we might not consider our friends and allies, if they are in the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  The Finance Committee has quite a history of bipartisanship in this \narea, to give the President what used to be called fast-track trade \nnegotiating authority, now called trade promotion authority.\n  This type of legislation, over a long period of time, has passed with \nbroad bipartisan support. We in the Senate generally have not waited \nfor others to act. We have seized the reins of leadership and have \nmoved ahead. Today, we need to be doing that as well. I hope I can help \nmove that process along. I hope this bill today helps do that as well. \nThere is bipartisan legislation that is already introduced that would \nbe a good bill for this committee to consider.\n  At a time when the world economy is slowing, we must act. We must put \naside our partisan preconditions and excuses to trade and show the \nworld that the United States is ready, willing, and able to lead.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of what time I did not \nuse for Senator Gramm.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong support of \nH.R. 2603, the United States-Jordan Free Trade Area implementing bill. \nThere is a very limited time for debate available to my colleagues \ntoday on this legislation, so I will keep my comments short.\n  First, let me say that the timing for the consideration of this \nlegislation could not be more propitious given the horrific events that \nhave just occurred in our country. As we consider this bill, let us not \nlose sight of the geo-political context within which we now conduct \ninternational affairs. Trade negotiations between the U.S. and Jordan \nwere initiated for one reason alone, that being that government \nofficials felt it would substantially increase economic interaction \nbetween the two countries and thus significantly enhance political \nstability in the Middle East as a whole. Although the immediate \neconomic gains from the agreement will, no doubt, be modest, the long-\nterm political benefits will be considerable. Of particular importance \nare the opportunities the agreement potentially provides Palestinians \nliving in Jordan and operating in qualified industrial zones. For these \nindividuals, nearly all of whom at present live in poverty and have \nlittle chance to improve their lives, this agreement changes the \nequation and offers real hope. Significantly, it offers a tangible \nalternative to violence, and I need not emphasize how important a \ndifferent path like this might be to young individuals, and the \nstrategic interests of the United States, at this time.\n  I understand the concern of certain colleagues about national \nsovereignty as it relates to the dispute resolution provisions in the \nagreement. But clearly this concern comes not because this agreement in \nparticular threatens our sovereignty--from my perspective it does not \nand it will not, but rather because of the apprehension that this \nagreement establishes a precedent for future negotiations. The concern \nrelates to this trade agreement being a ``model,'' and once this trade \nagreement is passed, others will certainly look much the same.\n  To this criticism I respond by saying that each agreement negotiated \nby our country is unique and based on the issues that concern the \nparties at the time. There is no reason to assume that every agreement \nwill contain similar language to that which is contained in this \nagreement. Indeed, there is much reason to doubt that they will. \nClearly, there is a balance that must be found between having an \nagreement and having ways to ensure that the provisions that are in an \nagreement are implemented. In this particular case, I think a very \nappropriate arrangement has been created.\n  But I want to emphasize today that I do intend to be very cognizant \nof how we establish dispute resolution mechanisms down the road. And I \nsay this simply because we have reached a point in international trade \nrelations where we have to ask if we are prepared to change the ideas \nand institutions that form the foundation of our political economic \nsystem to attain a trade agreement. That is the essence of the debate \nat hand, and if we have learned anything at all from NAFTA, it is that \nthis is not something to be taken lightly.\n  All this said, this legislation must be passed today, and it deserves \nto be passed today. It sends a signal to the people of Jordan that \nwhile they are already our political friend and ally, the time has come \nthat they also become our economic partner. I look forward to the \nbenefits, short and long-term, that will come as a result of this \nhistoric free trade area agreement. I would like to take this \nopportunity to compliment the Clinton and Bush Administrations for \nrecognizing its significance and pushing the agreement forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this trade \nagreement between the U.S. and Jordan. It is important in terms of \nnational security. Jordan is important in the quest for peace and \nsecurity in the Middle East, which couldn't come at a more appropriate \ntime. It is important economically--without a healthy Jordanian \neconomy, they will not be able to play a constructive role in the \nMiddle East.\n  For me, it is important because it recognizes that included in the \neconomic relationship between the U.S. and Jordan are labor and \nenvironmental standards. It goes without saying that domestic labor \nmarkets and environmental standards are relevant\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\nto competition within a nation and between nations. Both the U.S. and \nJordan have strong practices in the areas of labor and the environment.\n  Some critics of this historic legislation counsel us that if either \ncountry fails to meet their commitments to enforce these or other \nprovision of the agreement, they do not expect or intend to use \ntraditional enforcement mechanisms to enforce them. This kind of talk \nis unfortunate. To say that regardless of the violations in a trade \nagreement, enforcement mechanisms will not be used is irresponsible. \nTrade sanctions are always a last resort. But to set a precedent in any \nagreement that under no circumstances is there an expectation they may \nhave to be used is a mistake an unwise precedent.\n  I should remind critics of this legislation that the agreement \ncarefully sets up a framework for various consultations and mediation \nover a long period of time before either party could use sanctions only \nafter recurring violations affecting trade and only with appropriate \nand commensurate measures. This is clear. Cutting corners on the \nimportant issues of labor and environmental standards in trade \nagreements is a step backwards for future constructive action on trade.\n  I support this agreement because of the importance of our \nrelationship and because the timing couldn't be more important. I \nsupport this agreement because we need to support our friends in the \nMiddle East. By passing this legislation today, the United States \nSenate sends a clear signal of support to our many allies in the Middle \nEast and a clear signal to Osama Bin Laden that we stand united with \nhis neighbors to do whatever we can to promote the economies between \ncivilized nations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to urge support of the free trade \nagreement between the United States and Jordan.\n  As ranking Republican member of the Trade Subcommittee of the Finance \nCommittee, I am pleased that the Jordanian Free Trade Agreement was \napproved by the full committee and now is receiving floor \nconsideration.\n  While some would say that this agreement amounts to nothing more than \na garden variety trade agreement, they would be wrong. From a strict \nU.S. economic perspective, it is not a major agreement. However, as \nKing Abdullah has made clear, from the standpoint of the Jordanians, it \nis an important precedent for his country and for other nations in the \nregion. This was true before the tragic events of September, and may be \nmore true today as our country wages a campaign to reach out to \nmoderate Arab states.\n  Bilateral free trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries \nhelp establish a mutual understanding of the norms and expectations of \ntrade. I think when foreign business interests enter into trading \npartnerships with American firms under a free trade agreement, both \nparties can benefit economically, and the U.S. and our trading partner \nwill almost inevitably grow closer together due to this type of joint \nenterprise.\n  I must commend Chairman Baucus and Ranking Republican Member Grassley \nfor their work on this agreement.\n  Anyone who has followed the debate on this agreement knows that \nprogress was slowed by a vigorous discussion of how the ambiguous \nlanguage pertaining to labor and the environment in the Jordanian \nagreement might, or might not, serve as a precedent in any trade \npromotion authority legislation adopted by Congress.\n  It is clear that the biggest stumbling block to passage of TPA \nlegislation is how labor and the environment are handled. As a \nproponent of free trade, I have serious reservations about any move \nthat would make labor and environmental concerns central concerns of \ntrade negotiations.\n  While I know that there may be some in the Senate who would like, for \nproper but misguided motivations, to attempt to raise the standard of \nliving in the developing world through the implementation of non-trade \naspects in trade legislation. But we must not confuse trade \nnegotiations with social engineering. Our chief goal in trade \nnegotiations must focus on benefitting American consumers and American \nworkers.\n  We must remember that what is good for the goose is good for the \ngander. If we try to impose our views on labor and environment on our \ntrading partners, we should not be surprised if one day these trading \npartners complain that our food safety laws are insufficient, our air \npollution levels too high, and our minimum wage too low.\n  Even prior to the terrorist attacks two weeks ago, the economy was \nlosing steam. It seems to me and I am sure to many other members of the \nSenate, that one good way to help revive and stimulate our economy is \nto pass trade promotion authority legislation. Fast track can help put \nour country back on the right path to economic recovery and growth.\n  While it is my hope that we can work on a bi-partisan basis to pass \nTPA legislation before we adjourn for the year, the Jordanian agreement \nis not the vehicle to resolve all these issues. Today, we can \naccomplish a significant achievement by adopting the Jordanian \nagreement.\n  On balance, this is a good agreement with a good partner, Jordan. It \nis not a model for how labor and environmental concerns should be \naddressed in trade promotion authority legislation. It is a statement \nto those in the MidEast and around the world that the United States is \na good partner. King Abdullah and other world leaders need to know that \npartnering with the United States can result in tangible benefits to \ntheir citizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement is \nan important acknowledgment of our long-standing friendship with the \nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which has been a stalwart ally in pursuing \npeace and prosperity in the Middle East. Opening our markets to free \ntrade with one another is appropriate, not simply in order to foster \nthe opportunities free trade can bring between our two economies, but \nto draw our countries closer together in the struggle for peace.\n  I have been an advocate of this free trade agreement since the \nprospect of its negotiation was first raised some years ago. I believe \nstrongly in the power of trade to eliminate poverty, encourage \npolitical transparency and draw nations closer together. I also believe \nthat free trade is one of the best manifestations of mutual \nunderstanding, trust and congruent interests two like-minded countries \nas the United States and Jordan can have. So I have strongly supported \nthe negotiation and implementation of this agreement on the essential \npolicy grounds on which it is founded.\n  I do not, however, support the inclusion in this agreement of \npolitically charged provisions linking trade remedies to environmental \nand labor standards. We have learned over the years that as a means to \nenforce expressions of U.S. political will on other nations, trade \nsanctions are ineffective at best. Quite often, they do more harm to \nAmerican interests, including the very interests they are invoked to \nserve, than doing nothing at all. Those that champion the linkage of \ntrade with non-trade interests understand this basic fact quite well. \nSanctions do not work. Sanctions are nothing more than thinly-veiled \nproxies for economic protectionism.\n  The effort to link trade and environmental and labor standards are \nlargely championed by those whose primary interest is in limiting the \ngrowth of trade. The labor movement is understandably interested in \nlimiting the impact of trade on entrenched labor interests. Their \ndesire is to maintain the economic status quo, not to promote growth \nthrough competition. Likewise, the American environmental movement \nperceives economic growth as inherently counter to their interests in \npreserving the environmental status quo. The evidence is overwhelming \nthat the long-term benefits of trade are vastly more positive for labor \nand environmental interests. However, labor and enviromental groups \nserve only narrow, short-term interests.\n  Those of us who understand the overwhelming economic and social \nbenefits of expanded trade are rightly concerned, therefore, with the \ninclusion of environmental and labor provisions in trade agreements. \nEven seemingly innocuous provisions such as those slipped in, almost \nmischievously, by the previous Administration into the U.S.-Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement are\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\ndesigned as poison pills by the interest groups which championed them. \nThey are invitations for mischief-making on a grand scale.\n  There is no doubt that opening markets to new economic activity \nplaces new pressures on labor and environmental concerns. Attention to \neasing such impacts is thoroughly appropriate in implementing new trade \nagreements. To condition trade on prescribed labor and environmental \nstandards is, however, to do the work of the opponents of trade. When, \nas in the case of the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, we establish an \nopen-ended and vague linkage between trade and non-trade standards, we \nransom our long-term policy interests for short-term political gain.\n  Jordan is not, happily, a model for future trade agreements. Our \ninterests in pursuing a free trade agreement with Jordan are \nunparalleled and unique. An attempt to draw parallels between the \nnegotiated Jordan agreement and negotiations toward a new WTO Round, a \nFree Trade Agreement with the Americas, or even new bi-lateral \nagreements with other countries is fool's errand. The reasons pro-trade \nAmericans support the agreement with Jordan have few echoes in our \nsupport for other more clearly economically-based trade negotiations. \nJordan is the exception that proves the rule: trade agreements must \nstand on their own, or they will not stand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of S. 643, \nthe U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act. Two weeks ago, a \nproud symbol of global free trade was destroyed by terrorists in New \nYork City. The terrorists who struck the World Trade Center meant harm \nnot only to the United States, but to the entire civilized world. In \nthis new era, our attention turns increasingly to defending against \nthis catastrophic threat, and to pursuing policies that advance our \ninterests overseas and reflect the values of our people.\n  Strengthening our strategic relations with our friends in the Middle \nEast has become an urgent priority of American policy. This free trade \nagreement marks an important benchmark in U.S. relations with Jordan, \nan island of moderation and stability in a volatile region. U.S.-\nJordanian intelligence cooperation will be helpful to our efforts to \ncrack down on terrorism at its source. That Congress has made \nratification of this bilateral trade agreement a priority as we wind \ndown the current session while sorting through the pressing obligations \nahead reflects its meaning to our people, and our mutual interests.\n  The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Area represents the first free trade \nagreement the United States has negotiated with an Arab nation. \nLiberalized trade with Jordan will benefit both our economies. Although \nvarious Jordanian and American goods already enjoy duty-free status or \nlow tariff rates, this free trade area will ensure that Jordanian and \nAmerican consumers enjoy an expansion of commercial choice and value. \nBoth nations will also benefit from greater foreign direct investment \nand trade-related job creation.\n  I remain concerned about the hostility this Congress has shown \ntowards free trade. Many important new trade bills enabling the \nexpansion of bilateral and multilateral trade have not moved through \nthe legislative process this year. Existing laws, such as the Andean \nTrade Preference Act and the Generalized System of Preferences, are set \nto expire shortly but have received little if any attention from \nCongress. This summer, we struggled as a body to determine whether or \nnot we would honor our Nation's solemn commitments to NAFTA, an \ninvaluable trade agreement with our neighbors and largest trading \npartners.\n  Indeed, it has seemed as though free trade is no longer a priority of \nthis body. In addition to the strategic significance of this \nlegislation to U.S.-Jordanian relations, it is my hope that passage of \nthis bill represents a change in the direction this Congress will take \ntoward a policy of free trade that has upheld our prosperity and \nadvanced our values around the world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement is an \nimportant agreement and I am pleased the Senate has agreed to pass it \nby unanimous consent today. The agreement will provide a closer \neconomic relationship with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which has \nproven itself to be an important strategic ally in the Middle East. \nImportantly, this agreement also represents the first free trade \nagreement to include in the core text, binding provisions recognizing \nthe trade impacts of labor and environmental standards. The agreement \nsets a precedent that future trade agreements should follow.\n  Some in the Senate have opposed the agreement because of the labor \nand environmental provisions. The Administration responded to this \nopposition by exchanging side letters with the Government of Jordan \nindicating that neither country expected or intended to use trade \nsanctions to enforce the agreement. These letters do not specifically \nmention the labor and environmental provisions of the agreement. The \nexchange of letters was, however, clearly aimed at the labor and \nenvironmental provisions. I think that this exchange of letters was \nunfortunate. I continue to support the agreement, though, because the \nletters did not affect the text of the agreement. I believe in the need \nto have meaningful and binding labor and environmental provisions in \ntrade agreements, provisions that are fully enforceable and can be \nimplemented through the same mechanisms as any other part of the \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators wishing to \nspeak. The unanimous consent agreement indicated that this debate would \nbe for 2 hours, which would end at about 2:08. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time be extended an additional 4 minutes on each side and that \nthe vote occur thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Just to alert everyone, the two leaders may wish to speak \non this legislation. If they do, they will use leader time and extend \nthe time until we vote a little more. If that is the case, they can \ncome and take care of that themselves. So the vote, as I understand it, \nwill occur at approximately 2:15, 2:16, something like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as a consequence of the recent change in \ntime, will the Presiding Officer indicate how much time is available to \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 5 minutes 20 \nseconds, and the Senator from Texas has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it may very well be that the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee would like to end the debate. I will \nafford him that courtesy.\n  Let me just try to sum up very briefly by saying I am hopeful we can \nwork together on a bipartisan basis to have trade promotion authority. \nThere is no temporal issue that I have stronger feelings about than \ntrade. I see it as an extension of freedom. I see it as the great \npromoter of economic opportunity and prosperity and happiness in the \nworld. I am in favor of world free trade. Obviously, I am in favor of \nfree trade with any individual nation.\n  There are very real problems when you bring domestic law into these \ntrade agreements, and I have outlined today the two problems you have \nin trying to inject, in this case, domestic labor law, domestic \nenvironmental law, and then the enforcement of those laws through \nregulation. When you bring them into trade agreements, you create two \nvery real problems: First, you give an extraordinary grant of power to \nthe executive branch of Government to\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n\nwrite domestic laws in a context where Congress' powers to debate and \namend are severely limited; and, second, you pass decisionmaking \nauthority, as to America's intent and as to the impact of the making of \ndomestic law, to an international decisionmaking unit. And you create a \nsituation where literally, with strong popular support, with the best \nof intentions, with the goal of promoting the well-being of our \npeople--and the only legitimate objective of American Government is to \npromote the well-being of its people--we could find ourselves in a \nsituation where a change in a labor or an environmental law was judged \nby an international decisionmaking body or dispute resolution mechanism \nto benefit us in trade, and I would hope that would be one of our \nobjectives in passing law. But by judging it in those terms, we could \nliterally have tariffs imposed on any American product sold on the \nworld market, and the net result would be severe limits on our national \nsovereignty.\n\n  These are very real issues. They are not easy to fix. If you are \ngoing to extend trade promotion authority into the area of domestic \nlaw--in this case, labor and environment--my own preference would be, \nknowing that trade promotes the environment, knowing that trade \npromotes labor rights by promoting competition, the ultimate right of a \nworker comes down to their ability to quit and go get another job. That \nis the ultimate worker right: I do not have to worry about somebody \nprotecting my rights and treating me well when I can go across the \nstreet.\n  Trade promotes that kind of competition. But there are two sides to \nevery story. I know the distinguished chairman has very different \nviews, at least on what he hopes to achieve with labor and \nenvironmental provisions.\n  I conclude by saying I am willing to try to work with him to come up \nwith a way of finding a solution to this problem so that we can give \nthe President trade promotion authority at a time when we desperately \nneed it, at a time when we need to be promoting world prosperity, and \nat a time when we need to be promoting democracy and capitalism, \nbecause democracy and capitalism do not give rise to the kind of hate \nthat endangers us and our people and our future and our happiness. I do \nthink it is important that we work this out. But these are very real \nissues, very tough issues.\n  Let me conclude by saying that in having this bill go forward, from \nmy own viewpoint, this is a decision that was made based on the \nnecessity of approving this agreement now as we are looking at a long \nand difficult war on terrorism, a trade agreement that in the big \nscheme of economics is not very important, but the country with which \nwe are entering into this agreement is a critical country, critical for \nAmerican interests in the Middle East. And it is in the Middle East \nthat many of our problems with world terrorism are focused. Without \nsetting a precedent for this labor and environmental extension into \ntrade or loss of sovereignty or violating the separation of powers, I \nintend to support the agreement.\n\n  I reiterate, in conclusion, that I am willing to work with anybody to \ntry to find a way to get trade promotion authority for the President. \nIt would be a great tragedy if we adjourn this year without the \nPresident having this authority. It is an arrow in his quiver that he \nneeds to fight this war. We are not going to win this war just with \nbullets, though we need some bullets and we need them properly \ndelivered. However many we need, I am willing to buy. That alone will \nnot win this war. Trade and the mutual respect it creates will be \nimportant tools, as important as bullets in winning this war.\n  This trade promotion authority is very important, but to deal with \nit, we have to come to grips with these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  I first wish to congratulate Charlene Barshefsky, the very able U.S. \nTrade Representative who negotiated this agreement, and also President \nBush and his administration. They have been very far-sighted in urging \nthe Congress to pass this legislation for all the reasons I and others \nhave mentioned.\n  I also thank my colleague and good friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, ranking member of the committee, for his steadfast support \nfor this agreement.\n  This agreement was signed by both countries last October. The \nimplementing legislation was passed by the House before the August \nrecess. A virtually identical bill was reported out of the Finance \nCommittee with only two dissenting votes, again before the August \nrecess.\n  The point being, there was immense support for this agreement even \nbefore the disastrous events of September 11. Certainly, the events of \nSeptember 11 make it all the more important now that we pass the bill \nto implement this agreement.\n  I also thank Senator Gramm for allowing this bill to come to the \nfloor. He had earlier expressed his disagreement with the bill to the \npoint where its passage was a little bit uncertain. I very much thank \nthe Senator for allowing this bill to come up and pass and for his \nsupport of the bill at this time.\n  I respectfully disagree with some of his concerns. First, the \ndistinctions he suggests between trade and non-trade issues are just \nnot valid. We have a whole plethora of domestic issues routinely \nincluded in trade agreements, whether patents or copyrights or \ntrademarks, uses of geographical names on labels, farm tilling \npractices. That gets pretty domestic. You can't get more domestic than \nfarming. We address farm tilling practices in our discussions of trade. \nThey are now very much in discussion between the European Union and \nourselves with respect to which practices are included as trade-\ndistorting subsidies and which are not. There are a lot of domestic \nissues that are included in trade agreements.\n\n  Second, the statement has been made that this agreement impinges upon \nAmerican sovereignty. It is important to remind ourselves that any \nagreement the U.S. Government enters into with another country to some \ndegree has sovereignty consequences. Arms control, for example, the \nMontreal Protocol restricting chloroflorocarbons, tax treaties, all \nhave consequences for American sovereignty. International agreements \nare not a free lunch. They are bargained-for agreements that have \nconsequences and have effects on each country's sovereignty.\n  Also, it is important to remember that a lot of traditional economic \nprovisions included in trade agreements have some effect on our \nsovereignty. For example, in the GATT, we have mutually agreed to \nreduce tariffs. If we didn't agree to reduce our tariffs, we would \nnever get other countries to reduce theirs. The issue of intellectual \nproperty rights is another example. Agreements in this area have \nconsequences to one degree or another on actions that this country may \nor may not take.\n  The main point I wish to make is that the agreement before us does \nnot infringe upon U.S. sovereignty because, under the agreement, \nneither country is required to change its laws. And there has been a \nlot of talk about international dispute settlement mechanisms. There is \nno binding international dispute settlement mechanism in this \nagreement. If there is a dispute, as I mentioned previously, three \nconditions have to be met for either side to request consultations. I \nwon't go through those conditions again, because time is limited. But \neven if a party claims that the three conditions are met, the next step \nis to go to mediation, not arbitration. There is mediation, and it is \nnon-binding.\n  A mediator might suggest to the United States or to Jordan, let's say \nthe United States, that the United States has done something untoward. \nThe United States can accept it or not accept it. There is no \nrequirement whatsoever for the United States to accept what a non-\nbinding mediation panel--one panelist named by the United States, the \nother by Jordan, a third selected between them--might suggest. Again, \nit is non-binding.\n  Finally, I might say that I do believe this agreement does set a \nprecedent, by definition, because it is the first of its kind. That is \na precedent. I hope that all future trade agreements will now, after \nthe passage of this agreement, include proper, reasonable labor and \nenvironmental provisions, because that is where we are in the world \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think I have pretty well said everything \nI came to say. Let me yield back my time and then if someone else wants \nto speak, they can come speak. If not, we can just remain in a quorum \ncall until we are ready to vote. With that, let me yield back the \nremainder of my time, seeing the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas. Especially I thank the chair of the Senate Finance Committee and \nthe ranking member for their work in getting us to this point.\n  I simply wanted to come to the floor before the end of the debate to \nexpress my strong support for the Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation \nAct. This is the first-ever U.S. free trade agreement with an Arab \ncountry. I think at these very tenuous and challenging times, there \ncould be no stronger statement for us to make than to pass this \nlegislation. I appreciate very much the work by all of those involved \nto see that it is done.\n  I note this agreement was negotiated before the events of September \n11. We are moving ahead today because forging this agreement is the \nright thing to do for the people of the United States. It is also the \nright thing to do for the people of Jordan. It serves as a statement \nthat our enemy is terrorism, not the Muslim world.\n  More than a year ago, President Clinton and King Abdullah began \ndiscussions about how we could more closely link the United States and \nJordan, which, as everyone knows, is an increasingly important and \nstrategic friend in the Middle East. This act is the result of those \nefforts, an important step in deepening that bond. When President \nClinton and King Abdullah signed the United States-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement a year ago, they expressed their concern about the impact of \ntrade on workers and the environment. I share that concern today.\n  I am pleased that written into the text for the first time ever are \nseveral provisions to protect the environment and the rights of \nworkers.\n  I see this as not only an important bilateral agreement but hopefully \na template for future trade agreements as well.\n  I recognize, as others have noted, that several of my colleagues have \nconcerns about how this agreement is structured, and I thank them for \nsaving this debate for another day and allowing us to move forward on \nthis important legislation.\n  Our disagreements on this bill are far outweighed by our areas of \nagreement. We all agree on the strategic importance and good friendship \nof the Kingdom of Jordan.\n  Bordering Israel, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, Jordan sits in the \nmiddle of a wide range of critical U.S. national interests--\ngeographically and politically.\n  This centrality has been bolstered by Jordan's supportive orientation \ntoward U.S. interests. This agreement should stand as a strong symbol \nof the importance we attach to our relations with Jordan.\n  The Jordanians have taken admirable steps to improve relations with \nIsrael, including the 1994 peace treaty that helped to advance the \nMiddle East peace process.\n  This trade agreement, as the foreign assistance and debt relief \nbefore it, is a signal to Jordan that we appreciate its efforts at \npeace in the Middle East and that we hope for more.\n  That view is held by Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, who, on his first \nvisit to Washington as Prime Minister, urged Congress to pass this \nhistoric trade agreement.\n  This trade agreement is also a signal to King Abdullah that we \nsupport his efforts at economic modernization. He and his team have \ninstituted a series of significant economic reforms in order to restore \ngrowth.\n  We understand those reforms, while necessary, are painful. With this \nvote today, we are telling the Jordanians their reform and austerity \nwill pay dividends.\n  Lastly, and most importantly, this agreement signals that the United \nStates is not the enemy of the Arab and Muslim world.\n  Osama bin Laden and his associate extremists argue that the West is \nwaging a war on Islam. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are \nwaging a war on terrorism.\n  Jordan's participation in this international coalition against terror \nwill only hasten our triumph and isolate the extremists and criminals \nwho attacked America 2 weeks ago.\n  By further solidifying our important relationship at this critical \ntime, the United States-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act will \ngive further impetus to the international coalition against terrorism \nand advance vital U.S. national security interests as well.\n  For these reasons, I come to the floor in support of H.R. 2603 and \nhope that all my colleagues will do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The bill is before the \nSenate and open to amendment. If there be no amendment to be offered, \nthe question is on the third reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 2603) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2603) was passed.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9693-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF KIRK VAN TINE, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE \n                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1438, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1438) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2002 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. As I announced for the majority leader this morning, he has \nevery intent of finishing this bill by tomorrow. This is one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation we have dealt with all year. \nPeople who have amendments should offer those amendments. I have spoken \nto the two managers. We are in the process of getting ready to offer a \nunanimous consent agreement that we would have a finite list of \namendments by 4 o'clock today. Everyone who wants to offer an amendment \nmust notify their respective manager or aide by 4 o'clock today. I hope \nwe can propound that unanimous consent agreement within the next few \nminutes so we will know the status of all the amendments.\n\n  The managers have indicated if we have no amendments, they will move \nto third reading.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could we tell the Senators who have amendments they wish \nto offer, if they could notify our respective Cloakrooms, it would \nfacilitate things. We are not ready yet to offer a unanimous consent \nagreement, but we will propound that agreement in the next few minutes \nto set a time for those who want to offer amendments. Is that \nagreeable?\n  Mr. WARNER. We are endeavoring to do that on our side. A number of \nSenators have just returned to Washington. They need just a bit of time \nto assess this situation. I know there is a strong spirit of \ncooperation on this side to move forward with the bill and complete it \nby Wednesday afternoon early. In order to do that, we have to have this \ntype of working document from which to chart our course, night and day, \nbetween now and Wednesday afternoon, and recognize that we have to set \naside time for the CR when it comes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if it is agreeable with my friend from Virginia \nwe seek to complete action on this bill by tomorrow night, rather than \nWednesday. That is the goal. I take it the Senator would agree with \nthat goal?\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the distinguished chairman, I understand there \nis an amendment that the Senator from Kentucky will offer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Jack Reed has been waiting to make an opening \nstatement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course. And I ask it be in order that after the \nfirst amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, I offer an \namendment on behalf of Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have to clear that. I wonder if we could \nwithhold that for a moment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is hard to hear. I would like to know \nwhat kind of agreement we are coming to concerning amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not think we have reached any agreement. We have \njust come to the floor for the purpose of starting consideration of the \nbill. I defer to my chairman. As I understand, we have colleagues \nwaiting to move ahead. I am prepared to try to do what we can, subject \nto his concurrence.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if we could recognize Senator Reed, who is \nwaiting to make an opening statement, and while he is giving that \nstatement, we will try to line up the order of amendments. Is that \nagreeable?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to have a chance for opening comments, \nperhaps 10 minutes for that, whenever it is appropriate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that the Chair recognize Senator Reed, then Senator \nSessions, and at that point, after opening statements, we hope to have \nat least one or two amendments lined up in terms of order of \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Michigan regarding the order of speakers?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Michigan and \nVirginia not only for their gracious offer of the opportunity to speak \nthis afternoon but also for their work as chairman and ranking member \nof this committee. I thank Chairman Levin and Senator Warner for their \nleadership.\n  I rise this afternoon in support of this authorization bill for the \nDepartment of Defense for the year 2002. It comes at a critical time in \nhistory where we have to prepare for a series of threats, both \nanticipated before September 11 and now understood very well after \nSeptember 11.\n  I also speak specifically with respect to my responsibility as \nchairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. \nIn that regard, I first thank and commend Senator Wayne Allard of \nColorado, the ranking member. Senator Allard did a tremendous amount of \nwork, and his perseverance, diligence, his good humor, and his \ncooperation were essential to the legislation we are contemplating and \nconsidering today. He has truly done a remarkable job. It was a \ndistinct pleasure and honor working with him. I thank him for his \nactivities.\n  The jurisdiction of the Strategic Subcommittee has a very wide swath, \nincluding space and space systems, strategic programs, intelligence, \nreconnaissance and surveillance programs, ballistic missile defense \nprograms, and Defense-funded programs at the Department of Energy.\n  The Strategic Subcommittee held hearings on all of the matters of \njurisdiction, including reports of the Space Commission and the \nNational Reconnaissance Organization Commission. We had extensive \nhearings, particularly on the ballistic missile defense organization. \nWe had at one point a 5-hour hearing on their plans and programs for \nthis year. We also had a very useful and instructive hearing on the \nstatus of our long-range bomber force. Even though we had a compressed \ntimeframe to consider these issues because of the late submission of \nthe budget, the Strategic Subcommittee conducted extensive hearings.\n  The result is the legislation we have before the Senate, a product of \nthese hearings, and of hard work, particularly by the staff. I commend \nand compliment the staff for their intense effort and their thorough \nanalysis of the requests made to the committee.\n  Based upon these hearings and this extensive analysis, we were able \nto increase, in many critical areas, authorization for programs. In \nproviding additional funds for these programs, we were guided by the \nrecommendations of the military services themselves. We were very \nattentive to the unfunded requests outlined and identified by the \nDepartments of the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, their so-\ncalled wish lists. That gave us a sense of where we had to apply \nadditional resources. We tried to do that.\n  Now, with respect to space and space systems, we understand the \nUnited States has a continuing and increased reliance on access to \nspace. For space programs, we added $53.9 million to improve readiness \nand operations of safety at the east and west coast space launch and \nrange facilities. This was the Air Force's No. 1 unfunded priority. We \nwere able to fund a significant portion of their request.\n  We also added funds to the Air Force to improve its space \nsurveillance capabilities and its communications capabilities. With the \nadditional funds we have provided in this legislation, the Air Force \nwill be able to exercise an option to buy additional wide band gap-\nfiller satellites to ensure global wide band communications capability. \nAgain, as we contemplate and prepare for extensive operations around \nthe world directed at those who attacked us, these types of global \ncommunications become more and more critical to the successful \noperations not only of the Air Force but of our ground elements and all \nof the elements in the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\n  In the area of strategic systems, we have included a provision \nconsistent with the requests by the Department of Defense and the \nadministration that would repeal section 1302 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1998. Section 1302 required the \nSecretary of Defense to stay at the START I nuclear force structure \nlevel until such time as START II enters into force. This provision, \nthe provision we have included, will allow significant immediate \nreduction in the number of strategic nuclear warheads, and will \ncontinue the transition of our forces away from a cold war structure \nwithout having to wait for START II to enter into force.\n\n  Also related to the repeal of section 1302 is the inclusion within \nthe bill of funds to allow the Air Force to begin to retire the \nPeacekeeper ICBMs beginning next year. This is consistent with the \noverall thrust of the administration to make reductions in our nuclear \nforce structure.\n  We are awaiting a nuclear posture review, due in the next few weeks. \nBut we are giving the administration what they desire and what we think \nis appropriate: the authority to begin to make reductions in our \nnuclear forces and the money to begin immediately to retire the \nPeacekeeper ICBMs.\n  Also in the strategic area, we have included a provision that would \ndirect the Secretary of the Air Force to keep the full fleet of B-1B \nbombers in place, including those B-1B bombers that are assigned to the \nAir National Guard until both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the \nNuclear Posture Review are completed and the Secretary has thoroughly \nreviewed the missions of the B-1B bomber fleet. We have included the \nnecessary $100 million in operations and maintenance funds to keep the \nB-1B bombers flying in fiscal year 2002.\n  I also suggest and point out the B-1B bombers are among those assets \nthat have been identified and notified for possible forward deployment \nin support of our antiterrorist operations.\n  As we today and in the future place increased reliance on our bomber \nfleet, not only have we dealt with the B-1B bomber force, we have also \nadded an additional $125 million for much needed upgrades to the B-2 \nbomber and the B-52 bomber. We have all watched recently as those B-52s \nleft Barksdale Air Force Base in support, again, of our antiterrorist \noperations, so it is essential to support these Air Force aircraft \nalso.\n  In the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance area, we have \ncontinued the emphasis started by Senator Warner on transforming our \nmilitary forces by promoting unmanned aerial vehicles. This bill \nincludes an additional $64.2 million for unmanned aerial vehicles. As \nwe improve the capability of these vehicles, we will rely on them for a \ngrowing list of missions. Once again, in any type of counterterrorism \noperation where we need relatively low-level, nonobservable, we hope, \nobservation from the sky and where we are unwilling to risk pilots, \nthese vehicles are terribly useful.\n  Last year we sponsored a demonstration for the Global Hawk system in \nan air surveillance role. This bill includes funding for a signals \nintelligence demonstration project using the Global Hawk UAV. We think \nit is an important addition to our repertoire of overhead \nreconnaissance.\n  Another responsibility of the Strategic Subcommittee is the defense-\nfunded programs at the Department of Energy with the exception of the \nnonproliferation programs. These DOE programs include environmental \ncleanup programs, the Stockpile Stewardship Program, and intelligence \nand counterintelligence programs.\n  This bill would add approximately $855 million for these important \nprograms. The budget request for these programs was not sufficient to \ncover all the needs for DOE to comply with its cleanup agreements or to \nimprove the conditions of the production complex or to complete \nstockpile life extension programs. Additional resources are needed to \nnot only maintain weapons reliability and our ability to safeguard the \nstockpile, but also our responsibility to clean up sites that have been \npolluted by nuclear processes in the past.\n\n  We recognize that more money may be needed but this is a substantial \ndownpayment on cleanup and stockpile security programs. The additional \nfunding included $422 million for the DOE environmental programs and \n$500 million for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n  In addition to the extra funding for DOE programs, we have included \nlegislative provisions to streamline the DOE polygraph program and help \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration complete its \nreorganization. As we all know, the initial response prompting these \nprograms, the polygraph program and the creation of NNSA, was the \nsituation of security breaches in our nuclear laboratories. We hope and \nbelieve that is a thing of the past because of our emphasis on \nstreamlined security procedures and a more rational, robust, and \nefficient NNSA.\n  One of the most controversial elements of our deliberations involve \nballistic missile defense. Let me say initially that there is a \nconsensus on the committee that we need robust research and development \nof ballistic missile defense and immediate deployment of theater \nmissile defenses to counter the threat. But it turns out that when you \ncome to national missile defense there are two schools of thought. \nThere are those who might say it will never work and those who say we \ndon't care if it works, we need it. The reality is somewhere in \nbetween. We have a strong obligation to test and develop national \nmissile defenses so we can bring, we hope, that technology to bear to \ndefend the country. But we have to be careful not to deploy something \nthat will not work. That is what we have attempted to do in this \nlegislation, to provide a counter to immediate threats but also ensure \nthat we spend money wisely, with the ultimate goal of producing a \ntechnology that works, not fielding a technology that doesn't work.\n  Let me first discuss the threat that we see before us immediately. It \nis most easily divided, I think, into the theater threats, short-range, \nless than 1,000 kilometers, and medium range, 1,000 to 3,000 \nkilometers, and then those national threats, ICBMs that can travel more \nthan 5,500 kilometers.\n  You can see there is a large number of countries that have theater \nmissile capability, and it is growing each and every day. These are the \nthreats that immediately challenge our troops in the field, that \nimmediately involve American interests through our forces and our \nallies throughout the world.\n  When you go to the area of national missile defense, we know the \nRussians have thousands of missiles, the Chinese approximately 20, and \nthen it is uncertain, frankly. As we all know, there is a strong \nsuspicion that the North Koreans have this capability. There is \ncertainly an indication other countries want this capability. But it is \nclear to us, and it should be clear to the American public, that the \ngreat, immediate threat that should prompt our immediate response is in \nthe area of theater missile defense. This authorization responds to \nthat grave theater missile defense threat.\n  It responds also to the national missile defense threat by continuing \nto support robust funding for research and development.\n  Let me give an overview of the funding levels that we have \nrecommended for the ballistic missile defense program. It is good, I \nthink, to begin with our baseline, which is last year's authorization: \n$5.1 billion overall--national missile defense and theater missile \ndefense, as indicated on this bar graph. The ``other'' category simply \nrefers to other nonspecific BMDO-wide activities such as program \noperation and other generally supporting programs. The request by the \nadministration was $8.3 billion, about a 60-percent increase, the \nlargest request for any particular category in this DOD authorization. \nIn this chart, you can see roughly the breakout between ``other,'' \nnational missile defense, and theater missile defense.\n  After very careful consideration of each and every program, after \nhours of hearings and discussions with the officers in charge of BMDO, \nand other officials, we made adjustments unrelated to the debate about \nthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, related simply to several principles \nthat are important.\n  Avoid contingency deployments--avoid deploying equipment that has not \nbeen thoroughly tested and we are not quite sure will work.\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\n  Do not fund activities that cannot be executed this year. We have \nscarce resources. We are about to mount a worldwide campaign against \nterror and terrorists who struck us and to fund things this year that \ncannot be performed when we have other glaring needs, to me is not the \nway to spend our money wisely and to support our troops appropriately.\n  Also, to avoid excessive nonspecific funding, requests for large \namounts of money without any real plan to spend it--the sense I got \nfrom listening to the Administration is that they will figure out what \nthey are doing on the run.\n  That is not the way to develop a system that is going to protect the \nUnited States.\n  Finally, avoid an undue program growth rate--programs that have been \nmoving along with good progress and suddenly are going to be \naccelerated without justification for the acceleration.\n  Those are the principles we used to decide program-by-program \nadjustments we would be making.\n  The effect was to reduce the overall budget to $7 billion, almost $2 \nbillion more than last year's authorization; specifically, to increase \ntheater missile defense by $600 million, the immediate threat, while \nreducing the administration's request for national missile defense yet \nstill increasing that budget by $1.1 billion. This was a robust \nauthorization for ballistic missile defense.\n  The committee decisions have been impacted, of course, by what we did \nlast week. In the manager's amendment, we added back the $1.3 billion \nwe had cut. But we have given the President the opportunity to use this \nmoney for either ballistic missile defense or for antiterrorism \nactivity.\n  I hope he will look at what we have done, and while looking at the \nability to deploy systems that aren't ready and activities that can't \nreally be executed this year, that he will wisely spend that $1.3 \nbillion for antiterrorism in the conduct of this campaign that \nthreatens America today. If he does that, we will still be on the path \nto a strong theater missile defense and a strong national missile \ndefense, but we will be able to affect the immediate crisis we face \nwith more resources. I hope he makes that choice. The legislation we \npresented him after last week's amendment will give him that choice.\n  Let me try to go into some detail about the recommendations.\n  Again, I hope the President and DOD will take our work and use it to \nform their views with respect to the additional $1.3 billion.\n  As I mentioned, we have increased theater missile defense by $626 \nmillion. We have tried to identify with surety well-defined programs \nsuch as the PAC-3 Program, which is just ready for deployment, and the \nTHAAD Program, and to fund them robustly. We have also tried to \nincrease resources for the Navy Area Defense Program and the Airborne \nLaser to resolve emerging technical problems to keep them on schedule.\n  In addition to these programs, we have added $76 million to the \nadministration's request for the Arrow Missile System. The Arrow is a \njoint Israeli-United States project. These funds will help make the \nArrow interoperable with our forces. It is an essential part of the \ndevelopment. Today that is one of the few theater missile defense \nsystems that is fielded and operational.\n  We have also gone ahead and looked at some of these ill-advised \ncontingency deployments.\n  We save $390 million by not funding untested THAAD missiles, Navy \nTheater-Wide missiles, premature THAAD radar, and Airborne Laser \ncomponents. We save over $200 million by rationalizing the Navy \nTheater-Wide test and radar development programs while funding tests \nfor Block 1 missiles and asking the Secretary of Defense for future \nplans on Navy Theater-Wide.\n  When it comes to national missile defense, I also pointed out that we \nhave increased last year's authorization by a total of $1.1 billion. It \nwould fund a new midcourse test bed. It would provide 20 percent more \nfor NMD, but it would save over $500 million by moderating growth in \nthe NMD system and reducing funding for nonexecutable programs--those \nprograms which we think, after careful analysis, cannot be completed in \nthis year's authorization.\n\n  We also have saved over $200 million by reducing excessive funding \nfor activities not associated with specific programs--essentially large \ncategories of money with very little justification. All of this money \ncan now be used, pursuant to the amendment of last week, for \ncounterterrorism operations, all the things we know we have to do \ntoday, and I hope we do today.\n  We have also funded the request by the administration for a test bed \nin Alaska. Even though there is a great deal of controversy about the \nefficacy of this test bed to test missiles, even though there is a \nsuggestion that it could be used for deployment which would raise \nissues under the ABM Treaty, we have tried to give the administration \nthe benefit of the doubt by not only significantly increasing resources \nbut also assuming that they are working very diligently not to \narbitrarily move away from the treaty but to comply with it until they \nare forced otherwise.\n  This approach of giving the administration not only permission but \nauthority to establish their test bed is again another commitment to do \neverything we can to promote research and development of a national \nmissile defense system. As we go forward, we hope we can continue \nworking closely with the administration.\n  Let me also point out that our response to the proposal by the \nadministration for missile defense was prompted not by an ideological \napproach to BMD but by a desire to see a program that works. We tried \nto base our judgments on the experience of these programs before.\n  One of the most influential aspects of our review was considering the \nreport of General Welch, the former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air \nForce, who conducted a thorough study of the THAAD system, the theater \nhigh-altitude system. A few years ago, this system was going nowhere, \nwith test failure after test failure. General Welch was asked to come \nin and look at the program, analyze its faults, and point out whether \nit could be saved and how it could be saved. His conclusions were very \ninstructive to our deliberations.\n  First of all, the Welch panel, set up by the BMD office to look at \nthe failure in this theater high-altitude program, concluded that the \nTHAAD program's ``rush-to-failure'' was caused in part by the decision \nto buy operational missiles early. That was the key factor in the \ndifficulties of this program. Until they got back to careful, thorough \ndevelopment with requirements and objectives, this program was in \ndanger of failing. If it failed, it would be a significant loss to the \nNation.\n  The same logic was echoed by GEN Kadish, director of BMDO, when he \ntestified that ``emergency deployments are disruptive and can set back \nnormal development programs by years.'' That is precisely what the \nadministration was urging us to do in this authorization--to accelerate \ndeployment before we had done the testing, to buy missiles that were \nuntested, to rush to failure.\n  I argue very strenuously that if the program adopted by the \nadministration is to simply take this $1.3 billion back and plug it \nright back into this program, it will be a rush to failure, and it will \ndefeat what we all want to see--the immediate deployment of effective \ntheater missile defenses and the deployment, subject to considerations \nof international law and treaties at this point, of an effective \nnational missile defense.\n  Until we have the testing and the development completed, deployment \nis something that is both premature and ultimately harmful to the \nprogram development. The program should be careful and deliberate, and \nwe hope ultimately successful. As the Welch report concluded, \nattempting to deploy minimal operational capability early ``is unlikely \nto be productive for programs of this complexity. The drive for early \ncapability is proving to be counterproductive.''\n  I hope the administration takes these words to heart. Much of what we \nsuggested in terms of funding reductions was based upon this logic--the \nlogic of seasoned professionals who looked closely at this program and \nwho want these programs to succeed but understand that they have to be \ndone thoroughly and carefully, and not rushed to failure.\n  As we go forward, we will, I am sure, continue this debate about \nnational\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\nmissile defense and ballistic missile defense, and a host of other \nissues. I hope and I know the full Senate has the same type of very \nconstructive and very helpful debate that the members of my \nsubcommittee and the members of the full committee had because I think \nit is important to have this type of significant debate as we go \nforward about issues. We have tried to do this, and we have tried to do \nit thoroughly. I believe we have produced, at the subcommittee level, \nand the full committee, a thoughtful and very logical and very \ndefensible product.\n\n  Today we are in this Chamber presenting the administration with the \nopportunity to use these resources to counter terrorism or to go back \nand invest in programs of dubious immediate efficacy and efficiency and \nworth for the national defense. Again, I hope that the administration \ndoes this.\n  Let me just make brief comments about the situation with respect to \nthe ABM treaty which, I point out, was separated from the logic of this \ndiscussion.\n  Regardless of the existence of an ABM treaty, our responsibility is \nto look closely at every one of these programs and to conclude which \nones have real value for national defense and which ones are simply not \nworth the effort in terms of the resources committed this year. We did \nthat--regardless of the existence of the ABM treaty. But the ABM treaty \nis a factor that has to be considered when you talk about national \nmissile defense.\n  The point I make is that many things changed on September 11. One \nthing that changed is the appreciation, I believe, by all of us and the \nadministration that we need the help and the cooperation of the world \ncommunity to beat our enemy, to beat the terrorists, to root out these \nnetworks out and destroy them.\n  In that context, I suggest and advise that it would be very \ncounterproductive for immediate and unilateral departure from the ABM \ntreaty, because of the consequences it would produce. That advice, I \nhope, is taken to heart by the President.\n  The President clearly has the authority today to withdraw from a \ntreaty. We attempted--and we continue to attempt in separate \nlegislation--to provide a forum for this Senate at least to consider a \nproposed departure from the ABM treaty. But until that other \nlegislation is considered, and perhaps passed, it is clear that the \nPresident has this right.\n  But today, as we assemble a world coalition to fight people who have \nharmed us--grievously--I would think that he would be very careful not \nto withdraw because we need the support of many nations. I think it is \nparticularly inappropriate and premature to do that since I believe we \ndo not have the technology today that will, in fact, be capable of \ndeployment within the next few months, perhaps the next few years.\n  While we are developing the technology, we should be very careful \nabout undermining the stability of international relations, \nparticularly at a time when we are reaching out to nations across the \nglobe, including our European allies, including Russia, including \nChina, asking them all to stand with us and to trust our judgment and \nour leadership as we go forth to counter and destroy the common enemy, \nthe terrorists in the world.\n  So I believe among the many things that have changed on September 11 \nis the attitude that was demonstrable in the administration that we can \ngo it alone, that we don't need many other people; it is our way or the \nhighway. We are now on a common path, we hope, to overcome and defeat \nthe terrorists. This is not time to debate the language that was \nembodied in the original version of the bill which passed the \ncommittee. I do hope there is a more appropriate time soon.\n  We are in this Chamber today at a momentous time in our history. All \nof us are committed to giving our Department of Defense every resource \nit needs to defend this country and, most specifically, to destroy \nthose who attacked us and attempted to destroy us. It is in that spirit \nwe continue these deliberations. It is in that spirit we will pass this \nlegislation. And it is in that spirit we will triumph and prevail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask my colleague to defer for a moment so that I can \nrecognize the valuable contribution of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I defer to the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. We recognize the Senator from \nAlabama is next to be recognized for an opening statement.\n  I commend our colleague from Rhode Island first for his hard work \nthroughout the years on the committee on which he has served from the \nfirst day he came to the Senate, and most particularly now in his \ncapacity as the chairman of the subcommittee, which is a very important \nsubcommittee dealing with many issues. I thank him for his work with \nSenator Levin and myself as we worked our way through the resolution of \nsome issues that were very important to him. I thank the Senator very \nmuch.\n  Mr. President, I will keep on my desk, as will the distinguished \nchairman, a list of the amendments which are now coming in. I am \npleased to say we are down to where there is a single person who is \nexamining the possibility of the UC request shortly to be propounded on \nthe question of putting in the amendments for consideration by a \ncertain time today, so we can hopefully complete this bill tomorrow \nnight.\n  My understanding is that at the conclusion of the remarks of the \nSenator from Alabama, we will turn to amendments; and in all \nprobability, our distinguished colleague from Kentucky will seek \nrecognition at that time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for just an additional \nminute without losing his order for recognition?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for not just his \nopening statement, which is always extraordinary and thoughtful, but \nalso for his magnificent work as the chairman of the Strategic \nSubcommittee. They are both invaluable. I thank him very much for that.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, may I say what a privilege it is working \nwith Chairman Levin and the ranking member, Senator Warner. The \nSenators have led this Senate with great distinction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my appreciation \nto Senator Levin and Senator Warner and to all others who have worked \nvery hard to make sure we complete our work in this Chamber in a \nbipartisan way. We were very close to doing that on almost every issue \nthat has come before us. But one issue did divide us; that was national \nmissile defense. And Senator Reed is one of the most knowledgeable and \narticulate spokesmen concerning that issue.\n  In my subcommittee, of which I am ranking member, I think Senator \nKennedy and I were able to reach an agreement on issues pertinent to \nseapower that both of us felt good about. It was not perfect; it was \nnot what we would like; but with the money that we were allocated to \nspend on seapower, I think we did a good job. Our problems simply were \nthe lack of money and resources. And, indeed, I will mention a few \nthings that we were missing as a result of that.\n  President Bush campaigned that he would improve the situation for our \ndefense people and our defense budget and do some things that needed to \nbe done. If you look at his budget, it represents an historic \nimprovement and increase in defense. This appropriations bill we are \nvoting out today totals $328 billion. Last year, we were at $296 \nbillion. That is a $30 billion increase, plus a $6 billion supplemental \nwe passed. It means a $38 billion increase in defense this year over \nlast year.\n  That is the biggest increase in probably 15 years in defense. It \nrepresents a long overdue step. It was done before we had these \nterrorist attacks. And it represented a consensus by the administration \nand their representation to the Congress on the needs of our defense \nbudget. So we made a big step forward, and we are happy about that.\n  We spent a good deal of that money on a number of things, such as a \n5-percent pay raise for our men and women\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\nin uniform, which is tacked on to last year's increase--well above the \ninflation rate; 6- to 10-percent pay raises for people in critical \npositions; a $232 million increase in the housing allowance for \nfamilies--increased funding for housing--an increase for national \nmissile defense, and a number of other increases.\n  So we are proud of those things. We are proud of the overall increase \nin the defense budget. However, our defense budget still, as a \npercentage of our GDP--our total gross domestic product--is far less \nthan it was in the 1980s. At a time when we are seeing increased \nthreats to our ability to function in the world as a result of \nterrorists and rogue nations, we are going to have to increase the \nbudget in the years to come.\n\n  The biggest thing we were not able to do in this budget--and the \nAmerican people need to understand it--we did not make enough progress \nin recapitalization, replacing old and worn-out equipment such as \ntanks, aircraft, and ships; nor did we do enough in research and \ndevelopment of new equipment for the future. We did not make enough \nprogress despite a very significant increase in defense spending this \nyear.\n  We are going to have--we approved the other day--an additional $20 \nbillion for defense, most of which--virtually all of which will be \nspent for the terrorist problem we are now facing. With some of that, \nwe will be able to strengthen our Defense Department for other issues, \nbut most of it, indeed, will go to a terrorist response. That is not \ngoing to leave us in a significantly stronger position.\n  If you count that, we are looking at a $58 billion increase over last \nyear. From a financial point of view, we did pretty well. From a \nprocurement point of view, most of us are somewhat concerned.\n  For example, in the Seapower Subcommittee, of which I am ranking \nmember, we were wrestling with a Navy that now has about 315 ships \nafloat out there. At one point in this country not too long ago, we \nwere talking about a 600-ship Navy. Along with everything else, we have \nhad a steady reduction in funding for ships. In this budget, we are \ngoing to have six new ships approved, which is good--they are \nexpensive, every one of them--but that will not stop the decline. Our \nestimates from our Navy people are it takes eight to ten ships a year \nto maintain the current level of 315 ships. So we are still on a \ndownward slope for ships.\n  At some point, you just have to have a ship on the sea to be able to \nproject American power in areas around the globe. You have to have a \ncertain number. Many of them have to be in home port to be repaired. \nThe sailors need to be home at various times. They need to respond to \nvarious crises in different places. It does not leave you that many \nships to actually send to a given place at a given time when they are \nneeded. Seapower is a good example of our inability to be as effective \nin procuring capital assets for our defense as we would like to be. I \nwish I had a more positive story to tell there, but I don't.\n  One defense official recently said that it was like a bow wave in \nfront of a ship, this procurement need. We are just pushing it in front \nof us. Sooner or later, we will have to confront it. Another defense \nofficial in the Clinton administration said we are in a death spiral. \nWhat he meant by that was, we are trying to keep afloat and keep \noperating equipment and airplanes and ships that need constant repair, \nand they are getting older and older. We would do better to purchase \nnew, modern, more effective equipment that would not, perhaps, have as \nmany personnel needed to operate it and could actually save us money in \noperation to a significant degree. Those are the issues with which we \nneed to wrestle.\n  Senator Reed is very knowledgeable and makes a number of points about \nnational missile defense. It would be appropriate for me to respond to \nsome degree on that. I will make a few points the items that concern \nme. We are not in perfect agreement on it.\n  However, I do want to say how much I appreciate Senator Reed and \nChairman Levin and Senator Warner, the ranking member, and Senator \nAllard, ranking member of the subcommittee, for their determination at \nthis time of national crisis to reach an agreement on this issue and \nnot to have us be in disagreement. They have accomplished that. They \nhave done so in a way I can support. I believe it moves us in a \ndirection that we needed to move. I am very proud we were able to have \nthat occur.\n\n  As it came out of committee, we split 13-12 on the budget for \nnational missile defense. Let me relate a few things about it.\n  President Clinton's budget for national missile defense this year, as \nhe projected it, was approximately $5 billion. As President Bush \ncampaigned, he told America he believed we needed to do more on \nnational missile defense. Two and a half years ago, this Congress voted \n97-3, I believe, to deploy a national missile defense system. As soon \nas technologically feasible, we would deploy a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, when he was in the private sector, chaired a \nbipartisan commission, the Rumsfeld commission. They did a study to \ndetermine what kind of threat we faced from incoming missiles. The \nreport was unanimous, the bipartisan commission was unanimous, that by \n2005, this Nation could be subject to missile attack for which we have \nabsolutely no defense at this time. The President recognized that. \nLater he chose Mr. Rumsfeld to be Secretary of Defense. When he came \nin, he proposed a $38 billion increase in the defense budget. He asked \nfor $3 billion more for national missile defense, to go from $5 to $8 \nbillion. We think that is a reasonable increase. It is a significant \nincrease, but I believe--and I know Senator Warner and others believe--\nthis is the right thing for us to do.\n  People say: Well, they may not have this missile that can reach us \nnow. The commission said, by 2005, they could. If we are going to have \na defense against it when they do have the capability of reaching us \nwith missiles, we have to start today. This is not something about \nwhich we can do at a snap of our fingers.\n  Of course, this administration will not, this Congress will not \ntolerate the deployment of a system that is not feasible, that won't \nwork. We have to get started on building it. A $3 billion increase in \nnational missile defense spending is a reasonable increase when that is \nthe one gap we saw in our defense.\n  Indeed, Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, in his \ntestimony, talked about the Gulf War. He said: If you look at the Gulf \nWar, you could see that in many ways we overestimated our enemy's \ncapability. And, in fact, we overestimated his capability in virtually \nevery area except one. The one we did not consider enough was his \nability to launch missiles, Scud missiles, if you remember, into our \nmilitary bases and troops out in the field and into Israel and perhaps \neven destabilizing our relationship with Israel and causing \nconsternation in our defense effort. So we rushed in the Patriot \nmissile. It actually succeeded in knocking some of those Scuds down, \nbut it was not designed for that and had not been ready to be deployed \nfor that. It was rushed out as an emergency, and it worked to a degree.\n  Since then, we realize we do have the capability to knock down an \nincoming missile. Some people almost think it is Star Wars and it can't \nbe done, but we have had hearing after hearing after hearing on that \nsubject. Both sides of the aisle agree it is technologically something \nthat can be done. We have the ability to do it. It is just the question \nof when it ought to be deployed, I suppose; that is our disagreement.\n  The American people need to realize that if, by 2005, Iran or \nPakistan, any nation, Iraq, or North Korea continues their development \nor their purchase of missiles, they could have the ability to reach us \nwith a missile, and we have no defense to that whatsoever.\n  You say we have theater missile defense, but it cannot be deployed \naround this country in a way that would protect us as a national \nmissile defense. Why is that, under present circumstances? The reason \nfor that is, in 1972 we entered into an ABM treaty, Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty, with the Soviets.\n  At that time, we both had the capability to destroy each other many \ntimes over with our missiles. Both of us, in the 1970s, were thinking \nabout a national missile defense program. So somebody finally, I guess, \ngot our nations to start thinking that this is\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\nreally not good for either one of us. Why should we invest billions of \ndollars in a system that will not really protect us from the \noverwhelming force of the other. So we signed the treaty. It, flat out, \nsaid that we will not deploy a national missile defense. The treaty is \nnot but two or three pages.\n  The first article says: We will not build a national missile defense. \nPeople have said we don't need to get out of this treaty. Well, if we \nare going to build a national missile defense, we do have to get out of \nit. What if the Russians don't agree? We are threatened now from a \nmultitude of nations. We want to have a friendly relationship with \nRussia. I pray we don't have a threat from Russia. I hope that our \nrelationship will get even better with Russia. But we have a bunch of \nnations out there--and if anybody had any doubts about it, they didn't \nafter September 11--who wish us ill. If they had the capability of \nlaunching missiles and hitting Los Angeles, New York, Miami, or some \nother American city and can kill millions of American people, then we \nare not safe in this world.\n  We have the ability to do this, and it is time for us to get busy \nabout it. No great nation ought to leave itself vulnerable. Indeed, \nHenry Kissinger, an architect of the ABM Treaty, was quoted. He talked \nabout the new circumstances we are in. He said:\n\n       I have never heard of a nation whose policy it is to keep \n     itself vulnerable to attack.\n\n  That is what we are basically talking about. We are having a policy \nby trying to adhere to a treaty with a dead empire, the Soviet Union--\nit wasn't even with the Russia of today. Many legal scholars say we are \nnot even required to abide by it because it is not with a legal entity \nthat exists today. So we need to get out of that treaty.\n  The Russians want to extract compromises from us, and we all \nunderstand that. So the President deals with them and works and \nincreases our relationship with Russia, and the mutual interests get \nfurthered. I thought we were on the road to making an agreement with \nthe Russians. They have said some things that indicate they would \nagree. The Europeans, after initially being opposed, have warmed up to \nthe idea quite considerably. About the only place left that we are \nhaving problems with is the U.S. Senate. The House is on board with \nthis, but we are still having some problems here. So there was language \nin this bill--and the reason I and others voted against it when it came \nout of committee--which said that if the Russians didn't agree to allow \nus to build a national missile defense, the President could not go \nforward, but had to come back to Congress and ask for a vote.\n  Whereas, under the ABM treaty, the President has personal unilateral \npower to wipe out the treaty. But if they did agree, the President \ncould go forward. To me, that is an odd thing for the Congress to do--\nto cede our power to build a national missile defense system to the \nRussians, to have them have a veto over whether or not we have a \nmissile system deployed. I don't think that was good.\n  I am glad that this compromise language came out. I am very, very \nhappy that it came out. It is something I don't think we should have \ndone.\n  As a former Federal lawyer, I think about the legal situation here. \nThe treaty prohibits us from deploying a national missile defense \nsystem, which would include deploying the radar systems, perhaps, out \nthere that support one. It prohibits us from developing or testing a \nsea-based or mobile system of any kind, which is precisely what we need \nto be doing now. As a lawyer, it seems to me that when the Senate votes \n97-3 to deploy a national missile defense system, the President of the \nUnited States at that time, President Clinton, signed that legislation, \nand the President of the United States today, President Bush, campaigns \non developing and deploying one, and we are funding the money to carry \none out, we ought to be honest enough to say we are moving to \ncontradiction of the treaty, if we have not already.\n  We have the intent to deploy a national missile defense system, which \nis contrary to the treaty. So the President either has to get out of \nit, or the Russians need to agree to that. Hopefully, they will agree. \nIf not, we need to move on because we have to protect ourselves. We \ncan't let a 1972 treaty with an empire that no longer exists prohibit \nus from protecting ourselves from other nations around this world who \nhave the ability to launch missiles that could hit us. It is just that \nsimple. I hope and believe I can support the language that is in the \nbill. I salute those who worked hard to make it acceptable.\n  I will just mention a couple of things in general about this \nlegislation. Secretary Rumsfeld is committed to transforming our \nmilitary. Certainly, the events of September 11 should make us doubly \ncommitted to that goal. The old system of defending against a Soviet \nattack on the planes of Europe is not what our threat is today. We need \na transformation that has more mobility, the ability to move our \nequipment, to disembark it around the globe. This is what the \ntransformation plan was about that he has pushed, which was in \ndiscussion and agreement, really, by all of us before September 11. It \nwas that we be more mobile, have more agility, that the weapons systems \nand equipment we use have more abilities to perform different \nfunctions. It would be more lethal with the smart bombs and those kinds \nof things. A single round, a single bomb, could be much more directed \nand effective in its attack.\n  We needed better surveillance and reconnaissance and intelligence \ninformation, and we need a modernized command and control system. Those \nwere the goals of transformation. I believe this legislation supports \nthat, although perhaps not as much as I would like. I would like to \nbelieve that the quadrennial defense review coming out of the \nDepartment of Defense within a few weeks, and Secretary Rumsfeld's own \ninternal review, will further push our services to go forward to a \ntransformation to a world that is quite different than the one we have \nhad--particularly against asymmetric threats.\n  I am concerned that we may not have enough money in this budget for \nsmart weapons of all kinds--the kinds we saw in Kosovo that could go in \nthe window of a building. We need an adequate supply of those weapons, \nbut the new funding--the $20 billion we approved--should be able to \nfill those needs. But we have to watch to make sure we have a \nsufficient supply of those. I don't think we have been operating at the \nlevel we should. We are closer to minimum sustaining rates for \nproduction of those kinds of weapons; whereas, we could get the weapons \ncheaper if we increase the production level.\n  I thank Chairman Levin for his leadership and dedication, and I \nparticularly thank Senator Warner, the ranking member, whose advice and \nwisdom I have called on frequently and value highly.\n\n  I believe we have a bill here that is good. But we remain challenged \nas a nation. Our challenge remains that we have to consider how much \nmore we are going to need for defense, because this remains a dangerous \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama. He is a tireless worker on our committee and a \ngreat watchdog of the taxpayers' dollars. I especially thank him for \nhis reference to the work done by the full committee, and indeed others \nsubsequent thereto, to resolve such issues as we had during the course \nof the markup on the missile defense system. He has been a keen \nobserver and a strong contributor to America's ability to prepare \nitself against a limited attack. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1622\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] for himself, Mr. \n     Lott, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Ms. Collins, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Smith of New \n     Hampshire, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Conrad, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Stevens, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1622.\n\n (Purpose: To strike title XXIX, relating to defense base closure and \n                              realignment)\n\n       Strike title XXIX, relating to defense base closure and \n     realignment.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the full committee for giving me\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\nan opportunity to offer this amendment on behalf of 20 cosponsors. This \namendment is a straightforward amendment.\n  The underlying bill authorizes a base closure realignment in the year \n2003. This amendment simply strikes that language, that provision.\n  There are a number of good reasons why we should not move ahead with \nanother BRAC at this time. Most important, there has always been the \nuncertainty as to whether or not previous rounds of BRAC have actually \nsaved the military and the taxpayers any money. This has always been my \nmain concern with proposals for future BRACs.\n  I will go further into this aspect in a moment, but right now I, and \nmany others, have a bigger concern with future BRAC rounds, and it \nunfortunately stems from the awful terrorist attacks on September 11. \nNow more than ever, we should hold off further downsizing of our \nmilitary infrastructure as we analyze how to fight the first war of the \n21st century.\n  Last week, President Bush laid it all out for us. We are gearing up \nfor war. It will be a different kind of war and different from any \nbattles this Nation has ever fought. Its future is unknown. The course \nof the conflict is uncharted. The strengths we will use and need are \nunforeseen.\n  The President has warned us that victory is not going to come quickly \nand it is not going to come without pain. There will be casualties, and \nour will and resources will be tested, probably for many years to come.\n  The fight will require force. It may require more and a different \nkind of training at our military posts and bases. This war may change \nfrom the United States battling only terrorist organizations to the \nUnited States battling armies of nations harboring terrorists.\n  Because of this uncertainty, it is unwise to begin hacking away at \nour military infrastructure. I am not here to chant gloom and doom. I \nknow in the end we are going to triumph over evil, but at this point in \ntime, we have to ask a fundamental question: Is now the time to cut \nbases and to reduce our military infrastructure? The answer is a clear \nand resounding no.\n  President Bush said recently the course of this conflict is unknown. \nIf this course is unknown, then it must be unwise to move ahead with \nanother BRAC round until we have a clearer picture of where we are \ngoing and how we are going to get there. Now is not the time to further \nauthorize the reduction of our military infrastructure.\n  More than ever, we must focus on security and how to maximize our \nresources. We should not leap before we are even able to look. We are \nventuring into the unknown and attempting to survey the landscape of \n21st century warfare. We should not go blindly or with one hand tied \nbehind our back in the name of so-called efficiency and cost savings.\n  During markup of this bill, the Readiness Subcommittee heard from our \nprofessional staff on the BRAC issue. They were unable to pinpoint any \ndefinitive cost savings from the prior BRAC rounds. In fact, they could \nnot provide any firm details because DOD could not provide them \ndefinitive numbers from previous BRAC rounds.\n  We have heard talk about so-called savings numbers from DOD here and \nthere, but when the rubber hits the road, DOD is unable to provide \nthese savings with cold, hard numbers.\n  I and many others have asked the Department of Defense many times to \nprovide detailed data showing savings from previous BRAC rounds. If it \nis there, we should definitely take a look at it, but until we see real \nnumbers, supporting another BRAC is only a shot in the dark.\n\n  CRS, CBO, and GAO have all been asked to find real savings, and they \nalso have had a tough time finding consistent and detailed savings \nnumbers. They quote DOD projections and predictions as their source, \nbut they admit that DOD has been unable to document any detailed \nunderlying savings.\n  We all support efficiency in not only our military but throughout the \nFederal Government. But after the attacks of September 11, the \nlandscape for me and others has changed from one of efficiency to one \nof security. In these turbulent times, we need serious numbers before \nwe can even contemplate another BRAC, let alone approve it.\n  In conclusion, it seems to me at this point that it would be foolish \nand dangerous to go ahead with another BRAC. When you boil it down, it \nis pretty simple: We are entering a new type of conflict in which we \nare not sure what resources are going to be needed. So how can we take \na chance on eliminating resources that may be vital to our struggle \nagainst terrorism? In fact, last week, the House of Representatives \nwithdrew a BRAC amendment to their fiscal year DOD authorization bill. \nIt is clear that support in the House for another BRAC round evaporated \nafter the attacks of September 11.\n  If the Senate bill includes another BRAC round, this could make for a \ncontentious issue in conference, and now is not the time for prolonged \ncontentious debate.\n  I ask my colleagues' support for this amendment. In light of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, we need to act prudently and carefully. \nAuthorizing another BRAC round is neither. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I want to read from Secretary Rumsfeld's letter of September 21. I \nwant to read a portion of it because it says in the third paragraph: \n``While our further future needs as to base closure are uncertain and \nare strategically dependent,'' he says we must simply go ahead and do \nit. I firmly and strongly disagree with Secretary Rumsfeld. If base \nclosures are uncertain and strategically dependent, then now is not the \ntime when we are planning for a full, all-out war against terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nKentucky for his remarks. He is a very valuable member of our \ncommittee, and he straightforwardly told us from the very first he \nwould be in opposition to the BRAC procedure. The opposition he \nindicated preceded indeed the crisis we now face as a consequence of \nthe tragedies of September 11.\n  I nevertheless have decided to continue to support the action of the \ncommittee, and I will recite my reasons for doing so in the course of \nthe next few minutes. I will address one point my colleague made so it \nis fresh in the minds of those Senators and others following this \nimportant debate. He read from a letter, and I shall put the letter in \nthe Record. It is addressed to me from the Secretary of Defense and I \nwill read it in its entirety momentarily. But he quoted:\n\n       While our future needs as to base structure are uncertain \n     and are strategy dependent, we must simply have the freedom \n     to maximize the efficient use of our resources.\n\n  Freedom, in a sense, goes directly to what the bill says. The bill \nvery carefully and simply puts in place, in the hands of the Secretary \nof Defense, the authority to go forward with such legislation if he \ndeems it necessary at some future date. So the Senate will be asked to \nmake a decision of deleting this provision or sustaining the committee \nreport and bill and thereby just putting in place the authority for the \nSecretary to do the following: If the President does not transmit to \nCongress the nomination for appointment to the commission on or before \nthe date specified for 1993 in clause 2 of subparagraph B, for 1995 in \nclause 3 of that paragraph, or for 2003 in section 4, the process by \nwhich the military installations may be selected for closure \nrealignment under this part with respect to that year shall be \nterminated.\n  So what we are doing, in a sense, putting aside all of that technical \nlanguage, is simply giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to \nproceed. I supported it in the committee, and I support it now.\n  I say to my good friend, after discussion with him and others, I \nthought as to whether or not we should proceed to put in place on a \nstandby basis the authority. I reflected on the many rounds of base \nclosures in which I have had personal experience. As a matter of fact, \nI was the author of the legislation involving several previous BRAC \nrounds. Going as far back as when I was privileged to serve in the \nDepartment of Defense, in those days a service secretary could initiate \nthe BRAC procedures and did so and closed such\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\nmajor installations as the Boston naval shipyard. That was, I believe, \nin the 1971-1972 timeframe. So I have had a long familiarity with the \nBRAC procedures, the goals of BRAC, and I reflected on whether or not I \nwould support the BRAC when this bill came to the floor, and I do so.\n  My concern was much along the lines of our distinguished colleague \nfrom Kentucky. America is experiencing a callup of the Reserve and \nGuard units. America sees our Nation faced with a great many \nuncertainties and challenges never before faced, the complexity of the \nforeign policy considerations and the security considerations flowing \nfrom the tragic events of September 11, without parallel in our \nhistory. So why should we at this point in time critical to our \nnational defense and that to help our allies and friends be faced with \na BRAC round?\n  I long ago made the decision, before we took it up in committee, we \nwould not have 2 years; we would only have the one, and I told that to \nthe Secretary of Defense, and indeed when they came before the Congress \nthey had selected the single year because BRAC brings upon a community \na tremendous amount of unsettling factors, particularly in the towns \nand cities where we have the military bases. It is home for so many of \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces and civilian workers. It is an \nunsettling thing from their economic standpoint. They are planning for \nthe future and for business, and to have this hanging over their head \nis a difficult situation.\n\n  Most communities will go out and expend a considerable sum of money \nto hire experts who have been through the complicated procedures that \nBRAC thrusts upon the communities to assist them in stating their \nclaim, as they have a right under the law for continuing to have those \nmilitary facilities open and not have them the subject of a possible \nfuture closure by a base closure commission.\n  Having thought all through that, I personally talked to the Secretary \nof Defense and I reiterated these arguments to him. I think it was not \nmore than a day or two after September 11, because I have had an \nopportunity to visit with him on a number of occasions--and Deputy \nSecretary Wolfowitz--and I laid before them the fact we are calling up \npeople, we are augmenting our forces, there is uncertainty, and the \nlast thing we need is instability in those communities which provide a \nhome for the men and women of the military.\n  So I said I would like to have you send a letter to me, if it is your \ndesire that the Senate proceed to ask for a vote in favor of the bill \nas now written, and he wrote me on September 21.\n  I will read it because it is very important.\n\n       Dear Senator Warner: I write to underscore the importance \n     we place on the Senate's approval of authority for a single \n     round of base closures and realignments. Indeed, in the wake \n     of the terrible events of September 11, the imperative to \n     convert excess capacity into warfighting ability is enhanced, \n     not diminished. Since that fateful day, the Congress has \n     provided additional billions of taxpayers' funds to the \n     department. We owe it to all Americans, particularly those \n     service members on whom much of our responsibility depends, \n     to seek every efficiency in the application of those funds on \n     behalf of our warfighters.\n       Our installations are the platform from which we will \n     deploy the forces needed for the sustained campaign the \n     President outlined last night. While our future needs as to \n     the base structures are uncertain and are strategy dependent, \n     we simply must have the freedom to maximize the efficient use \n     of our resources. The authority to realign and close bases \n     and facilities will be a critical element of ensuring the \n     right mix of bases and forces within our warfighting \n     strategy. No one relishes the prospect of closing a military \n     facility or even seeking the authority to do so, but as the \n     President said last evening, `We face new and sudden national \n     challenges,' and those challenges will force us to confront \n     many difficult choices. In that spirit, I am hopeful that \n     Congress will approve our request for authority to close and \n     realign our military base facilities. Thank you for the \n     opportunity to provide our views in this important matter.\n\n  Other Senators are anxious to address this matter, and I may reenter \nthe debate subsequently before we proceed to a vote, but I assure the \nSenate this Senator deliberated long and carefully as to whether or not \nI would continue my support. I have given the request by the Secretary \nsimply to put in place the necessary authorization to proceed. If it is \nhis judgment and that of the President to do so some months ahead, then \nI think it is important we do proceed because we have an obligation to \nthe American taxpayers that those dollars that are authorized and \nappropriated for the Department of Defense be spent very wisely.\n\n  Subsequently, I or others will address the question of savings, but \nmy calculation is, the 152 major closures and realignments resulting \nfrom the BRAC procedures of 1988 through 1995 will save the Department \n$14.5 billion by 2001--that fiscal year is about to end--and $5.7 \nbillion every year thereafter. There is additional information on the \nsavings which will be placed into the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I speak to the pending amendment, \nI want to commend the two leaders of our committee. I joined this \ncommittee in January, and they have worked very hard in the last week \nto come up with a bill that would unify this body. So I want to commend \nboth Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their tremendous efforts in \nproducing a bill that will help bring us together and ensure we are \nproviding the resources and the authority for the important task before \nus. I praise them and thank them for their efforts.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Kentucky for his amendment. I rise in \nstrong opposition to the provisions in our bill known as the base \nrealignment and closure, or BRAC, proposal. I opposed this proposal in \ncommittee, and I continue to oppose it today. In fact, I think the \nreasons for opposition are even more compelling than they were at the \ntime of our committee markup. After the September 11 attacks on \nAmerica, I question, with even more certainty, the decision to proceed \nwith additional cuts in our base infrastructure.\n  As the result of the first 4 BRAC rounds, 97 military bases in the \nUnited States have been or are in the process of being closed, \ndegrading our defense readiness according to some military experts.\n  In light of the recent terrorist attacks on our homeland, and based \non the testimony provided by the Chief of Naval Operations before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee when Admiral Clark recently cautioned \nthat the Navy's infrastructure is already at barebones, now is simply \nnot the time, it is simply not in our country's best interests, to \ninitiate yet another round of base closures.\n  At a time when our Commander in Chief has warned of a long and \nsustained military operation, we should be preserving, not eroding, our \nfacilities and infrastructure, so that they are fully available for our \nArmed Forces both at home and abroad. It is the responsibility of this \nCongress to ensure that these installations are not placed at risk \nwithout careful, prudent consideration of the additional military \nrequirements, particularly with regard to homeland defense, that are \nevolving as a result of the recent horrific attacks on our Nation. It \nis also clear that our ongoing peacekeeping and humanitarian missions \nrequire a greater force structure than had been expected. Our war on \nterrorism will most likely require a greater one still. In short, it is \ndifficult to conceive of a worse time for the Pentagon to divert its \nenergies to another round of base closures.\n  Before we legislate a defense-wide policy that will reduce the size \nand number of training areas critical to our force readiness, the \nDepartment of Defense needs time to complete its comprehensive plan \nidentifying the operational and maintenance infrastructure required to \nsupport national security requirements, particularly in light of the \nchallenge to come. Before we know what to cut, we need to know what to \nkeep. It is that simple. I fear we are approaching the issue of excess \ncapacity exactly backwards. As Secretary Rumsfeld acknowledged in his \nrecent letter to the committee, our future needs as to base structure \nare uncertain and our strategy dependent.\n  I make it clear I understand the Secretary still wants to proceed \nwith base closures, but his own letter says very clearly that our \nfuture needs as to base structure are uncertain. Shouldn't we determine \nwhat our infrastructure needs are before embarking on a whole\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\nnew round of closing bases? Wouldn't that be the better, more logical \nway to proceed?\n  Further, while those who support BRAC hope for substantial savings \nfrom base closures, the one consequence you can count on when a base is \nclosed is the need for a significant upfront investment.\n  A recent GAO report released in July of this year underscores how \ncostly base closures can be and how ephemeral the savings estimates may \nbe. The loose estimates of supposed savings, for example, exclude over \n$1.2 billion in costs of Federal assistance provided to affected \ncommunities. These are costs paid by the Federal Government but not out \nof the BRAC budget accounts. Some $10.4 billion in environmental \ncleanup costs were the direct result of the first four BRAC rounds. We \nought to be doing a better job of environmental cleanup at our bases, \nwhether they are open or closed. However, we can't ignore these \nsignificant costs. These are considerable costs which only continue to \ngrow, often not counted, as costs associated with closing bases.\n\n  There is another more fundamental reason I oppose the BRAC language \nin this bill. Simply stated, BRAC is the wrong process for identifying \nbases for closure. If the Pentagon believes certain bases are no longer \nneeded, those installations should be identified and included in DOD's \nbudget submission. There is no need to cast a cloud of uncertainty over \nevery base in virtually every community hosting a base all across this \ngreat Nation.\n  Senator Snowe and I can testify personally that BRAC is not the \nclinical, impartial process it is often made out to be. Rather, the \nBRAC process in the past has been highly politicized and it remains \nsusceptible to political pressure in its current form in this bill. \nWhile I recognize the need to reduce proven excess capacity, the BRAC \nprocedure has been unfair in the past. It has not produced the savings \nanticipated by past rounds of closures, and it could at a critical time \nresult in degraded readiness for our Armed Forces.\n  I will continue, therefore, to voice my strong opposition to another \nround of base closures. I will continue to work to ensure that critical \nassets and training capacities provided by our existing force structure \nand infrastructure are not lost.\n  Now is certainly not the time to create chaos, concern, in every \ncommunity that has proudly hosted a military installation. Now is \ncertainly not the time to embark on another round of base closures, \nwhen all of the energies of our civilian and military leaders must be \nfocused on the overriding goal of crushing the global network of \nterrorists intent on harming our great Nation and its citizens.\n  I urge support for the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I intend to speak at greater length later on on this \nissue. It is very clear, the opinion of Members of this body, including \nthose just articulated by the Senator from Maine who, among other \nthings, said there has been no savings, when we have ample \ndocumentation that they have achieved net savings of $15 billion by the \nend of this fiscal year from the previous base closure rounds, with \nanother $6 billion in savings each and every year thereafter.\n  What we are really talking about is an opinion held in the Senate, \nwhich I respect, for which I have admiration, and I have great respect \nfor the individuals who are opposing the base closing round. The fact \nis, at a time when we rally around the President of the United States \nand the Secretary of Defense and the men and women in the armed \nservices, we are going in direct contravention to the views of the \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and our \nmilitary and civilian leadership. It is that clear.\n  That is really what this debate is all about.\n  As the Secretary of Defense wrote on September 21, to Senator Carl \nLevin and Senator John Warner: \n\n       We owe it to all Americans--particularly those service \n     members on whom much of our response will depend--to seek \n     every efficiency in the application of those funds on behalf \n     of our warfighters.\n       Our installations are the platforms from which we will \n     deploy the forces needed for the sustained campaign the \n     President outlined last night. While our future needs as to \n     base structure are uncertain and are strategy dependent, we \n     simply must have the freedom to maximize the efficient use of \n     our resources.\n\n  Why is that? Earlier this year there was testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee by the people who are responsible for our \ninstallations. Do you know what they are saying?\n  ``We are in a slow death spiral,'' said Air Force MG Earnest Robbins \nII, the civil engineer for his service, who predicted the 2002 defense \nbudget will include enough money only to handle the most pressing \npriorities.\n  The services have argued that the poor conditions of many facilities \nand the shortage of money to fix them are proof they must close \nunneeded bases.\n  What is going on here is, because we have so many bases, we don't \nhave the funds to maintain not only their capabilities but the quality \nof life. The quality of life deteriorates when we do not maintain these \nfacilities. Therefore, there is a requirement to close the unnecessary \nones.\n  By the way, we will get into this argument about how you do it and \nwhether it is politicized. I will submit for the Record and discuss, \nover time, clearly the fact that there is no other way to close bases. \nWe went for many years until we came up with the Base Closing \nCommission.\n  But if you go out to any military facility, you will see that people \nhave aging, not only installations at which they work but aging \ninstallations in which they live. It is because we simply have not \nenough money to go around to maintain all of these facilities.\n  So what does that translate into? Difficulties in recruiting, \ndifficulties in retention. According to a study last year, the U.S. \nArmy has had the greatest exodus of captains they have had in their \nhistory. What do they say? They say they do not put us in conditions in \nwhich we can live. We have men and women in the military living in \nbarracks that were constructed in World War II and Korea.\n  An example of the problems, Robbins said, is at Travis Air Force \nBase, where routine operations on one runway had to be suspended \nbecause a 90-foot-long, 4- to 6-inch-wide crack has appeared.\n  The Navy has a $2.6 billion backlog in critically needed repairs, \nabout the same as a year ago, because the budget did not include enough \nmoney to make up any ground, officials said. Navy people ``are so used \nto operating and living in inadequate facilities that many accept this \nas the norm.''\n  Should we be asking men and women in the military to be living in \ninadequate facilities and accepting it as the norm?\n  The carrier berth at Norfolk Naval Air Station is a prime example. \nStructural deterioration of the berth has forced access restrictions \nthat allow only emergency vehicles to park near the ships.\n  Marine COL Michael Lehnert, assistant deputy commandant \nfor installations and logistics, says his service does not even have \nenough money to assess problems at its bases.\n\n  Assess problems at its bases?\n\n       We are doing the right thing; we just aren't doing it fast \n     enough.\n\n  At Camp Pendleton, the base sewer system, which spilled 3 million \ngallons of sewage into the Santa Margarita River last year, needs to be \nreplaced. But that would cost $179 million--more than the entire $173 \nmillion construction budget proposed by the Marine Corps for 2002.\n  ``The effects of underfunding only get worse as our facilities age,'' \nArmy MG Robert Van Antwerp, Jr. said. He noted that the backlog has \ngrown to $18.4 billion, a $600 million increase in 1 year.\n  We are asking these men and women to live and work in facilities that \nare, at best, substandard, in some cases absolutely abysmal, because we \nhave too many of them. We have too many of them.\n  I will challenge the proponents of this amendment to find one \nmilitary expert, active-duty or retired, who would not say we need to \nclose unnecessary bases. I would like for the Senator from Maine to \ntalk to GEN Schwarzkopf. He is a fairly well respected individual. I \nwould like for her to hear all the former Chairmen of the Joints Chiefs \nof Staff. I would like for her to hear from all the experts on\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\nmilitary readiness. All these people unanimously, without exception, \nwill say we have too many bases and we need to reduce those numbers of \nbases so we can be more efficient, but also we can take the limited \nassets that we have and put them into the bases that remain so the \npeople there would have a lifestyle, both operationally and \nrecreationally, and living-wise, that would give them the standard of \nliving of most Americans outside the military.\n  That is all we are asking. The President of the United States needs \nthe flexibility to be able to do that. I know the President feels \nstrongly about this. I know the Secretary of Defense feels strongly \nabout it. I know how the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff feels \nabout it. But do you know who feels most strongly about it? The \nsquadron commanders and base commanders at these installations where \nthey see their men and women subjected to a lifestyle that is not \nsatisfactory. It is not satisfactory. They know it, I know it, and \neverybody else knows it.\n  I believe if we take this base closing amendment out of this bill, we \nwill send a signal, my friends, and the signal is: It is business as \nusual in the U.S. Congress. It is business as usual. We are not \nprepared to make the necessary sacrifices--even if it affects our \nState; a base closing commission can clearly affect my State--that are \nnecessary to fight this war on terrorism.\n  The opening signal is business as usual, my friends. We will not even \napprove giving the Secretary of Defense the authority, through a base \nclosing commission which, with one exception, has been an apolitical \nprocess.\n  I admit there were some politics around the base closing. We have \nfixed this. Senator Levin and I have fixed this with this amendment so \nthat is not possible again. If anybody believes there can be any other \nprocess to eliminate these bases, then obviously the history of how we \ntried to do this in the past shows it doesn't work.\n  So I say this is a very important vote. It is even more important \nthan whether we are going to have a base closing commission. This vote \nis really all about whether we are going to do business as usual and \npreserve our bases in our States, whether they are necessary or not, or \nwhether we are going to have another commission so we can have the most \nefficient military machine to fight this long, protracted struggle, the \nopening salvo of which was fired on Tuesday, September 11. This is a \nvery important vote.\n  I am glad to see the Secretary of Defense has made such a very strong \nstatement, a very strong statement in support of this base closing \ncommission. I hope the Members of this body will pay close attention to \nthe views of the uniformed and civilian leadership of the U.S. \nmilitary, including the President of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to support the language in this \nlegislation that would authorize another round of base closings. I do \nso, as we all do, knowing full well there are perhaps facilities in my \nhome State that might be considered. I am confident and hopeful that, \nbecause of their critical role, they will continue to be vital parts of \nthe Department of Defense. But every Senator is a bit nervous when we \nauthorize a round of base closings.\n  Simply stated, we have too many facilities. We have a cold-war base \nstructure. We have a post-cold-war Department of Defense. We have to \nreconcile the two.\n  I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Arizona. The \nbottom line here, the effect that is most obvious from too many bases, \nis the deteriorating quality of life of the troops who serve in our \nArmed Forces.\n  I spent 12 years in the U.S. Army, from 1967 to 1979. There were \nfacilities back then, in the 1970s, which the Army desired to close. \nSome are still open. There were facilities back then that were \ninadequate or barely adequate. They remain on the books of the \nArmy. Troops are using them for their barracks. Family housing is being \nused.\n\n  Base closure is just common sense. When you have the demands of \ntraining, operational readiness, integrating new equipment, and then \nfamily housing, troop housing, and community facilities on Army posts \nand Navy bases or an Air Force base, something has to give. What \ntypically gives are those quality-of-life items: The community center, \nthe child care center, the library, family housing, and troop housing.\n  That is multiplied and amplified when you have just too many bases.\n  About 3 weeks ago, I traveled to Fort Bragg, NC, to watch the 82nd \nAirborne Division conduct live fire exercise for their division \nreadiness brigade. Those soldiers are today on orders and on alert to \ngo out and be the tip of the spear. I talked to the brigade commander, \nthe division commander, the battalion commander, and the troops. The \none thing they said is they are proud to be in this division, and that \none of the reasons they are is because the commanding officer, the \ndivision commander, and battalion commander--all the way down--put the \nmoney and emphasis on training. They are ready to go. They are well \ntrained. But what they can't do is put sufficient resources to all the \nneeds they have on the post.\n  I must say that Bragg is one of the primary posts in the Army it does \nquite well. They are getting ready to conduct massive reconstruction of \nfamily housing. They are reconstructing barracks. But they cannot do as \nmuch as they want.\n  When you go away from those major division posts, such as Fort Bragg, \nFort Campbell, and other posts around the country and go out to other \nposts that do not have quite that high of a priority, the crisis is \neven more severe. It is then manifested, as Senator McCain indicated, \nin retention problems and in recruiting problems. It is manifested in \nquality of life which is not commensurate with the sacrifices these \nyoung men and women make for their country and will make even more \ndramatically in the days ahead.\n  This base closing round is supported by the President, the Secretary \nof Defense, by the Joint Chiefs, and by service chiefs because they \nknow they can't continue to operate efficiently and effectively if they \nhave facilities they do not need but have to keep barely open. It \ndrains resources from the quality-of-life of troops, and also from the \nability of this military force, which is the best in the world, to \nmaintain its razor edge of readiness, training, and operational \ncapability.\n  The DOD estimates that we are maintaining 23-percent excess capacity \nof infrastructure. That is obvious because after the end of the cold \nwar we reduced our force structure 36 percent.\n  There are those arguing based upon the tragic and horrific events of \nSeptember 11 that we need to keep these bases open. Some of those bases \nwere built at the beginning of the First World War. But substantially \nthe infrastructure was built in the Second World War when we were \nfighting huge national armies in two theaters. We were drafting \nhundreds of thousands of men. We were training them. We were preparing \nto conduct operations with armies and corps.\n  The operation we face going forward will involve our military forces \nbut most likely special operations troops--specially tailored brigades \nof Army and Marines. We will not be engaged, mercifully, thankfully in \na tank-to-tank army battle with hundreds of thousands of troops on each \nside. We don't have that force structure today. But we have \nthat infrastructure today.\n\n  If we want to be efficient and effective, we have to reconcile our \ninfrastructure with our force structure. We are not going to fight \nWorld War II again--I hope. We are not going to fight the cold war \nagain--I hope. But we have serious threats before us. Those threats \nrequire a faster, leaner military. Part of that efficient, leaner \nmilitary is allowing the services to make judicial judgments about what \nreal estate they need.\n  Yes, we have an imperfect structure in terms of base closing \nconditions. Nothing is perfect. But there are closed bases that some \npeople thought would never be closed in our lifetime, or several \nlifetimes. So it has worked.\n  There are other arguments that no savings have been realized. As the \nSenator from Arizona pointed out, between $15 billion and $16 billion \nwill have been realized by the end of fiscal year\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\n2001 on these base closures. It is projected going forward that we will \naccrue an annual savings of approximately $6.2 billion. That is real \nmoney that goes back into the bottom line of the Department of Defense \nfor improved barracks, improved family housing, improved readiness, \nimproved technology, a better fighting force.\n  There are some who argue that we can't do this because there is just \ntoo many environmental flaws; that it turns out to be just a big \nenvironmental remediation project. Those environmental costs are not \navoidable. It is mandated by law that the DOD, like everyone else, is \nresponsible for serious environmental degradation. They have to pay for \nit. They are doing it right now on posts that are open and operating. \nIt is not something you can throw into the mix and say don't close the \nbase because of environmental costs. You have environmental costs for \nopen bases. They have to be faced, addressed, and paid for.\n  For many reasons, I believe we have to follow through on the base \nclosing language in this legislation. I think it is time to give the \nDepartment of Defense the flexibility to tailor their resources, to \ntailor their infrastructure, and to fit the mission that faces us \ntoday.\n  We have the best military force in the world. We will see them in \naction shortly. I think we owe them our vote to sustain their base \nclosing round as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am compelled to rise today in opposition \nto the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky and to join with \nthe Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Arizona and others \nwho have spoken eloquently and effectively on this point.\n  For 23 years of my life, I was not a Senator but was a naval flight \nofficer, and I served as commission commander of Navy aircraft.\n  We saw a lot in the news earlier this year about this. I have been \nstationed on bases that did not get much support. As the Senator from \nRhode Island suggested, it is not an enviable position to be in--either \nprofessionally in terms of supporting your mission, your aircraft, or \nwhatever weapons systems with which you operate. And it is not an \nespecially satisfying position to be in for the families of those who \nare assigned to those bases because you don't get the kind of support \nfor your child care development centers, and you don't get the kind of \nsupport for your family-related activities on those bases.\n  Several people rose today to say there are cost savings that flow out \nof base realignment and closures. Just take the figures that were \nestimated by the previous two speakers: Savings of $15 billion to $16 \nbillion by 2001, and annual savings going forward of about $6 billion \nper year. Let's say those figures are not right. Let's say they \noverstate by half the amount of money that has been saved and will be \nsaved. It was suggested that we have already saved anywhere between \n$7.5 billion to $8 billion, and that going forward we might expect to \nsave another $3 billion each year.\n  What would we do with that money? There are plenty of things to spend \nit on in this Defense authorization bill. I will just mention a few of \nthem: Fighter aircraft that we are anxious to build; military airlift \ncapability; cargo aircraft--either anxious to build or upgrade and \nimprove--helicopters that need to be replaced, and ships.\n  Earlier we heard from the Senator from Alabama that 315 Navy ships \ncontinue to diminish. We need to build ships to replace those that are \nbeing decommissioned. We need to build submarines as well.\n  The President and others support the idea of developing and deploying \na national missile defense system which will cost tens of billions of \ndollars. But even if we set aside those weapons systems and simply \nconsider the aircraft and the ships that stay on the ground, with the \nhelicopters that stay on the ground that are used just for \ncannibalization--we steal their spare parts to keep other ships and \nother aircraft and other helicopters flying, the ships that aren't \ngoing to sea simply because they lack the spare parts that enable them \nto carry out their missions.\n  It has been suggested that in the wake of the tragedies in the last 2 \nweeks--the terrorist attacks in New York and Virginia--somehow keeping \nmilitary bases that are unutilized or underutilized open will enable us \nto be more vigilant against our enemies. I just do not see it. I just \ndo not see it that way.\n  The language in the legislation before us today does not mandate the \nestablishment of a base realignment commission. It provides the \ndiscretion to the President and to our Secretary of Defense, if they \nsee fit, to appoint the members to serve on a commission. As Senator \nMcCain has suggested, the language in this legislation is crafted in a \nway to take the politics out of whatever might be done with respect to \nbase realignment.\n  If the President and if the Secretary of Defense elected to use the \ndiscretion provided for them in this legislation, they would ultimately \nestablish the commission, and that commission would ultimately come \nback to us in this body and in the House of Representatives in order to \nhave the final say, the final word, as to whether or not the bases \nrecommended for closure be closed. We have the final word.\n  I believe it is prudent for us, in a day and age when we do have \nsubstantial needs for additional weapons systems--upgraded weapons \nsystems, and to make the ones we already have workable--to look for \nsome opportunities to save not just a few dollars but a substantial \nnumber of dollars. The potential in this bill, with this approach, is \nvery real.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nlanguage the committee has reported out, and also to support our \nPresident and our Secretary of Defense, as well as our military \nleaders, who have sought just this kind of authorization.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from North Carolina allow me to propound a \nunanimous consent request without you losing your right to the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no idea what the Senator from North Carolina would \nsay, but the Senator from North Dakota would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I am so sorry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They both start with ``North.''\n  Mr. REID. That is why they should change the name to ``Dakota.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I am going to propound a \nunanimous consent request. We have been talking now for a couple days \nabout having a final cutoff time for amendments, telling Senators that \nthey have to give both Cloakrooms amendments so we know how many. We \nneed a finite list of amendments. We have been going back and forth on \nthis. We want to move this along. This is the country's bill. The \nPresident is very interested in getting this passed as quickly as \npossible. Unless we work out something on these amendments, we will \nnever finish this bill. So this is the purpose of this unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list I will send to the desk be the \nonly first-degree amendments remaining in order to S. 1438, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill; that these amendments be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments; that upon disposition of \nall amendments the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I object, Mr. President. I might explain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I understand there are a couple Members yet on our side \nwho are still working on it. I am not sure whether we have those issues \nresolved or not. As soon as Senator Warner returns to this Chamber, we \nmight be able to get a final agreement on that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say we are losing ground. A little \nwhile ago we only had one Member who was concerned; now we have two. \nThis has been going on literally all this day. I repeat, I certainly \nunderstand the point by my friend from Colorado, but the fact is, we \nneed to move this legislation. This does not prevent anyone from \noffering an amendment. They can offer amendments to their heart's \ncontent. But we\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\nneed a list of finite amendments so the managers can work on these \namendments to move this legislation forward.\n  I think it is really too bad that we can't get a final list of these \namendments. Senator Warner and Senator Levin have worked very hard on \nthis legislation. It is important--I repeat--to this institution and to \nthe country to get this legislation passed.\n  So I am very disappointed we were not able to do this. I hope we can \ndo it at some subsequent time. And I hope that subsequent time is not \nfar in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, \nTuesday, September 25, following the usual opening activities, the \nSenate resume consideration of S. 1438, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill; that there be 15 minutes remaining for debate prior \nto a motion to table the Bunning amendment, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form, provided no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  I would say, before I put this to the Chair in final form, that the \nmanagers of the bill are being very gracious in doing this. People \ntonight can debate this amendment as long as they wish. Either manager, \nor any anyone else, of course, could move to table at any time. So I \nthink this is certainly generous on behalf of the two managers. People \nwould have all night tonight to debate. We would come in tomorrow \nmorning and have a vote on a motion to table. So I propound this \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I again----\n  Mr. BUNNING. May I state my objection?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I really have not had a chance to talk to the minority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. OK.\n  Mr. BUNNING. As soon as I speak with him, I will get back to you.\n  Mr. REID. I express my appreciation to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with an issue that is \nnot new to any of us. We have long debated the issue of base closures \nand the establishment of a BRAC commission for the purpose of base \nclosures. In fact, we have had previous base closure rounds in 1988, \n1991, 1993, and 1995. In those rounds, 451 installations, including 97 \nmajor installations, were ordered closed or realigned by the year 2001. \nAnd the last two big installations, Kelly and McClellan Air Force \nBases, were closed this past summer.\n  Now even though most of those installations have been closed or \nrealigned, only 41 percent of the unneeded base property has, in fact, \nbeen transferred. From all of those base closures, over all of that \nperiod of time, only 41 percent of the unneeded base property has been \ntransferred.\n  It takes years to dispose of this property. And, principally, the \nreason for that is the strict environmental cleanup standards which are \nvery costly and very expensive. In fact, I find it interesting, \naccording to pages 118 and 119 of the Department of Defense's 1998 \nReport on Base Realignment and Closure, the first several years after a \nbase closure incur additional costs to the government, not savings.\n  For the 1993 BRAC round, a net cost to the Federal Government--not a \nnet savings--a net cost was incurred for the first 3 years beginning in \nthe year 1994.\n  If you take a look at the 1995 BRAC round, you find exactly the same \nthing. The BRAC-related costs exceeded savings by $1.5 billion for five \nyears from fiscal year 1996 to 2000.\n  One might make the case, if you skip over the next 3-5 years you will \nfind some savings from a new round of base closures. Maybe so, although \nlying out there is the disposal of almost 40 percent of all the \nproperty that has not yet been disposed of because of the environmental \ncleanup costs. So one wonders exactly what these savings are. They are \ncertainly not in the next 3-5 years.\n  Those who make the point that there is an urgency to close these \nbases, at a time when we desperately need investment in the Department \nof Defense, are probably going to end up costing the Department of \nDefense additional money through base closures if we, in fact, decide \nto approve another round.\n  I support this amendment to strike the base closure provisions from \nthe underlying bill for two reasons. One is military, and the other is \neconomic. First, the military side of things.\n  We do not know what the force structure is going to be of the \nDepartment of Defense. There is a quadrennial review that is going on, \nbut at this point no one in this Chamber knows what the force structure \nis going to be. If you do not know what the force structure is going to \nbe, how do you know what the base structure should be? How do you know \nwhat kind of facilities for military operations you need if you do not \nknow what kind of military force you are going to have?\n  Will this military force change as a result of the tragedies that \noccurred on September 11? Probably. Will we--when we see now a renewed \nattention to homeland security and homeland defense--will we be more \nconcerned about the issue of bases in this country? Where they are \nlocated? Whether they are strategic in location? Whether they are \nneeded or not needed? Will all that change? I think it will.\n  But the main point is this: If you do not know what your force \nstructure is, how can you be talking about your base structure? Yet the \nDepartment of Defense is already saying our base structure is way out \nof line, even though they don't know their force structure.\n\n  I deeply respect the men and women in uniform. God bless them. I want \nto give them everything they need to do their job in preserving liberty \nand fighting for freedom. But we don't need a new BRAC round to find \nsavings in the Pentagon. We all know there are areas of inefficiency in \nthe Pentagon. I won't go through them. But let me give you one instance \nI have dealt with in the last 6 months, just as an example. I say this \nonly to say that if there are worries about efficiency, let's go find \nwhere money is being wasted hand over foot.\n  We have 5,700 trailers that were manufactured for the U.S. Army. They \nhad a problem with the brake actuator. The result is, they put 5,700 \ntrailers in storage facilities, and they were there for years. It turns \nout in fact, in addition to a brake actuator that didn't work on the \nhitch, the bumpers on the Humvees that were supposed to pull the \ntrailers weren't strong enough. They hooked these things up to the \nHumvee, and it broke the Humvee. You talk about waste. There is a lot \nof waste, a lot of inefficiency. I think we ought to go at that. I \ndon't think it ought to be business as usual with respect to the waste \nof the taxpayers' money.\n  With respect to the question of which bases are important in the \nfuture of this country, which bases might be important with respect to \nhomeland security, I don't think we know the answer to that at this \npoint. We certainly don't know what the force structure is, so how on \nEarth would we know what the base structure should be?\n  Economic circumstances have really changed with respect to this \ncountry's economy. We had a very soft economy prior to the tragedy on \nSeptember 11. That economy has turned more than soft, I am afraid. All \nof us are struggling to try to find ways to see if we can't give some \nlift to the economy.\n  I will tell you how you put a lodestone on the economy, how you put \nan anvil on the economies of literally dozens and dozens of \ncommunities, all across America: Tell the communities tomorrow that we \nare going to have a base closing commission and that every single base \nis at risk, and, therefore, if you are thinking of making an investment \nin a community that has a sizable base, don't do it because it might be \nthis base that will get caught in the next BRAC round and be closed. \nThat message in this particular piece of legislation will say to \npotential investors in literally hundreds of communities across this \ncountry that you ought not make investments in those communities now, \nyou ought to wait.\n  I can't think of a more destructive thing to do to the economy at \nthis point than to send that message to all of those communities and \nall the folks who might invest in them.\n  When you have a wide open BRAC commission like the Administration\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nproposes, every single military installation is at risk. It is as if \nyou are painting a bull's eye on the front gate of every base that \nsays: This might be the one that is selected; this might be the one \nthat is closed. The result is, people will stunt the economic growth of \nthose communities because they feel they must, in order to make good \nprudent investment decisions, they must wait until that BRAC round is \ncomplete.\n  Investors will say: I can't build a 12-plex apartment in this \ncommunity because I don't know whether there will be 20- or 30-percent \nunemployment 2 years from now if that base is ordered closed. From a \nmilitary standpoint and economic standpoint, I think this is a very \ninappropriate and unwise judgment. That is what will happen if we \napprove the base closure provision in this bill.\n\n  The amendment I support simply says, let's strip that provision out.\n  My point remains: How can you realign and create a base structure \nbefore you know what your force structure is? And we don't know that. \nNo one in the Senate, no one in the Congress and, for that matter, no \none in the Pentagon yet understands what our force structure is going \nto be.\n  It might very well be the case--I suspect it will--that following the \ntragedy of September 11, we might have a very different view of the \nbase structure in this country relating to homeland security and \nhomeland defense. If that is the case, it will change the views of \nCongress and the Pentagon about what our missions ought to be and where \nthey ought to be placed. At this point I believe strongly that we ought \nto do the right thing, and the right thing is to take this out of the \nbill. Pass this amendment.\n  My colleague, for whom I have great affection, said that, if we strip \nthis out of the bill, we will be sending a signal that it is business \nas usual in the Congress. It is not that, with due respect. It just is \nnot that. Business as usual is gone, as far as I am concerned. Business \nas usual is thinking the way we used to think. Everyone in this Chamber \nand in the Congress ought to be prepared to think differently about \nthese issues. We have a quadrennial review commission that will \nevaluate force structure. We don't have the foggiest idea what that is \ngoing to be or how that will change as a result of what has happened in \nthe last couple weeks. Yet we are going to go right back to the same \nold cry on the floor of the Senate that we need to unleash a base \nclosing commission that will evaluate whether any and every base in \nthis country shall be a candidate for closure. That makes no sense to \nme.\n  Let me make a couple of additional points. The term they are now \nusing to create a BRAC is ``efficient facilities initiative,'' which as \nan acronym is pronounced ``iffy.'' I really don't like acronyms very \nmuch. This particular one I don't like a lot. ``Iffy'' probably \ndescribes the difficulty, the serious difficulty, virtually every \ncommunity in this country that hosts a military installation will have \nwith respect to its future and the consequences of this Congress \nunleashing another round of base closures.\n  One of my colleagues said: This doesn't really create a round, it \njust authorizes a round. Of course it creates a round. There is no \ndifference between authorization and creating one. If we don't pass \nthis amendment and it strip out the base closure provision, we will \nhave a new round of base closures. And if we have a base closing round, \nI am certain it will have significant consequences on this country's \neconomy, beginning immediately. The minute the Congress enacts \nlegislation and it is signed, every single community in this country \nthat hosts a military installation is going to see its investment \ndeteriorate. It is the worst possible result for this country's \neconomy.\n  Aside from that, as I said, the issue is not just economics, and \nshould not be. The issue is also military. Given the circumstances with \nour new needs in homeland defense and given the fact that we don't know \nwhat the military force structure is going to be, this Congress should \nnot at this point anticipate that the base structure ought to be cut by \ncreating a new BRAC commission. If the new force structure \njustifies cutting base structure, we can consider that again next year, \nsince the base closure round the Administration wants is not applicable \nuntil the year 2003. There would be nothing that would prevent it from \nbeing included in the next year's authorization bill.\n\n  This proposal for a new round of base closures is a terrible idea. I \nhope very much my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I renew now the unanimous consent request \nthe Senator from Nevada had made before. I understand it has now been \ncleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, September 25, \nfollowing the usual opening activities, the Senate resume consideration \nof S. 1438, the Department of Defense authorization bill; that there be \n15 minutes remaining for debate prior to a motion to table the Bunning \namendment, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform, provided no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Reserving the right to object, and I don't plan to \nobject, does that mean there will not be any more votes tonight so \nMembers can clear their schedules?\n  Mr. REID. May I respond to that on behalf of the manager of the bill? \nSenator Daschle has not made a decision on whether or not there will be \nmore votes tonight. We hope there will be the opportunity to offer \nother amendments tonight. If people want to debate this base closing \nissue until the wee hours of the morning, the two managers have no \nconcern about that. But if people have completed their debate tonight \non this issue, we hope that others will offer amendments on other \nmatters. There could be votes. The leader has not made an announcement \non that.\n\n  I think the Senator from Colorado makes a good point, that the leader \nneeds to make a decision on that, and he will in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I join Senator Lott, Senator Bunning, my colleague who \njust spoke, and others, in supporting the amendment to strike section \n29 of the bill. That is the provision in the bill that comes to the \nSenate floor to authorize the Base Realignment and Closure Commission \nthat would be convened 2 years from now.\n  Simply stated, I believe this is the wrong time for us to be \ncommitting our country to this course. It adds greatly to the \nuncertainty that already is substantial in the country. In the context \nof this new threat that we have all come to recognize in stark terms in \nrecent weeks, it strikes me as inconsistent for us to agree to close \nmore military facilities, not knowing precisely what our military needs \nare going to be as we move ahead. We may decide we need to resize the \nmilitary and we may need to reconfigure it in a great many ways.\n  Let me make one other point that I believe is accurate, which I have \nalways thought got too little attention in this discussion; that is, \nthe point that the administration has authority to realign and, in \nfact, even to close bases--or essentially do that--if it determines \nthat is an appropriate course to follow. When they send us their budget \neach year, they can send us proposals to move people from here to there \nand, in fact, they don't need to wait for the next budget cycle or for \nthe next fiscal year to take those actions.\n  I think the reality is that this whole concept of setting up a \ncommission to make these determinations is a way for the administration \nto not have to specify what bases it believes ought to be realigned or \nwhat bases it believes ought to be closed.\n  We had a base closed in my State back in the 1960s. Lyndon Johnson \nwas the President at the time that happened. We didn't have a law on \nthe books that authorized that in this\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nsame way. It was the decision of the President to support the \nrecommendations made to him by the people he chose to review this \nmatter.\n  So I don't really think anyone in this Senate should be under the \nillusion that if we don't pass this provision, the administration is \ntotally hamstrung; they are not. If they feel strongly about this, they \nshould come to the Congress and make their recommendation or take their \naction. If the Department of Defense decides to reduce the number of \nvulnerable overseas bases and facilities--which they may well do in \nlight of this new terrorist threat of which we have all become aware--\nthen that would require that personnel and equipment and their families \nbe brought home, and we may well need the various facilities in this \ncountry to accommodate them at that time. It is another aspect of the \nuncertainty that we face in going forward. Clearly, there are other \naspects of that uncertainty that we also need to take into account.\n  Let me also raise the obvious issue about the impact that closing \nbases and realigning bases has on morale and quality of life for the \npeople in uniform and their families. There is a lot of relocating that \ngoes on when you are in the military. I think we have all observed \nthat, and we see that in our own States. But that relocating is added \nto very substantially when you go through this process of doing a major \nrealignment and closure of a whole raft of bases. So that needs to be \ntaken into account in determining whether this is the right time to be \npursuing this course of action.\n\n  Among those who support setting up a new commission on realignment \nand closure, we hear a lot about savings. They say the reason we are \ndoing this is that this will give us extra money in the defense budget \nto meet these urgent needs. Several Senators have already spoken about \nhow those savings are fairly illusory when you get down to looking at \nthem. The costs of closing bases and realigning bases can be very \nsubstantial. When the Department of Defense was closing bases in the \n1990s, there were expenditures--identifiable expenditures--of over $3 \nbillion during 1994, 1995, and 1996. The Congressional Budget Office \ncited the Department of Defense estimates that an average round of base \nrealignment and closure could average costing more than $2 billion each \nyear during the first 3 years after that process begins.\n  I think what people are not focusing on is that these extra costs--if \nwe approve this provision as it comes to the Senate floor, these extra \ncosts that can be incurred in going forward with this issue are not in \nthe budgets we have been given by the Department of Defense so far. If \nthe Congress approves another round of base realignment and closure, \nthose upfront costs have to come out of some other portion of funds \nthat are identified for the Department of Defense. It could be \nprocurement of weaponry, it could be readiness, and it could be \nresearch and development for improvements in our force structure in the \nfuture. Those choices, which are already hard to make, become even \nharder if we lay these additional billions of dollars of expense on the \ndefense budget. So the upfront cost problem is a very real problem and \nneeds to be taken into account.\n  Supporters of BRAC, as I mentioned before, refer to the billion \ndollars in savings; there will be savings and I recognize that. But \nthey will be a long time in the future. According to the Department of \nDefense estimates, the Department did not begin to show overall net \nsavings for the first four rounds of base realignment and closure until \nat least 10 years after the first round of the base realignment and \nclosure was approved in 1988. So there may be savings, but we need to \nrecognize that those are far in the future, and that for the next \nseveral years there will be additional costs laid on top of the \nmilitary, which they will have to take out of some other activity in \nwhich they are engaged. I believe the timing is wrong for this issue.\n  From a national security standpoint, it does not make sense to me to \ncommit ourselves to reducing our base infrastructure, with all of the \nuncertainty we have about what that base infrastructure ought to be as \nwe move forward. It also doesn't make sense to undertake significant \nnew spending that is not currently in the Department of Defense budget \nwhen future budgets promise to be tighter and our economy clearly is \nmore fragile than we thought it was several months ago. All of this we \nare doing, or proposing to do, in the hope we will have some savings in \nthe far distant future.\n  In my view, that is not an adequate justification for going forward \nwith another base realignment and closure commission. I hope my \ncolleagues will support the amendment Senator Lott and Senator Bunning \nhave put forward on this issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment \nand to support our chairman, Senator Levin, and our ranking member, \nSenator Warner, and to support our Secretary of Defense, Donald \nRumsfeld, who has written a very clear letter to all of us, which \nSenator Warner has already read into the Record, setting forth his \nreasons why we need to consider realignment and closure of some bases.\n  We have close to 400 bases in the United States. With a \nreorganization of the force structure, it is very clearly stated by the \nSecretary of Defense that we don't need all of those bases, and that \nthere would be substantial savings from closing some of them.\n  Now, is any Senator up here going to want any base closed in his or \nher particular State? Of course not.\n  Are all of us, with such a recommendation for closure, going to fight \nlike the dickens to keep that base open in our particular States? Of \ncourse we are. But we are judging a question not within the myopic lens \nof just the interest of our own States but, rather, from the view as \nSenators looking at protection and providing for the common defense of \nthe country.\n  I have heard a number of our colleagues talk about this very sad \ntragedy of September 11 as a justification for not closing bases. It \nseems to me it is a justification for exactly the opposite; that it is \na justification for recognizing that we need to be smart in how we are \ngoing to allocate the funds that are clearly going to be needed for the \ndefense of this country, and that we best utilize and direct those \nfunds in combating this terrible plague that has now beset not only us \nbut the entire world, and that is this plague of terrorism.\n  I wanted to add my voice to perhaps what is an unpopular point of \nview. Indeed, if one of our bases ends up on the closure list, I will \nbe making the pitch, but that is not the question. The question is what \nis in the best interest of the country in the allocation of the dollars \nthat are appropriated for the Department of Defense. If we can save \nsome that can be allocated more to the prosecution of this war against \nterrorism, then, in this Senator's judgment, that is in the best \ninterest of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida. He is a \nman who has served his country in a variety of capacities and \nunderstands the military, the men and women in the military, and the \nneed for this provision.\n  None of us who have a significant number of bases--such as is the \ncase in the State of Florida, as is the case in the State of Arizona--\nthat are very important to the economy of our States enjoy this \nexercise. I respect the views of those who are supporters of the \namendment, including the sponsor himself, who is an experienced \nindividual having served in the House and now in the Senate and has \nbeen involved in these issues of national security.\n  We have an honest difference of opinion. I believe this is a good \ndebate to have. I respect--I repeat, I respect--the views articulated \nby those who are supporters of the amendment. But I do think, as I said \nbefore, this will be a defining vote. The President of the United \nStates has clearly asked for the authority to close unnecessary bases. \nThe Secretary of Defense has spoken in the strongest terms. Our \ncivilian and military leaders of the services have spoken in the \nstrongest terms. Every objective observer recognizes that we need to \nhave a base closing process.\n  There are several arguments that are being made in behalf of the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky. One is we need more studies \nbefore we act.\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\n  Here are some things we already know. We know we have excess \ninfrastructure. An April 1998 report from the Department of Defense on \nbase closure required by the Congress found that the Department still \nmaintains excess capacity that should be eliminated.\n  We know having more facilities to run costs more money, and having \nfewer facilities to run costs less. Excess infrastructure is a drain on \nresources and the military services are struggling. I quoted earlier \nfrom testimony given to the House Armed Services Committee by the \npeople who are responsible for these installations.\n  Some of the conditions at these bases are deplorable. None of us \nwould want to live and work under the conditions which they presently \nhave, and this does have an effect on morale, which then does have an \neffect on retention of good men and women in the military. God knows, \nwe need them now more than any time perhaps since December 7, 1941.\n  We know the Base Closure Commission used to reduce that excess in an \nimpartial way not only works well but is considered a model for others \nto follow. Many times I hear we ought to have a commission on Social \nSecurity along the lines of the Base Closure Commission so Congress can \nvote up or down. It has been a model.\n  We know the military has unmet needs that have higher priority than \npreserving our current base structure. The fact is DOD has excess \nfacilities; that closing bases saves money; that the military has other \npressing needs for those savings, and BRAC is the fairest way we know \nto reduce the excess.\n  I point out, I do not think it is totally fair. As long as you have \nhuman beings making these decisions, it will not be a totally fair \nprocess. There will be some subjectivity, but for me, someone has to \ncome up with a more objective way. The only way I know is crank all the \ninformation into a computer, and I do not think we are quite ready for \nthat process.\n  People keep saying: We don't know if closing bases really saves \nmoney. The Defense Department says they will have achieved a net \nsavings of $15 billion by the end of this fiscal year from the previous \nbase closure rounds, with another $6 billion in savings each and every \nyear thereafter.\n  One of the things that costs money that was not anticipated was the \nenvironmental cleanup costs. We found out that on these bases, \nparticularly those that were built during World War II and before, in \nsome cases there were enormous environmental problems. Those were \nadditional costs associated with closing those facilities.\n  My response to that is, no, we did not anticipate that, but should we \nhave left these environmental problems alone? Shouldn't we have cleaned \nthem up anyway? Were we asking our active duty military men and women \nto work in places that were environmental hazards, perhaps even to \ntheir health? These measures should have been taken while the bases \nwere still open.\n  We do know it saves money. We do know there are environmental costs, \nbut I would argue those environmental steps should be taken on every \nbase in America whether they are open or closed. Why should we expect a \nmilitary base to put up with an environmental situation which is not \nacceptable off the military base? Some people say DOD has not proved \nthat is the right number. This is because the BRAC savings costs you \navoid does not mean the savings are not real. The more bases you have, \nthe more you have to spend. We know that.\n  We have to wait for Secretary Rumsfeld to finish all his strategy \nreviews before we authorize any new base closures. The fact is, we are \nnow undertaking several strategy reviews that may revise DOD's force \nstructure plans and their estimates of what facilities are in excess. \nAuthorizing new base closure rounds now does not preempt these reviews. \nJust the opposite: It will allow Congress to act on them.\n  We are in the process right now and already have spent more money on \ndefense. There will be additional costs for defense because, as the \nPresident so eloquently stated to Congress and the American people, we \nare in a long twilight struggle. But I know of no one who believes we \nwill have to expand the size of the military establishment to fit in \nthese excess costs. I think all of us envision a military that is not \nnecessarily expanded in size but restructured; something we should have \ndone beginning in 1991 at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  This military structure will not necessarily be a larger one. This \nmilitary structure will be one that is equipped to respond to \nemergencies throughout the world, deploy in force, be on the \nbattlefield, effect the outcome, and leave. That is basically the kind \nof military we need to meet the challenges and win the first war of the \n21st century.\n  So, yes, there is restructure in the military; yes, we need more \nhigh-tech equipment; yes, we need more of some kinds of equipment. We \nneed less of others. But no one believes we will go back to a military \nof the size that would require the use of the number of bases we have \ntoday.\n  I do not believe the Secretary of Defense would have written the \nletter he did yesterday that says I want to underscore the importance \nwe place on the Senate's approval of authority for a single round of \nbase closures and alignments. Indeed, in the wake of the terrible \nevents of September 11, the imperative to convert excess capacity and \nwarfighting ability is enhanced, not diminished.\n  I repeat, the imperative to convert excess capacity into warfighting \nability is enhanced, not diminished.\n  I want to talk about another issue that is kind of important, \nalthough perhaps from a national security standpoint it is not too \nimportant, but that is the economic impact it has on the local \ncommunities. There is the belief it devastates the local community. If \na base is closed, it can go well, and it can go badly. There are many \ncases where the local communities put together a good reuse plan and \nthey are as well off or even better off after the closure of an \ninstallation.\n  The Congress and the Defense Department have taken steps, since the \nlast base closure round, to speed up the disposal of property for any \nfuture rounds.\n  In the majority of bases that were closed, there has been an increase \nboth of employment as well as revenues into the local communities. Why \nis that? One reason is that in a lot of cases you have a nice runway, \nand an air facility is readily available then for usage; in the case of \nWilliams Air Force Base, in the case of many others. Another reason is, \nyou have recreational facilities, such as a golf course. You have \nbuildings. You have an infrastructure there that businesses, education, \nand others have chosen to move into.\n  There is another argument that it is not fair to put every community \nwith a base through all the anxiety of BRAC when we only need to close \nsome of them, so we ought to change the process and take some bases we \nknow we will not want to close off the list, certain bases that will \nnot be closed under any circumstances.\n  On the surface it sounds like a good idea. I think anybody could name \n20 bases we would not want to see closed. But who decides which 20 \nbases cannot even be looked at, what criteria would be used, and how do \nyou put 20 bases on the list and say no to the 21st or the 40th or the \n100th?\n  I have every confidence the Norfolk naval base will not be closed. I \ndo not see how the Navy could exist without it. Could Luke Air Force \nBase be closed? It is the only place where F-16 pilots are trained \ntoday. I am not so sure. Should Luke Air Force Base be in the top 20? I \nhope so. But maybe not. Maybe this BRAC could figure they could \nconsolidate F-16 and F-15 training together in one base. So that is \nnot, I believe, a procedure that could lead us to any meaningful \nresult.\n  There is another issue that is important: Closing bases will deprive \nmilitary retirees of access to health care, and that happens. Not only \nhealth care but commissary facilities and others. That is one of the \nreasons we induce people to join the military--because they will \nreceive benefits and have access to military bases after they are \nretired. They have reduced retiree health care options, but the TRICARE \nFor Life Program enacted in the fiscal year 2001 Defense authorization \nbill addresses this issue by providing a quality benefit package that \nallows military retirees to get care from civilian doctors. This was a \nbig step forward. It also allows the services in the Base\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\nClosure Commission to focus fully on the military value of each base.\n\n  I know if Luke Air Force Base were closed, a lot of retirees who use \nthe commissary, use the other facilities, would be deprived. I feel \nvery bad about that, but at least we have taken care, to some degree, \nof their most important needs, and that is health care they would \notherwise get at these installations.\n  So we have been through this debate for years. We have been through \nthis debate since I came to the Congress in 1983. We had a series of \nbase closures, and unneeded and unwanted and unnecessary bases were \nclosed. If we had not gone through that process and left a number of \nbases open that had been closed through previous BRAC processes, I \ncannot imagine the costs that would be entailed today.\n  I note with some interest the Secretary of Defense is asking for one \nmore round. Perhaps we are getting close to the point where we will not \nneed any more rounds of base closings, but every study, every objective \nobserver, every person I know of--and there may be some who do not, but \nI do not know of any who are military experts who are admired and \nrespected by the people of this country who think we need another round \nof BRAC.\n  Again, I want to point out--and this is a very important point--it is \nvery difficult for us to recruit and maintain a quality military force \nif they are living and working in facilities that are inadequate and \nsometimes unsatisfactory. I mentioned the issue of environmental \ncleanup. It is obvious now, because of the base closure process, that \nmany of the men and women in the military were working and living in \nareas that were environmentally unsafe, if not hazardous. So the \nquality of life does have a significant impact on the efficiency of our \nmilitary.\n  We will be asking men and women in the military to go out and fight \nand perhaps sacrifice their lives. It seems to me the least we can do \nis make sure their quality of life, both at home and overseas, is at a \nlevel we would want for all of us, our families and our friends and \nparticularly those brave young Americans whom we are going to ask to \nserve and sacrifice in the future.\n  Is this a life-or-death issue? No, it is not a life-or-death issue. \nWe will muddle through if the Bunning amendment is passed. As I said \nearlier, I think this sends a signal that could be very wrong, and that \nis that on a major issue, according to the Secretary of Defense and our \nuniformed and civilian leaders, we do need a base closing commission, \nwe are not prepared to do that. I think that would be a very serious \nerror on our part.\n  So I hope we will defeat the Bunning amendment.\n  I want to thank Senator Levin, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, for his unstinting and unrelenting support of this issue. He \nand I have tried to get this done for a number of years now, and our \ntrack record, like mine on several other issues, has not been \nexemplary, but I think we now have an opportunity.\n  I thank Senator Levin again for his leadership and his willingness to \nbe involved in this issue. I am aware in the State of Michigan there \nare bases that could be closed, as there are in any State.\n  I thank all of those who support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope I did not cause the Senator from \nArizona to wrap up his argument prior to when he planned to. I did not \nmean to do that.\n  Senator Daschle has asked me to announce there will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight. We also hope, if there is a lull in the debate \nregarding this base closing issue, that Senators offer amendments on \nother matters, and we would arrange a time to vote on those tomorrow.\n  We are going to renew our request for a finite list of amendments. We \nhad great difficulty getting that. We are sorry the minority has \nobjected to that. This is a bill that is of the utmost importance, and \nit appears now there are people who do not want this legislation to go \nforward, which I think sends a terrible message to the American people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If Senators come forward tonight with other amendments, if \nthe BRAC debate ends at a reasonable hour, would it be possible for \nthose amendments not agreed to, to have votes on those amendments, \nstacked immediately after the BRAC motion to table tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. REID. It may be difficult because the Attorney General is coming \nbefore the Judiciary Committee at 10 o'clock. It is a very important \nmeeting. With all he has on his plate, we should not keep him waiting. \nWe will work to arrange the votes as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was prepared and I think Senator Levin was prepared to \noffer a motion to table very shortly. Is that out of the question at \nthis time?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Arizona, we have a vote scheduled \nat 9:45 in the morning. People said they wanted more time to debate \nthis. Although, as I announced prior to entering into that consent \nagreement, anyone at any time can move to table, but in consideration \nof the importance of this issue, we thought it would be best that \neveryone have everything they have to say tonight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I, too, thank the chairman and ranking \nmember and a number of our distinguished colleagues who have risen to \nsupport and oppose the Bunning amendment. I believe many Members in \nthis Chamber either had no well-informed or formed opinion prior to \nSeptember 11, or, perhaps, were inclined to support a new round of base \nrealignment closings. It is with some regret that I rise in support of \nthe amendment from the Senator from Kentucky. I believe after September \n11, it is imperative we have more information available than we \ncurrently have.\n  There are many arguments that have already been made on the floor, \nvery good ones, from our colleagues from Arizona, Rhode Island, \nDelaware, and Florida, as to what efficiency issues should take \nprecedence. I agree we need to constantly be evaluating our defense \nbudget and expenditures, to become as efficient as possible. Yet I also \nbelieve there are serious security concerns we are only beginning to \naddress. I take very seriously the Secretary's letter which has been \nreferred to and which has been read into the Record.\n  I believe my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, is correct \nin saying the President and the Secretary have inherent power to \nrealign, depending upon the needs we face in any kind of strategic or \nemergency situation.\n  We are about to engage in a broad-scale reevaluation of our homeland \ndefense and security. We are going to be asking ourselves some very \ntough questions about our readiness, about the proper intersection \nbetween our domestic policing agencies and functions and our military.\n  At this point, I think there are several factors that have to be \naddressed in addition to the request of the Department of Defense and \nthe recommendation from the Armed Services Committee before many \nMembers would be comfortable voting for a new round. I am not sure the \nnew round, if it is only a Defense Department review, will adequately \nlook at some of these other broader issues that may have implications \nfor both physical infrastructure and force deployment.\n\n  Some have said the QDR, which is expected by the end of this month, \nis out of date now. I don't believe that is the case, at least from \nwhat I am told and read in the paper; that the quadrennial review that \nthe Department has been undertaking will have some very significant \nrecommendations that should be digested and taken into account with \nrespect to moving forward on another round of base realignments and \nclosings.\n  It is important we integrate our domestic and military capacities in \na way we have never had to think about before. Many were deeply \nconcerned when we read reports of the short time, but nevertheless, \nunfortunately delayed time, that it took to scramble fighters into the \nair to try to deal with the impending threat and the potential threat \nthat might have still been out there from additional hijackers.\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\n  I don't know that the BRAC round has the same substantive \nunderstanding or impact that we have had in years past, given the new \nthreats we have so tragically suffered. I would be very confident and \nsupportive of our chairman and ranking member and members of the Armed \nServices Committee, working with the administration, coming up with a \nproposal that does make some sense.\n  I listened very carefully to the comments of the Senator from \nArizona--maybe certain bases should be taken off the table. Maybe they \nshould. That is something we have never talked about before, but in the \ncontext of the new threats we face, I think we have to think \ndifferently. It may be we may have a BRAC round where some bases would \nbe off the table, some of the assets that we have would be put to one \nside and we say they are essential to homeland security and they are \nessential to our projection of force abroad. Therefore, any BRAC round \nwould not look at those. That might be an idea worth considering \nbecause I think everything changed on September 11. A threat that was \nnot understood as being so deadly and imminent has caused such terrible \ndestruction and tragedy.\n  I, for one, will support the Bunning amendment at this time because I \nthink we have to reevaluate what we mean when we think about closing \nbases and realigning our forces. No one should argue about the \nefficiency measures that need to be taken, so that we do, No. 1, get \nthe most effective use of our dollars; and, No. 2, provide the kind of \ninfrastructure and resources that our all-volunteer military deserves \nto have.\n  I am concerned at this point we may not be ready for the ``son of'' \nBRAC. There may be the need to rethink how we get to the level of bases \nthat are required. I think perhaps for the first time we have to \nseriously take into account the new mission that the President has \ngiven for homeland security, to make sure there is, if necessary, the \nkind of integration that will make us safe at home as well as abroad in \nterms of America's values, interests, and security.\n  I rise with some regret because I have the greatest of respect for \nour chairman, our ranking member, and those who support this request \nfor another round. I probably will very much end up supporting it, but \nonly after we give the kind of thought I think is required today, to \ntake into account the new threats and perhaps do it differently than we \nhave done it before after we carefully evaluate what kind of presence \nwe need, taking into account homeland security. I would support that \nkind of approach. That is not what is being proposed at this time. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Bunning amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think it is important we go back and \noutline how the base-closing commission works. In listening to this \ndebate, we get the idea that by continuing a process of having a base-\nclosing commission, that the commission simply takes on its own head \nand imposes the closing of bases without regard to the thinking of the \nPresident, without regard to the wishes of the Secretary of Defense.\n  Let me remind my colleagues how the process works. How the process \nworks is, you set up a structure and nothing happens until the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense come forward and say, we believe \nfor these reasons that these bases should be realigned, closed, \nrestructured, merged, et cetera.\n  Nothing happens until the President makes the proposal.\n  Look, I understand base closings. We have closed bases in my State. I \nhave a lot of bases. I am proud of every one of them. I love every one \nof them. And nothing is harder than watching communities that \nsacrificed and supported the military and helped win the cold war, and \nthen through base closing and realignment we end up closing the base \nand imposing a very heavy burden on the community. I understand that. I \nidentify with it. I have seen it in flesh and blood in my State.\n  But the bottom line is we have 20 to 25 percent excessive capacity in \nmilitary bases in America today. I was for the Base Closing Commission \nprocess before the 11th, but I am stronger for it now. The arguments \nfor it today are stronger than they were then because we need these \nresources moved into areas where they can support the defense of the \nAmerican people and into nontraditional areas.\n  The first proposal the new Secretary of Defense made as part of his \nmilitary realignment and restructuring was the renewal of the Base \nClosing Commission process that we had under a Democrat and a \nRepublican President. If we come in now and simply say we forbid them \nfrom undertaking this process--we forbid the President and the \nSecretary of Defense from looking at our new situation and saying that \nbased on where we were before the 11th, based on what happened on the \n11th, based on the challenge we face today, we need to close or realign \nthese bases and we want an orderly process to have it evaluated and to \nhave Congress vote up or down, yes or no in response to that \nevaluation--if we come in and take the first proposal the Secretary of \nDefense has made and say no, we are not going to do it, it seems to me \nwe are basically saying we do not want to restructure the military and \nwe are going to look at our interests in our States and we are going to \nsay those interests supersede the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  There are two sides of every argument. I know there are good \narguments on the other side, and they are going to be made \npersuasively. But let me just sum up.\n  We have 20 to 25 percent excessive capacity in military bases, and I \ncannot foresee or imagine a circumstance under which that will not grow \nas a result of the conflict that started on the 11th. No base could be \nconsidered for base closing by the Commission unless it was recommended \nby the President and the Secretary of Defense.\n  What we are doing here is taking away flexibility from them, to \nrestructure resources to meet the current needs--not the needs of World \nWar II, not the needs of the Korean conflict, but the needs of the \nmilitary today. In the end, if we do not agree with the process, if \nafter we go through their recommendation and the outside evaluation of \npeople who are appointed to the Commission, confirmed by the Senate, \nevaluated independently--if we disagree with it, we can reject it.\n  But I think it is very important that we not reject the only reform \nproposal that has come before the Congress since the new administration \ntook office. I just think to accept this amendment today is basically \nto say to them: Forget about this reform because the first one you \nproposed, we say no to.\n  I hope this amendment will be rejected. I am not sure that it will \nbe, but I hope it will be.\n  I would also like to say, while I have Senator Levin here in the \nChamber, I thank him for his leadership on this issue. I would like to \nmake a plea to him.\n  He and I, out of the best of intentions, have for the last half dozen \nyears engaged in a battle about the Prison Industries. I am not going \nto give a long speech on it today. I will have plenty of opportunities \nif we do not work something out to do that. But for the last half dozen \nyears we have had a running debate. I believe people in prison ought to \nwork. I think the evidence of decline in recidivism of people who are \nin Prison Industries is overwhelming. No less an authority than de \nTocqueville, when he came to America in the 1830s to study American \nprisons and then decided to stay and study democracy, commented on the \nimportance of prison labor and prison industry.\n  Senator Levin and I have had a running debate about this issue. I \nwant to preserve the prison industry system. He wants to--I would say \n``kill it,'' but I will say ``dramatically change it,'' in this new \nspirit of bipartisanship. It is an important issue. It is one that \ndeserves to be debated. There are two sides of the issue. Strong \narguments can be made on both sides.\n  But my plea to Senator Levin is, this is not the year or the time or \nthe bill, it seems to me, on which to have this debate. I hope we can \nset aside this divisive issue on which the Senate has been roughly \nevenly divided. I think in the 6 years or so we have debated this \nissue, Prison Industries has survived by a handful of votes in each and \nevery one of those years.\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n  I hope we can wait and debate this next year or the year after. We do \nnot have to debate it this year. I think this is an impediment to \nseeing this important bill pass.\n  I would just call on the better angels of his nature to let us set \nthis issue aside with a guarantee that next year or the year after we \nwill have a hot debate on it and we will each present our side of the \nargument and we can decide then on prison labor and prison industry in \nthe Defense Department. But I think, with all we have going on, with \nall the major issues, this is not a good use of our time.\n  So being here to support the chairman on this issue of base closing, \nI simply wanted to make my appeal that we put off this divisive issue \nof prison labor for another day. Next year we will do another Defense \nauthorization bill. We can debate this divisive issue then. Hopefully \nthis war will be well underway and we will be in the process of winning \nit overwhelmingly. If he would do that, this Member would greatly \nappreciate it. All the prisoners who are working would appreciate it. \nBut I would appreciate it if we would eliminate this divisive issue and \nspeed up the process of moving ahead with this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, let me respond to my good friend from Texas. I very \nmuch welcome his constancy on the issue of base closings. We have had \nbase closings in our States, just about all of us. We know how \ncomplicated that can be. He has taken a very courageous position on \nthat, even though there have been bases closed in his State as well as \nothers in this Chamber as well. I thank him for the commitment he has \nmade to doing something which is not easy to do because back home it \ncan, at least on occasion, cause some disruption.\n  Senator Thomas is also in the Chamber. He is a cosponsor of our \nlegislation, which is in the bill. My good friend from Texas mentioned \nperhaps a year or two from now we could debate it. It is kind of \ntempting to have that debate 2 years from now because such an effective \nadvocate for his position would no longer be here, to wit, the good \nSenator from Texas.\n  But when my good friend from Texas says people in prison ought to \nwork, I have to say I could not agree with him more. I could not agree \nwith him more.\n  But I also think people who are not in prison ought to have the right \nto at least bid when their Government is buying items. Right now there \nare too many occasions when people in the private sector are prohibited \nfrom bidding for items being purchased by their Government. That may be \nhard for colleagues to believe. But it is the truth. Despite all of the \nadvantages in terms of ``costs'' of Prison Industries, to wit: labor at \nincredibly low cost, including the fact that they do not pay a whole \nlot of other benefits, to put it mildly, there are businesses in this \ncountry that are not allowed to bid on items that their Government is \npurchasing. I find that to be simply incredible and wrong \nfundamentally.\n\n  It is that issue which this language addresses in our bill. We want \nthe Defense Department, when they bid for purchasers, to let out bids \nand to be able to receive bids not just from Prison Industries but from \nthe private sector as well, and then go with the lowest bidder, or the \nbest quality. The Defense Department wants that power. Prison \nIndustries wants to maintain the monopoly and deny the private sector \nthe opportunity simply to bid. It may be unbelievable that the private \nsector could bid less than Prison Industries charged the Defense \nDepartment for items. But there is one way to find out. Let them bid. \nIt is the only way to find out. In this system of ours, it is \nunthinkable to me that we not allow the private sector to compete when \nit comes to the Government purchases.\n  I thank Senator Thomas who has been so active on this issue, as well \nas others. I wish we could figure out a way to accommodate my friend \nfrom Texas. But I can't do that without giving up what I consider to be \nan important principle.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know there are a lot of other people who \nwant to talk. One of the compromises that I would be satisfied with is \nto have competition in the Defense Department on procuring--competition \nwith Prison Industries but let prison labor within the constraints of \nnot selling locally, which could disrupt the local economy, and not \nglut the markets, let them produce and sell things in the private \nsector.\n  If we could generate that, the problem is the practical impact of the \npolicy that we have 1.2 million people in jail--almost all of them \nmales in their prime, productive period--and the net result of the \namendment is that the relatively few who are working won't be working. \nSo they can't sell in the private sector. If you take away from them \nthe right to sell to the largest Government customer, then there is no \nprison labor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will correct my friend. This is not a \nquestion of a right to sell to the customer. They have ever right to \nsell to the customer.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The right to sell in the private sector.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is what we tell China--that we don't want China to \nuse prison labor to make products to sell to us and that compete with \nus. We tell China that we don't want prison labor to make products that \ncome into this country and compete with us. But my friend from Texas \nwants us to use domestic prison labor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Absolutely I do. Why shouldn't prisoners be paid to work?\n  Mr. LEVIN. They are being paid about 35 cents an hour. No one in the \nprivate sector can compete for a job if he has to compete with prison \nlabor on that basis.\n  Let me say that I fundamentally disagree with the Senator from Texas \non that issue. That is not the issue in the language in this bill. The \nissue in the language in this bill has to do with simply allowing the \nprivate sector to compete. This is one of those cases where the AFL-CIO \nand the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the NFIB are in total agreement. \nWe can debate this later. It is not often that you get those \norganizations together. But in this case they are because the issue is \nso fundamental. Will our private sector be allowed to bid on Government \npurchases or can the Federal Prison Industries have a monopoly on some \nitems even though they are charging the Government more despite their \n50-cents-an-hour payment on labor--whatever they pay--despite the fact \nthey make no benefit payments to the prisoners. Despite all of that, in \nmany cases they still are charging the Government more than the private \nsector can charge the Government. Let the private sector, for heaven's \nsake, bid on items which their own Government is buying. It is \nunthinkable that we do not allow the private sector to bid on items \nwhich their own Government is buying. It is unthinkable to me.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am little unsure where we are. I am not \nsure about my position on this issue. However, I and many of us here \nworked very hard to pass a fair bill last year to allow for the private \nsector to bid and compete for Government business rather than doing it \nby outsourcing. I think that applies here. Certainly there are many \nother things that prisoners can do to continue to work. This is matter \nof competition.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan: Did the Senator from Texas agree to \npull his amendment? What is the agreement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy that is not quite the way I \nheard him at this time. Perhaps we will be able to figure out some \napproach where this matter can be resolved.\n  I emphasize that the right to compete with the private sector is in \nthe bill. The amendment which will be offered would have to be written \nwith language that allows competition in the bill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are prepared to talk about that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman: But it \ndoes change current law to provide for additional competitive \nstrictures on the Federal prison system. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. It allows competition where there is none now. The \nFederal prison system now can declare a monopoly for something, and \ndeclare that no private sector can bid on an item that it wants to \nsupply to the Federal Government. That prevents the private sector from \nbidding. We would say that is not right. Let the private sector bid, \nand if the Prison Industries folks can produce it cheaper or\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\nbetter, fine. But if they can't, and the private sector is doing it \ncheaper or better, then the private sector ought to be allowed to \ncompete.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But it would alter current law. Under current law, the \nplan has been for Prison Industries to produce products for sale to the \nFederal Government thereby improving prison conditions and receiving \nsome financial benefit to the prison.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That part doesn't change. They can still produce what they \nwant but they wouldn't be allowed to declare a monopoly so nobody else \ncould compete for that product.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I remember not too many years ago that I met an \nindividual who I had prosecuted as a Federal prosecutor. He served a \nnumber of years in jail and was a former elected public official. We \ngot to talking about this very subject. He said to me: If you need a \nwitness, call me because I have been in prison where prisoners work, \nand I have been in prisons where they don't work. And it is a lot \nbetter where they are working. It is when you go to the chow line at 6 \no'clock in the afternoon, there are no fights, and no shoving or \npushing. People are tired and want to get their food and go to the cell \nand go to bed.\n  It is a tough call for me because I believe in competition. And I am \nwrestling with this vote. I understand the Senator's concern about it. \nBut I believe deeply that we have to ensure that prisoners work. There \nare forces out there that want to shut it off at every angle. But at \nsome point we need these prisoners working, for their benefit and for \nAmerica's benefit. I don't know how they can't be competitive with the \nadvantages they have. That is why I am thinking I could support the \nSenator's amendment on the theory that they would probably tighten \nthings up and get competitive if it passed. But they certainly need to \nwork.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1438, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002. This bill \nprovides our armed forces the tools necessary to protect, serve, and \ndefend the United States of America and our allies. Recent events \nunderscore the critical importance of this bill: as the country mourns \nthose lost in last week's terrorist attacks, our armed forces must \nstand at the ready.\n  This bill has many laudable initiatives, including several efforts \nfrom all three of the subcommittees on which I serve: Seapower, \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities, and Personnel.\n  In the area of Seapower, our subcommittee was faced with the \ndifficult task of balancing the competing priorities of: new \nconstruction of ships for our naval fleet; sustaining our current \nplatforms and weapons systems; and investing in the weapons systems and \nplatforms of the future. I am pleased that this bill takes important \nsteps to ensure that our naval forces can continue to command the seas \nand project power ashore while sustaining a viable industrial base to \nsupport our future national security needs.\n  The bill approves more than $9 billion in funding for such major \nprograms as three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers, one SSN-774 \nVirginia class attack submarine, and one T-AKE auxiliary cargo and \nammunition ship. It is critical that the U.S. Navy's destroyer program \nsustain a viable production rate to ensure a smooth transition from the \ncurrent DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyer program to the future land \nattack destroyer program, DD-21, which will form the backbone of our \nfuture fleet.\n  The bill further authorizes advance procurement funding for four LPD-\n17 amphibious transport dock ships and the LHD-8 amphibious assault \nship. Full funding of $643.5 million for the continued research and \ndevelopment for the DD-21 Zumwalt land attack destroyer program is also \nincluded in this bill. This is particularly important in light of the \nHouse's unfortunate decision to cut the DD-21 authorization for the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  DD-21 will be vital to assure and sustain access to areas of U.S. \ninterests overseas. It will do so very efficiently, with a target crew \nsize of less than 100 and other design innovations that result in \nsignificant life-cycle cost reductions over the current destroyer \nprogram. The U.S. security strategy to defeat adversaries that seek to \ndeny us access to littoral regions of the world will be critically \ndependent on U.S. ships that are harder to target and attack, and on \nweapons systems that can deliver combat power ashore.\n  The Seapower Subcommittee also allocated substantial resources to \nstrengthen aviation assets in the areas of airlift, as well as for \npatrol, reconnaissance and surveillance platforms. The bill authorizes \nnearly $90 million in additional funding to sustain readiness for C-17 \nmaintenance trainers and improved shipboard navigation radars, among \nother items. Additionally, the bill provides more than $170 million to \nimprove the ability to meet non-traditional threats, including $96 \nmillion for P-3 modifications to increase the capability of the P-3 \naircraft to support operations in littoral environments. These \nmodifications to the P-3 aircraft will ensure that the aging P-3 \naircraft can continue to respond relevant to the changing threat and \noperational environment.\n  The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities has spent a \ngreat deal of time this year analyzing the military's ability to meet \nnon-traditional threats. This bill continues to improve the ability of \nU.S. forces to deter and defend against a very real, asymmetrical and \ngrowing terrorist threat. Tragically, we have learned just how real the \nthreat has become. The threat is not ``emerging''; unfortunately, it's \nreal and present.\n  In light of the recent terrorist attacks and testimony of the \nmilitary regional Commanders-in-Chief, I believe that we must do more \nin the areas of force protection, antiterrorism, counter-terrorism \ntraining, and research and development in order to protect U.S. forces \nagainst weapons of mass destruction, and to help them support domestic \nefforts to manage the deadly consequences of terrorist attacks on our \nhomeland.\n  The awful events of September 11th should highlight the urgency of \nensuring preparedness in this arena. In this new ``war'' against \nterrorism, such programs are our front lines.\n  The Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee sought to improve \ncapabilities to meet non-traditional threats by encouraging the \ndevelopment of technology for the detection, identification, and \nmeasurement of weapons of mass destruction agents, investing in \nresearch initiatives that will detect biological and chemical weapons, \nand funding the terrorism readiness initiatives of the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  This bill demonstrates our commitment to reexamine and bolster our \nefforts to combat terrorism and to extend the Defense Department's \nemphasis upon force protection overseas to include better protection at \nhome as well. One of the first hearings held by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee this year, for example, focused on ``lessons \nlearned'' from the attack upon the destroyer USS Cole, which had killed \n17 sailors. Tragically, we will now have many more lessons to learn.\n  The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats also has been examining the role \nof civil support teams in dealing with terrorist attacks and upon \nbroader issues of how we should prepare for ``homeland defense.'' This \nwork has been eye-opening, and the tragic events of the past few days \nunderscore, as perhaps nothing else could, how important it is to \nsupport the Defense Department's efforts in these areas.\n  I am pleased with the work of our Personnel Subcommittee as well. The \nbill we are considering fully funds the Tricare for Life, TFL, \ninitiative authorized in the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization \nAct, while also improving the compensation and quality of life of U.S. \nforces and families. The committee added $700 million to the budget \nrequest to improve compensation and quality of life, including \nadditional funds to reduce service members' out-of-pocket housing \ncosts, to increase higher education opportunities, and to provide \npersonal gear to improve the safety and comfort of U.S. forces in the \nfield.\n  Effective January 1, 2002, every service member will receive a pay \nraise of at least 5 percent, and personnel in certain pay grades will \nreceive targeted pay raises ranging between 6 and 10\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\npercent. These will be the largest increases in military pay since \n1982. Further, the bill supports the budget request of $17.9 billion \nfor the Defense Health Program, which represents a significant increase \nin order to meet rising costs of medical care and increased benefits \nfor military retirees.\n  While it is our responsibility to exercise our best judgment \nregarding the security of our Nation, we must do so while considering \nthe administration's current priorities, as well as the emergent needs \nof our sailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines. In this time of \nconstrained resources and limited budgets, every initiative needs to be \ncarefully considered in the wake of traditional and non-traditional \nthreats.\n  With that said, it is my belief that we in Congress, and this \nadministration have some very tough choices to make, not only in the \nareas of missile defense and the new war on terrorism, but also in \ndeveloping a integrated national security strategy, force structure, \nand future investments critical to our armed forces. Such fundamental \ndecisions should be made first, and we should move forward to the \nevaluation of where and how our force structure should be supported.\n  While the debate continues on how to transform our armed forces, and \nthe committee takes action to support our armed forces and the \nadministration's priorities, I would like to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge and thank Chairman Levin and Senator Warner for their \ntireless efforts to tackle these very tough issues and produce an \nauthorization bill that funds a number of critical priorities and \nprovides support for the men and women of our armed forces.\n  I wish to make a few points in response to the speech given by my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona earlier today on the issue of base \nclosures.\n  Many of us have made the argument that it makes far more sense to \ndetermine our force structure, particularly in light of the new \nemphasis that must be placed on homeland defense before we proceed with \nclosing installations that may well prove to be needed later on.\n  But it isn't just those of us serving in the Senate who support \nSenator Bunning's amendment who feel that way. Let me quote from an \nanswer that our Secretary of the Army, Thomas White, gave to a question \nregarding base closures put to him by Senator Dorgan at a hearing \nbefore the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in June. Senator Dorgan \ngave an excellent speech on this issue earlier. Secretary White said:\n\n       I think that the cart's a little before the horse. The \n     first thing we have to nail down is what the national \n     military strategy is . . . in accordance with the QDR \n     process. That's step one.\n       Step two is sizing the force against the strategy, and that \n     will flow out of the exercises currently ongoing.\n       And the third step will be what's the most efficient basing \n     for that force, and only at that stage of the game, when we \n     try to figure out the most efficient way to base the force \n     and to support it from a business perspective, will we get \n     into which infrastructure is excess or not. This has got to \n     be a strategy driven exercise.\n\n  Ironically, Secretary Rumsfeld, in arguing for base closures, also \nmakes the point that:\n\n       Our future needs as to base structure are uncertain and \n     strategy dependent.\n\n  This is the wrong time. We face tremendous challenges. We should not \nbe embarking on a whole new round of closing and downsizing base \ninstallations until we know what our needs are. And then, Mr. \nPresident, we should not be using the discredited BRAC process.\n  My colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and I have extensive \nexperience with the BRAC process. We have found it to be unfair. We \nhave found it to be inconsistent in its application.\n\n  If the Pentagon identifies bases that are truly excess, that are not \nneeded--and I recognize there is excess capacity--then the Pentagon \nshould identify those bases and put it in the budget. Why should we put \nevery community across this country that hosts a base through the \nuncertainty, the worry, and the expense of hiring consultants to make \nthe case for the retention of their base? That just does not make \nsense.\n  We are experiencing this right now in Maine the Pentagon's closure of \na base in Winter Harbor. We wish that this Navy installation, which has \nbeen there for more than 70 years, were going to remain open, but, \nunfortunately, its mission has become obsolete. What the Maine \ncongressional delegation is doing is working with the local \ncommunities, with the Park Service, and with DOD, on a transition plan \nso it can be effectively reused. We do not need to endure the \nuncertainties of a politicized BRAC system.\n  Finally, I want to respond to the comments made by the Senator from \nArizona about the need for improved housing for our troops. I could not \nagree with him more. I have visited our troops stationed at the DMZ in \nKorea. I was shocked and appalled at how bad the housing was for our \nbrave men and women who are serving there on the front lines. We do \nhave to do better. But that is a completely separate issue from the \nissue of whether now is the time to embark on base closures.\n  Now is not the time--now is the worst possible time--to divert the \nenergies of the civilian and military leaders of the Pentagon into an \nexercise of closing bases that may well prove to be needed later. Now \nis certainly not the time to create concern and chaos and confusion in \nevery community that has proudly hosted a military installation and is \nsupporting our men and women in uniform. Now is certainly not the time \nto embark on another round of base closures when all of our energies \nmust be focused on the overriding goal of crushing the international \nnetwork of terrorist organizations that have so harmed our Nation and \nits citizens.\n  I urge support for the amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I would like to make an inquiry and \nthen I have a couple comments to make.\n  When are we going to be taking up amendments that have been on the \nlist for quite some time? Has that been decided yet? Or may I ask the \nmanager of the bill, are we going to be disposing of the Bunning \namendment before we go to other amendments? Is that going to be the \norder?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to be disposing of the Bunning amendment \ntomorrow morning at 9:15. What we are hoping for is that other people \nwith amendments--if debate ends early enough tonight on the Bunning \namendment--will come forward with their amendments so we can debate \nthose amendments and then set votes on those amendments tomorrow.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Reid is here so we will leave that conversation \nfor him.\n  Mr. REID. The manager of the bill is absolutely right. We are \ncertainly willing tonight to take up any amendments that need to be \noffered. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, as I have said several times \nthroughout the day, this is a very important amendment, the one now \nbefore the Senate. We are going to dispose of it in the morning, more \nthan likely, at 9:45.\n  But the problem we have, I say to my friend from Alabama, is we \ncannot get your side to agree on a list of amendments. We are not \nsaying eliminate amendments. We are not saying you cannot offer \namendments. We are saying offer anything you want, but let's have the \nmanagers have a finite list of amendments.\n  And I don't know what the majority leader is going to do, but if this \ngoes on tomorrow, I think the majority leader would have to think \nseriously about going to some other legislation because we cannot go on \nwith each hour that goes by with more amendments coming in. We need a \ncutoff period of some kind.\n  So I say to my friend from Alabama, if there is some way you can \nprevail on the people on your side of the aisle to allow us to have \nthis unanimous consent request agreed to--what the consent agreement \nsays is that--I offered it already, and I will just tell you what is in \nit again--in fact, I will propound it right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list that I will send \nto the desk at this time be the only first-degree amendments remaining \nin order to S. 1438; that these amendments be subject to second-degree \namendments that are relevant; that upon disposition of\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\nall amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I propound this unanimous consent request, but I say, Mr. President, \nbefore I ask you to rule--I say to my friend from Alabama, and anyone \nwithin the sound of my voice--this is something that isn't unique to \nthis bill. We do it all the time. That is how we complete legislation. \nIf we cannot get people to agree on a finite list of amendments, we \ncannot do anything on the legislation. We might as well just pull it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished assistant majority leader.\n  And I will say this: I started out with 16 amendments, and I have 3. \nI think if everyone did this, we would be able to complete this bill. \nIt is very important we have the Defense authorization bill and we act \non it. So I will do my part.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, if he had 16, that is your privilege. \nYou can have as many as you want. We are saying, have as many as you \nwant, but let's have a cutoff period so the managers, at some time, can \nwork through these amendments. If there is no end to these amendments, \nthere is nothing to work through; we never finish the legislation.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I propound this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand there are still those who wish to continue \ndebate and who have not been prepared to agree to that on this side--\nmaybe somebody on this side. We have had this frustration ever since I \nhave been in the Senate. We have been on the other side as the \nmajority. But maybe we can get this thing moving. I certainly would \nlike to see this bill move. I would not personally object. I am \nobjecting for others who, I understand, have a right to object and have \nasked that I do so. I certainly will do what I can to see this bill \nmove. I hope we can reach an agreement soon.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alabama, this unanimous consent \nrequest that I have propounded does not in any way limit debate. In \nfact, it will allow unlimited debate on each amendment. We are not \nsaying don't talk more than an hour on an amendment. We are saying just \ntell us what you want to talk about so that the managers can determine \nif they can be accepted as part of a managers' package, or if they want \nto try to work out time agreements on these amendments, or if they want \nto basically accept some of them.\n  The way it is now, under the Senate rules we will never, ever finish \nthis legislation unless there is a finite list of amendments. And we \ncan't do it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand the Senator's concerns and frustrations. \nWe have been on this less than 2 full days. This is a major bill. Maybe \nwe can get the agreement soon. I will certainly help him in that \nregard, if I can.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma does have the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate this, I say to both the Senator from Alabama \nand the Senator from Nevada. It is very important. We must get to a \npoint where we can vote on it. I do have three amendments I want to \ntake up. I will just stick it through until such time as I can bring \nthem up.\n  Let me make a couple comments on some of the debate that has been \ngoing on. As far as prison labor is concerned, I assure the Senator \nfrom Alabama, who has been concerned about it, expressing his desire to \nhave prisoners work, I can assure him that prisoners can work.\n  I can also assure him that the language, in my opinion--I have been \non this committee now since 1994, and I have heard this debate every \nyear since 1994--in the bill is good language. We need to be able to \nhave quality work done on the work we are talking about in conjunction \nwith this prison labor debate.\n  Let me assure the Senator from Alabama that we can go ahead and keep \nthe language that is in our bill and still have a lot for the prisoners \nto do. I know a lot about this. I was mayor of Tulsa for three, four \nterms. During that time, we had a prostitution ring that hit Oklahoma \nand hit my city of Tulsa. It was a very serious problem. Of course, we \nwould throw them in jail. They would get out about 10 minutes later, \nwhen their attorneys would come up. What I did was, instead of putting \nthem in jail and incarcerating them, I put them in work details.\n  We had them out there--it worked out really well--cleaning up our \nparks. Because they had spiked heels, they could kind of go out there \nand pick up the trash, and it worked out very well. That program \nactually stopped that ring. It was because it was hard work. They \ndidn't want to do it.\n  I can remember once I got a call from someone from Sidney, Australia, \non a live radio show. I don't know what time it was there, but it was \nthe middle of the night in Tulsa.\n  He said: Mr. Mayor, how cruel can you be, making those poor women go \nout and work hard in the hot sun and do all that labor.\n  I said: I'll tell what you I will do. We will just package them all \nup and send them to Sidney, and then it will be your problem.\n  Then he said: By jove, I think you have a good program there.\n  There is a lot of work that can be done by prisoners. Anyone who has \nworked in this area, which I have in Oklahoma with our State \npenitentiary, knows that can happen. That is not the issue. There is \ngoing to be work. They are going to get work anyway that is not as \nenjoyable as the work we are talking about. I support the language in \nthe bill.\n  Under the debate right now, we have been talking about the proposed \nfifth round of the BRAC, base realignment and closure round. I have to \nsay this: I am opposed to it, but for a different reason than the \nSenator from Maine who spoke before me. It is not that I don't believe \nin the process.\n  I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1986. Dick Armey put \nout this problem. He said: As it is, we are never going to be able to \nclose installations and get rid of infrastructure that is no longer \nsomething we need if we leave it up to the political process. Each one \nis an economic base. There is not a Member of the House or the Senate \nwho is not going to protect his own turf.\n\n  That had been true. So I strongly supported Dick Armey, and in 1987 \nwe passed the BRAC process. We went through four rounds. Until the last \nround came up, it worked beautifully. It wasn't to everyone's \nsatisfaction. A lot of people were mad about it. But a lot of bases, in \nNew York and other places, were closed down and everyone cooperated.\n  In the fourth round, politics entered into it. It was a partisan \nthing because it was Democrats and Republicans who did it. That has \ntaken care of where it can't happen again.\n  The system is good. I far prefer the system of having BRAC rounds \nover the system that we used before then.\n  Here is why I am opposed to it. It is a totally different reason. I \nheard Senator Bunning ask: Can anyone show me the amount of money that \nhas been saved? We all have opinions as to what is projected into the \nfuture. I will say this: One thing we know for sure, we have closed 97 \ninstallations. I would suggest we wouldn't have closed one of them if \nit had not been for this process. We closed them. And in that time that \nwe actually closed those, there wasn't one that didn't lose money for \nthe first 3 or 4 years afterwards.\n  I think there probably is infrastructure out there that we are going \nto have to address at some time. We have two things that are going on \nright now: No. 1, we are bleeding. Everything is hemorrhaging right \nnow. We know we are having problems in our force structure, problems \nwith retention, problems with modernization. We need to have a missile \ndefense system. All these things have top priority in the bill, and I \nagree that they should be done. So if we postpone the consideration--I \nknow it doesn't take place until 2003--if we postpone it until a later \ndate, then we will not have to forgo that money that it is going to \ncost to close bases at a time that we need to go into rebuilding our \ndefense structure. We are repeating something right now like it was in \n1981. We have a hollow force. So this is not the time. I might \nseriously consider it later on.\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\n  The second reason is this: We know we are going to change the force \nstructure. We know we are right now at one-half of the force structure \nwe were in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War. That can be documented. \nThat is one-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical Air Force, \none-half the ships, down from 600 to 300. We know we are going to have \nto start building that force structure back up.\n  As we do it, we may be needing some of the infrastructure that right \nnow, if it were looked at by a committee that were appointed now or \nnext year, they might think is not necessary.\n  Let's wait. To artificially lower the infrastructure down to here, \nwhen our force structure is too low and we are going to have to raise \nit up--we don't know what we are going to be needing at the time. The \ntime is not right.\n  I believe in the system. I will support it at the appropriate time. \nBut we need every dollar we can get to rebuild our defenses today. That \nis what this bill is all about. That is why this is one of the few \nparts of this bill with which I disagree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to indicate my strong \nopposition to amendment No. 1622, which would strip a provision \nauthorizing a round of base closures in fiscal year 2003 from the \nfiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill, and differ from some of my \ncolleagues who would like to do that.\n  As one who voted for base closing last year, I understand how \nimportant this provision is to our national security. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, our military now finds itself with an \ninfrastructure base that is no longer proportionate to its force \nstructure. It is estimated we now support an infrastructure that is in \nexcess nearly 25 percent. In other words, we have an infrastructure out \nthere of bases; there is 25 percent more than what we really need. I \nbelieve rather than continuing to pay for unneeded facilities, our \ndefense dollars can and should be better spent to meet the most \npressing needs of our armed services.\n  I stand behind Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, and other members of \nthe Armed Services Committee who supported the inclusion of this \nprovision in the fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill.\n  As the committee noted in its report accompanying the bill, our top \ncivilian and uniformed military leaders have requested this authority. \nFor the last 5 years, they have been asking for it. I believe we should \ntrust their guidance and act to grant the Defense Department this much-\nneeded authority. Too often I have noticed in this body that we do not \nsupport the recommendations of the people we charged with the \nresponsibility to get the job done. We know more about it than they do.\n  In this case, we have charged these people with the responsibility to \nsecure our freedom and provide our national defense. We should listen \nto them. I am so glad the Armed Services Committee did so in this case.\n  The committee said:\n\n       The committee believes that the arguments for allowing the \n     closure of additional facilities are clear and compelling. \n     The department has excess facilities. Closing bases saves \n     money, and the military services have higher priority uses \n     that could be funded with those savings.\n\n  As our Nation prepares to engage in a new battle to combat terrorist \nthreats against the United States and the Free World at large, it is \ncritical that these excess resources be used to meet the most pressing \ndefense needs.\n  I respectfully disagree with the argument that we should not act on \nthis initiative as our country prepares to take on those who commit \nacts of terrorism against our Nation. On the contrary, I believe that \nnow, more than ever before, we need these resources for more important \nendeavors.\n  As the Secretary of Defense noted in a letter to Chairman Levin, \ndated September 21, 2001--I want to make the point that I have heard \nseveral people say on the floor of the Senate that they can't do it, \nthey are too busy with other things, and don't have the time or \nresources to properly do the overview that they need to determine which \nof these bases ought to be closed. It seems to me that they have a \nbetter idea of what their capacity is than we have.\n  In this letter from the Secretary of Defense, dated September 21--\nthat is pretty near--he said:\n\n       Indeed, in the wake of the terrible events of September 11, \n     the imperative to convert excess capacity into war-fighting \n     ability is enhanced, not diminished.\n\n  Basically, they say we can handle the job. Give us the permission so \nwe can move on with it. We made hard decisions regarding the size of \nforce structure during the past decade and we can continue to do more \nto make corresponding choices regarding the size and configuration of \nour military installations. Some of the words I have heard were that we \nhave had base closings and they have been wonderful in terms of cost \nsavings. The cost savings associated with past base realignment and \nclosures, including several from my State of Ohio, is considerable.\n  That is the other thing. So often when these things come up, people \nare thinking of their own bases and they don't want to lose the bases. \nI didn't want to lose the bases in Ohio that went through the BRAC \nprocess. I thought it was fair and above board. They did close down \nbases. In other instances, we were able to convince them that the bases \nshould remain open. But the fact is, as a result of these base \nclosings, the Department of Defense has a cost savings of nearly $14 \nbillion because of these initiatives. Given the fact we still have a \nmilitary infrastructure that is in excess of more than 20 percent, we \ncan continue to generate even more savings with an additional round of \nbase closures.\n  The Secretary of Defense estimates that with an additional round of \nbase closures, in fiscal year 2003, our taxpayers are going to save \n$3.5 billion annually. In this particular case, I don't think the \nsavings are going to be there. We will take the savings and put them to \nuse by taking care of this war dealing with terrorism. Given these \nsavings, there should be little doubt that additional rounds of \nclosures will do a much better job of directing expenditures where we \nneed them.\n  As I have long advocated during my time in public office, I believe \nwe should work harder and smarter and do more with less. That is what \nwe are asked to do. Keeping excess and unneeded military installations \nup and running takes scarce and critical resources from meeting \nimportant priorities in light of our new war. It just doesn't make \nsense.\n  How can we ask the American people to increase our defense budget by \n$18.4 billion and, at the same time, know that by closing these bases \nwe can save another $3.5 billion annually? Again, that is $3.5 billion \nannually. I believe the base closures are essential to allowing our men \nand women in uniform to best serve the strategic and national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  I strongly oppose any amendment that would remove the much needed \nprovision from the fiscal year 2002 Defense Authorization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. Madam President, I will be brief. I rise in \nreluctant support of this amendment. There have been many who have \ntalked about the macro reasons for doing this--that since September 11 \nwe are in a brave new world; that we may need reassessment, and we \nprobably do; that we probably should not rush to judgment.\n  Those are good arguments. But I want to talk about the particular \nissues that affect my State because we are all looking at our States \nhere. I supported BRAC while I was in the House consistently. I knew \nthat it might affect bases in my State. But my mouth has been so soured \nby the last BRAC that I cannot support it again. It is not simply that \nmy State suffered dramatically of our large bases--three out of the \nfour were closed--it is rather that the process, by just about all \naccounts, was highly politicized--at least in the instance of my State.\n  While the BRAC Commission did recommend the closing of Griffiss Air \nForce Base, and they did recommend the closing of the Seneca Army \nDepot, they did not recommend the closing of Plattsburgh Air Force \nBase. It was a state-of-the-art base, one of the few bases east of the \nMississippi that dealt with long-range bombers and tankers. Plattsburgh \nwas a state-of-the-art facility with a huge landing runway, with huge \ninvestments in its infrastructure that was being built; and,\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nwith good reason, the Commission did not recommend Plattsburgh.\n  Perhaps because the chairman of the Commission came from another \nState--a fact that may or may not have had an effect on this \nsituation's ultimate outcome--at the last minute Plattsburgh was put on \nthe closing list and McGuire Air Force Base in the middle of the New \nYork/Philadelphia skyway was used to replace it. The devastation in \nPlattsburgh was enormous. The BRAC Commission does not take into \naccount areas where, when bases are closed, people will never find jobs \nagain because they are shrinking areas. We are having the same problem \nin Utica. It was done so unfairly that I cannot support this amendment \nunless steps are taken to avoid the kind of politicization that \noccurred. I was not in the Senate then. I would have filibustered or \ndone whatever I could to stop it because it was so unfair.\n  Now we have only really two large non-Guard facilities left in New \nYork State. They are: Fort Drum, a state-of-the-art 10th Mountain \nDivision, a highly trained and mobile unit, those soldiers have served \nnobly in the Bosnian arena. We have Rome Labs, which is an information \ncenter for the Air Force. These days, as the tragedy of September 11 \nshowed us, military intelligence, information, and communication is the \nkey.\n  If I had faith that the decision would be made on the merits, I \nbelieve that neither of these bases would be on the list. They are both \noutstanding and important to our security and unique. Fort Drum is, \nagain, one of the few bases in the East--Northeast--that does this. It \nis one of the few that can train mountain fighting in the kind of \nterrains that we will be called upon to be involved with in the near \nfuture. Rome Labs, with the work of Congressman Boehlert and myself, \nhas chipped in $12.5 million to help revitalize, and it is doing state-\nof-the-art research. I have no doubt that if a decision were made \ntotally on the merits, those bases would not be on a BRAC list. Had not \nthe sour experience of the Plattsburgh Air Force Base existed in my \nmouth, I would roll the dice and gamble, hoping and believing that a \ndecision would be made on the merits. But I believe that that did not \nhappen. I don't think New York should take another hit, especially with \ntwo such outstanding bases like Fort Drum and Rome Labs.\n  So, as I said, I will reluctantly vote for this amendment. I would \nlike to see some safeguards put in, and that we take into account areas \nthat are shrinking in terms of population and in terms of jobs.\n  Most important, I would like to see the process insulated from the \nkind of last-minute political horse trading that occurred and unfairly \nclosed Griffiss and put McGuire in its place.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleagues on the committee. I know their \nintentions are the best and, as I said in the past, before I reached \nthe Senate, I had supported this process. I hope we can straighten it \nout so that decisions are completely made on the merits and I can \nsupport it again. But until that time, given, again, the bitter and \nunfair experience of our State, I cannot.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise today in strong support of the amendment that has been offered \nby the Senator from Kentucky to strike the base closing provisions \nwithin the DOD authorization bill.\n  We all recognize that this is not business as usual. We also \nrecognize how we will have to reevaluate many of the considerations \nthat are included in the Defense authorization bill, many of the ways \nin which we viewed our military and our force structure prior to \nSeptember 11.\n  Even before the horrific attacks of September 11, I, along with many \nof my colleagues, had serious questions about the integrity of the base \nclosing process itself, as well as the actual benefits realized. Now, \nwith acts of war committed against the United States, with the \nPresident addressing a joint session of Congress that justice will be \ndone, with our Reservists being called up and our troops being deployed \nand the unpredictability of the mission ahead, of the asymmetric \nthreats, I do not believe this is the time to be considering the \nclosure of additional bases.\n  Indeed, now more than at any other time in recent history, I believe \nit is absolutely critical that this Nation not sacrifice valuable \ndefense infrastructure when we have just committed ourselves to a new \nwar on terrorism.\n  This challenge will require a new overarching military doctrine, one, \nindeed, that has yet to be developed. One of the central goals of this \nadministration has been to overhaul the military doctrine which has \nbeen in place since the cold war, requiring that the United States must \nbe able to be engaged in and to win two major theater wars at the same \ntime.\n  Until a new doctrine has been determined, we cannot decide what the \nmilitary infrastructure should be. Now with the announcement by the \nPresident of a Cabinet-level position responsible for homeland defense, \nwe certainly do not know essentially what our requirements at home will \nbe to provide for our national security interests. Until there is an \nassessment and cataloging of those needs, we simply cannot afford to \ndetermine what additional bases should be closed.\n\n  I look at the Northeast, and in all the four previous rounds the \nNortheast has lost 49 bases, roughly 50 percent of what we had prior to \nthe BRAC process; 73 of those bases, or just under 35 percent of the \ninstallations on the east coast, were closed during the previous four \nrounds.\n  Although the Office of Homeland Security will not take the place of \nthe Department of Defense, it obviously will be coordinating many of \nthe law enforcement responsibilities of the myriad agencies across the \nFederal Government, and all of our military installations will no doubt \nplay a critical and prominent role in our homeland security.\n  Moreover, the war on terrorism will be a long-term challenge, as the \nPresident has said repeatedly. This will require a sustained resolve \nand effort on the part of the United States. It will employ U.S. \nmilitary, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel and resources. \nThese forces will require the support of our domestic and overseas \ninstallations. This is all in addition to our existing force \ndeployments and peacekeeping operations that we have in Bosnia and \nKosovo and, of course, our logistical support in Macedonia.\n  Instead of chasing elusive savings, I believe the Department of \nDefense needs to provide to the Congress a comprehensive plan that \nidentifies the operational and maintenance infrastructure required to \nsupport the services' national security requirements. We all know that \nonce the property is relinquished and remediated, it is permanently \nlost as a military asset for all practical purposes.\n  Proponents of additional base closure rounds are quick to point out \nthat reducing infrastructure has not kept pace with post-cold-war \nmilitary force reductions. They say bases must be downsized \nproportionate to the reduction in total force strength. However, the \nfact of the matter is, there is no straight-line corollary between the \nsize of our forces and the infrastructure required to support them. \nBelief that there is disturbs me. I heard it repeatedly when I served \non the Senate Armed Services Committee and chaired the Seapower \nSubcommittee. I was in the House when this whole process began. I think \nabout it in terms of the 1997 QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review \nprocess.\n  Since the end of the cold war, we have reduced the military force \nstructure by 36 percent and have reduced the Defense budget by 40 \npercent, but now I ask you: How much are we employing that force? \nAlthough the size of our armed service has decreased, the number of \ncontingency operations that our service members, our men and women who \nare in the military, have been called upon to respond to in recent \nyears has dramatically increased.\n  As I said, I chaired the Seapower Subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in the last Congress. Guess what. The Navy and \nMarine Corps team alone responded to 58 contingent missions between \n1980 and 1989--58 between 1980 and 1989--and between 1990 and 1999 they \nresponded to 192, a remarkable threefold increase.\n  Between 1980 and 1989, they responded to 58 contingencies. But from \n1990 to 1999, in that entire decade, it was 192, and that is just for \nthe Navy and Marine Corps alone.\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\n  During the cold war, the U.N. Security Council rarely approved the \ncreation of peace operations. In fact, it was a relatively rare event. \nI served on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I was the ranking member on the Subcommittee on \nInternational Operations. We rarely had such contingency operations. In \nfact, the U.N. implemented only 13 peace operations between 1948 and \n1978 and none--none--from 1979 to 1987. However, from 1988 through last \nyear, by contrast, there were 38 peace operations, nearly 3 times as \nmany during the previous 40 years.\n  Madam President, as a former member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I can attest that \nthe Armed Services Committee has listened to our leaders in uniform \ntestify that our current military forces have been stretched too thin, \nand that estimates predicted in the fiscal year 1997 QDR underestimated \nhow much the United States would be using its military. Clearly, the \nbenefits of the peace dividend were never truly realized. So, we are \nseeing first hand that the 1997 QDR force levels underestimated how \nmuch our military force was intended to be used, that our military \nforce is beign called upon now more than what military strategies \nestimated, and that are forces are being stretched to cover a wide \nrange of operations.\n  Keep in mind, Mr. President, that force levels may have to be \nrevisited once again in light of the new anti-terror mission our \nmilitary faces, and may well require an increase. So would we then go \nand buy back property that we have given up in future base closure \nrounds to build new bases--I think not.\n  Madam President, the Department of Defense contends there is 20 to 25 \npercent excess infrastructure today. Before we legislate defense-wide \npolicy that will reduce the size and number of training areas critical \nto our force readiness, the Department of Defense ought to be able to \ntell us, through a comprehensive plan, the level of operational and \nmaintenance infrastructure required to support our shifting national \nsecurity requirements. Congress, instead, is being pressed to \nauthorized base closures essentially in the dark, without the upcoming \nQuadrennial Defense Review or Future Years Defense Plan. We will have a \npreliminary QDR in the near future, but it will have to be revised in \nlight of the new threat facing this nation. How can we make fundamental \ndecisions about our infrastructure needs before we even have any \nguidance from the QDR?\n  In the full committee hearings and the subcommittee hearings that the \nArmed Services Committee held during the 106th Congress--while I sat on \nthe committee, and chaired the Seapower Subcommittee--the Chief of \nNaval Operations and fleet commanders testified that the QDR-\nestablished force levels were not sufficient to support their \noperational requirements. A report by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff concluded that the submarine force levels needed to be raised \nfrom the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review and I anticipate that the next \nQDR will support an increase in the Navy force as well.\n  We simply must not take the risk of losing critical infrastructure at \nthis time. Not only have arbitrary comparisons of personnel and \ninfrastructure levels never been the basis for military force structure \nchanges . . . Not only has a direct correlation between force and \nfacility level yet to be established . . . but the Department of \nDefense has said that the primary criteria for base closure will be \nmilitary value tied to the forthcomong QDR. But this begs the question \nas to the validity of the QDR numbers--the 1997 QDR has been heavily \ncriticized for getting the numbers wrong, particularly with regard to \nNaval fleet size. It could be premature and costly to predicate base \nclosure decsions even on the 2001 QDR, until we knwo for certain what \nour needs will be as we confront the new terrorist threat. Critical \nassets such as waterfront property, airspace, and bombing ranges would \nbe far more difficult and expensive to replace then troops, ships, and \ntanks.\n  Proponents argue that the administration's approach will be based \nupon military value and removes parochial and political factors from \nthe process, but in reality, the administration's Efficient Facilities \nInitiative is more similar to past BRAC rounds than one might think. \nMuch has been made of the de-politicization of the process by including \n``military value'' and the other criteria in the legislation. However, \nreview of the last process reveals that these criteria are nearly \nidentical to those used in the 1995 round. This is very disturbing, \nbecause in my view, the past BRAC rounds were not fair or equitable, \nand were not based solely on military value. I have been through BRAC \nbefore. And I have to say, I know how the criteria can be twisted to \nthe advantage or disadvantage of a given facility. In fact we had not \none but two Air Force generals defending the former Loring Air Force \nBase before a past BRAC commission; yet the Air Force claimed its \nfacilities were ``well below average''--and this despite the fact that \n$300 million had been spent there over a ten year period to replace our \nupgrade nearly everything on the base and it ended up being closed on \nso-called ``quality of life'' issues even though that was never \nsupposed to be part of the criteria.\n  I strongly believe Congress must also consider the economic impact of \nbase closures on communities in light of the uncertainty regarding the \nnation's economy in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. \nPrior to that date, it was clear that the economy was slowing, perhaps \neven entering a recession. Today, there is a great deal of uncertainty \nabout the state of the economy in the quarters to come.\n  In August 2001, GAO issued an overview of the status of economic \nrecovery, land transfers, and environmental cleanup in communities that \nhave lost bases during previous BRAC rounds. GAO found that the short \nterm impact of a base closure was traumatic for the surrounding \ncommunity and that economic recovery was dependent on several factors \nincluding the strength of the national economy, federal assistance \nprograms totaling more than $1.2 billion, and an area's natural \nresources and economic diversity.\n\n  Keep in mind, Mr. President, this assessment was done during a time \nof unprecedented economic growth and as GAO stated, the health of the \nnational economy was critical to the ability of communities to adjust: \n``Local officials have cited the strong national or regional economy as \none explanation of why their communities have avoided economic harm and \nfound new areas for growth.'' GAO also noted: ``Local officials from \nBRAC communities have stressed the importance of having a strong \nnational economy and local industries that could soften the impact of \njob losses from a base closure.''\n  With the slow-down of the economy, and the uncertainty brought about \nby the recent tragedy, it is doubtful that communities will be able to \nrebound even to the extent they have in previous years. Indeed, it is \nvital to note that not every community affected by base closures has \nfared so well in the past--those in rural areas still experienced above \naverage unemployment and below average per capita incomes.\n  In this vein, I would like to discuss for a moment the issue of the \nup-front costs involved in the base closure process. This appears to be \nnoticeably absent from the debate. The facts reveal that there are, in \nfact, billions of dollars in costs incurred to close a base.\n  These costs include over $1.2 billion in federal financial assistance \nprovided to each affected community--a cost paid by the federal \ngovernment, not through base closure budget accounts, and therefore not \ncounted in the estimates. And more significantly, there is at least a \n$7 billion environmental cleanup bill so far as a result of the first \nfour BRAC rounds--a conservative figure that will continue to grow, \naccording to a December 1998 GAO report.\n  Indeed, the Department of Defense has admitted that savings would not \nbe immediate; that approximately $10 billion would be needed for up-\nfront environmental and other costs. The Department of Defense also \nprojects that savings from 2003 closures would not materialize until \n2007.\n  Advocates of base closure allege that billions of dollars will be \nsaved, despite the fact that there is no consensus on the numbers among \ndifferent sources. These estimates vary because, as the Congressional \nBudget Office explains, BRAC savings are really ``avoided costs.'' \nBecause these avoided costs are not actual expenditures and cannot be \nrecorded and tracked by the Defense\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nDepartment accounting systems, they cannot be validated, which has led \nto inaccurate and overinflated estimates.\n  The General Accounting Office found that land sales from the first \nbase closure round in 1988 were estimated by Pentagon officials to \nproduce $2.4 billion in revenue; however, as of 1995, the actual \nrevenue generated was only $65.7 million. That's about 25 percent of \nthe expected value. This type of overly optimistic accounting \nestablishes a very poor foundation for initiating a policy that will \nhave a permanent impact on both the military and the civilian \ncommunities surrounding these bases.\n  And the GAO has found that, in reality, the majority of land \ndesignated as excess in previous BRAC rounds is still in DOD \npossession. Moreover, GAO reports that environmental cleanup costs have \nbeen underestimated. So far, as I mentioned, $7 billion or 32 percent \nof BRAC-associated costs have been attributed to environmental \ncleanups. This figure is estimated to increase over $3.4 billion after \nFY01, $1 billion more than the $2.4 billion originally projected in \n1999.\n  Lastly, when and if cost savings materialize, the Department of \nDefense intends to allow the services to retain savings and use the \nfunding at their discretion. This does not guarantee that any freed up \nfunding will go toward comprehensive modernization or quality of life \nimprovements--one of the arguments employed in favor of the BRAC \nprocess.\n  I believe that the Department of Defense has other long term \nalternatives to base closures that provide savings for important \nmilitary programs. The 1997 Defense Reform Initiative included actions \nsuch as streamlining, paperless contracting, and reduction in staff \npersonnel. These reforms were estimated to lead to approximately $3 \nbillion in savings. The new administration has proposed similar \ninitiatives and efficiency improvements that could generate substantial \nsavings.\n  Madam President, I want to protect the military's critical readiness \nand operational assets. I want to protect the home port berthing for \nour ships and submarines, the airspace that our aircraft fly in and the \ntraining areas and ranges that our armed forces require to support and \ndefend our Nation and its interests. I want to protect the economic \nviability of communities in every state. And I want to make absolutely \nsure that this Nation maintains the military infrastructure it will \nneed in the years to come to support the war on terrorism. We must not \ndegrade the readiness of our armed forces by closing more bases, \ncertainly not at this time. Certainly not without information on our \nfuture defense needs that we do not have.\n  Madam President, we say that we are going to have a Quadrennial \nDefense Review, and at least the preliminary report is expected to be \nforthcoming this month. Supposedly we predicate our infrastructure and \nour national security requirements on that report, and I know, having \nbeen a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we listened to \nour leaders in uniform testify that our current military forces have \nbeen stretched too thin and that the estimates in that 1997 QDR, in \nfact, underestimated how much the United States would be using its \nmilitary, how much our men and women would be called upon to be \ninvolved in contingency operations abroad.\n  They have multiplied. So now we are seeing firsthand, even before \nSeptember 11, that the forces established in the 1997 QDR \nunderestimated how much our military force was intended to be used, \nthat our military force is being called upon now more than what the \nmilitary strategies estimated, and that our forces are being stretched \nto cover a wide range of operations.\n  We know our force levels obviously may have to be revisited once \nagain in light of the new antiterrorism our military faces. The threat \nthat is represented to the United States and our security interests may \nwell require an increase. How do we know exactly what infrastructure we \nneed and where we need it? In hearing after hearing, I implored the \nPentagon and the previous administration: Give us your plan, tell us \nwhat you think our infrastructure requirements will be, and based on \nwhat threats, that we will need to have so many installations and so \nmany locations around the country. That is something we have never \nreceived.\n  Now they say they base it on the 1997 QDR report. Well, we know that \nunderestimated the utilization of our military forces. So now why would \nwe want to put in place another base commission closing process, set it \non an automatic path, when we have yet to receive the new Quadrennial \nDefense Review and how that will have to be reevaluated in light of the \nthreat we now face with terrorism? It really does not make any sense.\n  I know the Department of Defense has indicated there is a 20- to 25-\npercent excess of infrastructure, but I do not know how we have arrived \nat that excess of this 20 to 25 percent because we have never had a \nplan. I know this is a new administration, and it is beginning to \nevaluate it, and obviously an enormous burden has been placed upon it \nas a result of September 11. Those of us who have been through the four \nprevious rounds, who have been through the experience of this last \ndecade with contingency operation upon contingency operation that has \nstretched our forces to the maximum--that has had a tremendous impact \non their abilities, and they have performed in such a professional and \nskilled way, even in spite of all of the pressures as a result of doing \nso much more with less.\n  So I say we have to really draw back. We cannot afford to put this \nprocess in an automatic motion for some course in the year 2003 because \nwe have to go back and reexamine exactly what we need and why we need \nit.\n  What message does it send to those who are deployed or those who are \nabout to deploy, that somehow we are going to be downsizing at home? We \nmight need those bases. I know the Senator from New York mentioned \nPlattsburgh, that it was a state-of-the-art facility. So too was Loring \nAir Force Base. It was on the base closing list and was closed in 1991, \nand we spent a total of $300 million providing every upgrade in that \nfacility. It happened to be a base that was the closest base to Europe, \nto the Middle East, to Africa, to Russia, but we were told we are in a \nnew era where it is no longer required.\n  How do we really know, when we see the threat that occurred and the \ntragedy and the enormity of the impact of that attack on September 11? \nNo one could have fully anticipated what has affected the United States \nand the civilized world.\n  So I think it would be prudent on our part to recede from this \npredicate that somehow we have excess infrastructure because we really \ndo not know. It is an uncertainty. It is as uncertain as the asymmetric \nthreats that are now prevalent in the world today.\n  So I hope the Senate will support this amendment to strike these \nprovisions because we really do have to reexamine many of the issues \nthat are now prevailing in our world of today. We do not know the \nvalidity of what numbers, from which report, will now be applicable in \ntoday's world with this threat of terrorism. I know from my own \nexperience, not only with the four previous rounds and the base closing \nprocess, but also in terms of underestimating the number of times our \nmen and women would be deployed in other parts of the world, and I know \nfirsthand from the testimony that was provided to my subcommittee when \nI chaired the Seapower Subcommittee, that our forces were stretched too \nthin, that we could no longer absorb the demands being placed on us \nbecause we were being asked to do so much in so many places around the \nworld.\n\n  So now, in view of September 11, it is all the more prudent that we \nbegin to examine what we need in America today to provide for our \nsecurity, an acknowledgment that we have now had an attack on domestic \nsoil that we heretofore did not anticipate in the manner in which this \nhappened.\n  I think we really do have to look very carefully at what our \nrequirements will be in the future, because once these bases are lost, \nonce you lose the waterfront property, once you lose the land, once you \nlose the access, it is very difficult to retrieve. It is very difficult \nto be able to create an installation in the manner in which it was \nestablished before.\n  Also, we hear about the savings, and there is no doubt we ought to do \neverything we can to find savings within the Defense Department, as is \ntrue with all other budgets, but I have yet to see the methodology that \nis the rationale for\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\nthe savings the Defense Department has indicated have been created as a \nresult of the four previous base closing rounds.\n  I know the Defense Department claims there are $15.5 billion in net \nsavings through fiscal year 2001 due to prior base closing rounds, but \neven in the July 2001 GAO report it indicated there were flaws with \nthat estimate. And I quote: The savings estimates have been \ninfrequently updated, and, unlike for estimated costs, no method or \nsystem has been established to track savings on a routine basis. Over \ntime, this contributes to imprecision as the execution of closures or \nrealignments may vary from original plans.\n  That is true. It has been my experience, in examining what potential \nsavings would be derived from these base closings, that they have \ntraditionally underestimated the costs of closing such a base. They \noverestimated the savings and the benefits that would be yielded as a \nresult of land sales. In fact, they were far below what they had \noriginally estimated.\n  The environmental cleanup costs have been underestimated. So far, $7 \nbillion, or 32 percent, of the BRAC-associated costs have been \nattributed to environmental cleanups, and this figure is estimated to \nincrease over $3.4 billion after fiscal year 2001. These figures are \nfor base closures already in progress. If another 20 to 25 percent of \ninstallations are closed, environmental costs can be expected to \nskyrocket. Increased costs in environmental cleanup have led to delays \nin the cleanup process and deferment of land transfer for reuse. This \nfurther cripples local communities already hurt by the base closures.\n\n  There are a number of other issues regarding those savings, and I \ndraw my colleagues' attention to the GAO report ``Military Base \nClosures, DOD's Updated Net Savings Estimate Remains Substantial'' \ndated July, 2001.\n  In conclusion, this is not the time to ask this of our communities \nthat would be directly affected by potential closures, the men and \nwomen who work at these installations. They have to use their energy, \nattention, and focus to begin to prepare for the arduous, complex, and \nburdensome process that we ask of those who are trying to defend these \ninstallations. It costs millions of dollars for communities across this \ncountry, with the installations at stake. In Maine, for example, a \ncommunity in Brunswick has already established a committee to begin to \nreevaluate. Now, in light of September 11, that is not what we should \nbe asking of anyone.\n  We have to absolutely make sure this Nation maintains the military \ninfrastructure it will require in the years to come to support all of \nour challenges, and certainly this new one, which is the war on \nterrorism. I hope we will not embark on this process that ultimately \ncould lead to a degradation in terms of the readiness of our Armed \nForces, certainly not at this time, not without information on our \nfuture defense requirements that we certainly do not have at our \ndisposal at this point.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Senator from Kentucky in his \neffort to strike the language that creates this additional process. I \nthank Senator Lott, our leader, for all of his efforts. I know he has \nbeen supportive in making sure this can happen.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nremarks and for her leadership in this area. She paid attention to \nthese issues when she was in the House and served on the Armed Services \nCommittee in the Senate and is very knowledgeable and makes such a good \npoint. To go forward with this, with no plan, no certainty about where \nwe are going in the future, would be a big mistake. I thank her for her \nefforts.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of an amendment that strikes \nsection 29 of the National Authorization Act of 2002. Section 29 \nprovides authority to carry out a base closure round in 2003.\n  As this body considers yet another round of base closure hearings, I \nthink it is very important that we pause and reflect on where we have \nbeen, and examine where we are, and particularly today, where we are \ngoing with our future force structure considering we find ourselves in \na new war against terrorism.\n  I've said it many times before; we have been down this ``old BRAC \nRoad'' before, actually four times. The pros and cons of the BRAC \nprocess should be well defined by now.\n  I have always opposed the BRAC process because, first and foremost, \nit is an abdiction of responsibility by Congress. For years, Congress \nmade base closure decisions based on recommendations from our military \nleaders. This supposedly independent BRAC commission was supposed to \ntake politics out of the base closure process, but it has failed. There \nare always concerns about the fairness of how it is done. There are \nalways implications or indications that some political considerations \ncame into play, and always will be.\n  Regrettably there have already been statements from Defense \nofficials, which hint at bases that should be reduced or moved. In a \nUSA Today article Ray DuBois, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for \nInstallations and Environment, said the Pentagon wants to consolidate \nits bases by relocating some operations from congested areas to \nsparsely populated regions. He offered hints about moving training \nbases in the fast-growing Southeast to the Northern Plains State, \nwhittling down some of the 150 military operations in the Norfolk, \nVirginia area, and moving activities out of Andrews Air Force Base.\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recently said the Pentagon was \nconsidering a variety of options, including mothballing some bases, \nmothball part of a base and keep the rest open, or close only part of a \nbase. Mothballing means that even the surrounding community will be \nprevented from using the abandoned facilities, devastating any hope of \neconomic development in these local communities.\n  We must realize that an attempt to close bases, through any means, is \nin some form political. The future of our bases, our base communities \nand our Nation's security should therefore be decided by the elected \nofficials of this nation, not by an appointed commission.\n  Secondly, we know for certain that the BRAC process severely disrupts \nthe local economies of communities across the nation. Statements like \nthose coming out of the DOD in the past few months only exacerbate the \nanxieties of local communities. These communities have hired \nconsultants and will spend millions of dollars trying to prove the \nworth of their bases out of fear that they will be closed.\n  For such communities, losing a base is more than just an economic \nloss; it is an emotional loss and a blow to the core of their identity. \nThese are not just nameless, faceless people involved. In most military \ncommunities, personnel from the base are their church leaders, little \nleague coaches and scout leaders, not just men and women with money to \nspend. Communities that closed a base have lost must more than economic \nwell being, they have lost friends. neighbors, and community leaders. I \nthink it is very important that we remember what this process does to \nthese communities and to the people who are involved.\n  The third thing we now know about BRAC is that its savings cannot be \ndocumented. The economic and fiscal ramifications of closing and \nrealigning bases Congress has already authorized will stretch well into \nthe 21st century. The proposed savings from previous BRAC rounds are \nnothing more than imprecise Department of Defense estimates that cannot \nbe confirmed.\n  In fact, both the CBO and the GAO have said the Department of Defense \ncannot back up its savings estimates with hard facts. Given BRAC's \npurpose in life is to save money, I find this especially disturbing. If \nDOD cannot tell us how much has been saved by previous base closures, \nit begs the question, how can they say we need more?\n  Now are know that it is almost impossible to assess the real damages, \nsavings, or benefits from these previous base closings. We have seen \nthis time and time again. For instance, we have made decisions that \ncertain bases would be closed and there would be certain savings. Yet, \nwe have found that it is very difficult to move toward closing these \nbases and getting the savings for no other reason than there are \nextensive environmental problems in cleaning up those bases before they \ncan be turned over to the private sector or the local communities. To \nthis day, many\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\nof the recommendations from previous BRAC's have not been completed. We \nare still operating bases, facilities, or depots that supposedly were \ngoing to be closed. Today, they are still not closed.\n  Finally, the objective of BRAC is to match base infrastructure with \nforce structure. Yet today, the Department of Defense is working on \ntheir plan to transform our Armed Forces. In light of current events, I \nthink we all agree that a new threat has emerged and a new type of war \nwill be fought. I have to ask, what will be the force structure of the \nfuture? And, where will we need bases for operating, training, and \nmaintaining this force? These are just a few of the questions that must \nbe answered before we make a large-scale commitment to change our \ndefense infrastructure.\n  Secretary Rumsfield is still working on his Strategic Reviews to \ndefine the environment for the future and to make recommendations on \nforce structure changes. He has stated that the fiscal year 2003 \nDefense budget submission will be his first opportunity to implement \nthese transformational ideas.\n  DOD is also currently executing the Congressionally mandated \nQuadrennial Defense Review (QDR), and was scheduled to report to the \nCongress later this month on the results. I have no doubt this report \nwill be delayed due to the terrorist attack on the Pentagon. This body \nhas been patient, and continues to wait anxiously for these reviews \nbecause we know their importance to the future of our military. Why, \nthen, would we make such an important decision as closing certain bases \nbefore these long awaited reports are even available?\n  Without these key assessments, how do we define the base requirements \nfor our future force? We have yet to decide not only what that force \nshould be, but where it should be based. Now is not the time to get the \nproverbial ``cart in front of the horse.'' Another round of base \nclosures should not occur until all of the studies and reviews have \nbeen completed and the President is given the appropriate time to \nupdate the National Security Strategy.\n  So without having had an opportunity or a means to assess the changes \nin our infrastructure, and without having the opportunity to get \npreviously identified bases closed and savings realized, and without \neven identifying the future force structure of our military, we now \nhave to confront the recommendation that we should have yet another \nround of base closures. As a result of all these factors, CBO observed \nthat additional base closures ``should follow an interval during which \nDOD and independent analysis examine the actual impact of the measure \nthat have been taken.''\n  I agree. Before we go forward, we need to take a look at what we have \nalready done, evaluate it, and make sure we understand the cost savings \nand the costs that have been expended--both in financial terms and in \nterms of our military capabilities. Only after this review can we make \nan informed decision about whether or not to have another round. To go \nforward and blindly close more bases when we are not even sure what the \nbenefits, if any, would be, just does not seem like good policy.\n  I have stated to the President, the Secretary of Defense, and all the \nService Chief of Staffs that if they desire another round I could only \nsupport a round that focuses on those areas identified with large \nexcess capacity. This focused round would provide savings but not \nreduce infrastructure below what might be required by the future force.\n  One area is overseas bases and facilities. The 1990 BRAC legislation \noutlines the sense of Congress that closure of military installations \noutside the United States should be accomplished at the discretion of \nthe Secretary of Defense at the earliest opportunity.\n  Yet today, we have over 700 activities in Europe and Asia alone. \nEurope has 523 activities with 115,650 active duty personnel. We \ninvested $572 million in military construction in Europe from 1997-\n2001. That equates to an average annual investment of $114.5 million \nper year. In Asia we have 188 activities with 129,482 active duty \npersonnel. There are more troops in Asia than Europe but 60 percent \nless activities. The United States invested $653.8 million in military \nconstruction in Asia from 1997-2001. That equates to an average annual \ninvestment of $121 million per year.\n  In a recent meeting with Secretary of the Army Tom White, he \nmentioned the possibility of moving 10,000 troops from the European \ntheater to the Pacific theater. During a separate meeting, Deputy \nSecretary Paul Wolfowitz mentioned transferring 10,000 troops from \nEurope back to the United States. Just last week on Friday, September \n14, President Bush granted the authority to mobilize 50,000 reserve \npersonnel for Homeland Defense. How will these large-scale troop \nrealignments affect our infrastructure requirements of the future?\n  Why are we continuing to close installations in the United States \nwhen there are so many facilities overseas that we continue to sink \nlarge amounts of funds into year after year? In light of the events of \nSeptember 11, I believe we need to consolidate overseas installations, \ntherefore providing a more secure environment as well as improving the \nquality of life for our service-members and their families.\n  These are some of the questions we need answered before we authorize \nan additional round of BRAC. If after the Strategic Reviews and the \nQDR, the required force structure supports further base closures, then \nI think DOD should identify bases they no longer feel are necessary and \nsubmit their finding to Congress. I have full faith that this body is \ncapable of looking objectively at our defense needs and determining \nwhether a base has outlived its usefulness.\n  Given what we already know about BRAC, the ongoing reviews, and more \nimportantly, what has happened in recent days, I cannot support and \nvigorously oppose the Department of Defense's request for another round \nof base closure.\n  For that and many other reasons, I offer these amendments, one to \nstrike and one to modify section 29 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport me on this important issue.\n  I support and am a principal cosponsor of the amendment to strike \nsection 29 of the national authorization act of 2002. That section \nprovides authority to carry out the base closure round of 2003.\n  As this body considers yet another round of base closure hearings and \nproceedings, I think it is important we pause and reflect on where we \nhave been and examine where we are, and particularly, today, where we \nplan to be in the future with our force structure, considering the \nevents we have witnessed in the last 2 weeks.\n  I have said many times before we have been down this old BRAC road--\nactually, four times--and there are pros and cons about whether we \nshould do it.\n  This time I have listened to the arguments of the Pentagon, and the \nSecretary of Defense and I have weighed it very carefully. I still \noppose the process. I still think this is an abdication of \nresponsibility, to turn decisions of this nature over to this Base \nClosure Commission. I have always taken that position. Some people, \nsay, well, how did you plan to do it? How did we do it before? We \nstarted this process in the 1980s. The Pentagon would make decisions \nabout excess capacity, bases we did not need, missions that were not \nnecessary or could not be consolidated, and they sent a recommendation \nto the Congress. And the Congress would take it under advisement, \nsometimes accept the recommendation, sometimes reject it. In many \ninstances, bases were closed in the late 1940s and 1950s and 1960s. I \nknow of at least four bases in my immediate region that were closed, \nincluding one I believe in the 1970s, Brookley Air Force Base in \nMobile, AL, bases around my State.\n  Congress faced up to it. If it could be justified, if it can be, and \nwe can be assured it will leave us the capacity to do what we need to \ndo, I think Congress will step up to it. Some will say this is a way to \nget politics out of it. Really? How many think politics did not come \ninto play the last time we had a base closure round? It clearly did. \nThat is why many Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have opposed \nanother BRAC process over the last 2 years.\n  Some would have said 3 weeks ago that it is time we give it another \nchance, and we do have duplication and excess capacity. In my meetings \nwith\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\nthe Secretary of Defense and the service secretaries and \nrepresentatives of the Office of Management and Budget, I have \nindicated I would do one round, not two, but also if it would be \ntargeted to those places where we know we have redundancy or excess \ncapacity; or, to put it conversely, where we know we are not going to \nclose bases, then say it will not apply in these areas.\n  By the way, one of the key questions I want to ask in my remarks: \nWhat about bases in other places of the world? We have given the \nPentagon the authority to consolidate missions and close bases in \nEurope and other parts of the world, but they have done very little of \nit. In fact, I think one of the most interesting statistics I have come \nacross anywhere is this: We have over 700 activities in Europe and Asia \nalone. Europe has 523 activities with 115,650 active-duty personnel. We \nhave invested $572 million in military construction in Europe from 1997 \nto 2001. That equates to an average annual investment of $114.5 million \nper year. Shouldn't we look at excess capacity and consolidation in \nEurope before we start closing bases and facilities we may need at \nhome?\n  Now I support and understand the need for having some Air Force bases \nin Europe, such as at Rhein-Main, and we need naval bases so we can \nproject force. But when you look at the number of missions, where the \nmissions are, what we are doing in Europe, you cannot help but realize \nthey are snickering at us. They view it as economic development and \njobs activity.\n\n  I would like to make sure in fact something is going to be done in \nEurope before we start down this track of another base closure round in \nthe United States. We have already had some hints at how this might \nwork. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and \nEnvironment was quoted as saying maybe we would want to accommodate \nbases by relocating some operations from congested areas to sparsely \npopulated regions, even talking of moving bases from one region to \nanother. I understand there is some denial of that or apology for it. \nMaybe it shows some of the thinking.\n  We have also had the suggestion from the Pentagon that they were \nmaybe considering a variety of options, including mothballing some \nbases, or mothballing part of a base and keeping the rest open or \nclosing only part of that base. What that means is, even the \nsurrounding community will be prevented from using the abandoned bases. \nThat might be the worst of all worlds. We will not say yes or no. We \nwill say, well, we might want to keep part of it, not this part, maybe \nmothball it, we will not turn it over to the county, community, the \nState, for them to do something else with it.\n  I don't think this has been thought out. I don't think there is a \nplan of how this would work.\n  We know for certain that the BRAC process severely disrupts local \neconomies of communities across this Nation. If we have another BRAC, \nevery community, every State in America for the next 2 years will have \nto hire some high-priced, high-powered consultants and lobbyists to \ntell them what to do. You are not talking about cheap money, you are \ntalking about $200,000 a year, a quarter of a million a year. Everybody \nwill get on their war footing to try to satisfy the anxieties. And, by \nthe way, in many instances where they are not even going to be \nconsidered--or where they might be considered, but clearly in the end \nit will not happen. But let me tell you, that is what will happen.\n  Here is one thing that worries me. I had this feeling basically \nbefore 2 weeks ago, but think about it now. Think about it today. Our \nNational Guard units are being activated. Tankers from Meridian, MS, \nare flying overhead to keep our jets flying. Our Air Guard unit that \nhas the C-141 cargo aircraft, they are going to be involved. You can be \nsure of that. We have already had reservists called up, medical units, \nintelligence units and military police forces.\n  At a time when we are activating Reserve units and calling up Guard \nunits and we are telling the American people: We have been attacked, \nget ready, be ready and break out the flags. Let's support our men and \nwomen in uniform--oh, gee, and by the way, your base may be on the base \nclosure list.\n  Great timing? This is a great way to rally the troops. While we are \nexpanding and planning for the future and not really sure what all we \nare going to need, making demands on communities, individuals, every \ncommunity in every State in America is about to be affected by this, \nand then we are going to come with this particular proposal? I don't \nthink so, colleagues.\n  Some people say: Don't worry, it will be taken care of in conference. \nI have counted on that before and it did not quite work out that way.\n  So I hope my colleagues in the Senate will think about the timing of \nthis. What are we to expect in the future?\n  The third thing we now know about BRAC is the savings cannot really \nbe documented. Again, we will get arguments there can be savings. Yes, \nmaybe there should be savings in the future, but as a matter of fact \nthe proposed savings from previous BRAC rounds are nothing more than \nimprecise Department of Defense estimates that cannot be confirmed. In \nfact, both the CBO and GAO have said the Department of Defense cannot \nback up its savings estimates with hard facts.\n  One thing, the cleanup we have to go through, you can argue about \nwhether it is necessary or not, and sometimes I think we go to the \nextreme on that. But the cleanup has been a big problem in terms of \ncost and also in getting it into some other usage.\n  In some areas, some communities, some States, they have been able to \nturn these bases into economic development opportunities, and they \nworked out in those local communities. But I think the savings are of a \nvery dubious nature.\n  Finally, the objective of BRAC, as I understand it, is to match base \ninfrastructure with force structure. Yet today the Department of \nDefense is working on their plan to transform our Armed Forces. In \nlight of current events, we all agree a new threat has emerged and a \nnew type of war will have to be fought. So I have to ask what will be \nthe force structure of the future? What it likely may have been 3 weeks \nago may not be what it is now. Where will we need bases for operating, \ntraining, and maintaining this force?\n  Just this past weekend I heard an Air Force general talking about how \nour jets and our mission had always been set up and planned from inside \nout, looking out to stop attack. Now we have to change that thinking. \nWe have to think about how do we have protection inward. It is going to \nbe fundamentally different. We have to now think about, if we have to \nscramble planes, where would they have to come from to get to New York? \nWhere would they have to come from to get to Chicago? Where would they \nhave to come from to get to Boston? I understand we did have some \nplanes scrambled out of Massachusetts. But we have to look anew at how \nwe have this force structure and where these aircraft will come from, \nwhat type of forces we will need, what type of training will we need \nfor our men and women.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld is still working on his strategic review to define \nthe environment for the future and to make recommendations of force \nstructure changes. He stated that the fiscal year 2003 defense budget \nsubmission will be his first opportunity to implement these \ntransformational ideas. If that is the case, shouldn't we at least wait \nuntil we know that before we move toward another base closure round?\n  I have never supported a BRAC, but I have also never said I would not \nsomeday if I could be convinced there was a plan, that there was a \nforce structure, that we knew what we were going to need and we could \nbe shown there is duplication and redundancy and overlapping, things we \ndid not need because of changes in plans for the future, and it would \nbe aimed at those areas, not just a broad brush at every base.\n  DOD is also currently executing the congressionally mandated \nQuadrennial Defense Review and was scheduled to report to Congress \nlater this month on the results. I have no doubt this report will be \ndelayed due to the terrorist attack.\n  So I think I have made my point here. This could be done, but I think \nit would have to be done with more planning, with more indication of \nwhat our needs are going to be, what we want in the future, and with \nsome targeting. But that is not what we have here.\n  I say again, I think we need to take a look when we do it, not just \nat what\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nwe have here in America but what we have around the world. We are going \nto have this new homeland defense position. Would we like to see how \nthat is going to be formed and what their recommendations would be, \nbefore we start down this trail?\n  I think that would be the responsible thing to do. This is an \nadministration that I am very proud of. I have had a long relationship \nwith Secretary Rumsfeld. I have listened to Secretary Cohen, my \npersonal friend-- I sat next to him on the Armed Services Committee--\nthe Secretary of Defense with President Clinton; I have listened to the \nPentagon officials this time around. I think they are the experts, but \nI think we have a responsibility to ask the tough questions.\n  This time, the toughest question is, Are we ready? Do we know what we \nare doing, or is this just the knowledge that maybe we have some \nactivities that we can do without? But is that the case today as it was \n2 weeks ago? I don't think we know.\n  So I hope we will move on this amendment to strike. I appreciate the \neffort that has been made by the chairman and the ranking member to \ncome with this bill. Concessions were made. Senator Daschle and I kept \nencouraging them to keep working and they did. They did a great job.\n  I hate to stand up and speak on behalf of an amendment to strike \nanything out of this bill. I hoped basically we could just come \ntogether and get it done. I still think we can. There is no reason why \nwe should not be able to get a list of amendments agreed to and \ncomplete this legislation tomorrow or Wednesday morning. I think that \nwould be another important sign of how we are working together. We are \ndoing the right thing for the defense of our country and our efforts to \nhelp the economy and help deal with the threats this country faces.\n  The American people are saying they like seeing us do that. I think \nwe should do it on this bill. But for now, I think we should do it \nwithout this section. I thank my colleagues for their patience and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the list I shortly will send to the \ndesk be the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to S. 1438, \nthe Defense authorization bill, and that these amendments be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments; upon disposition of all amendments, \nthe bill be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the \nbill with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I was over here trying to \ndo my reading homework. I am not sure I heard. Is the Senator asking \nthat we limit amendments to the bill at this point?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The unanimous consent agreement I proposed just now, \nfor the third or fourth time, is that we would have a finite list of \namendments, not limiting the amendments but that the two managers would \nbe able to sort through the amendments, find out which ones they agree \nwith, those they want in the managers' amendment. Anyway, they would \nhave a list of amendments.\n  If we do not do that, I say to my friend from Texas, we will never \nfinish the bill. This doesn't limit debate on any amendment. It doesn't \nlimit the number of amendments that people would want to offer. But it \nwould bring some finality to the list of amendments.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Further reserving the right to object, I am hoping \nsomething can be worked out on a nondefense issue which has found its \nway into the bill. I am doing everything I can to expedite that, to get \nthat issue out of the way. I think we can save time by working that \nout, if we can.\n  On that basis I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I know there are other items that need \nto be worked on tonight. I say to my friend from Texas, we are arriving \nat a point in this legislation where I simply do not think it works to \nhave us on this bill. There are many other important issues we need to \nfinish before Wednesday at 2 o'clock.\n  One of the things we wanted to finish was this bill. The majority \nleader badly wanted to finish this bill.\n  The President wants the bill. It is important for this institution \nand it is important for the country, but unless the managers get a list \nof amendments, we are not going to finish this bill.\n  I suggest perhaps to the leader that tomorrow maybe we should go to \nsome of the other legislation that has to be done before we get out of \nhere on Wednesday. I know the Senator from Texas feels strongly about a \nmatter that is in the bill. But I would suggest to him that he should \noffer an amendment, debate it, and let the cards fall where they may.\n  But, as I said, the unanimous consent request that has been \npropounded does not limit debate or amendments in any way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nmotion to strike BRAC from the Defense authorization bill and to speak \non behalf of amendments that would put the money that we would save to \nbetter use in terms of our national security.\n  We just elected a new President of the United States. He selected an \noutstanding management team: Colin Powell, Secretary of State; Donald \nRumsfeld, Secretary of Defense; people who are well seasoned in terms \nof our national security interests. It seems to me if that team we are \nentrusting the security of the United States of America to believes the \nBRAC process would be well taken in the best interests of the United \nStates of America and would serve our national security needs that we \nought to follow their leadership in that regard.\n  If we have confidence in them moving forward with all the other \naspects of securing our national defense, we ought to also give them \nsome recognition and approval in terms of what they want to do in terms \nof our infrastructure and our bases in the United States and throughout \nthe world.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate will consider their recommendations.\n  As recently as September 21 after the national tragedy on the 11th, \nSecretary Rumsfeld came back and said to the Armed Services Committee: \nWe want it. We need it. Please give it to us.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay attention to the folks to whom we have \nentrusted our security.\n  Almost two weeks ago, the American people watched in horror as the \nterrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon unfolded \nbefore our very eyes.\n  As the nation slowly recovers, the image that no one will forget is \nthat of Fire, Police and emergency service personnel running towards \nthe flames and destruction while terrified individuals ran the other \nway.\n  These brave men and women knew they were racing into obvious danger, \nrisking their own lives in order to save others, but each one knew--and \naccepted the fact--that it was their job to do so.\n  Just three days after the attack on the Pentagon, I got an \nopportunity to see the devastation at that familiar landmark first-\nhand.\n  I was struck by the looks of quiet determination on the faces of the \nrescue personnel, each knowing the serious business they faced, and \ncontemplating the serious business they have yet to do.\n  Last Thursday, I was in New York City with 40 of my colleagues to \ntour the World Trade Center site. Standing at ``ground zero,'' seeing \nthat devastation first hand, has sealed my resolve to do whatever I can \nto make sure that such terrorism is never again used upon the United \nStates of America.\n  It is important for the future of our nation--our children and \ngrandchildren--that we support the President. The President was \nabsolutely right in his speech to the nation last Thursday evening when \nhe said ``Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy \ncampaign unlike any other we have ever seen.''\n  As I said on the floor of the Senate the day after this heinous \nattack, ``our actions must be ongoing and relentless, and be dedicated \nto excising the cancer of terrorism wherever it raises its ugly head.''\n  And if we expect to win this war, we will need the resources \nnecessary to do so, and the one resource we need above all others is \nhuman capital.\n  The American people have demanded--and rightly so--that we make\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\nour airports and commercial aircraft safer.\n  They want this government to turn the full force of the FBI towards \nconducting investigations and pursuing terrorism suspects.\n  They have urged us to beef-up our border patrols and strengthen our \nimmigrations and customers enforcement.\n  And most of all, they want this nation to use the full force of its \nintelligence, law enforcement and military apparatus to root out and \nsquash every terrorist organization in the world.\n  To ask their government to do these things is the right of every \nAmerican, but these will not be easy tasks to accomplish, Mr. \nPresident.\n  They will not be easy because at this moment, the federal government \nfaces a human capital crisis; we are losing the very people we need to \nrun our government--and their valuable experience--with each passing \nmonth.\n  And as they retire, we are not doing enough to replace them with the \n``best and the brightest:'' the individuals who will carry-on the \nimportant work of our nation.\n  The human capital crisis saps our strength as a nation, and at this \ncritical time in our history, we cannot afford to be vulnerable.\n  Since I was elected to the Senate, I have devoted a great deal of my \ntime towards examining this crisis in the Federal workforce and how we \ncan address it.\n  I can tell you that we need a unified strategy to rebuild the federal \ncivil service in light of the challenges it confronts--especially in \nthe aftermath of the attack on our nation on September 11.\n  The human capital crisis extends not just to our security and law \nenforcement agencies, but it includes virtually every department, \nagency, and office in the Federal Government.\n  While the entire Federal Government is in need of a massive infusion \nof high quality human capital, I am most concerned about the workforce \nof the national security establishment, because national security is \nthe most important responsibility of the Federal Government.\n  On March 29, the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \nheld a hearing entitled, ``The National Security Implications of the \nHuman Capital Crisis.''\n  At the March 29 hearing that I chaired, former Defense Secretary \nJames Schlesinger and Admiral Harry Train, United States Navy, retired, \ntestified on behalf of the U.S. Commission on National Security in the \n21st Century.\n  The Commission, which was chartered by former Defense Secretary \nWilliam Cohen in 1998 and chaired by former Senators Warren Rudman and \nGary Hart, undertook a comprehensive evaluation of our national \nsecurity strategy and structure.\n  The final report of the Commission, ``Road Map for National Security: \nImperative for Change,'' was released this past February. It includes \n50 recommendations on such areas as recapitalizing America's strengths \nin science and education, institutional redesign of critical national \nsecurity agencies, the human requirements for national security, and \nsecuring the national homeland.\n  On this latter point, I am pleased that the President has taken quick \naction to establish an Office of Homeland Security. The head of that \noffice, Governor Tom Ridge is a friend of mine, and I know that he is \nmore than able to face this challenge.\n  Regarding human capital, the Commission's final report concludes:\n\n       As it enters the 21st century, the United States finds \n     itself on the brink of an unprecedented crisis of competence \n     in government. The maintenance of American power in the world \n     depends on the quality of U.S. government personnel, civil \n     and military, at all levels. We must take immediate action in \n     the personnel area to ensure that the United States can meet \n     future challenges.\n\n  The report went on the state that:\n\n     . . . it is the Commission's view that fixing the personnel \n     problem is a precondition for fixing virtually everything \n     else that needs repair in the institutional edifice of U.S. \n     national security policy.\n\n  The General Accounting Office's Comptroller General, David Walker, \nalso pointed to the human capital crisis as a growing problem in our \nnational security establishment, stating at a hearing I held in \nFebruary that:\n\n       At the Department of Defense, where a Defense Science Board \n     task force found that ``there is no overarching framework'' \n     for planning DOD's future workforce, civilian downsizing has \n     led to skills and experience imbalances that are jeopardizing \n     acquisition and logistics capacities. In addition, the State \n     Department is having difficulty recruiting and retaining \n     Foreign Service Officers . . .\n\n  In fact, we have less people today applying to the Foreign Service. \nAnd of those people who we find meeting those very high standards, less \nof them are going in the Foreign Service than ever before.\n  I believe Secretary Schlesinger and Comptroller General Walker hit it \nright on the head when it comes to human capital.\n  Consider that we are currently making preparations to take on Osama \nbin Laden and his Taliban protectors and we don't have enough people \nwho speak their language.\n  Consider that the investigation that is underway by the FBI is \nhampered by a lack of language specialists.\n  Indeed, the Washington Post reported on September 17 that:\n\n     . . . although investigators are receiving large quantities \n     of data from documents and wiretaps, two well-placed former \n     law enforcement officials said the FBI suffers a lack of \n     Arabic linguists and analysts.\n\n  In fact, the situation is such that, the United States is now \nadvertising for anyone who speaks Farsi or Arabic to come forward and \nhelp out as translators in the aftermath of the September 11 tragedies.\n  I do not know how many people in the national security establishment \nactually speak Farsi, but it is apparent that we do not have enough.\n  And while I believe we need a full scale assault on human capital \ncrisis in the Federal Government, again, the first and foremost \nobligation of the Nation is to ensure the defense of its citizens.\n  For the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I have been working on a targeted piece of \nthe human capital needs of the civilian defense workforce.\n  I remind my colleagues that during the 1990s, over 280,000 Defense \nDepartment civilian positions were eliminated with little or no regard \nfor workforce planning. On top of that, new hiring was severely \nrestricted.\n  Taken together, these two factors have inhibited the development of \nmid-level career, civilian professionals--the men and women who serve a \nvital role in the management and development of our Nation's military.\n  To help remedy this, Senator DeWine and I amended last year's defense \nauthorization bill and provided the Department with a special authority \nto reshape its workforce after a decade of significant downsizing.\n  The authority provided to the Department last year allowed it to \noffer 1,000 voluntary separation incentive payments in fiscal year \n2001, and 8,000 total incentive payments and voluntary early \nretirements--4,000 in fiscal year 2002 and 4,000 in fiscal year 2003--\nfor the purpose of reshaping that workforce. Last year's defense \nauthorization bill required these authorities to be reauthorized this \nyear.\n  Human capital is the Federal Government's most valuable resource, and \nthis program is only a downpayment on the changes and authorities the \nU.S. will need to enact and implement to revitalize the civilian side \nof our defense establishment.\n  The amendment Senator DeWine and I are offering to section 1113 of \nthis bill is simple: it reauthorizes these important workforce \nreshaping proposals for both fiscal years 2002 and 2003.\n  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH, is an excellent \nexample of the challenge facing military installations across the \ncountry. Wright-Patterson is the headquarters of the Air Force Materiel \nCommand, employing 10,900 civilian Federal workers.\n  By 2005, 40 percent of the workforce will be age 55 or older. Another \n19 percent will be between 50 and 54 years of age. Thirty-three percent \nwill be in their forties. Only 6 percent will be age 35 to 39, and less \nthan 2 percent will be under the age of 34.\n  According to these numbers, by 2005--only 4 years from now--60 \npercent of Wright-Patterson's civilian employees will be eligible for \neither early or regular retirement.\n  There is a legitimate concern that when significant portions of the \ncivilian workforce at Wright-Patterson and other military bases retire, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\nhundreds of key leaders and employees with crucial expertise, the \nremaining workforce could be left without experienced leadership and \nmost important institutional knowledge.\n  Military base leaders--indeed, the entire Defense establishment--need \nto be given the flexibility to hire new employees so they can begin to \ndevelop another generation of civilian leaders and employees who will \nbe able to provide critical support to our men and women in uniform.\n  I thank Chairman Levin and Senator Warner for their support on this \namendment.\n  Incredibly, with a human capital crisis facing our Nation and the \nreport on the vulnerability of U.S. security in the year 2000, it seems \nthat the House of Representatives may not reauthorize the workforce \nreshaping program that Congress passed last year. We should be very, \nvery concerned about this.\n  If the provisions of our amendment are not included in the House \nbill, I would urge the House conferees to join in support of this \namendment as the final version of the Defense Authorization Act is \nbeing developed.\n  Let me state again that this amendment does not address all of the \nhuman capital needs of the Defense Department. It is just a small down \npayment.\n  Additional action needs to be taken to help ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense recruits and retains a quality workforce so that \nour Armed Forces may remain the best in the world and be able to keep \nthe world secure in the 21st century.\n  I will continue to work towards that goal, and will be introducing a \nmore comprehensive bill that not only responds to the human capital \ncrisis in the U.S. security establishment, but in the entire Federal \nGovernment as well.\n  In the wake of these attacks, our men and women in Government all \nacross the Nation have a renewed sense of purpose--to keep America safe \nand preserve our freedoms. I have never seen more determination and \npatriotism in my entire life.\n  Right now, law enforcement and military personnel are standing \nvigilant to watch over America.\n  The Border Patrol, the Customs Service, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service are closely monitoring who is coming into the \nUnited States and who is leaving.\n  Active and reserve elements of the Air Force, Navy, and the Marine \nCorps have been and will continue to patrol the skies above Washington \nand other cities.\n  The Navy and Coast Guard are guarding our ports and patrolling our \nwaters. Tens of thousands of reservists have been called up to assist \nin these activities.\n  At this moment, troops are being deployed in Southwest and Central \nAsia.\n  In the days and weeks and months ahead, our brave soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and Marines will be called upon to risk their lives and, in some \ncases, give their lives in an effort to rid the world of the evil \nscourge of terrorism.\n  Still, Mr. President, as much as we are asking our military personnel \nand our Government employees to do what we are asking them to do right \nnow, more is going to be asked of them. More will be asked of them.\n  We have a responsibility to the future generations of this Nation to \ngive the Federal Government the tools it needs to help retain and \nattract the best and the brightest. I believe our amendment is a good \nfirst start towards getting that job done.\n  I think all of us know, if we want to win the World Series or we want \nto win the Super Bowl, we need the best and the brightest. That is what \nwe need. And the best and the brightest have not been coming to the \nFederal Government. In fact, I have talked to the dean of Harvard's \nJohn F. Kennedy School, Dean Nye. He is very concerned about the fact \nthat 10 years ago, 70 percent of their brightest people would be going \ninto Government; today it is around 40 percent. So we have a long way \nto go.\n  I hope with this amendment we will be able to attract some of those \npeople to our civilian defense establishment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Bunning in strong support of Amendment 1622. This important \nprovision would prevent military base closures through 2003.\n  In the light of the recent, tragic events, implementing another round \nof base closures could be a dangerous decision. We are entering a new \nphase of heightened national security in our great Nation. And \nPresident Bush has correctly warned of the continued threat to the \nsecurity of the United States and its allies from terrorist groups and \nrogue states. I believe that base closures would not be in our \ncountry's best interest any time in the near future.\n  While the defense budget can be increased in a matter of days for \nincreased intelligence efforts or readiness assistance, the same is not \ntrue of the force structure or the base structure. Once property is \nconverted to civilian use, as it would be under another round of Base \nClosures, it is, for all practical purposes, permanently lost as a \nmilitary asset.\n  I would like to draw attention to Malmstrom Air Force Base in my home \nState of Montana. After two weeks of rigorous evaluations, the 341st \nSpace Wing's operations, security, maintenance, communications \npersonnel, and equipment were recently given an ``excellent'' overall \nrating for Combat Capability Assessment. A very high mark! I'd like to \ncongratulate them on a job well done.\n  It would take months or even years to reach this state of \neffectiveness if we had to start from scratch to re-engage the base. To \nlose this asset in moments of heightened national security could \npermanently scar our force capability to respond.\n  While protection of our national security and military readiness is \nenough of a reason to halt base closures, there are additional concerns \nto address, as well: first, while reducing spending is the main \nmotivation behind base closures, studies have shown that the additional \nfunds are never realized. The majority of savings comes from reduction \nof personnel, which is not directly tied to base closures. And \nreduction of personnel shouldn't be an option given the current \ncircumstances. Second, there is no procedure for selecting which bases \nare closed. And that is very troubling. ``Military value'' is only the \ndefinition currently used and is open to interpretation. A concrete set \nof criteria must be developed before any further base closures are \nconducted.\n  Since September 11, we have seen that our economic security is \nclearly tied to our national security. In order to bring strength to \nour economy, we must maintain strength in our military.\n  We do not have months or years to wait while our bases are \nrefurnished with military personnel, equipment and missions. If \nadditional bases were closed, we would waste valuable resources as we \nscrambled to reinstate a base during a time of high security. Now is \nnot the time to limit our military's ability to respond.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against further base closures and \nsupport amendment 1622.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to the \nDefense Authorization Bill.\n  I must tell you that I have thought long and hard on the subject of \nbase closings. The arguments for and against initiating another process \nwhich might lead to additional base closings have weighed heavily on my \nmind. I have the deepest respect for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and I \nknow how hard he is working to find efficiencies and economies within \nthe Department of Defense. I know he believes that a new base closing \ninitiative is an important tool in his efforts to fix our defense \ninfrastructure problems. However, I strongly believe that the events of \nSeptember 11th changed this Nation's priorities. Now is not the time to \nengage in any type of activity that distracts from our national defense \npriorities.\n  This is a pivotal time in our history. All our efforts and resources \nmust be focused on fighting terrorism at home and abroad. At this time, \nI do not think that the time and money spent preparing for base \nclosings will contribute to this effort. Military bases and the \nmilitary establishment need to be focused on the war effort. Our \nmilitary leaders and base commanders throughout the country do not need \nto be worrying about justifying their installations' existence. The \ncommunities around the bases do not need to be worrying about their \nfuture economic well-being. At a time when we,\n\n[[Page S9725]]\n\nas a Nation, face an uncertain future, we need not take on a process \nthat is rife with uncertainty and turmoil and which distracts from our \nnational goals.\n  Additionally, we do not yet know what force structure will be \nrequired to accomplish all the missions associated with this new 21st \ncentury warfare. I believe it will take some time to determine what our \nmilitary should look like. Why would we start a base closure process \nwhen we have no idea what shape or size our forces will take? Equally \nimportant, we do not know which bases will be key to our efforts in \nbuilding an effective homeland security network.\n  There is great debate about how much base closings cost and how much \nbase closings save. In a time of economic uncertainty, I do not believe \nit is wise to spend millions of dollars on a base closure process. I am \nnot willing to sacrifice the readiness of our armed forces for \ntheoretical savings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am wondering if my friend from Oklahoma \nwould agree with me on the following procedure, that after Senator \nNelson speaks--I understand that is going to be on the BRAC amendment, \nI want to speak on the BRAC amendment--that unless others notify our \nCloakrooms that they wish to speak on the BRAC amendment, at that point \nwe would be done with the BRAC debate. We would then move to the \namendments offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. I don't want to put \nthat in the form of a UC, but I will state that would be my intention. \nI am wondering whether or not the Senator will concur.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do concur in that. In fact, I will go along with a UC \nto that effect, whatever the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are not sure yet if anyone else wants to speak on BRAC. \nI would ask if any of our colleagues want to speak on the Bunning \namendment, that they let our Cloakrooms know so we would then be able \nto accommodate those Senators before we move to the Senator's two \namendments. I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky to strike the BRAC language from \nthe fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill.\n  Senator Dorgan referred to Secretary Rumsfeld's label for BRAC, the \nEfficient Facilities Initiative, as ``Iffy.'' I have to agree with him. \nI think it is iffy in terms of cost, iffy in terms of our present force \nstructure, and would be iffy to the morale of our troop force.\n  On Tuesday, September 11, the strategic environment in which the \nUnited States operates was completely changed; certainly, as it relates \nto the military as well. Many issues that crowded our plate \ndisappeared, and we have all begun to focus on the current crisis. I \nbelieve that change in environment involves base closures.\n  I said at the time we were debating this issue during the Defense \nauthorization bill that we should wait on the QDR before we voted to \ngive the administration the ability to close bases. That point of view \nwas not shared by every member of the Armed Services Committee, and \naccordingly the BRAC language was included in the authorization bill.\n  We are now told that the Department of Defense will submit an on-time \nQDR to the Congress and that DOD has indicated they will send an \namended QDR to us just as soon as they can at a later date to address \nthe current crisis.\n  Authorizing another round of BRAC without first reviewing the QDR and \nwithout first admitting that our strategic environment has shifted \ndramatically is a classical case of putting the cart before the horse. \nI didn't think that BRAC was right before September 11, and I don't \nthink our military knows if it is right now.\n  We know, for example, as a result of the September 11 events, our \nfighter jets are flying cover over major U.S. cities. Those jets need \nbases from which to fly in and out. It strikes me as a rather odd time \nto be closing bases.\n  Now that we are in the process of creating a homeland defense office, \nwhat role will our bases play in the protection of our major cities? \nWill we need increased ground defenses which are located at bases which \ncould otherwise be closed? What role will bases play in our new \nsecurity structure? Again, we haven't had the opportunity to think this \nthrough and, therefore, we must, in fact, set aside the BRAC \nauthorization at this time.\n  Some say that BRAC will provide us significant cost savings. \nCertainly, I am for cost savings. Over the long term it may be \npossible, but no one disagrees that in the short run, BRAC costs money. \nRight now we need every bit of our resources, financial and otherwise, \nto address our significant force protection concerns.\n  Finally, this sends a mixed message to the men and women who are now \npreparing to engage a new and terrible enemy. How can we be united as a \ncountry if we are adversely affecting morale? Now is the time to focus \non reducing the threat of terrorism, not on relocating and uprooting \nfamilies from bases. It would be inopportune to include this language \nin the Defense authorization bill, certainly at this time.\n  Until I am presented with more persuasive evidence regarding this \nmatter, I simply cannot support an initiative that could hamstring our \nhomeland defense. And in my opinion, it might. Certainly I believe \nothers share that view based on comments on the floor.\n  Clearly, it would be prudent to strike the language in the best \ninterest of our country and our military personnel at this time. Let us \nconsider BRAC under less threatening circumstances, when we will have \nmore information at our disposal and when we will know what the QDR \nexpects from our military. Let us not act prematurely. Instead, let's \nexercise prudence and do the right thing for the right reason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nBunning amendment because I don't think we are ready to make the \ndecisions about which bases we are going to need. We didn't know before \nSeptember 11 exactly what our troop strength was going to be in the \nfuture because we didn't have the reviews in place yet from the new \nadministration.\n  Today we know even less about the troop strength, and we certainly \nneed to know how many we are going to have in our component \norganizations--the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--before we make \nthe decision on which bases we will need for the future.\n  Also we need to know how we are going to do our training. What is the \nbest place to do the training? I have visited bases overseas where we \nhave training facilities, but we have limited airspace in some of \nthose. We have limited missile range in some of those places.\n  Is it better to do the training there or is it better perhaps to do \nit at a U.S. base where we have better facilities and more control over \nthe airspace and the ground space? I don't know the answer to those \nquestions. I know we should have the answer before we make a decision \non whether we start closing bases.\n  I have seen us do two things in previous base closings. I have seen \nus close bases that we then needed in the future. The Air Force has \nsaid that we should have kept some of the training bases in the United \nStates opened, but they were already closed. It was too late to do \nanything about it.\n  Secondly, I have not seen us estimate anywhere close to the true cost \nof closing a base. If I could get real numbers that showed that closing \na base really saves money, I would consider having another round of \nbase closings. But until we know what the environmental cleanup is, \nwhat the hazards are in each of these bases and what it is going to \ncost for that cleanup to put it in order for the base to either be sold \nor given back to the community, depending on what the arrangement is, \nthere is no way I would support a base-closing commission.\n  I think we are spending more closing these bases than we have keeping \nthem open. I am the ranking member of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. We have $150 million in that bill that is going to come \nto the floor in the next\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\nfew weeks, $150 million for environmental cleanup that was not \nanticipated in base closings.\n  That is not the way we ought to do business. I don't think we ought \nto say that environmental cleanup is going to be $15 million and then \nall of a sudden have a bill for $150 million and say that is an \nefficient use of our assets. We have not done our homework yet.\n  I am not saying I am never going to be for a base closing. I will be \nfor a base closing, if I see what our troop strength is projected to be \nfor the next 25 years or even 10 years, if I see that training is going \nto be done either in America or overseas, but we have studied where \nthat training ought to be. In fact, I would support a study that would \nprepare us for a base-closing round. But I will not support another \nround of base closings until we have done our homework, until we have a \nstudy, until we know how this new war that we have just determined we \nmust wage for the freedom of our country is going to be waged and how \nlong it is going to take and where the bases might be needed. We \nprobably will have more overseas bases. But are they going to be in the \nsame places that they are now? Maybe not. Maybe we will have to build \nnew bases in other sites.\n  So I don't think we ought to be talking about closing things until we \nknow what we are going to need in the future. I am not against base \nclosings; I am just against doing it too soon, because I think we are \nthrowing good money after bad if we don't have our ducks in a row and \nknow exactly what our needs will be from the military construction \nstandpoint.\n  On the Military Construction Subcommittee, I did not like having to \nspend money on environmental cleanup, when I would have liked to have \nspent that money building better housing for our people, building more \nfacilities to do the job that we know we must do. Yet we are still \ncleaning up bases that were closed 10 years ago. I don't think that is \nthe way we ought to operate. We ought to operate with good business \nsense. We ought to decide what our troop strength is going to be, where \nwe can best do the training, what our needs are going to be with this \nnew war that we now know we must fight--and we know it is going to be \ntough. We are going to support the President and give him the resources \nhe needs to make sure we win because freedom is at stake.\n  The idea that we would have a premature round of base closings is a \nbad idea whose time has not come. So I appreciate the work of everyone \nhere. I know we have legitimate disagreements on this issue. But I am \ngoing to support the Bunning amendment. I hope we can set it aside for \nthis year.\n  I have an amendment, which I have already offered, which I hope we \ncan consider. It does have a study that would ask just the questions I \nhave asked tonight. If we can answer those questions, then we can have \nbase closings based on what we are going to need in the future, based \non facts, based on studies, and knowing exactly what we are going to do \nbefore we take these steps. Most of all, we will know what the costs \nare going to be and how much could be saved and how much must be spent \nfor those savings.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member, and I hope we can pass the Bunning amendment. I \nalso hope we can pass the Hutchison amendment that will provide studies \nfor the future, and that we can do this in the right way and in a \nthoughtful way, in a way that will make sure we do right by our men and \nwomen in the services and protect them wherever they may be in the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a number of arguments have been raised this \nafternoon about the Bunning amendment which would strike the BRAC \nlanguage from our bill. By the way, this is the first time the Armed \nServices Committee--at least within my memory--has adopted a bill for \nan additional round of base closings on a very strong bipartisan vote. \nIt was adopted because the civilian and uniformed leadership of our \nArmed Forces pleaded with us to allow them to get rid of excess \nstructure, which costs a lot of money and makes it impossible for us to \ndo the things we want to do to modernize Air Forces, make them more \nready and more lethal, to make them more mobile, to give them greater \npay, because we are spending billions of dollars on infrastructure we \ndo not need.\n  For the last 4 years, Senator McCain and I have come to this floor \nand said our leadership is asking for the authority--just the \nauthority--to have another round of base closings. It has been denied \nyear after year. We have been told ``this is not the time,'' year after \nyear. We have been told we should have a study year after year. As a \nmatter of fact, in 1997 there was a study that was substituted for the \nround of base closings. The April 1998 report contained 1,800 pages of \ndetailed backup material for why we should have another round of base \nclosings.\n  I think the most important question that has been raised is, Does \nSeptember 11 change all this? That, to me, is the real vital issue. We \nwanted to get the thinking of our uniformed and civilian leadership on \nthat issue because, surely, I think each one of us--and perhaps no one \nmore than the person occupying the chair now--would want to know what \nis the effect of the events of September 11. I want to read a letter we \nhave received because even though parts of it have been used before, it \nseems to me this letter addresses that most pungent of all questions. \nThis is from Donald Rumsfeld, dated September 21. The same letter was \nwritten to both myself and to Senator Warner. It reads as follows:\n       I write to underscore the importance we place on the \n     Senate's approval of authority for a single round of base \n     closures and realignments. Indeed, in the wake of the \n     terrible events of September 11, the imperative to convert \n     excess capacity into warfighting ability is enhanced, not \n     diminished.\n       Since that fateful day, the Congress has provided \n     additional billions of taxpayer funds to the Department. We \n     owe it to all Americans--particularly those service members \n     on whom much of our response will depend--to seek every \n     efficiency in the application of those funds on behalf of our \n     warfighters.\n       Our installations are the platforms from which we will \n     deploy the forces needed for the sustained campaign the \n     President outlined last night. While our future needs as to \n     base structure are uncertain and are strategy dependent, we \n     simply must have the freedom to maximize the efficient use of \n     our resources. The authority to realign and close bases and \n     facilities will be a critical element ensuring the right mix \n     of bases and forces within our warfighting strategy.\n       No one relishes the prospect of closing a military facility \n     or even seeking the authority to do so, but as the President \n     said last evening, ``we face new and sudden national \n     challenges,'' and those challenges will force us to confront \n     many difficult choices.\n       In that spirit, I am hopeful the Congress will approve our \n     request for authority to close and realign our military base \n     facilities.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will have the will to do something that is \nnot easy. This is not easy for any Member for his facilities and his \nState to do; we know that. That is why facilities were not closed until \nwe had commissions that were in place. We make a recommendation to the \nPresident, and the President would then have a right under our approach \nto either say yes or no to the entire list. If he says yes, Congress \nhas the right to say yes or no to the entire list.\n  This does not abdicate responsibility to a base-closing commission. \nWhat it does is it permits us to shed excess infrastructure that is \ncosting us billions, that is detracting from the ability of our \nwarfighters to fight a war, because it means billions of dollars which \nshould go into that effort are instead being spent to maintain \nstructure that is no longer needed.\n  We would not put excess baggage on a warfighter. We would not tell \nthat warfighter you have to carry a larger load than is necessary. By \nkeeping bases open, that is exactly what we are doing. We are denying \nthe warfighter the resources that would otherwise go into what is \nneeded in the Defense Department.\n  That is the issue. The issue, if anything, it seems to me, is sharper \nsince 9-11. More than ever, we must avoid waste. More than ever, we \nmust have the will to make tough choices. We have done a lot of things \nthat have been difficult, and we have done a lot of things differently \nsince 9-11 in this Congress. We have come together on a lot of issues \nthat we thought we could not come together on, and we have avoided the \nkind of dissension and debate in which our people do not want us to \nengage.\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\n  Now we have our military leadership and the President of the United \nStates pleading with us to allow them to get rid of excess \ninfrastructure 2 years down the road. That is the plea from our \nPresident, that is the plea from our military leadership, civilian and \nuniformed: to allow them to begin the process 2 years from now of \nremoving excess infrastructure.\n  I hope we have the will to do that, to respond to the men and women \nof our military who have much greater needs than excess infrastructure.\n  We have been told also that we should be closing more bases overseas \ninstead of starting this process here. Since the end of the cold war, \nthe Department of Defense has closed 59 percent of our overseas sites \ncompared to about 21 percent of our domestic sites. They do not need \nauthority legislatively to close overseas facilities. They have that \nwithout our action, and they have been able to close 59 percent of the \noverseas sites. That is quite a difference from what they have closed \nin this country. So I do not think that argument works either.\n  Then we have been told as well that we should know what we want in \nour force structure before we move for some additional flexibility on \nour base structure. We ought to know what our force structure is going \nto be, and there is no doubt about that. Before the base structure is \nconcluded, surely we must know, or should know, what the force \nstructure is going to look like. That is why in this bill we require \nthat ``the Secretary shall carry out a comprehensive review of the \nmilitary installations of the Department of Defense inside the United \nStates based on the force structure plan submitted under section A(2). \n. . .'' And that plan is very specific. That is part of the budget \njustification documents submitted to Congress in support of the budget \nfor the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2003: The Secretary shall \ninclude a force structure plan for the Armed Forces based on the \nassessment of the Secretary in the Quadrennial Defense Review under \nanother section.\n  The force structure plan is required by our law. We have heard many \ntimes this afternoon and this evening, and correctly, that we ought to \nbase our base structure on our force structure and we do not know what \nthat force structure is going to be.\n  The answer is we know that the force structure must be determined \nprior to the base structure recommendations that go to the Base Closure \nCommission and then from them to us. It is a requirement of law.\n  The Senators who have made this point are right; we should know our \nforce structure before we know our base structure, but the inaccuracy \nis in their argument that we will not know that force structure prior \nto the decision on base structure, both by the Defense Department, in \nterms of their recommendation to the Base Closure Commission, and by \nthe Base Closure Commission in their recommendations back to the \nPresident and to us.\n  The one final point I will make this evening has to do with cost. The \nargument has been made that there either have not been savings or that \nthe savings have not been demonstrated, or that there has been no proof \nof the savings, or that the savings have not been precise. We have GAO \nreport after GAO report saying that--and I will reading from one:\n\n       Our work has consistently affirmed that the next savings of \n     the four rounds of base closures and realignments are \n     substantial and are related to decreased funding requirements \n     in specific operational areas.\n       In addition to our audits, review by the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the Department of Defense Inspector General, \n     the Army Audit Agency have affirmed the net savings are \n     substantial after initial investment costs are recouped.\n\n  The Defense Department has even attempted to give us a very precise \ndocument as to what those savings are. They have made a real effort \nyear by year, item by item, to tell us where there have been costs, \nwhere there have been savings, starting in 1990 for each round of base \nclosures.\n  They have come up with net savings to date of approximately $16 \nbillion. Total savings, and I am rounding this off, is $37 billion. \nThat is gross savings. Those are total costs of about $21 billion--\nagain I am rounding that off--with the savings to date of $16 billion.\n  Recurring savings from those rounds each year are now about $6 \nbillion per year. That is what we are saving because Congress had \nenough courage to walk down this road, and believe me, I know it takes \ncourage. It is not an easy vote. I have been through a few. We have \nlost our strategic air command bases. We have some other bases, other \nfacilities that are very nervous about the possibility that maybe in \nthe next round they will be caught. So this is not an easy vote, but it \nis a cost-effective vote. It is a vote that the President, his \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, every military \nleader we have ever had in front of our committee, civilian or \nuniformed, is pleading with us to make.\n  The plea, it seems to me, is more eloquent than ever after September \n11 because it is so critically important that we not load down our \ndefense with unneeded infrastructure anymore than we would load down a \nsoldier with unneeded baggage. They are related.\n  I hope that tomorrow we will cast this vote. The country will be \nlooking at us, the Nation will be looking at us to see whether or not \nwe are willing to do some tough things that our uniform and our \ncivilian leadership in the Defense Department and our President are \ncalling upon us to do. I cannot think of any way more eloquently to \nstate this cause, other than to read from a letter of August 30 from \nSecretary Rumsfeld and General Shelton. I expect we will be hearing \nfrom the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on this same issue before we vote \ntomorrow.\n  This letter, which I will make part of the Record, makes a very \npotent case for saving the money. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  August 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Warner: We are writing to \n     underscore how critically important it is that Congress \n     authorize the Department to conduct another round of base \n     closures and realignments.\n       The Department must reshape and restructure its \n     installations to serve the country's national security in the \n     21st century. Currently, our installations do not match and \n     therefore do not adequately serve our current and projected \n     force structure. Under-utilized facilities, estimated to be \n     23 percent DoD wide, are a waste of public resources and an \n     impediment to our efforts to protect our national security.\n       Because current law makes it virtually impossible for the \n     Department to make prudent decisions in managing its \n     facilities, we can only rectify these problems through a \n     Congressionally authorized round of base closures and \n     realignments in 2003. Drawing on the process from past \n     rounds, the Efficient Facilities Initiative is an objective \n     way to rationalize an infrastructure on the basis of military \n     value, verified by an independent commission. In addition, \n     both the General Accounting Office and the Congressional \n     Budget Office confirm DoD's savings estimates from prior \n     rounds.\n       The Department is committed to accomplishing the necessary \n     reshaping and restructuring in a single round of base \n     closures and realignments to minimize the difficulty these \n     efforts pose to communities surrounding our bases. While the \n     process may be hard, the record from our previous rounds \n     indicates that the majority of affected communities actually \n     emerge in a better economic condition than prior to the \n     closure or realignment. As before, the Department will work \n     closely with these communities in fostering economic reuse.\n       We know you share our concerns that additional base \n     closures are a necessity to provide resources necessary to \n     meet essential national security requirements. We simply must \n     take action. Please do not hesitate to call on us in your \n     efforts to secure passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    General Henry H. Shelton, USA,\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                               Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his strong \nstance on base closure. He and Senator McCain have worked for a number \nof years on this issue.\n  I do not know how many years ago it was I joined on that legislation, \nand then, of course, we had a problem with the previous administration. \nAnyway, I was with them up until that problem arrived. So it is indeed \nlong overdue.\n  Even though I am proud to say my State has a very significant share \nof\n\n[[Page S9728]]\n\nmilitary installations, I stand with my colleagues and the vote of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee because I think that is what it should \nbe, an efficiency that should be given to the Secretary of Defense. We \nneed these savings. We need them desperately.\n  Mr. President, I believe that concludes the remarks on base closure. \nI see the Senator from Oklahoma, one of our valued members of the \ncommittee. He wishes to, as I understand it, lay down two amendments \nfor tonight, and then the chairman and I will proceed to do a number of \ncleared amendments. Am I correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. We now hopefully will turn to our \nfriend from Oklahoma to offer two amendments. I think one of them we \nmay be able to accept, although I am not sure if that is true, on both \nsides. If that is true, and I think the Senator knows which one that \nis, he can offer that one first.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be----\n  Mr. INHOFE. The amendment on the waiver process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1594\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in an effort to try to get this bill \nthrough, which America desperately needs now, I had about 16 amendments \non which I worked out arrangements and understandings with other people \nso that I am down to only three amendments. Of these three amendments, \nas was suggested by the Senator from Michigan, one is without \ncontroversy, I thought, until about 5 minutes ago.\n  My understanding is one Republican Senator is going to object to it. \nThat being the case, we will have to have a rollcall on that amendment.\n  I would like to explain that amendment and hopefully that one Senator \nwould be available and tell us if she is not going to object to it.\n  Mr. President, for quite a number of years we have had a debate, when \nwe do our defense authorization bills, on an issue that is in place in \norder to keep an internal ability to handle depot maintenance in areas \nwhere it might be considered to be core maintenance; in other words, \nareas where it is necessary to have that ability in order to fight a \nwar. The concern has been this: With the decreasing number of defense \ncontractors and the decreasing number of people who are able to perform \ncertain maintenance functions, if we are in a war, we would not want to \nbe held hostage by a single contractor who would be able to keep us \nfrom being able to do it internally.\n  For that reason, some time ago we passed a law that said under that \n60/40 bill, which is now 50/50 in our statute, simply this, that 50 \npercent of the maintenance has to be performed in-house by a depot \ncapable of doing it without outside help. For that reason--and I agree \nwith those who disagree with the 50/50 concept, that this is merely an \narbitrary figure, but there has to be some type of a figure and we have \nnot been able to come up with anything since then that is any better \nthan this. So the law now says that 50 percent of the maintenance has \nto be done internally by a public depot.\n\n  There is a way they have been able to get around 50/50, and that is \nif any of the service secretaries say that within their service they \ncould declare there is a national security reason that for 1 year or \none period of time we are not going to be able to do 50 percent of the \nmaintenance work in a public depot, if they do that, they do not have \nto give any reason for it, but they merely say this is for national \nsecurity.\n  This has happened a few times so we have gone back to the service \nsecretaries and we have said to them: Tell us why it is as much as 50 \npercent of the maintenance in a public depot. We have never gotten any \ngood answers, and then we have also asked them afterwards: What are you \ngoing to do to ensure that we are going to be able to meet this 50 \npercent in the next fiscal year? And we have not been able to do that.\n  I am not saying this critically of any particular service secretary. \nWe need to know why, if we are going to find a loophole around one of \nour existing laws, this being the 50/50, it is necessary, and what we \nare going to do in the future to prevent that from being invoked.\n  So my amendment does simply two things: One, it takes that \njurisdiction away from the service secretary and puts it with the \nPresident of the United States. He then can delegate it back to the \nSecretary of Defense. If he is going to say that there is a national \nsecurity reason that we cannot do 50 percent of the work at a public \ndepot, he has to say why that is and what they are planning to do to \ncorrect that in the next fiscal year. That is all it does.\n  So if people are opposed to the 50/50 concept, fine. Let us pass a \nbill or try to pass a bill to do away with 50/50. That is not the \nissue. The issue is if we are going to use a national security waiver \nto waive 50/50 for a given year, we need to make sure we know why we \nare doing it and what can be done for the next year to keep from having \nto do that. So that is simply it.\n  I was hoping we might have a note from the Senator. We do, and there \nwill be apparently one vote against this.\n  So that is an explanation, and I am going to ask that this be voted \non tomorrow.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been sent up yet.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, the amendment is at the desk. It has been there \nsince last week.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator call up his amendment so it will be \npending immediately after the disposition of the Bunning amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I call up amendment No. 1594 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1594.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To authorize the President to waive a limitation on \n   performance of depot-level maintenance by non-Federal Government \n                               personnel)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 335. REVISION OF AUTHORITY TO WAIVE LIMITATION ON \n                   PERFORMANCE OF DEPOT-LEVEL MAINTENANCE.\n\n       Section 2466(c) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Waiver of Limitation.--(1) The President may waive \n     the limitation in subsection (a) for a fiscal year if--\n       ``(A) the President determines that--\n       ``(i) the waiver is necessary for reasons of national \n     security; and\n       ``(ii) compliance with the limitation cannot be achieved \n     through effective management of depot operations consistent \n     with those reasons; and\n       ``(B) the President submits to Congress a notification of \n     the waiver together with--\n       ``(i) a discussion of the reasons for the waiver; and\n       ``(ii) the plan for terminating the waiver and complying \n     with the limitation within two years after the date of the \n     first exercise of the waiver authority under this subsection.\n       ``(2) The President may delegate only to the Secretary of \n     Defense authority to exercise the waiver authority of the \n     President under paragraph (1).''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, then there would be additional debate \navailable on this amendment because there has been no time agreement \nrelative to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand--perhaps the Chair can confirm--after \ndisposition of the Bunning amendment at approximately 9:45 a.m. or 10 \na.m. tomorrow, the debate on the first amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma would recur; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would then be the pending question, the \nSenator is correct.\n\n[[Page S9729]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent, so that we can sequence \namendments, if the Senator from Oklahoma is willing, that we now set \naside the pending amendment and the underlying amendment to allow the \nSenator from Oklahoma to offer an additional amendment, and then part \nof that unanimous consent agreement will be we will then immediately, \nafter he lays down his second amendment, come back to the Bunning \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment will be set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1595\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send Senate amendment No. 1595 to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1595.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To revise requirements relating to closure of Vieques Naval \n                            Training Range)\n\n       On page 380, after line 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1066. CLOSURE OF VIEQUES NAVAL TRAINING RANGE.\n\n       (a) Conditional Authority.--Title XV of the Floyd D. Spence \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as \n     enacted by Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-348) is \n     amended by striking sections 1503 and 1504 and inserting the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 1503. CONDITIONS ON CLOSURE OF VIEQUES NAVAL TRAINING \n                   RANGE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Navy may close the Vieques Naval \n     Training Range on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, and \n     discontinue live-fire training at that range only if the \n     Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine \n     Corps jointly certify that the training range is no longer \n     needed for the training of units of the Navy and the Marine \n     Corps stationed or deployed in the eastern United States.''.\n       (b) Actions Related to Closure.--(1) Section 1505 of such \n     Act (114 Stat. 1654A-353) is amended--\n       (A) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:\n       ``(a) Time for Taking Actions.--The actions required or \n     authorized under this section may only be taken upon the \n     closure of the Vieques Naval Training Range by the Secretary \n     of the Navy.'';\n       (B) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``Not later than May \n     1, 2003, the`` and inserting ``The'';\n       (C) in subsection (d)(1), by striking ``pending the \n     enactment of a law that addresses the disposition of such \n     properties'';\n       (D) in subsection (e)(2), ``the referendum under section \n     1503'' and all that follows and inserting ``the Secretary of \n     the Navy closes the Vieques Naval Training Range.''; and\n       (E) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(f) Military Use of Transferred Property During War or \n     National Emergency.--\n       ``(1) Temporary transfer by secretary of the interior.--\n     Upon a declaration of war by Congress or a declaration of a \n     national emergency by the President or Congress, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall transfer the administrative \n     jurisdiction of the Live Impact Area to the Secretary of the \n     Navy notwithstanding the requirement to retain the property \n     under subsection (d)(1).\n       ``(2) Training authorized.--Training of the Armed Forces \n     may be conducted in the Live Impact Area while the property \n     is under the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of \n     the Navy pursuant to a transfer made under that paragraph \n     (1).

ACTIONS UPON CLOSURE OF THE VIEQUES NAVAL \n                   TRAINING RANGE.''.\n\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1507(c) of such Act is \n     amended by striking ``the issuance of a proclamation \n     described in section 1504(a) or''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. This amendment is one further that there may be some \nopposition to and it is going to require the yeas and nays, but I will \nbriefly say what we are doing with this. The issue of the Vieques \ntraining range has been a contentious one now for a number of years. We \ndid resolve this in such a way that there would be a referendum that \nwould take place on November 6, where the eligible voters among the \npopulation of 9,300 people on the Island of Vieques would vote as to \nwhether or not the Navy should continue naval training operations on \nthe range.\n  A lot of things have happened since then. I agreed with that. That \nwas my language in the Defense authorization bill last year. However, \nsince that time we have found we are deploying east coast deployments \nto the Persian Gulf. A lot of these battle groups have not been able to \nhave adequate training. Since that time we had the war declared upon us \nby the terrorists on the 11th of September. That has changed \neverything.\n  Since that time we have had Puerto Rico come and say they want to \nsupport the training of our troops. We currently have, being debated \nnow, a resolution in the legislature in Puerto Rico that is going to \nsay: ``We Puerto Ricans, as proud American citizens with the same \nresponsibilities as our brethren in the continental United States, have \nthe obligation of contributing to this fight, allowing and supporting \nmilitary training and exercises on the island municipality of \nVieques.''\n  Vieques is a municipality of Puerto Rico.\n  What we believe is a solution to this now and should be put on this \nbill as an amendment is language that would do away with the referendum \nof November 6. There are several reasons why. One reason is the policy \nis not a good policy. I never believed it was. Prior to the events of \nSeptember 11, we thought this was something that would resolve that \nissue.\n  This amendment would do two things. It would do away with the \nreferendum of the 6th of November; two, it would say we would continue \nto do as the law provides today, until such time as both the CNO of the \nNavy and the Commandant of the Marine Corps sign a certificate saying \nthat training is no longer needed. I cannot think of a worse time to \nforce our military to stop training than right now. Right now we should \nbe enhancing training.\n  That is a very simple amendment, one to which there may be some \nopposition. However, it merely says that, at least in the time being, \ndo not have a referendum, but continue to train our troops as they are \ndeployed in these battle group deployments, from the east coast and \nelsewhere, until such time as the CNO and the Commandant agree that \ntraining is no longer necessary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator has received, in accordance \nwith your request, a communication from the Department of Defense.\n  Does the Senator wish to include it in the Record?\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, I will read the last paragraph:\n       Senator Inhofe's amendment, SA 1595, supports the Defense \n     Department's request to repeal the local referendum and \n     provides for transfer of the eastern property to the \n     Department of Interior, following cessation of training. \n     Unlike the Department's proposed legislation on Vieques, \n     however, the amendment does not provide for a date certain \n     departure. Nonetheless, the Department believes that the \n     amendment does not constrain the Department's ability to \n     define and meet its training needs and the target departure \n     date may still be achieved. To the extent that the amendment \n     offered by Senator Inhofe, SA 1595, is not inconsistent with \n     the Department's legislative proposal and underlying intent, \n     we interpose no objection.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Navy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, 24 September 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: As you are aware, the Department of \n     Defense previously submitted proposed legislation that would \n     eliminate the requirement in Section 1503 of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001, requiring a referendum among the Vieques electorate on \n     whether the people of Vieques approve or disapprove of the \n     continuation of training beyond May 1, 2003. Consistent with \n     the commitments made by both the President and the Department \n     of the Navy, the Navy is actively planning to discontinue \n     training operations on the island of Vieques in May of 2003 \n     and is committed to identifying alternatives to Vieques from \n     both a geographical and technological standpoint to provide \n     effective military training. Consequently, a referendum \n     regarding continuation of training past this point in time is \n     no\n\n[[Page S9730]]\n\n     longer necessary. I still believe that conducting a local \n     referendum on issues critical to the Department of Defense \n     sets a bad precedent and strikes at the heart of military \n     readiness. Enacting legislation that does away with this \n     requirement will avoid such a precedent and potential domino \n     effect on our other military training ranges.\n       Senator Inhofe's amendment, SA 1595, supports the Defense \n     Department's request to repeal the local referendum and \n     provides for transfer of the eastern property to the \n     Department of Interior, following cessation of training. \n     Unlike the Department's proposed legislation on Vieques, \n     however, the amendment does not provide for a date certain \n     departure. Nonetheless, the Department believes that the \n     amendment does not constrain the Department's ability to \n     define and meet its training needs and the target departure \n     date may still be achieved. To the extent that the amendment \n     offered by Senator Inhofe, SA 1595, is not inconsistent with \n     the Department's legislative proposal and underlying intent, \n     we interpose no objection.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gordon R. England,\n                                            Secretary of the Navy.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am happy to respond to any questions, and if there are \nno questions, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The amendment I will not bring up is the amendment having \nto do with incorporating the language of our energy policy in this \nbill.\n  The question could be asked, Is this an issue that should be put into \nthe Defense authorization bill? I served as chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Readiness Subcommittee for 5 years. I can assure Members \nthere is no time in our history that should be more clear that we will \nhave to do something about our dependency on the Middle East for our \nability to fight a war. Right now, we are 56.6-percent dependent upon \nforeign sources for our ability to fight a war. That is not acceptable.\n  I remember back in the early 1980s during the Reagan administration I \ncriticized the Republicans and Democrats alike. We have been trying to \nget an energy policy since the Reagan administration. We tried at that \ntime. We introduced one. We were unable to get it done.\n  We tried during the Bush administration, certainly thinking that a \nPresident coming out of the oil patch would understand why we cannot be \ndependent upon foreign sources for our ability to fight a war. We were \nunsuccessful. We were unsuccessful during the Clinton administration. \nWe started during the Carter administration.\n  I have an amendment that will put a policy into effect. I have two \namendments. One adopts the House language and the other is to adopt the \nlanguage of the energy bill that is proposed in the Senate. I will not \nbring it up and debate it tonight because I want to do it when \neverybody is here. This is very significant.\n  Right now, on a daily basis, we are becoming more and more dependent \nupon foreign sources for our energy supply. By the end of this decade \nit is projected to be in excess of 60 percent. We will become 60-\npercent dependent upon foreign sources for our ability to fight a war.\n  I remember a few years ago Don Hodel, Secretary of the Interior, and \nI used to go to consumption states and make speeches as to how the \noutcome of every war--back to and including the First World War--has \nbeen who controlled the energy supplies. We have gone through the 1990 \nwar, the Persian Gulf war. In 1991, we remember the words of Saddam \nHussein who said, ``if we had waited for 10 years to go into Kuwait, \nthe Americans would not have intervened because we would have a missile \nwe could shoot over at them.'' And now we are dependent upon the Iraqis \nfor our imported oil.\n  It is very much an issue. There has been a lot of things floating \naround, including letters saying they are saying this has to do with \nANWR. It doesn't. I only say this is an issue that should be addressed \non this bill, and sometime tomorrow or the next day I will debate this \nand call for a vote on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are ready to handle a series of amendments and \ncomplete our work on this bill before the Senate tonight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1660\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I offer an amendment on behalf of myself and my \ndistinguished colleague, the chairman, Mr. Levin. This amendment would \neliminate the cap costs that the Congress very wisely and appropriately \nplaced on the costs of the overall renovation of the Department of \nDefense. Given the tragic attack on September 11--and, coincidentally, \nthat attack was directed at a portion of the building which was the \nsubject of the very contract on which this cap rests--we think it is \nwise, now, the chairman and I, that the cost of repairing this area of \nthe Department of Defense just would not enable us to work within this \ncap as now established in current law.\n  This amendment has been cleared by the chairman on his side. I \nbelieve we are ready to proceed on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 1660.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1660\n\n  (Purpose: To repeal the limitation on the cost of renovation of the \n                         Pentagon Reservation)\n\n       Strike section 2842, relating to a limitation on \n     availability of funds for renovation of the Pentagon \n     Reservation, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2842. REPEAL OF LIMITATION ON COST OF RENOVATION OF \n                   PENTAGON RESERVATION.\n\n       Section 2864 of the Military Construction Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1997 (division B of Public Law 104-201; 110 \n     Stat. 2806) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support Senator Warner's amendment. It \nis obvious the circumstances have changed in a massive way. Senator \nWarner knows, probably more than anybody I know of, firsthand, what the \nnecessity is out there. We certainly support his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, once again, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague. He and I went out there to the Department of Defense just a \nmatter of a few hours following that attack to join the Secretary of \nDefense. I think it is important we adopt this amendment, so I urge the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1660) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1661 through 1670, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk now 10 amendments and \nask they be considered and agreed to en bloc and any statements \nrelating to the amendments be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes amendments numbered 1661 through 1670, en \n     bloc.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The chairman has correctly represented to the Senate the \nstatus of this bloc of amendments. We concur, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment to the \nFiscal Year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act which will serve to \nassist our military in their continuing transformation into a more \nefficient fighting force, ready to meet the threats of the 21st \ncentury. It amends the National Technology Transfer Act of 1995 in \norder that the Federal Government can use appropriated funds for \npersonnel to participate in meetings to set technical standards for \nproducts, manufacturing processes, and management practices of interest \nto the military. Specifically, it eliminates an obscure technical \nrestriction established by an 89-year-old statute so that the Federal \nGovernment will be able to cover the expenses of those employees \nparticipating in standards activities critical to the Department.\n  The amendment is consistent with previous act of Congress, Department \nof Defense policy and Governmentwide policy to support efforts to \nreplace Government-unique standards wherever possible with standards \ndeveloped jointly with the private sector and other interested parties. \nThere are major Federal savings and national security improvements that \ncan result from this participation. I am proud to be joined by Senator \nSantorum in this effort. I thank my colleagues' for their support for \nthis technical amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the aftermath of the despicable terrorist\n\n[[Page S9733]]\n\nattacks continue to weigh heavily on our hearts, and I again express my \ndeepest sympathy to those lost and injured in the attacks, as well as \ntheir families. We will do everything in our power to bring all of \nthose responsible to justice and I am confident that our military, both \nactive and reserve, stand ready to act in response to act. Congress \nwill see that they are given all they need to accomplish the missions \nthey are given.\n  This bill increases defense spending. It focuses on improving \nreadiness, and also improving service member quality of life. It \ncontains the largest defense spending increase in many years. At $329 \nbillion, a $33 billion increase over last year, this bill represents a \nsignificant new investment in service members and the nation's \nsecurity.\n  As chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I have strongly advocated \nstrengthening Navy, Marine Corps and Strategic Lift forces. The \nworldwide presence of our armed forces requires at least a 300-ship \nnavy. The Navy is facing a serious shortfall in the numbers of ships \navailable to meet the Nation's future security needs. This bill fully \nfunded the President's request for most major programs, including the \nVirginia Class attack submarine, the DDG-51 AEGIS Destroyer, research \nand development for the DD-21 land attack destroyer, and 13 additional \nC-17 airlift aircraft.\n  The bill also supports a series of transformation initiatives, \nespecially the Trident submarine conversion. The Navy's budget called \nfor converting only two of these submarines. The bill includes an \nincrease of $307 million to reserve the option of converting all four \nsubmarines. I believe that these converted submarines can make a \nsignificant contribution to the Navy in the future.\n  The committee also considered the V-22 Osprey program and the future \nrole of this aircraft. We agree that the production line needs to \nremain open and we have authorized the minimum sustaining production of \nnine aircraft. It is the committee's belief that the minimum sustaining \nrate is nine rather than twelve aircraft. This reduced number of \naircraft will also limit future retrofit costs that the existing V-22 \naircraft will require. The committee also recommended the program for \nthe Air Force V-22 version, the CV-22, be restructured by removing the \nfunding for acquisition, but supporting research and development.\n  Our Armed Forces continue to operate and train at a more robust level \nthan at any other time during this Nation's history. At this moment, \nservice members are being mobilized for possible action in the current \ncrisis. They are already risking their lives daily by actively \nenforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq and patrolling the Arabian Gulf \nfor oil smugglers. Our men and women in uniform are overseas providing \nstability in Kosovo, and they are now involved in bringing peace to \nMacedonia. They are also monitoring the demilitarized zone in Korea, \nand they are assisting in the battle against drugs in Central and South \nAmerica. These activities are in addition to the daily exercises they \nconduct at home and with our allies overseas to maintain the readiness \nof our forces.\n  All of America's men and women in uniform put our Nation's interests \nabove their own. When called upon, they risk their lives for our \nfreedom. As a nation, we often take this sacrifice for granted, until \nwe are reminded of it again by tragic events such as the vicious attack \non the Pentagon.\n  They face constant risks in training for the many missions that they \nare called upon to carry out. This past year, seven Army personnel lost \ntheir lives when their helicopters crashed in a night training exercise \nin Hawaii. Two Marine AV-8B pilots died in a training flight in North \nCarolina. We lost 21 National Guardsmen when their transport plane went \ndown in Florida. The cost of training in the name of peace and security \nis high, and we are very proud of the brave men and women who accept \nthese risks to defend our Nation and our ideals.\n  In this bill, we continue the efforts to support service members and \ntheir families. The bill grants a minimum of a 5 percent pay raise, \nwith personnel in certain pay grades receiving raises between 6 and 10 \npercent. This raise is the largest since 1982, and the third straight \nyear that the committee has authorized a significant pay raise above \nthe rate of inflation.\n  The committee also recognizes the importance of providing service \nmembers with decent housing and work conditions. The bill provides $451 \nmillion above the budget request for military family housing and \nfacilities.\n  The bill also expedites the timeline for the gradual reduction to \nzero of the out-of-pocket housing costs for service members living off \nbase, from 2005 to 2003. We also provide additional funding to cover \nthe costs of military health care for service members and their \nfamilies. These are important quality of life improvements that our \ndedicated, well-trained men and women deserve, and they are important \nsteps in retaining them in the armed forces.\n  The bill allows the transferability of GI bill benefits. Senator \nCleland's dedication to this issue has resulted in the authorization of \n$30 million to allow the transfer of up to 18 months of unused G.I. \nBill education benefits to a family member, in return for a commitment \nof four more years of service.\n  The bill also includes significant parts of the Tricare Modernization \nAct, which I introduced earlier this year, to ensure that disabled \nfamily members of active duty service men and women have access to the \nhealth care they deserve. Early last year, a young man in the Air Force \ndrove 12 hours with his wife and disabled four-year old daughter to \ntestify to Congress about the need to make Medicaid more accessible, \nbecause the military health care system did not adequately meet his \ndaughter's needs. In order to continue her eligibility for Medicaid, he \ncould not accept a promotion to a higher rank.\n  No member of the Armed Forces should ever be put in the position of \nhaving to choose between health care for their disabled child and \nserving our country. These families should not have to rely on Medicaid \nto obtain health care that works.\n  The Tricare Modernization Act has been endorsed by The Military \nCoalition, a consortium of armed forces and veterans' organizations \nrepresenting 5.5 million current and former members of the military and \ntheir families. We need to correct the injustices that these families \nhave suffered by integrating services for disabled dependents into the \nbasic military health benefit program, so that no medically necessary \nservices are denied.\n  Last year, the Armed Services Committee heeded the needs of our \nmilitary retirees, and addressed their number-one priority--the cost of \nprescription drugs. This benefit, which began in April, lets all men \nand women in uniform know that we care about their service.\n  The bill also provides an additional $217 million for protection of \nour forces against terrorism, for counter-terrorism training, research \nand development to protect our forces against attacks by weapons of \nmass destruction, and to help the services in their efforts to support \ncivilian agencies in the battle against terrorism.\n  The bill also recognizes the very real threat we face from biological \nweapons. It addresses these threats with significant investments in \nscience and technology for chemical and biological defense and medical \ncounter-measures. These additional investments will support needed \nresearch on chemical and biological detection technology and \ndecontamination. It will also support lifesaving research on medical \ntreatments, vaccines, anti-toxins, and advanced diagnostic technology.\n  In addition, the cyber threat to national security is very real, and \nour armed forces must be better prepared to deal with this threat and \nto protect their information systems. The bill adds $5 million to the \n$7.9 million requested to address this serious and growing threat.\n  The bill also takes an important stand to begin the process of \ncleaning up unexploded ordnance. At many active and closed military \nbases, UXO is a major challenge. The bill addresses these hazards by \nincluding a major provision requiring the Department of Defense to \nestablish specific accounts to fund the cleanup of UXO at military \nbases across the country, which clearly poses a hazard to civilians, \nmilitary personnel, the environment, and the safe use of live-fire \nranges necessary for a high state of military readiness.\n\n[[Page S9734]]\n\nThese new accounts are essential to demonstrate the Department's \ncommitment to safety, the environment, and responsible use of its \nfacilities.\n  Finally, on the issue of ballistic missile defense, the committee \nresponsibly cut back the President's $8.3 billion request for research, \ndevelopment and testing of a ballistic missile defense system by $1.3 \nbillion. The administration's request was clearly in excess of what the \nBallistic Missile Defense Office could have reasonably allocated in the \ncoming year, and the committee was right to give priority to other \nmilitary programs. The committee also took a strong stand against \ntesting that would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  It makes no sense to rush forward prematurely with tests that will \nviolate the treaty, or with deployment of a missile defense system, \nwhen there are serious doubts about whether it will work. Our European \nallies and Russia continue to be skeptical about abandoning the ABM \nTreaty and deploying a missile defense system. We should work with our \nallies and continue consultations with Russia, not act unilaterally or \nestablish arbitrary deadlines.\n  It is disappointing that these important ballistic missile defense \nprovisions were removed from the bill we are currently considering. \nThese issues are, and will continue to be, very important.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their \nleadership in dealing with the many challenges facing our nation on \nnational and homeland defense. This bill keeps the faith with the 2.2 \nmillion men and women who make up our active duty, guard, and reserve \nforces. This legislation is vital to the Nation's security, and I urge \nthe Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1438, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2002. As the ranking \nRepublican on the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I \nwould like to thank subcommittee Chairman Landrieu and her staff for \ntheir cooperation in the preparation of this bill. While I may have \nsome concerns with several issues contained within the legislation, I \ndo support the bill and urge its adoption by the full Senate.\n  At this time I would like to take a moment to highlight a few \nimportant issues which are under the jurisdiction of the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee.\n  In particular, the legislation continues to build upon the \ncommittee's past efforts to strengthen and streamline the Department of \nDefense's combating terrorism program. As we were tragically reminded \nby the events on September 11 and last year's bombing of the U.S.S. \nCole, it is vital that we continue to focus on this growing threat.\n  As we all know, the threat of attacks on our national and defense \ninformation systems seem to grow daily. Last year, Senator Warner \nproposed an innovative scholarship program to encourage young people to \npursue careers with the Federal Government in the information assurance \narea. I am gratified that our collective efforts this year have \nincreased support for this innovative program, as well as other \nDepartmental efforts to enhance the security of our critical \ninformation systems. However, I am concerned that the funding level \nincluded in the bill for the scholarship program may not be sufficient.\n  Since the creation of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee in 1999, I have worked hard to ensure that our \nnonproliferation and threat reduction programs in Russia are fulfilling \ntheir national security objectives. This year I have worked hard to \nincorporate the kind of oversight I believe is essential if these \nnonproliferation programs are going to produce the desired results.\n  This committee has a long history of supporting a strong and stable \nscience and technology program and I was pleased to see the \nadministration's budget request of $8.8 billion in this important area. \nThis $1.2 billion increase over last year's request is the first step \ntowards achieving the Secretary's goal of having science and technology \nprograms make up 3 percent of the overall defense budget. It remains \ncritical that we continue our support of a vibrant science and \ntechnology base.\n  I strongly urge the rapid adoption of this important legislation. Our \nNation is faced with a daunting task ahead and now is the time to show \nour strong support for the men and women in the armed services who so \nproudly and bravely serve our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9734-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

A man believed to be gay was sexually \nassaulted with a stick, struck by the assailant's truck and abandoned \nin a remote area. Todd I. Klevgaard, 27, was charged with felony \nassault.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9734-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9734-S9735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AUTOMATIC MEMBER PAY INCREASE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is a great sense of unity across \nthe Nation as we begin to recover from the events of September 11. The \nPresident's speech last week gave both comfort and strength to the \nAmerican people and to people around the globe.\n  I have been heartened by the bipartisan unity demonstrated by \nCongress as it acts to respond to the human and economic devastation, \nand we will need to maintain that unity as we ask for the sacrifices \nnecessary to end this business.\n  Given all that has happened and all that will happen, it is all the \nmore inappropriate for Congress to accept a $4,900 backdoor pay raise.\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\n  Of course, I believe the automatic pay raise is never appropriate. As \nmy colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing to have the power to \nraise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our \nconstituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual \nis good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote on the Record.\n  This process of pay raises without accountability must end. It is \noffensive. It is wrong. And it is unconstitutional.\n  In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments advocated \nby James Madison that included what has become our Bill of Rights, the \nHouse of Representatives passed an amendment to the Constitution \nproviding that Congress could not raise its pay without an intervening \nelection. Almost exactly 212 years ago, on September 9, 1789, the \nSenate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, Congress \nsubmitted the amendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the States.\n  The 27th amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I try to honor that limitation in my own practices. In my own case, \nthroughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators \nreceive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return \nto the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a \ncost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don't \ntake a raise until my bosses, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at \nthe ballot box. That is the spirit of the 27th amendment.\n  This practice must end, and earlier this year I reintroduced \nlegislation to end the automatic cost-of-living adjustment for \ncongressional pay.\n  But we should not wait to enact that law to say ``no'' to the $4,900 \npay raise that will go into effect beginning next year.\n  To that end, I call upon the leadership of both parties to work \ntogether, in the spirit of the bipartisan unity we have seen flourish \nin recent days, to stop the pay raise that is scheduled to go into \neffect in 2002.\n  I very much hope it will not be necessary to fight this issue out on \nthe floor of the Senate. I have an amendment prepared to stop this \nbackdoor pay raise, and am willing to offer it if that becomes \nnecessary, but I want to give our leadership the opportunity to respond \nand to act together.\n  We are spending the hard-earned tax dollars of millions of Americans \nto recover from the horrific events of September 11 and to ensure that \nit does not happen again.\n  And right this minute, our Nation is sending the men and women of our \nArmed Services into harm's way.\n  This is not the time for Congress to accept a pay raise, and I am \nconfident that upon reflection, Members of the Senate and the other \nbody will want to stop this automatic pay raise from taking effect.\n  Let's stop this backdoor pay raise right now, and then, let's enact \nlegislation to end this practice once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9735-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9735-S9736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE WORLD SITUATION AFTER THE TERRORIST STRIKE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a speech delivered by a member of the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade, Evan Wallach. A graduate of Cambridge and a \nNevadan, this expert international jurist and expert in the law of war, \nwith clarity reviews the world situation, only days after the terrorist \nstrike of September 11, 2001.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Speech, 21 September, 2001 Hughes Hall College, Cambridge\n\n       It is good to be home. Whether it is because we as peoples \n     share the same language and laws, value the same rights of \n     humanity, and pray to the same God, or because I have \n     developed so many ties and deep friendships since I first set \n     foot in these halls some twenty-one years ago, I cannot feel \n     myself a stranger in this house and in this fair land. It is \n     good to be home and to share with you our common hopes and \n     our common tragedy.\n       When President Richards invited me to speak here some \n     months past, I had in mind a few words about my personal \n     history at Hughes, and some specific thoughts about how much \n     Cambridge has meant to the cause of freedom. I meant to speak \n     about how England stood alone and undaunted in those dark \n     days of May and June, 1940, as the only bulwark between the \n     free world and the dark night of unending barbarism. Long \n     before we Americans were forced into the affair, even before \n     her empire could effectively rally to the colors, this island \n     held the line; and this small town, with its great \n     university, was at the center of that resistance, providing \n     many of its pilots, much of its intelligence apparatus, and a \n     great deal of its military leadership.\n       My original thought was to come here to thank you yet \n     again, and to speak about the links forged in that crucible \n     of war which bind us still.\n       That was before Tuesday, September 11.\n       On that morning I was talking to my secretary Linda Sue as \n     she prepared coffee. When we heard the first explosion I \n     thought it was a bomb. We were relieved when the television \n     said it was an airplane. It had to be an accident. We watched \n     the second aircraft fly into the WTC. In one second it \n     changed everything. We knew we were at war.\n       New Yorkers reacted very well. They reminded me so much of \n     Londoners in the Blitz. Our court is exactly a half mile from \n     the WTC. There was no panic. People helped someone when they \n     stumbled, urged one another on, and were kind to strangers. \n     It was as Dickens says, the best of times and the worst of \n     times.\n       We are much a family, we Americans, a very large, very \n     extended and often very dysfunctional family. When our \n     brothers and sisters come into harm's way we react as does \n     any family; we cry, we grieve, we pray, we hold each other \n     close, and then we go on living.\n       Make no mistake about it, we will go on. The continental \n     Europeans have a conception of America which has a strong \n     kernel of truth. We are still, somewhat, the vaguely \n     isolationist, happy-go-lucky plough boy who can be insulted \n     by foreign waiters, euchred by a sidewalk grifter, blow his \n     month's pay on a pretty bar girl, and still go home convinced \n     he had a real nice time in the big city.\n       But when you slap us across the face, we know we've been \n     wronged and it is not in our nature to slap you in return. \n     Rather, our national instinct is to destroy your armies, \n     drive your population into exile, pillage your cities and \n     plow salt into the ground where they stood; in short, to act \n     like Europeans. Then, however, being Americans we pass out \n     chewing gum and foreign aid to help rebuild what we just \n     destroyed.\n       That baser instinct, however, is fortunately also mitigated \n     by one equally strong which we suckled at the breast of our \n     mother country with the milk of Magna Carta. I refer, of \n     course, to the sanctity of the rule of law. As Edmund Burke \n     said in 1775: ``In this character of the Americans a love of \n     freedom is the predominating feature which marks and \n     distinguishes the whole . . . This fierce spirit of liberty \n     is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any \n     other people of the earth [because] the people of the \n     colonies are descendants of Englishmen.''\n       We learned our lessons well at your knee. We learned from \n     Entick v. Carrington that though a citizen lives in the \n     rudest hut with no door or window, though the wind may blow \n     through and the rain may pour in, the King of England with \n     all his armies may not pass over his thresh hold without an \n     invitation to enter.\n       We have taken the rights and liberties of Englishmen and \n     extended them even further. We have enshrined them in a \n     written Constitution and from time to time, as we have done \n     wrong to individuals and learned our lesson from that wrong \n     doing, we have added additional protections.\n       We have been attacked by people from one particular part of \n     the world. I am not an Arabist or a scholar of that region's \n     history to any great degree but I think I can say those who \n     planned this attack are mistaken about the United States in \n     many ways. I believe they thought to wound us deeply by \n     attacking our national symbols, and that they viewed the WTC \n     as one such symbol. They thought, I imagine, that as a \n     capitalist state, worshipping the almighty dollar, we would \n     reel back, shaken and demoralized, by the loss of this great \n     temple of Mammon. Truly they mistake us.\n       We reel back, not at the loss of a building, because \n     bricks, and mortar can always be restacked; we usually tear \n     down our great edifices every few decades or so anyway, to \n     construct something larger and more modern. What wounded us, \n     what cut us to our souls, what enraged us beyond the \n     comprehension of these bombers, was the loss of five thousand \n     of our sons and daughters, moms, and dads, firemen, \n     policemen, janitors, bankers, doctors and lawyers. For this \n     we shall not forgive the perpetrators; this we shall never \n     forget. They are sadly mistaken.\n       If I could say one thing to those attackers and to their \n     followers it would be this: ``Beware of false prophets, which \n     come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are \n     ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits . . . \n     Every tree that bringeth not forth\n\n[[Page S9736]]\n\n     good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. Wherefore, \n     by their fruits shall ye know them.''\n       I trust we will not again make the mistake of the Second \n     World War and presume that because an individual or his \n     forefathers came from that region or worships our common God \n     in its way, that he is anything other than someone entitled \n     to mutual rights and mutual respect. There will be no mass \n     roundups based on race, there will be no mass internment \n     camps based on religion. We are not the same people as we \n     were in 1941, and thank God, we are not the same people as \n     those with whom we are at war.\n       I take some pride, that as a member of the federal \n     judiciary I have taken an oath to do equal justice to all who \n     come before me, and I have great confidence that not only \n     shall we honor that oath, but that the executive branch will \n     equally honor its obligation to protect the rights of those \n     who reside within our nation whatever their race or religion. \n     If restrictions there are, and there will be, if some \n     limitations arise on the freedom from government interference \n     with our ability to travel, and there will be, they will be \n     applied equally. If individual officials make mistakes simply \n     because of someone's color or creed, we will correct those \n     mistakes as quickly as possible and apologize for the error. \n     We will all face the burden together, we shall spread it as \n     fairly as possible, and we shall bear it with quiet \n     determination and good humor, for we are at war.\n       Make no mistake about it, we are at war. It is a different \n     war than those of the recent past, and we Americans tend to \n     be so forward looking that we confine our vision only to the \n     front, but there is historical precedent for what we are \n     about to do. When our nation was still in its infancy we \n     fought an undeclared war with your neighbors across the \n     Channel, we sent our young navy to the Mediterranean to \n     battle the corsairs of Barbary, and over the years we have \n     chased bandits and pirates beyond our borders whenever \n     our national interest required it. Often, and for many \n     decades, we shared that job with the Royal Navy.\n       I cannot, in this English language, say anything about this \n     endeavor upon which we now embark in any way better than my \n     hero who led your fight for civilization in the last world \n     war. Let me quote from two speeches by Mr. Churchill: ``There \n     shall be no halting or half measures, there shall be no \n     compromise or parley. These gangs of bandits have sought to \n     darken the light of the world; have sought to stand between \n     the common people and their inheritance. They shall \n     themselves be cast into the pit of death and shame, and only \n     when the earth has been cleansed and purged of their crimes \n     and villainy shall we turn from the task they have forced \n     upon us, a task which we were reluctant to undertake, but \n     which we shall now most faithfully and punctiliously \n     discharge.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``We do not war primarily with races as such. Tyranny is \n     our foe, whatever trappings or disguise it wears, whatever \n     language it speaks, be it external or internal, we must \n     forever be on our guard, ever mobilized, ever vigilant, \n     always ready to spring at its throat. In this, we march \n     together.''\n       In this indeed, I know, we shall march together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9736-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ELECTIONS IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Belarus and \nmy concerns about the country's recent presidential election.\n  Belarus has endured tremendous difficulties in its history. For \ncenturies, Belarus has been fought over, occupied and carved up. It has \nborne heavy losses, including the loss of over 2 million people, one \nquarter of its population, during WWII. Today, the Belarusian people \ncontinue to suffer devastating consequences from the 1986 Chernobyl \nnuclear disaster in neighboring Ukraine.\n  Belarus' declaration of independence in 1991 held great promise for a \nbetter future. As it broke from communist rule, it had the opportunity \nto build a free nation and become part of a peaceful, more secure \nEurope. The country began to embrace economic and political reforms and \ndemocratic principles. It courageously chose to be a nuclear-free \nstate, ratified the START Treaty, acceded to the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, and became a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace. It \nestablished a constitution and held its first Presidential election in \n1994.\n  Unfortunately, the prospect of democratic change in Belarus was \nquickly halted as its first President, Alexander Lukashenka, adopted \nincreasingly authoritarian policies, including amending the \nconstitution in a flawed referendum to extend his term and broaden his \npowers. Lukashenka's regime has been marked by a terrible human rights \nrecord that is progressively getting worse, with little respect for \nfreedom of expression, assembly and an independent media. A pattern of \ndisturbing disappearances of opposition leaders fails to be seriously \ninvestigated by authorities. The living conditions in Belarus are \ndeclining and Lukashenka's refusal to institute economic reforms has \nonly exacerbated the situation.\n  For months, nations throughout the world have been following closely \nthe events leading up to the presidential election which took place on \nSeptember 9, 2001, with hope that Lukashenka would take the necessary \nsteps to allow the election to be free, fair and transparent. The \nUnited States, the European Union and leaders of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, had urged Lukashenka to \nuphold his commitments to democratic principles as an OSCE member state \nand adhere to international election standards. Lukashenka was \nencouraged to seize this opportunity to signal to his European \nneighbors and the rest of the world that he is ready to change his \nheavy handed policies which have isolated his government and earned him \na reputation as the lone remaining dictator in Europe.\n  Unfortunately, this election process demonstrated that Lukashenka is \nstill unwilling to acknowledge the will of the Belarusian people. Much \nlike last year's parliamentary elections, this election was marred by \nreports of intimidation, harassment and fraud. The OSCE concluded that \nit failed to meet internationally recognized democratic election \nstandards.\n  Leading up to the election the opposition was denied fair and equal \naccess to state-controlled media coverage, the independent media was \nharassed, publishing houses were shut down, and newspapers reporting on \nthe opposition were seized. International observers from the Office for \nDemocratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODHIR, were denied entry into \nthe country for several weeks, and some were denied visas altogether, \nthus hindering efforts to establish a complete and thorough observation \nmission. Consequently, observation of critical aspects of a free and \ndemocratic election were missed, including the formation of election \ncommissions and the candidate registration process. As voters cast \ntheir ballots, efforts to conduct a parallel vote-count were thwarted \nwhen Belarusian authorities disqualified thousands of domestic election \nobservers. As a result, while most of Belarus' Central and Eastern \nEuropean neighbors continue to progress toward democracy and \nintegration into a peaceful, more secure Europe, Belarus remains on a \npath of its own, isolated from much of the world.\n  The United States must continue to pressure Lukashenka to change his \narchaic iron fist policies and adopt political reforms that espouse \ndemocratic principles such as respect for human rights, support for \ncivil society, and the rule of law. We must continue to urge his regime \nto institute desperately needed market-oriented economic reforms to \npromote trade, investment, growth and development in Belarus. We should \nalso engage the Russians in high-level discussions, urging them to \nraise these issues with their neighbor, to pressure Lukashenka to take \nthe steps he knows are necessary to facilitate normal, productive \nrelations between his country and the international community.\n  While putting pressure on the Belarusian Government, the U.S. should \nalso continue to support programs that will strengthen civil society \nand build democracy. The OSCE cited one positive observation about the \nPresidential election in Belarus: an increasingly pluralistic civil \nsociety is emerging and working to build the core institutions \nneglected by the state. The U.S. should continue to support programs \nthat will build upon this progress within civil society and help \nrestore democracy in Belarus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9736-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9736-S9737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of \nHispanic Heritage Month. Each year, from September 15 through October \n15, we recognize the contributions that Hispanic Americans bring to the \nUnited States. During this Hispanic Heritage Month, our Nation is in \nthe process of coming to terms with the unspeakably savage attacks of \nSeptember 11th and bracing for what may follow. Yet, in the wake of \nthese heinous terrorist acts, we have demonstrated one of our greatest\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\nstrengths, the ability to unite in times of crises. A major element of \nthat unity is recognizing and embracing our diversity. This month we do \nso by showing our respect and appreciation for the rich cultural \nheritage Hispanic Americans bring to our Nation.\n  Recent census figures show that there are more than 35 million \nHispanic Americans in this country. Their ranks have increased 58 \npercent through the last decade. Hispanic Americans will soon be the \nlargest minority group in the United States, making up 24 percent of \nthe population by 2050. In my State of Maryland, the number of \nHispanics grew more than 82 percent since 1990, making up more than 4 \npercent of the population statewide. I know that Hispanic Americans \nwill continue to bring great contributions to Maryland's culture and \neconomy.\n  Like America, the Hispanic culture within our country is diverse. \nWhether we look to the large Puerto Rican community in New York, the \ninflux of Central Americans to the Washington Metropolitan region, \nMexican Americans who have a long history in California, or Cuban \nAmericans who have made South Florida their home, Hispanic American \nculture reflects the breadth and depth of the cultures of their nations \nof origin. Hispanic Americans are changing the face of America, \nchallenging our tendency to view the world in terms of black and white \nand teaching us to accept ethnic diversity as well as racial \ndifferences.\n  I strongly believe that we will live up to the ideals of our Nation's \nfounding only when all Americans have equal access to the building \nblocks of a strong society, education, employment, health care, housing \nand political participation. We must make sure that basic services and \nopportunities are available to Hispanic Americans. And, as this segment \nof the population grows, it will be increasingly important for \neducators, hospitals, civil services, and financial institutions to be \nable to communicate effectively, provide bilingual materials where \nappropriate, and be aware of cultural differences when delivering \nservices. Hispanic Americans deserve to take full part in their \ncommunities and language barriers should not prevent them from doing \nso.\n  Throughout our history, different groups have come to this country \ncontributing their culture, values and strengths to make the United \nStates the strong diverse country that it is. The story of immigrants \nsearching for a better life is a story that has been replayed countless \ntimes throughout our history, sustaining the growth of America since \nher beginning. Hispanic Americans continue this tradition and I am \nproud to have the opportunity to recognize their heritage this \nmonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9737-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF DR. HENRY WALL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nservice of Dr. Henry Wall to New Mexican veterans. Dr. Wall recently \nretired from the Artesia Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient \nclinic after nearly 50 years of service to meeting the health care \nneeds of Artesia residents.\n  Dr. Wall graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1953 and moved \nto Artesia shortly thereafter. Dr. Wall's private practice spanned from \n1955 to 1991, and he became well known for his dedication to patient \ncare, as well as for his maternity practice. In fact, many Artesia \nresidents remind him that ``You delivered me, my children, and my \nmom.''\n  In 1989, the Artesia community-based clinic was founded. The clinic \nwas an outgrowth of legislation that I sponsored to establish six \nsatellite veterans outpatient centers. I believed that veterans should \nhave access to quality health care at a convenient location. Dr. Wall \nalso saw this opening as an opportunity to serve the veterans of \nsoutheastern New Mexico. He joined the clinic's staff and brought his \ncare and expertise to the many veterans in the local community. Dr. \nWall is a veteran himself, having served in the Marine Corps in World \nWar II, and he understood the need to provide our Nation's veterans \nwith superior health care.\n  I wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Henry Wall for his years of \nservice to Artesia, and to the veteran population, in particular. I \nhave frequently stated that ensuring the health and well-being of the \nservicemen and women, who have placed their lives in harm's way in \norder to secure our freedoms, should be a commitment that Americans do \nnot take lightly. I am proud that Dr. Wall has done his part to live up \nto this commitment. I am sincerely grateful for his service to New \nMexico's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9737-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARGARET SMITH\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today, I would like to take the \nopportunity to pay special tribute to an exceptional person, Sister \nMargaret Smith of Park Rapids, Minnesota. With great pride, Minnesotans \nhave named Sister Margaret Minnesota's Outstanding Older Worker for \nthis year. This is an honor richly deserved, for Sister Margaret has \nspent 55 of her 80 years serving in a variety of capacities at the St. \nJoseph's Area Health Services, in Park Rapids.\n  The award for Minnesota's Outstanding Older Walker is conferred by \nGreen Thumb, Inc., the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, and \nthe Minnesota Department of Labor.\n  Sister Margaret is virtually an institution, a pillar at St. Joseph's \nwhere she has touched the lives of thousands of people. With her humor, \nwarmth, feeling for people, and dedication, she has been a support not \nonly for appreciative patients and their families, but also for her \ncoworkers at St. Joseph's. Indeed, one of the affectionate nicknames \nconferred on her by the medical staff is ``The Presence.'' This is a \nfitting title, indeed: She was among the seven Sisters of Saint Joseph \nwho arrived in Park Rapids in 1946 to establish a hospital, is always \nwhere she is needed, and has never missed a single day of work. \nMoreover, Sister Margaret is nothing if not versatile. Having become a \ncertified radiology technician in 1945, she has worked in almost every \ndepartment of the hospital, including the lab and surgery; was once St. \nJoseph's administrator; and now sits on the Board of Directors.\n  Although she no longer performs procedures, she keeps the radiology \ndepartment running smoothly by scheduling patients' appointments; \nmaintaining statistics, information, and activities in superb order; \nworking with physicians to arrange radiology procedures; and \nsupervising the department's peer review. In the hospital at large, she \nkeeps her finger well placed on the pulse of the organization by \noverseeing quality control. Moreover, Sister Margaret is the hospital \nhistorian and photo archivist.\n  At St. Joseph's, Sister Margaret is called ``the rock, the \nfoundation.'' So loved is she for her steadfastness, lightheartedness, \nand solid values, that patients of 20 years ago return and ask to see \nher. At its genesis, the success of St. Joseph's and its founders might \nnot have been predicated. Rather, some in the community opposed a \nCatholic hospital. Today, sister Margaret says she believes her \npresence as a Sister of St. Joseph has made a difference. Caring for \npatients, she believes is sacred. Her philosophy has been to care for \nthe whole person, spiritfully as well as physically.\n  Sister Margaret was to have visited Washington, D.C., during the week \nof September 11, in order to attend the National Prime Time Awards \nProgram. Although our Nation's crisis made it impossible for this trip \nto take place, I would like to add my voice to those who have honored \nSister Margaret's constancy of heart and spirit in ministering to so \nmany patients for more than 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9737-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9737-S9738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF I.

Martin Mercado, who will be presented today \nwith the Small Business Administration's Minority Small Business Person \nof the Year Award. This prestigious award recognizes the vital role \nthat minority-owned small businesses play in creating jobs and \nproviding robust economic development in their communities. Mr. Mercado \nis the president of\n\n[[Page S9738]]\n\nMercado Construction in Albuquerque and is the perfect example of the \nimportant contributions that small business make to our economy.\n  Mr. Mercado is one of seven children of immigrant parents who left \ntheir native country of Mexico in search of better opportunities for \ntheir children. Although they had little knowledge of American culture \nor language, they were able to provide their children with a good \neducation and a bright future. I. Martin Mercado is a wonderful \nillustration of the American dream. Although he came from this humble \nbackground, he has built a successful business from the ground up.\n  Mercado Construction began in 1994 with only $20,000 in cash and one \nemployee. Mr. Mercado faced enormous difficulty in securing financing \nand credit because it was a start-up company. However, after the \nsuccessful completion of several projects, Mercado Construction was \nable to demonstrate its ability and began to gain access to working \ncapital. Through hard work and resolve, Mercado Construction has grown \nexponentially. It now has 23 employees and $4.8 million in revenues and \nhas contributed to many important development projects in the \nAlbuquerque and Rio Rancho communities.\n  Equally important, Mercado Construction shares its success with other \nNew Mexican small businesses. Mr. Mercado is an active member of the \nNew Mexico 8(a) Association and frequently subcontracts with and \npurchases materials from other minority- and women-owned small \nbusinesses. In fact, over 50 percent of Mercado Construction's \nsubcontractors are minority- and women-owned firms. Mercado \nConstruction is also an active participant in the Albuquerque \ncommunity. It has sponsored youth sports teams and contributes to \nseveral charities, such as the North Valley Little League and the Big \nBrothers/Big Sisters program.\n  I wish to congratulate Mercado Construction and its president, Mr. I. \nMartin Mercado, on being named a Minority Small Business Person of the \nYear. I am grateful for their contribution to economic development and \njob creation in New Mexico, and I look forward to their continued \ngrowth and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9738-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9738-S9739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON BLOCKING PROPERTY AND PROHIBITING TRANSACTIONS WITH PERSONS \nWHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 44\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (IEEPA), and section 301 of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631, I hereby report that I have exercised \nmy statutory authority to declare a national emergency in response to \nthe unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States by grave acts of \nterrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, \nincluding the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the World Trade \nCenter, New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania. I have also \nissued an Executive Order to help deal with this threat by giving the \nUnited States more powerful tools to reach the means by which \nterrorists and terrorist networks finance themselves and to encourage \ngreater cooperation by foreign financial institutions and other \nentities that may have access to foreign property belonging to \nterrorists or terrorist organizations.\n  The attacks of September 11, 2001, highlighted in the most tragic way \nthe threat posed to the security and national interests of the United \nStates by terrorists who have abandoned any regard for humanity, \ndecency, morality, or honor. Terrorists and terrorist networks operate \nacross international borders and derive their financing from sources in \nmany nations. Often, terrorist property and financial assets lie \noutside the jurisdiction of the United States. Our effort to combat and \ndestroy the financial underpinnings of global terrorism must therefore \nbe broad, and not only provide powerful sanctions against the U.S. \nproperty of terrorists and their supporters, but also encourage \nmultilateral cooperation in identifying and freezing property and \nassets located elsewhere.\n  This Executive Order is part of our national commitment to lead the \ninternational effort to bring a halt to the evil of terrorist activity. \nIn general terms, it provides additional means by which to disrupt the \nfinancial support network for terrorist organizations by blocking the \nU.S. assets not only of foreign persons or entities who commit or pose \na significant risk of committing acts of terrorism, but also by \nblocking the assets of their subsidiaries, front organizations, agents, \nand associates, and any other entities that provide services or \nassistance to them. Although the blocking powers enumerated it the \norder are broad, my Administration is committed to exercising them \nresponsibly, with due regard for the culpability of the persons and \nentities potentially covered by the order, and in consultation with \nother countries.\n  The specific terms of the Executive Order provide for the blocking of \nthe property and interests in property, including bank deposits, of \nforeign persons designated in the order or pursuant thereto, when such \nproperty is within the United States or in the possession or control of \nUnited States persons. In addition, the Executive Order prohibits any \ntransaction or dealing by United States persons in such property or \ninterests in property, including the making or receiving of any \ncontribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of such \ndesignated persons.\n  I have identified in an Annex to this order eleven terrorism \norganizations, twelve individual terrorist leaders, three charitable or \nhumanitarian organizations that operate as fronts for terrorist \nfinancing and support, and one business entity that operates as a front \nfor terrorist financing and support. I have determined that each of \nthese organizations and individuals have committed, supported, or \nthreatened acts of terrorism that imperil the security of U.S. \nnationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \nUnited States. I have also authorized the Secretary of State to \ndetermine and designate additional foreign persons who have committed \nor pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \nthreaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, \nforeign policy, or economy of the United States. Such designations are \nto be made in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nAttorney General.\n\n  The Executive Order further authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury \nto identify, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the \nAttorney General, additional persons or entities that:\n  --Are owned or controlled by, or that act for or on behalf of, those \n    persons designated in or pursuant to the order;\n  --Assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or \n    technological support for, or financial or other services to or in \n    support of acts of terrorism or those persons designated in or \n    pursuant to the order; or\n  --Are otherwise associated with those persons designated in or \n    pursuant to the order.\n  Prior to designating persons that fall within the latter two \ncategories, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to consult with \nany foreign authorities the Secretary of State deems appropriate, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral. Such consultation is intended to avoid the need for additional \ndesignations by securing bilateral or multilateral cooperation from \nforeign governments and foreign financial and other institutions. Such \nconsultation may include requests to foreign governments to seek, in \naccordance with international law and their domestic laws, information \nfrom financial institutions regarding terrorist property and to take \naction to deny terrorists the use of such property. The order also \nprovides broad authority, with respect to the latter two categories, \nfor the Secretary of the Treasury, in his\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\ndiscretion, and in consultation with the Secretary of State and the \nAttorney General, to take lesser action than the complete blocking of \nproperty or interests in property if such lesser action is deemed \nconsistent with the national interests of the United States. Some of \nthe factors that may be considered in deciding whether a lesser action \nagainst a foreign person is consistent with the national interests of \nthe United States include:\n  --The impact of blocking on the U.S. or international financial \n    system;\n  --The extent to which the foreign person has cooperated with U.S. \n    authorities;\n  --The degree of knowledge the foreign person had of the terrorist-\n    related activities of the designated person;\n  --The extent of the relationship between the foreign person and the \n    designated person; and\n  --The impact of blocking or other measures on the foreign person.\n  The Executive Order also directs the Secretary of State, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, and other agencies to make all relevant \nefforts to cooperate and coordinate with other countries, including \nthrough existing and future multilateral and bilateral agreements and \narrangements, to achieve the objectives of this order, including the \nprevention and suppression of acts of terrorism, the denial of the \nfinancing of and financial services to terrorists and terrorist \norganizations, and the sharing of intelligence about funding activities \nin support of terrorism.\n  In the Executive Order, I also have made determinations to suspend \notherwise applicable exemptions for certain humanitarian, medical, or \nagricultural transfers or donations. Regrettably, international \nterrorist networks make frequent use of charitable or humanitarian \norganizations to obtain clandestine financial and other support for \ntheir activities. If these exemptions were not suspended, the provision \nof humanitarian materials could be used as a loophole through which \nsupport could be provided to individuals or groups involved with \nterrorism and whose activities endanger the safety of United States \nnationals, both here and abroad.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState and the Attorney General, is authorized to issue regulations in \nexercise of my authorities under IEEPA to implement the prohibitions \nset forth in the Executive Order. All Federal agencies are also \ndirected to take actions within their authority to carry out the \nprovisions of the order, and, where applicable, to advise the Secretary \nof the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.\n  The measures taken here will immediately demonstrate our resolve to \nbring new strength to bear in our multifaceted struggle to eradicate \ninternational terrorism. It is my hope that they will point the way for \nother civilized nations to adopt similar measures to attack the \nfinancial roots of global terrorist networks.\n  In that regard, this Executive Order is an integral part of our \nlarger effort to form a coalition in the global war against terrorism. \nWe have already worked with nations around the globe and groups such as \nthe G-8, the European Union, and the Rio Group, all of which have \nissued strong statements of their intention to take measures to limit \nthe ability of terrorism groups to operate. In the next several weeks \nthe 33rd Session of the International Civil Aviation Organization \n(ICAO) General Assembly and other fora will focus on terrorism \nworldwide. It is our intention to work within the G-7/G-8, the ICAO, \nand other fora to reach agreement on strong concrete steps that will \nlimit the ability of terrorists to operate. In the G-7/G-8, the United \nStates will work with its partners, drawing on the G-8 Lyon Group on \nTransnational Crime, the G-8 Group on Counter-terrorism, the G-7 \nFinancial Action Task Force, and the existing G-8 commitments to build \nmomentum and practical cooperation in the fight to stop the flow of \nresources to support terrorism. In addition, both the Convention for \nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention for \nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings have been forwarded to the \nSenate, and I will be forwarding shortly to the Congress implementing \nlegislation for both Conventions.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. This \norder is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 24, \n2001.\n                                                      George W.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is to \ncontinue in effect beyond September 26, 2001.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, \nof a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), and 1173 (1998) continue \nto oblige all member states to maintain sanctions. Discontinuation of \nthe sanctions would have a prejudicial effect on the prospects for \npeace in Angola.

A bill to facilitate the security of the critical \ninfrastructure of the United States, to encourage the secure disclosure \nand protected exchange of critical infrastructure information, to \nenhance the analysis, prevention, and detection of attacks on critical \ninfrastructure, to enhance the recovery from such attacks, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1456\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Critical Infrastructure \n     Information Security Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The critical infrastructures that underpin our society, \n     national defense, economic\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\n     prosperity, and quality of life--including energy, banking \n     and finance, transportation, vital human services, and \n     telecommunications--must be viewed in a new context in the \n     Information Age.\n       (2) The rapid proliferation and integration of \n     telecommunications and computer systems have connected \n     infrastructures to one another in a complex global network of \n     interconnectivity and interdependence. As a result, new \n     vulnerabilities to such systems and infrastructures have \n     emerged, such as the threat of physical and cyber attacks \n     from terrorists or hostile states. These attacks could \n     disrupt the economy and endanger the security of the United \n     States.\n       (3) The private sector, which owns and operates the \n     majority of these critical infrastructures, and the Federal \n     Government, which has unique information and analytical \n     capabilities, could both greatly benefit from cooperating in \n     response to threats, vulnerabilities, and actual attacks to \n     critical infrastructures by sharing information and analysis.\n       (4) The private sector is hesitant to share critical \n     infrastructure information with the Federal Government \n     because--\n       (A) Federal law provides no clear assurance that critical \n     infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the \n     Federal Government will be protected from disclosure or \n     misuse;\n       (B) the framework of the Federal Government for critical \n     infrastructure information sharing and analysis is not \n     sufficiently developed; and\n       (C) concerns about possible prosecution under the antitrust \n     laws inhibit some companies from partnering with other \n     industry members, including competitors, to develop \n     cooperative infrastructure security strategies.\n       (5) Statutory nondisclosure provisions that qualify as \n     Exemption 3 statutes under section 552 of title 5, United \n     States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act), many of them longstanding, prohibit \n     disclosure of numerous classes of information under that Act. \n     These statutes cover specific and narrowly defined classes of \n     information and are consistent with the principles of free \n     and open government that that Act seeks to facilitate.\n       (6) Since the infrastructure information that this Act \n     covers is not normally in the public domain, preventing \n     public disclosure of this sensitive information serves the \n     greater good by promoting national security and economic \n     stability.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to foster improved security of \n     critical infrastructure by--\n       (1) promoting the increased sharing of critical \n     infrastructure information both between private sector \n     entities and between the Federal Government and the private \n     sector; and\n       (2) encouraging the private sector and the Federal \n     Government to conduct better analysis of critical \n     infrastructure information in order to prevent, detect, warn \n     of, and respond to incidents involving critical \n     infrastructure.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to facilitate the voluntary provision of emergency \nservices during commercial air flights; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Volunteers \nFor Safe Skies Act of 2001. This bill will allow our Nation's \nfirefighters, law enforcement officials, and emergency medical \ntechnicians, EMTs, to serve voluntarily on commercial aircraft to help \nensure the safety of the flying public. In many cases, these public \nservants already notify the crew when they board that they are fully \ntrained for emergencies and are willing to help out in the event they \nare needed.\n  This bill would simply streamline and organize this practice by \nrequiring the Federal Aviation Administration to create a program \nthrough which\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\nthese officials can register voluntarily and confidentially with the \nairlines. Our Nation's law enforcement officials, firefighters, and \nEMTs are trained to respond to and keep calm during emergencies and can \nbe of great assistance to an airline crew.\n  When I was back in Wisconsin following the vicious attacks on our \ncountry, I was proud of the outpouring of support and the number of \npeople who wanted to help the victims, their families, and the rescue \nworkers in the attacks. Across Wisconsin and the country, we have all \nheard the stories of people lining up to donate blood and food, of \ncharities being flooded with donations of goodwill. People are \nsearching for ways to help.\n  When I held one of my listening sessions last week, Fire Chief James \nReseburg and Deputy Police Chief Charles Tubbs of Beloit, WI, came up \nto me with an idea that they thought would help make our skies safer. \nPart of this idea was to create a registration system through which law \nenforcement officials, firefighters, and EMTs could register \nvoluntarily to serve in the event of an emergency on a commercial \nairplane. For example, if an official was going on vacation on an \nairplane, he would register with the airline beforehand to notify them \nthat they would have a trained public safety official on that flight. \nLike the sky marshals, only the crew would know when one of these \nvolunteers was on the plane.\n  Keep in mind that this would strictly be a volunteer program. This \nbill will help make our skies safer while at the same time making it \neasier for our police officers, firefighters, and EMTs to serve their \ncountry.\n  As many of my colleagues have stated, if the airline industry is to \nrecover fully from the events of September 11, 2001, we must make the \nflying public feel safe once again in our skies. The Volunteers For \nSafe Skies Act would help us do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/24/senate-section/article/S9745-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9745-S9746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1617.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government, through the Atomic Energy \n     Commission, acquired the Rocky Flats site in 1951 and began \n     operations there in 1952. The site remains a Department of \n     Energy facility. Since 1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats \n     site has changed from the production of nuclear weapons \n     components to cleanup and closure in a manner that is safe, \n     environmentally and socially responsible, physically secure, \n     and cost-effective.\n       (2) The site has generally remained undisturbed since its \n     acquisition by the Federal Government.\n       (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing increasing growth \n     and development, especially in the metropolitan Denver Front \n     Range area in the vicinity of the Rocky Flats site. That \n     growth and development reduces the amount of open space and \n     thereby diminishes for many metropolitan Denver communities \n     the vistas of the striking Front Range mountain backdrop.\n       (4) Some areas of the site contain contamination and will \n     require further response action.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved \n     important results in ensuring that weapons of mass \n     destruction, weapons-usable material and technology, and \n     weapons-related knowledge remain beyond the reach of \n     terrorists and weapons-proliferating states.\n       (2) Although these efforts are in the United States \n     national security interest, the effectiveness of these \n     efforts suffers from a lack of coordination within and among \n     United States Government agencies.\n       (3) Increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and \n     investment by the United States private sector in job \n     creation initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian \n     weapons scientists and technicians, are making an important \n     contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to weapons of \n     mass destruction remains beyond the reach of terrorists and \n     weapons-proliferating states.\n       (4) Increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union require the establishment \n     of a coordinating body to ensure that United States public \n     and private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure that \n     public spending on nonproliferation efforts by the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union is maximized to \n     ensure efficiency and further United States national security \n     interests.\n\n     SEC. 1233.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commercial Reusable In-\n     Space Transportation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 3502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest to encourage the \n     utilization of cost-effective, in-space transportation \n     systems, which would be developed and operated by the private \n     sector on commercial basis.\n       (2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, \n     enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end \n     of their useful lives, and increase the capability and \n     reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.\n       (3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance the economic well-being and national security of \n     the United States by reducing space operations costs for \n     commercial and national space programs and by adding new \n     space capabilities to space operations.\n       (4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including \n     orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude \n     orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite \n     orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of \n     satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to \n     increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to \n     geostationary and other high energy orbits.\n       (5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States \n     by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth \n     orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival \n     deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other \n     planets.\n       (6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to \n     deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic \n     loss to the United States, estimated at as much as \n     $3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000 in a recent 12-month period, \n     and present substantial concerns for the current backlog of \n     national space assets valued at $20,000,000,000.\n       (7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     provide new options for alternative planning approaches and \n     risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national \n     space assets.\n       (8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     developed by the private sector can provide in-space \n     transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, the Department of Defense, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need \n     for the United States to bear the cost of development of such \n     systems.\n       (9) The availability of limited direct loans and loan \n     guarantees, with the cost of credit risk to the United States \n     paid by the private-sector, is an effective means by which \n     the United States can help qualifying private-sector \n     companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing for \n     the development of commercial reusable in-space \n     transportation systems, while at the same time minimizing \n     Government commitment and involvement in the development of \n     such systems.\n\n     SEC. 3503.
