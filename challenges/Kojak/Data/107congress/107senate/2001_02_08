Mr. President, in these times of extraordinary \nbudgetary wealth, it is easy to forget it was less\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nthan a decade ago that a now famous comment was made that the U.S. \nGovernment would have deficits as far as the eye could see. Indeed, in \n1992 when the Clinton administration began, the annual deficit was $290 \nbillion and was projected to grow to $455 billion this year. Today, not \nonly has that annual deficit been eliminated but the budget surplus is \n$237 billion, for the first time in generations, 3 successive years of \nbudget surpluses, leading to the extraordinary ability of the U.S. \nTreasury by next year to have reduced the aggregate historic debt of \nthe United States by $600 billion.\n  It is now realistic to discuss the elimination of all outstanding \nU.S. Government debt--not in another generation, perhaps not even in \nanother decade, but in our own time, on our own watch.\n  This extraordinary change of the national finances has led to the \nrecognition that the Federal Government could generate a $3.1 trillion \nsurplus, even while excluding the accumulating Social Security surplus \nthat we mutually agree needs to be held in reserve. This is clearly a \nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Any generation of Members of the Senate \nonly could have dreamed of the chance to reorganize the finances of the \nFederal Government with surpluses that were even a fraction of these \nmagnitudes.\n  The choices before the Senate are obviously considerable. We arrived \nat these massive surpluses for a combination of reasons: Our taxes, \nextraordinary work by the American people, rising productivity and \ntechnology, but also because for a long time our people simply went \nwithout some benefits. Like a company that improves its bottom line by \nnot investing in its personnel, our country cast a blind eye for some \ntime to real human needs and human investments in order to balance our \nbudget.\n  First and foremost among those things that the country simply ignored \nfor a period of time was the medical needs of our people. Modern \nmedicine is obviously revolutionizing health care. Despite the fact \nthat prescription drugs are an integral part of the health care of any \ncitizen, 35 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, or 15 million senior \ncitizens, have no prescription drug coverage and are either choosing \nbetween their rent and food or paying their prescription drug bills or \nsimply doing without at the cost of compromising the quality of their \nlives, or life itself. It remains first on the national objectives to \nbe corrected in these new circumstances.\n  Second, arguably, the United States has the finest system of higher \neducation in the world. But no one could defend the current quality of \nour elementary or high schools. They are literally bursting apart at \nthe seams: Aging schools, postponed improvements in their \ninfrastructure, the need for higher standards, to retain good teachers, \nand get even better teachers.\n  It is axiomatic that in this time of revolutionary technology and \ninternational competition, it will be impossible to maintain the \nstandard of living in the United States or our national strength or \neven democratic character without improving the quality of instruction \nin our schools. Mr. President, 2,400 schools will need to be rebuilt by \nthe year 2003 to accommodate rising enrollments alone, and 130,000 \nteachers will need to be hired over the next decade. This, too, was \npostponed.\n\n  Third, until most recently, this generation postponed its obligation \nto maintain the quality of life by maintaining the quality of the land \nof our country. What began with Theodore Roosevelt in preserving our \nnational monuments and lands and open space for our generation was \npostponed as we fought to balance our budget. No State in the Nation is \na better example of this phenomenon than my own native State of New \nJersey. Forty percent of the land is already developed; 10,000 acres \nare lost per year. There is an epidemic of sprawl. America is losing 50 \nacres of open space every hour of every day, all year long.\n  These three, from my own personal perspective, are on top of a long \nlist of postponed national ambitions that need to be debated in the \ncontext of broad and meaningful tax reduction, which I support. \nPrescription drug benefits, new teachers and schools, preserving of \nopen space, and the quality of our environment--they are a part of this \ndebate. The resources that go to one are not available for the other.\n  This Congress, unlike many that came before us that dealt with the \nquestion of comprehensive tax relief, must commit itself to balance, to \nbalance the resources that are necessary for national goals and the \nresources that are required for comprehensive and meaningful tax \nrelief.\n  The question of tax relief itself also involves issues of balance. I \nbegin this discussion with a profound belief that tax relief is not \nonly affordable, it is owed to the American people. There are many \ncontributors to the national surplus. This Congress and President \nClinton deserve considerable credit for reducing spending and some \nenhanced efficiencies. The American people deserve most of the credit \nfor the new productivity of this economy and its efficiency through \ntheir hard work.\n  But it is also true--indeed, it is inescapable--that a significant \nportion of the Federal surplus is a direct result of high tax rates \nthat have produced increased revenue, and the American people deserve a \ndividend on their high taxes of all these years.\n  Rates were increased and they were too high, and now they are simply \nnot necessary. The projection of a $3.1 trillion surplus should end \nforever the argument about whether the U.S. Government can afford \nbroad-based tax relief. It is right, it is necessary, and it is \naffordable.\n  The question becomes the character of this Congress; whether we not \nonly have the judgment to balance our educational, environmental, and \nmedical needs against the need for broad-based tax relief but whether \nthe tax relief itself can be comprehensive and balanced to a variety of \nnational objectives.\n\n  President Bush has proposed a $1.6 trillion restructuring of the tax \nbrackets. It is largely a reflection of the broad-based tax relief \noffered by Senators Coverdell, Breaux, Kerrey, and myself in the last \nCongress. It is deeper and it is broader, but it is based on the \nprinciple of lowering rates generally and specifically moving middle-\nincome American families into the lowest bracket possible. That is \nsimple but it is direct and it is right.\n  But the tax debate must include more than simply lowering rates in \nthe broadest fashion possible for most Americans. There are other \nspecific national objectives to be achieved through the Tax Code. I was \npleased to see that Senator Lott has joined in my efforts to include in \nthis tax reduction a further cut in capital gains rates. The business \ncommunity has made clear its own desire to see the R tax credit made \npermanent and reform of the international tax laws.\n  Those in my State of New Jersey, home of the pharmaceutical industry \nand increasingly of high technology, and involved in a disproportionate \namount of international trade, are grateful for the help of our economy \nand growing employment base. Both political parties have pledged \nthemselves to end the marriage penalty and to eliminate the estate tax \nfor at least small businesses, family farms, and to fix the alternative \nminimum tax, which is a rising burden on middle-income people.\n  Indeed, with a surplus of this magnitude, there is no shortage of \nlegitimate ideas. All of these concepts for tax reform and tax \nreduction have one thing in common: They are justifiable, they have a \nrationale, and they should be considered. But they also have this in \ncommon: None should be considered to the exclusion of other ideas, and \neach should be balanced.\n  This is a moment the country is not going to visit again for a long \ntime. This should be considered at length, seriously, and done right. \nLet me begin with several ideas that I believe are critical, in \naddition to the clear objective of restructuring the tax brackets \nthemselves.\n  First is the affordability of higher education. There is no greater \nburden on middle-income families, on working couples, than the \nprospect, the daunting challenge of a college education for their \nchildren. With the possible exception of buying a home, it is the \nprincipal financial burden in life for most Americans. For those less \nfortunate, there are a variety of scholarship and loan programs. The \nvery wealthy will never have to be concerned. But most Americans find \nthemselves in neither situation, and we are\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\nfacing the prospect where the middle class will simply be out of range \nof a quality graduate education or even a college education. Both our \nsense of fairness and our economic prospects as a nation are going to \nbe radically altered if a quality college education is the province \nonly of the upper middle class and the privileged. We will destroy the \nengine of our economic growth while taking basic fairness and social \nmobility out of our society.\n\n  As this chart indicates, over the last decade the cost of sending a \nchild to college has increased by 40 percent, two and a half times the \nbasic underlying inflation rate, for public universities and for \nprivate universities. It is not tolerable and there is something that \nthis Congress can do about it. If we were to add one single deduction \nto this new Tax Code that this Congress is going to write in the coming \nweeks, in addition to the broad-based relief in the lowering of tax \nbrackets for all Americans, it would be 100-percent deductibility of \ncollege tuition. It makes sense and it should be done now, and nothing \nwould add more to the finances of middle-income families.\n  Long ago this Congress recognized the need for deductibility of basic \ninvestments by business to add to its capabilities of productivity and \nefficiency. As a nation, that same investment strategy is reflected by \naverage Americans every day when they seek the financial security of \ntheir families and their productivity as a people by educating their \nchildren.\n  I recognize, because of the variety of deductions and rate \nalterations that are going to be suggested in this Congress, that 100-\npercent deductibility for Harvard or Yale or Princeton might not \ninitially be possible.\n  Because we cannot do everything does not mean we cannot do anything. \nIf 100-percent deductibility for the most expensive schools in the \nNation is not possible, 100-percent deductibility for the cost of going \nto a State university or a more moderately priced school is affordable \nand should be in this legislation.\n  Second, the national crisis of savings and retirement: There is no \narguing that these are extraordinary economic times by almost any \nmeasure--national competitiveness, efficiency, employment, and quality \nof life. In this panoply of good news, there is at least a single \nmeasure of a mounting national problem: the national savings rate.\n  As this chart demonstrates, from only 20 years ago, when Americans \nwere saving 10 percent of their income, for the first time since the \nGreat Depression, the Nation now has a negative savings rate.\n  The consequences of this are very clear. American families are \nmaintaining their standard of living by going into debt further and \nfurther every year. In the last 23 years, the debt burden on American \nfamilies has quadrupled. We are now last in the developed world in the \namount of money available to every family in their personal savings.\n  Nearly two-thirds of Americans have no stake in the society, no \naccumulated wealth but the value of their home. The consequences of \nthis on society are very clear. Most Americans are no more than a \nsickness, a natural catastrophe, a divorce, or the loss of a job away \nfrom losing a home and everything they have worked for all of their \nlives. A stable society that is prosperous and confident must have \nbroad-based savings by its people.\n  There is a reason why Americans have stopped saving money. This \nGovernment has made savings an irrational economic act. A working \nfamily on a modest income, who puts a few dollars in the bank or in the \nstock market every year hoping for a dividend, a small capital gain, \nsome appreciation, faces the prospect of paying taxes on it every \nApril. This denies people not only security from the vagaries of \neveryday life, it also denies them the ability to save appropriately \nfor their own retirement and ultimately makes them dependent upon \nGovernment to an extent that should not be necessary.\n  Let me be clear because I believe this is so fundamental to this tax \nbill. The Federal Government, in its current circumstances, does not \nneed tax revenues from taxing the dividends, interest, or capital gains \nof working-class families who decide to have modest savings and make an \ninvestment in the country for themselves, their children, or their \nfuture. We not only do not need their money, we should be encouraging \nthem to every extent possible to participate in the growth of the \ncountry and save their own money: Buy a mutual fund, put money in the \nbank, get in the stock market, make a family investment, and keep your \nmoney.\n  If we provide a $500 exclusion for dividends, savings on interest in \nbank accounts, $2,000 or $3,000 exclusion for capital gains, we can \neliminate all taxes on savings for 20 million Americans; 20 million \nAmericans would be eliminated from the tax rolls with regard to their \nsavings account or their brokerage account.\n  This Congress could make saving money and getting financial security \nto be a rational economic act again.\n  For most Americans, this would translate into the ability to have \n$10,000 in the bank or in the stock market, knowing it is theirs and it \nwill not add to their tax liability every April. I believe this second \nelement, in addition to a broad-based rate reduction, is a critical \ncomponent of comprehensive tax reform.\n\n  Third, the elimination of the estate tax for small business and \nfamily farms: There is clearly a general agreement in this Congress by \nDemocrats and Republicans that we can eliminate all taxes as we now \nknow them on estates for small businesses and family farms. The \nquestion is whether we can afford to do this for everybody or only for \n90 percent of those Americans who would be eliminated from the estate \ntax rolls if we simply increased the threshold to $5 million or $7 \nmillion.\n  We all agree there is a problem. Seventy percent of small business \nowners choose to sell their businesses rather than pass that business \non to their children and pay the estate tax. The estate tax is \ndestroying small business in America, family businesses, the continuity \nof ownership and pride within a business inside a family. As a result, \nonly 13 percent of small businesses in existence today will survive to \nthe third generation.\n  With the loss of family farms, it is even worse, adding not only to \nthe loss of continuity of ownership of a family farm but in a State \nsuch as mine, in New Jersey, more importantly, the destruction of the \nland. People who want to be in farming and want their children to be in \nfarming have to sell the farm to a developer and divide the acreage \nbecause upon their death, their children cannot afford to pay the tax.\n  The better alternative, if we cannot afford to eliminate the estate \ntax entirely, is to increase the exemption to such a level that every \nsmall business and every family farm, for all practical purposes, is \nexcluded from the tax.\n  Under current law, there is a $2.6 million exemption for qualified \nfamily farms and small businesses. But in a State such as New Jersey--\nindeed, much of the country--if you have significant acreage, you may \nnot be a wealthy person--indeed, you may have no cash available at \nall--but your land may be worth more than that, and you cannot afford \nto give it to your child on your death. Therefore, the more effective \nalternative to repeal may be to increase the threshold to $8 million or \nmaybe even $10 million. This would deal with the practical problems of \ndestroying small businesses and family farms.\n  Four, rate reduction. I began this discussion by conceding the \npoint--and, indeed, conceding it gladly--that every American deserves a \ntax break regardless of their income because every American, regardless \nof their position, has contributed to the surplus and the new national \nprosperity.\n  I say this because my hope is that this discussion of tax reduction \ncannot become a debate about different sections of the country any more \nthan it should about different stratums of wealth, a fight of region, \nor class warfare. All Americans helped produce this prosperity, and \neveryone should share in its benefits. But I also want this \ncongressional debate to begin with the idea that we all do come from \ndifferent sections of the country and have different concepts of the \ntax burden.\n  The issue becomes that we all want these tax reductions to go to \nprimarily middle-income people, which begs the question: What is a \nmiddle-income family? Is a family of four making $40,000 or $50,000 \nmiddle income? There\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nare regions of the country where the answer to that might be \naffirmative.\n  In the State of New Jersey--indeed, I suspect in New York, \nCalifornia, southern Florida, or northern Illinois--the answer most \ndecidedly is no. A family of four earning $40,000 to $50,000 a year is \nstruggling every single day to pay their mortgage, educate their \nchildren, feed their children, and clothe them. That is not a life of \nprosperity and ease. It is only marginally sometimes middle income.\n\n  Indeed, in my State, a family earning $70,000 a year is probably a \npolice officer married to a nurse or a schoolteacher. This is a family \nof middle-income status that deserves these benefits. So I hope we can \navoid a discussion of broad-based tax relief that focuses most tax \nbenefits significantly below this level of income.\n  I want to be accommodating to my colleagues. I want this to be a \nbipartisan and broadly based tax plan, but I will fight to the end to \nassure these levels defining ``middle-income families'' are realistic \nfor these police officers, nurses, teachers, and small business people \nwho have modest incomes and high expenses in our urban and suburban \nareas of the country.\n  Last year, when Senator Coverdell and I introduced the first \nbipartisan broad-based expansion of tax brackets for lower rates, the \ncenter of our plan--largely now adopted by President Bush--was to \nexpand the 15-percent tax bracket to a family of four earning $75,000. \nThis would move 7 million taxpayers into the lowest Federal bracket, \nrecognizing that no one in this bracket, as I earlier suggested, should \nbe paying 28 or 31 percent. This is the centerpiece, in my judgment, of \nany rate reduction.\n  Finally, I leave my colleagues with two other concepts that I hope \nwill be considered, recognizing that in addition to the education and \nhealth care and open space agendas of the Nation, and the need for \nbroad-based rate reductions, there are two other issues Congress has \naddressed previously where we are not succeeding that could be impacted \nby the tax break.\n  First is our urban agenda. We have tried Empowerment Zones and HOPE \nVI grants and a variety of measures to deal with our urban problems. \nSome have succeeded. Indeed, I am proud of many. But my sense is that \nour cities are now at the point where private investment could largely \nfollow these Federal initiatives in an urban renaissance. If we could \nchange, even marginally, the profitability of urban investment, such \nas, in wide areas of Newark and Jersey City--I recognize private \nhousing is beginning to be built, but what is a tentative beginning \ncould be an explosion of investment if we could marginally change the \ntax status of the developers.\n  So I propose, for home ownership and investment in our urban areas, \nwe take these areas of urban Empowerment Zones and do an exclusion on \ncapital gains for those who will invest in new housing or new \ninvestment. Allow the developer to keep $25,000 of capital gains on \nevery house they build in an urban enterprise zone as their money, if \nthey will take the risk and change the economics of that investment.\n  Second, and finally, on brownfields, brownfields is an important \nconcept to recycle urban polluted lands into vital economic resources. \nIt has been successful, but it must move more quickly.\n  Mr. President, I conclude simply by suggesting I want to accelerate \nand increase the tax deductibility for investment in brownfields. I \nleave my colleagues with the thought that I hope this is a good debate \non tax reduction. I hope it is comprehensive. I hope it is balanced. I \nhope we seize this extraordinary moment to impact the lives of as many \nAmericans as possible while assuring our economic future.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

Mr. President, this is an important day in the 107th \nsession of Congress. This is the day on which President Bush will send \nus his tax proposals. Our response to them will determine, I believe, \nthe strength of our economy and the security of each and every American \nfor years to come.\n  In response to the proposal the President will send us, I believe we \nwill all be tested--each of us individually, the institution of \nCongress, and, indeed, the American people whose opinions will \ninfluence what we do. I think, therefore, we have to think long and \nhard about what we do.\n  I have looked at the proposal President Bush is going to send us \ntoday. And with all respect, I believe President Bush's tax proposal is \na mistake because it does not reflect the best American values of \nthrift and discipline. I also believe President Bush's tax proposal is \nultimately fiscally irresponsible because it spends money in a \nprojected surplus we have no reason to have absolute confidence we will \nhave and, therefore, not only threatens to take America back down the \ndrain to debt, to deficits, to higher interest rates and higher \nunemployment but threatens to make impossible the kinds of measured \ninvestments we need to make in our people's future, including our \nnational security, the education of our children, and the health care \nof all Americans.\n  So I think it is time for us, on these tax-and-spending matters, to \nslow down. If I might paraphrase a Simon and Garfunkel classic: It is \ntime for us to slow down and not move too fast because we have to make \nthe good economy last. What I see around us, in response to the \nPresident's proposal, is quite the opposite of discipline.\n  I fear we are going to end up in a race to see who can give more \naway, which will ultimately result in a position that the American \npeople will not be able to take care of themselves. I want to speak \nabout this for a moment or two.\n  We have learned some lessons--or should have--over the last several \nyears about how we created the economic growth that most American \nfamilies are enjoying today. Government does not create jobs; the \nprivate sector does. But Government can create the environment in which \nthe private sector can thrive by the way we conduct ourselves.\n  It seems to me, if we look back over history, though the investments \nwe make in education and training are important, the most important \nthing the Federal Government can do is to keep its books in balance \nand, hopefully, to have a little bit of a surplus. That creates the \nconfidence and the stability which encourages the private sector to \ninvest, to innovate, to create jobs, to grow.\n  The tax plan which President Bush is sending to Congress today \nignores those lessons. The administration's massive $2 trillion tax \nprogram--because it is not just the $1.6 trillion, if you add on the \nnecessary alteration in the alternative minimum tax and lost interest \nearnings as a result of that tax plan, it comes to more than $2 \ntrillion--that massive $2 trillion tax program misunderstands our \nunprecedented economic expansion and why we got there and is not the \nright way to deal with the current economic slowdown that worries us.\n  As a so-called new Democrat and, indeed, I might add, as a New \nEnglander, I believe in tax cuts.\n  I have supported them in the past. I will support them again this \nyear. But they have to be done in the context of a balanced fiscal \nprogram. The President's proposal absorbs most of the projected surplus \nfor tax cuts, a surplus which, I repeat, is just a projection, not a \nreality. It is as if someone told the average American or the average \nAmerican small business person: We think you are probably going to make \nthis much money in the next 10 years, and then that individual American \nor that individual American small business person immediately goes out \nand spends all that money. No one sensibly would do that. We who have \nthe privilege and responsibility of leading this country should not \nallow the American Government to do that.\n  A better framework, one truly reflective of our national values and \npriorities, would be to divide the projected surplus into parts: One \npart for deficit reduction, not only for deficit reduction but as a \nhedge against the possibility that the surplus projections do not \nmaterialize; another part for\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nbroad-based progressive tax cuts; and a final part for targeted \ninvestments in our future: in our defense, in our national security, in \nour education, and in our health care.\n  My own preference for that division would be to put half of the \nprojected surplus for debt reduction in a rainy day fund, one-quarter \nfor tax cuts, and one-quarter for targeted spending increases. Others \nwould divide it in equal thirds. That is acceptable, certainly \npreferable to what the President is sending us today.\n  Our top priority must remain debt reduction. Let us not forget, as \ngood as the times are now, we still have a national debt of more than \n$3.1 trillion which, if we do not act responsibly, will burden the \nfuture, not just of our Nation but of our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Our economy is slowing down--it is still pretty healthy but slowing \ndown--from the extraordinary rate of growth we have enjoyed for several \nyears. Last week, it is important to note, the consumer confidence \nindex reported a 20-percent decline from a year ago, falling to its \nlowest level in 4 years. Obviously, many consumers are getting nervous \nabout the economy's slowing growth and what it portends for their \nfuture and our future as a nation.\n  That presents us with a warning about how we should act with this \nsurplus, but it also gives us an opportunity. Washington can quickly \nrally consumer confidence, I think most importantly, by continued debt \nreduction, staying the course, because that means lower interest rates. \nThat means lower interest payments on cars, homes, student loans, and \ncredit card debt. Lower interest payments also mean greater purchasing \npower.\n  In short, continuing to pay down the debt and thereby keeping \ninterest rates low amounts to an indirect tax cut and an economic \nstimulus now that will actually put more money into the pockets of more \nAmericans more quickly than anything else we can do.\n  Let me talk about the opportunity for tax cuts, which we have if we \ndo this responsibly and right. The American people have earned a tax \ncut. In fact, as good as the economy has been in recent years, there \nare millions and millions of Americans who need a tax cut to make the \nway for themselves and their families. The question we have to ask \nourselves is, What is the most constructive and fair way to return part \nof the surplus to those who helped create it? After all, the surplus \ncomes from the revenues that people pay our Government. The revenues \nthat people pay our Government have gone up because the economy has \nimproved. The economy has improved because of the investment and \ninnovation and hard work of the American people.\n\n  The answer here is to construct and adopt a broad-based, progressive \ntax cut, one that is directed at the middle class, which is, after all, \nthe backbone of our society and our economy. Let me suggest three \npossibilities to do this in a fiscally responsible way.\n  First, let us remember that almost three-quarters of all working \nAmericans actually pay more in payroll taxes, have more taken out of \ntheir paychecks in payroll taxes, than they pay in income taxes. Why \nnot help them by cutting that tax on work and thereby adopt a payroll \ntax credit? For instance, working families could receive an annual \nrefundable income tax credit equal to a percentage of what they pay in \nSocial Security taxes, without affecting what they have invested for \nretirement.\n  Another possibility that is being discussed is to use tax credits, or \nthe money available to establish what, in effect, would be a national \n401(k), by matching private retirement savings and encouraging actually \ndepositing money for retirement beyond Social Security in special \naccounts for all working Americans. That would allow people to keep \nmore of their own money while supplementing Social Security for their \nretirement.\n  A third reasonable, balanced, broad-based, progressive tax \nalternative is to give every American taxpayer a refund, a flat dollar \namount, as a dividend, to reflect the growing budget surplus and the \nhard work that went into creating it.\n  Each of these three possible proposals--and you can only adopt one of \nthem in a fiscally responsible way--would have a great impact on those \nwho need tax relief the most.\n  Incidentally, if we do it right, there will be some money left over \nfor tax cuts for business, tax cuts to encourage investment and \ninnovation, tax cuts that can help small businesses, particularly, work \ntheir way into the new information age, high-tech economy. That might \ninclude another round of capital gains tax cuts.\n  Briefly, on the question of spending, because I think we have the \nopportunity to make some investments in a limited, restrained, and \ntargeted way, none is more important than education. President Bush has \nmade a very thoughtful proposal on education reform which is not \ntremendously unlike proposals that many of us have made.\n  We can talk about good ideas for education reform, but unless we have \nsome money left over to actually invest in the education of our \nchildren, those ideas won't matter. The same is true of our national \ndefense. Last year, then-Governor Bush quite often said that our \nmilitary was strapped, it was becoming weak, and that help was on the \nway. He has now said more recently to the military: Don't expect an \nincrease this year.\n  But more to the point, if we spend as much on his tax proposal, there \nis no way we will have the money we need to invest in strengthening our \nmilitary and keeping our Nation secure over the next decade.\n  The bottom line is this: Fiscal discipline has played a critical role \nin the growth of our surplus. It would be foolish to forget that as \nquickly as these surpluses materialize, they can disappear. That is why \nwe should follow a cautious approach to the surplus assumptions and \nprojections and a balanced approach to the policies that are based on \nthose assumptions.\n  The best way to keep America's prosperity going is with a balanced \nprogram in which we distribute this surplus the American people have \nearned to debt reduction, sensible broad-based tax cuts, and targeted \nspending increases.\n  That is the best way to secure America's future and improve the lives \nof the American people.

Mr. President, I want to respond to my distinguished \ncolleague on his always very insightful observations regarding the \nPresident's tax cut proposals. I want to strongly commend the President \nfor coming out with a well-conceived tax program that will provide \nbroad-based tax relief for the American people; for every American \ntaxpayer will experience relief from the onerous burden placed upon \nthem by this Tax Code and tax burden we have.\n  My distinguished colleague spoke of the need for investment. Too \noften when we talk about not giving tax relief because we have to \nensure we have enough resources to invest in the Federal Government, \nwhat we are really talking about is: Let's make sure we don't give it \nback to the American people so we have it to spend as we see fit. So \ninvestment equates to big spending programs. That would be ill-advised.\n  If we do not enact broad-based tax relief, as the President has \nproposed, I can assure you that over the next 10 years the projected \nsurplus will not go to debt reduction, as everybody would like to see, \nbut it will, in fact, be spent by a Congress that enjoys spending all \ntoo much.\n  When Senator Lieberman speaks about a cautious approach, I agree. \nWhat the President has done and proposed is cautious and prudent. He \nhas proposed that we spend one-fourth of the projected surplus by \nreturning to the American people tax relief. One quarter of every \ndollar out of the projected surplus would be returned to the American \npeople who pay the bills.\n  As my friend Senator Enzi has often said, the surplus is a tax \novercharge, and at least a quarter of it ought to go back to the \nAmerican people.\n\n\n                       EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to a part of the \nPresident's tax program and part of his education program, which is the \neducation savings accounts. My colleague,\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nSenator Torricelli, spoke on this earlier today. I join him and am \npleased to cosponsor the education savings accounts legislation with \nhim. I am honored to take up this cause from its previous Republican \nsponsor, the Senator from Georgia, Paul Coverdell, and it is in his \nhonor and memory that this legislation is named.\n  Senator Coverdell was an ardent supporter of education savings \naccounts. He worked for years to ensure that families and children \nacross America had the best educational opportunities available to \nthem. I, with all of my colleagues, am sad that Senator Coverdell is no \nlonger here to continue his exemplary work on this issue. He believed \neducation was one of the five pillars of freedom. Not only did he work \ntirelessly on this issue, but he coordinated the floor debate on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act last May. He was dedicated to \nthe issue of education and its importance in shaping the future of our \ncountry.\n  While this legislation was passed several times by the Senate under \nthe leadership of Senator Coverdell, I will work with Senator \nTorricelli to ensure that his dream of expanded, broader education \nsavings accounts is not only passed this year but is signed into law.\n  This legislation, which we call the Coverdell Education Savings \nAccounts Act of 2001, allows parents, grandparents, or other \nscholarship sponsors to establish an education savings account to save \nfor a child's education expenses. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nallowed families to establish individual education accounts for higher \neducation expenses, but it allowed contributions of only $500 per year. \nThat is simply not enough. This legislation would build on that \nlegislation by increasing the annual limit on contributions from the \n$500 to $2,000 per child per year. Furthermore, and equally as \nsignificant, it expands the account so that savings may be used for \nelementary and secondary education expenses, including tutoring, \nspecial needs services, books, home computers, and tuition.\n\n  Education savings accounts place the power of education in the hands \nof those who should be in control, and that is the parents. These \naccounts allow parents to invest their own money over time to plan for \ntheir children's future. Parents would have a real incentive to save \nfor their children's education expenses, and as these accounts grow and \naccumulate interest, they build compound interest so parents can have \nsignificant resources to pay for many of the services associated with \neducating their child.\n  My colleagues, even public education is no longer free. Parents often \nhave to pay for tutoring, for afterschool programs, for uniforms in \nmany schools, home computers and software, and they pay that out of \ntheir own pockets. These accounts can help pay for that.\n  May I say, as an aside, public school teachers are going to be big \nbeneficiaries of these Coverdell accounts. They are going to benefit \nbecause those who are hired to do tutoring, those who will provide \nadditional help for children who need that special time are going to be \nthe public school teachers who are going to see their incomes and \nlimited salaries oftentimes supplemented by these education savings \naccounts.\n  In addition, this legislation would expand who can contribute to the \neducation savings accounts so that corporations, charitable \norganizations, foundations, and labor unions can contribute to these \neducation savings accounts in the name of a particular child. So I can \ncertainly envision major employers deciding this would be an ideal \nbenefit to employees and their children by establishing these education \nsavings accounts, making contributions to them. I certainly can imagine \nlabor unions being supportive of this and seeing this as a wonderful \nbenefit for their members and ensuring that their members are going to \nhave the resources necessary for their children's education and for \ntheir employees to have all of the options available as they look at \nwhat is best for their children.\n  So this proposal will inject billions of new dollars into education \nthat would not have been spent previously. I think it is a wonderful \nopportunity for companies and unions to offer education savings \naccounts as benefits for their employees--a benefit particularly \nhelpful to low- and middle-income families who otherwise could not save \nmuch.\n  According to a previous analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \n70 percent of the families expected to take advantage of this \nlegislation have incomes of $75,000 or less. These accounts are only \navailable to taxpayers making less than $95,000 or $190,000 jointly. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation also estimated that 75 percent of all \nfamilies using these accounts will have children enrolled in public \nelementary or secondary schools. That means public schools aren't the \nlosers; they are the winners under education savings accounts.\n  The injection of billions of dollars, 75 percent of which is going to \nbe benefiting families with children in public schools, is a tremendous \nboon to public education. So education savings accounts benefit low- \nand middle-income families who currently struggle to meet the education \nneeds of their children, and they benefit families not only of lower \nincome but those who are enrolled in public schools.\n\n  One of the arguments against these savings accounts is that you are \ngoing to take the cream of the crop out of the public schools because \nin their education savings accounts, they can save the resources for \nprivate school tuition. Yes, they could, but the fact is, this \nlegislation is really targeting low- and middle-income families, those \nwho otherwise don't even have those choices. An affluent family can \nlook at private schools, parochial schools, all kinds of options. They \ncan afford tutors. It is the low- and middle-income families who \nheretofore have not had those options, but with education savings \naccounts they can look at these options.\n  Public schools, private schools, and parochial schools are all \nenhanced by that competitive atmosphere. This legislation leaves public \nmoney in public schools. Only private resources could ever be used for \ntuition in a private school.\n  We are going to have a healthy debate about the ``V'' word--\nvouchers--this year, and I commend the President for his portability \nprovision on title I so disadvantaged children don't have to remain in \na failing school, trapped in a school not meeting their needs, and \nparents will be able to take a portion of Federal money out of title I \nand move to another school. We are going to have a heated debate on \nthat. There are Republicans for and against it, and some Democrats are \nfor and against it. This is something Republicans and Democrats, \nprovoucher and antivoucher forces, can agree upon because it is only \nprivate money that would be utilized in going to other public schools, \nand only public money would go to the public schools. Instead of \ncreating a new Federal education program, should we not allow parents \nto realize a maximum return on their savings by allowing for these \naccounts?\n  It is estimated that education savings accounts will infuse more than \n$12 billion of additional funding into education. That far outweighs \nthe cost of the bill. What better way to stress the importance of \neducation than by allowing parents the opportunity to make their \ndollars count.\n  I look forward to working on this bill with the original cosponsors--\nSenators Gregg, Frist, Enzi, Sessions, Thompson, Hagel, Brownback, \nSantorum, and Breaux--as well as the chief cosponsor, Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey, who has fought this fight and who has been on \nthe floor with Senator Coverdell in past years and has taken a \ncourageous step for something that in the time since it began was \ncontroversial. I commend him and look forward to working with him as we \nmove this legislation forward.\n  Parents deserve this chance of empowerment to provide a better \neducation for their children.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I rise today to discuss \nsome of the benefits of the tax plan that President Bush has sent to \nCongress. I believe everybody is beginning to understand the \nsignificant benefit families would receive under this tax reduction \nplan.\n  A family of four living in my State--St. Louis, Kansas City, Sedalia, \nMoberly, Maryville, or Kennett--if\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\nthey earn $35,000, would have all their taxes eliminated, a 100-percent \ntax cut. That has to be good news.\n  A family of four making $50,000 a year would receive a 50-percent tax \ncut--at least $1,600. That could be a downpayment on a new van or a car \nor buy several weeks of summer camp for the kids or several weeks of \ngroceries.\n  President Bush's plan doubles the child tax credit to $1,000, \nbringing it more in line with the actual cost of raising a kid. It is a \nnews flash for those of us inside the beltway. Kids are expensive. \nThose of us who have kids know they are life's greatest blessing, but \nthey do not come cheap.\n  I commend the President for recognizing this.\n  I believe it is also very important that President Bush's plan \nexpands the charitable tax deduction. We ought to be encouraging more \npeople to contribute to the Salvation Army, Red Cross, Catholic \nCharities, or any of the myriad wonderful private agencies that are \ndoing very important work helping those who need help.\n  I want to speak today specifically about the impact these tax \nreductions would have on small business.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I hear from \nsmall businesses every day that are the dynamic engine growing this \neconomy. These are the businesses that create the new jobs. As larger \nand larger businesses cut back and lay off employees, they are finding \njobs. They are finding good opportunities in small business.\n  Small businesses represent about 99 percent of all employers. They \nemploy 53 percent of the private workforce and create about 75 percent \nof the new jobs in this country. As you are looking to see where jobs \ncan be provided to those who are coming off welfare and those entering \nthe workforce for the first time, small businesses are the ones giving \nthem the opportunities.\n  Under the Bush tax plan, small businesses will get a huge benefit \nfrom collapsing the tax brackets from 5 to 4--giving marginal rate \nreductions. This is extremely important for these small businesses. \nWhy? You may think businesses and individuals are different. But \naccording to IRS statistics on income--most recent data available--\nabout 20.7 million tax returns filed by small businesses were sole \nproprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations with business assets \nless than $1 million. Those are significant numbers of small businesses \nthat are taxed on the individual tax rates. The income of the business \nis passed through, and it is applied to their tax returns.\n  On the other hand, there are about 2\\3/4\\ million corporations, or \nregular C corporations, that are taxed under the business rates. Almost \n10 times as many businesses, much smaller, of course, are taxed on \nindividual tax returns. Eighty-eight percent of the businesses with \nreceipts under $1 million are passthrough entities--businesses taxed \nonly at the individual owner level.\n  The rate reduction proposed by the President will cut the taxes paid \nby farmers, retail shop owners, small businesses, startup businesses \nthat are formed as sole proprietorship, partnerships, and S \ncorporations. What are they going to do with it?\n  We have seen in the past when they have the taxes reduced--and we are \nreducing the taxes because we have a tax surplus; we are taxing them \ntoo much; too much money is being taken out of families' pockets and \nout of businesses' pockets--they will use those dollars left in their \npockets to invest in new equipment, in new technologies, hire more \nworkers, and pay better wages. They will be able to expand the product \nlines and the services they offer. Most importantly, they will \ncontribute to the economic growth of their hometowns.\n  Week before last, we had a fascinating discussion with Chairman Alan \nGreenspan of the Federal Reserve. Chairman Greenspan, many people \nbelieve, has been one of the real economic gurus whose good economic \npolicies have allowed this economy to grow. He has talked in the past \nabout the need to reduce the huge national debt run up over past years.\n  But do you know something. This time Chairman Greenspan said it is \ntime for a tax reduction. Why? Because we are running surpluses. There \nis a projected $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. That means \nwe would pay off all the debt we could pay off. Then the Federal \nGovernment would be left in the position of what to do with the extra \nmoney after they pay down the debt.\n  One of the most dangerous things he said they could do would be to \nhave the Federal Government accumulating private assets. That is \n``economic speak'' for buying up businesses, buying up shares of the \nstock market, or getting the Federal Government into socializing the \neconomy. We don't need to go that direction. We don't need to have the \nFederal Government as the major shareholder in our economy.\n  Reducing high tax rates now is the best way to make sure we don't put \nthe Federal Government into the business of buying up businesses. That \nis very dangerous. That is not where we want to go.\n  In addition, I asked Chairman Greenspan about what nature of tax cut \nwould most benefit the economy. He said as an economist that clearly \nthe most important thing we can do is lower the marginal rates.\n  With tax reform in the 1980s, we got the top rate down to about 80 \npercent. Most people think if the Federal Government is taking over a \nquarter of every dollar earned, that is as much as it should take. But \nright now we have the rates on the books of 39.6 percent. But with all \nthe phaseouts and others, sometimes that tax rate is 44 percent--almost \nhalf of every dollar.\n  When you take that much money out of the system, and when you take \nthat much money out of the new dollars coming into a business, for \nexample, you discourage investment. From the economist's standpoint, \nthe best thing we can do is reduce those high marginal rates so that \nsmall businesses will have the incentive to put more money into \ntechnology and into equipment.\n  We have had a phenomenal growth in productivity. Because there has \nbeen investment in new technology, information technology, the \ninformation age has revolutionized the way businesses work. Businesses \nare able to be more productive. What does that mean? It doesn't just \nmean the businesses are more profitable. It means you and I as \nconsumers get better products at lower prices. It means they can hire \nmore workers. It means they can pay workers better salaries.\n  These are the benefits that come about from a marginal tax rate \nreduction.\n  In addition, the President calls for repealing the death tax.\n  This will be a tremendous benefit to small business. I have a lot of \nfarmers in my State who are very worried that when they die the Federal \nGovernment is going to come in with a confiscatory Federal death tax \nand take away the farm, take away the small business that has been \nbuilt up over the years that the business owner or the farmer would \nlike to leave to his or her children.\n  Repealing the death tax will make a significant difference in \nassuring that we continue jobs and economic activity. Thousands of \nsmall businesses in this country waste millions of dollars each year on \nestate planning and insurance costs just to keep the doors open if the \nowners die.\n  A good friend of mine farms along the Missouri River in western \nMissouri. When his father died they paid almost $100,000 in accounting \nand legal fees to figure out how they could keep his farms from being \nbroken up. Death ought not be a taxable event. It is bad enough to have \nthe undertaker arrive at your door. You don't want to have the tax man \narrive at the same time.\n  The money we pay to accountants, to lawyers, and to insurance \ncompanies to try to get around this estate tax could be much more \nproductively employed in investing in new equipment, in providing new \njobs and better wages.\n  Many times the tax at death ends a small business; it has to be sold. \nIt is a job killer. I think the days of the death tax should be \nnumbered, not the days of the business owned by an older business owner \nor farmer who is reaching the end.\n  It should come as no surprise if the economy slows, as clearly it is, \nsmall businesses will be first to feel the pain. Capital dries up, \nsales will fall, and possibly business productivity will diminish. As \nwe focus on the need for immediate tax relief and the merits of it in \nthe Bush tax plan, we cannot ignore the plight of America's small \nenterprises in the growing economy.\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n  Taxes are not supposed to be countercyclical. This is a long-term \ninvestment in the productivity of our country. When we cut the capital \ngains rate in the last decade, the money made available from the tax \nreductions helped spur the investments in productivity that kept our \neconomy growing. Incidentally, that increased activity actually brought \nmore revenue to the Federal Government.\n  I think the Bush plan, in addition to holding tremendous benefits for \nfamilies, for individuals struggling to make ends meet, will have a \ntremendous benefit for small business. The rate cut, the estate tax \nrepeal, and the other features of the President's proposal will \ndirectly help the hard-working women and men who dedicate their lives \nto creating small businesses, to taking the risks in the marketplace \nthat will allow this country to be healthier, and to allow themselves, \ntheir families, and their workers to be productive, contributing \nmembers of the economy.\n  When small businesses win, we all win. I think President Bush's tax \nplan is one of the best hopes we have for ensuring that our economy \ncontinues to grow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, I commend the Senator from Missouri \nfor a fine statement. I certainly associate myself with those comments. \nIn particular, his reference to the effective tax cuts on the small \nbusinesses in our country, something he has worked on literally all of \nhis career. I appreciate very much his emphasis on that.\n  The President, of course, sends us his bill today. The essential \nfeature, as the Senator from Missouri said, is the reduction in \nmarginal rates. Reducing the marginal rates is the best thing we can do \nfor all taxpayers, as well as for strengthening the economy itself.\n  I note that the low- and middle-class taxpayers are the biggest \nwinners under this plan. For example, a family of four making $50,000 a \nyear would receive a 50-percent cut, a $1,600 reduction average on \ntheir tax bill. If that is not considered important by people, just \nthink about how much that would do for the average family. It pays the \nentire average home mortgage for that family of four, a year of tuition \nat a lot of community colleges, and so on.\n  The size of the cut is also modest by any standard. I know some of \nour colleagues on the left have said it is too big. Frankly, it is not \nnearly enough, in my view. I subscribe to the view of those in the \nHouse of Representatives yesterday who said it could be much larger, \nand it should be larger. I support at least this modest effort and urge \nmy colleagues who say it is too much to recognize that it is only half \nthe size of the tax cuts of the John F. Kennedy administration and one-\nthird the size of the tax cuts of the Ronald Reagan administration. So \nI don't think one could say that this tax cut is too large, when all \neconomists agree that the tax cuts of the Kennedy and Reagan eras were \nthe primary cause of the great economic growths that occurred during \nthose periods of time.\n  Moreover, for those who contend that we don't have enough money to \naccommodate this tax, I say, first of all, that is very much the wrong \nstandard to apply. This is not a Government expenditure. This has to do \nwith taking money from American workers. Recall that during the Reagan \nera we had huge Federal debt and very large annual deficits, yet we \nreduced taxes. As I said, this tax cut being proposed by President Bush \nis only a third the size of those Reagan tax cuts.\n  The goal, first of all, should be to relieve the burden on American \ntaxpayers, enabling them to contribute to the great economic engine of \nthis country. We do not need to be worried about how much money is \ngoing to be left over for this Congress to spend. Everyone here knows \nthat if we leave it on the table in the Congress, it will get spent. \nThat is why we believe there is another reason to support this tax cut, \nnot just to improve the economy and help American families but so the \nmoney will not be spent by the Congress inappropriately.\n  Surpluses are proof of the fact that taxpayers are being overcharged. \nThey deserve some of their money back. The fact that the economy is \nweakening at this point simply makes the point that this tax cut and \nthe case for this tax cut is undeniable.\n  I will focus my remaining comments on one specific feature of the \nPresident's proposal; that is, the repeal of the estate tax, the so-\ncalled death tax. Yesterday, I introduced legislation similar to that \nintroduced last year. Senators Breaux, Gramm, and Lincoln are \ncosponsors. We all serve on the Finance Committee. It is balanced \nbetween Democrats and Republicans. This is the bipartisan approach that \npassed both the House and the Senate last year, only to be vetoed by \nPresident Clinton.\n\n  The essence of the bill is to replace the Federal estate tax with a \ntax on capital gains earned from inherited assets due when those assets \nare sold. As I said, this is the approach that passed both Houses of \nCongress, and it rests on the notion that death should be taken \nentirely out of the equation.\n  Death should not be a taxable event. If people want to sell assets at \nsome point, they make an economic calculation knowing, among other \nthings, what kind of tax would pertain. They can make that decision on \ntheir own. That is the only time there should be any kind of a tax. At \nthat point, it should be a capital gains tax, not a tax that is more \nthan twice the capital gains rate, which is what the death tax is.\n  As I said, the beauty of this approach is it removes death as a \ntrigger for a tax. Death neither confers a benefit nor results in a \npunitive, confiscatory state. Small estates would be unaffected by the \nbasic changes we are making. For them, the estate tax would be \neliminated and a limited step-up in basis would be preserved. Each \nperson under our proposal has a $2.8 million automatic step-up in \nbasis. So for a couple, there is no chance that an estate that is not \ntaxed under the estate tax today would be taxed under our proposal.\n  This measure would not allow unrealized appreciation on inherited \nassets, however. I know that is a concern for some of our friends on \nthe other side. Beyond this limited step-up in basis, all assets would \nbe taxed as in any other situation if and when they are ever sold. \nFriends who own small businesses who never want to sell the small \nbusiness or farm, that is fine. You never pay a tax. The tax only \npertains if and when the business is sold.\n  This is a very fair proposal. In fact, the American people, even \nthough most of them realize they are not liable for an estate tax, \nunderstand the fairness of this and support it.\n  A Gallup poll not too long ago found that 60 percent of the American \npeople support repeal of the death tax, even though about three-fourths \nof them do not think they will ever have to pay the death tax \nthemselves. They are right, although many Americans have to go through \nthe expense of paying for insurance or estate planning.\n\n  As a matter of fact, about 3 years ago, coincidentally, the \nGovernment collected about the same amount in estate tax--I think it \nwas around $23 billion--that other Americans paid to avoid paying the \nestate tax. So it is actually a double tax. A lot of people who do not \nactually pay it end up paying as much through the estate tax lawyers' \nfees, accountants' fees, insurance, and so on. So I think most American \npeople understand it is not a good tax to have, even though they \nthemselves may not be liable for it.\n  Also this last year, in the last election, voters in two States \napproved referenda to repeal their own estate tax: South Dakota, by a \nvote of 79-21, and Montana, 68 to 32 percent. Clearly, repeal of this \nconfiscatory tax is an idea whose time has come, both in the State and \nat the Federal level.\n  I conclude by reiterating the significant majorities in the House and \nSenate who voted for repeal last year means we have finally found the \nformula for taxing inherited assets in a fair and commonsense way. I \nhope, as this process unfolds and the tax legislation comes before the \nSenate and the House, our colleagues will recognize the validity of \nthis approach, the fairness, the place in which the death tax repeal \nfits into the overall tax program, and that we can pass tax relief for \nhard-working American families.\n  It is the most sure way not only to do right by them but to ensure a \nstrong economy for the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to state that Americans need tax \nrelief and I believe they need it now. Despite record economic growth \nfor the last several years, and huge budgeted surpluses in the last few \nyears and in the future, I think these surpluses simply represent \novertaxation of the American taxpayers. Americans, in recent years, \nhave been repeatedly denied tax relief despite these surpluses because \nthere were not enough Senators to override the President's veto--the \nprevious President's veto.\n  Excessive taxation limits the individual freedom of hard-working \nAmericans, their families, and their enterprises. I agree very much \nwith the previous remarks made by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, \nand the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  The fact is, Americans are paying more in taxes as a proportion of \nthe gross domestic product than at any time since World War II. In \nfact, for this fiscal year, the Federal Government will pull out $1 of \nevery $5 in the economy--20 percent of the economy is being taken by \nthe Federal Government, even though there is a non-Social Security \nbudget surplus in this year that is going to top $125 billion, and it \nis going to exceed $3.1 trillion over the next decade.\n  I believe we must assure that Americans can keep more of their hard-\nearned dollars in their pockets. Previously, the Senator from \nConnecticut paraphrased a song to slow down tax cuts in this surplus. I \nthink there is a more apt country western song to reference this gold \nmine surplus that is created by the work of the taxpayers. What has \nbeen suggested by the opponents is that the Government gets the gold \nmines and the taxpayers get the shaft.\n  I think the taxpayers deserve better. It is simply common sense that, \nrather than continuing down the path of excessive Government spending \nin Washington, Americans ought to be allowed more money to invest in \ntheir priorities for their families, for their homes: saving for \nretirement or the purchase of a computer for their children. It is \ncommon sense--trusting families, trusting people. They know better than \nthe Federal Government about what they need and how to make their \nearnings work for themselves, their families, and their enterprises.\n\n  Overall, for the economic success and jobs in America, I believe the \nFederal Reserve needs to rapidly reduce interest rates much more, and \nsoon; we must pass tax relief soon to help bolster consumer confidence. \nWhen you look at these surpluses, I believe they ought to be handled \nthe same way a well-managed business would handle surpluses. A business \nwould first put funds into retirement or pension funds. Then they would \nlook at their priorities as a company and invest in them. And then they \nwould look for a dividend to the shareholders.\n  As the Federal Government, I think we ought to look at it the same \nway a business would. Certainly a business would not be raiding, at \ntimes of surplus--or at any time for that matter--pension funds or \nretirement funds. That is why I think as a Government we need to \nprotect Social Security. Put Social Security in a lockbox. Hopefully, \nwith this spirit of bipartisanship, that will change and we can pass \nlegislation necessary to protect Social Security so future retirement \nfunds are not raided for more Government spending.\n  The advantage of the Social Security lockbox is not only protection \nof retirement funds; it also helps pay down the national debt. \nImplementing the Social Security lockbox and allowing those surpluses \nto be used only for addressing the long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity helps us reduce the national debt, and we can effectively \neliminate the publicly held debt in the next 10 years with that fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  Then I believe we need to look at the non-Social Security surpluses \nand, again, handle it the same way a well-run business would. What \nwould a well-run business do with the nonretirement surpluses? They \nwould address priorities, research and development, workforce training, \nmaybe investment in ideas to be more competitive, or increase their \nmarket share. In the Federal Government, even after we save and protect \nthe Social Security surpluses and pay down the national debt, the \nFederal Government still will be collecting $3.1 trillion more in taxes \nthan is needed at the current levels of spending, on top of the current \nlevel of spending inflationary increases. So it is $3.1 trillion. That \nis over $10,000 of excess taxation of every man, woman, and child in \nthis country.\n  There are legitimate national responsibilities we need to address and \nin which we need to invest. We must provide that out of this $3.1 \ntrillion surplus. There are new investments we need to consider in \neducation. We must also act quickly, making sure we are improving the \npreparedness of our national defense and our Armed Forces. We need to \ninvest in new technological and scientific research. We need to shore \nup the Medicare system, as well as investing in our national \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  But once we take care of these priority responsibilities in \neducation, national defense, scientific research, and combating illegal \ndrug trade, we should again operate as a business. Then what would a \nbusiness do after you take care of priorities? They would declare a \ndividend. That is what I think we ought to do is declare a dividend for \nthe shareholders, the owners of this Government who are the taxpayers \nof America.\n  Surely, out of the $3.1 trillion surplus, I do not think the $1.6 \ntrillion the Bush administration is proposing is an excessive amount to \nreturn to our taxpayers. It is a minimal amount we ought to be \nreturning to the taxpayers. In fact, when you compare this proposal to \nprevious major tax cuts, history shows we can dedicate even 50 percent \nof the current non-Social Security surplus to tax relief measures and \nstill barely make a blip on the radar screen of our national economy.\n\n  For example, in 1963 President Kennedy's tax cut reduced tax \ncollections by 12 percent. That is this chart here, the Kennedy \nadministration; it was 12.6 percent.\n  The Reagan administration 1981 tax cut reduced tax collections by \n18.7 percent--nearly 19 percent.\n  The tax collections proposed by the Bush administration would return \njust over one-half of the excess tax collections to American taxpayers, \nand the tax collections would be reduced by 6.2 percent--much less than \nthe Kennedy and much less than the Reagan administrations. In fact, \naccording to the National Taxpayers' Union, as part of our gross \ndomestic product, when you compare the Kennedy tax cut, it was 2 \npercent of the gross domestic product--the Bush proposal of taxes being \nreduced by $1.6 trillion is a mere 1.2 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct.\n  You might recall the great growth in our economy in the 1960s was \noccasioned by the tax cuts of the Kennedy administration. So this is \nmerely one-half of the revenue impact of the Kennedy tax cut.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, if we cannot cut taxes in the \ntimes of these surpluses, when will we be able to give tax relief and \nreduce the tax burden on the people of America?\n  This is the time to make the Federal Tax Code more fair and less \nburdensome. This is the time to get rid of this illogical marriage \npenalty tax which imposes a penalty on men and women just because they \nare married. This is the time to eliminate the death tax which is a \nvery unfair tax, especially on family farms and small businesses. This \nis the time to make sure that individuals and small business owners get \n100-percent tax deductibility for health insurance. And there are many \nother things we can do. This is the time to act for the people of \nAmerica.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will seize this opportunity to exercise \nfiscal discipline and restraint and realize that the owners of this \ncountry deserves tax relief, and they deserve it now.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the very fine statement made by \nthe junior Senator from Virginia, certainly a very experienced leader, \nhaving served in the House of Representatives and having been Governor \nof the Commonwealth of Virginia, and already a very active participant \nin what is happening in the Senate and in our Government.\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\n  I had a feeling he would probably be suggesting tax relief is a good \nidea. Virginia has a strong opinion on that going back just a few \nyears. I thank him very much for his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1176-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SYMMS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \noutstanding accomplishments of Loretta Fuller Symms. There she is, \nlooking quite natural in the front of this Chamber. This week, she will \nbe retiring after over 20 years of congressional service. Has it been \nthat long? For 14 of those years, she has served in the Senate.\n  I first met Loretta 20 years ago when I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and she was working in the office of then-Congressman \nSteve Symms of Idaho. She would tell you--Steve and I were first \nelected in 1972 and came 1973--Steve and I have a common bond \nphilosophically but also fraternally in that we were close friends, and \nthat is where I first met Loretta.\n  She moved to the Washington area from Coeur d'Alene, ID, a beautiful \narea. What a sacrifice to move from Coeur d'Alene, ID, to come to \nWashington. Thank goodness she did, and we have all been much better \noff because of her outstanding congressional career.\n  In 1987, the very wise Senator Bob Dole, my predecessor as Republican \nleader, chose Loretta to be the Republican representative in the \nSergeant at Arms Office. Over the next 9 years, she filled a number of \nroles within that organization. It was during that time that I was \nfirst elected to the Senate, and Loretta was very helpful to me and my \nstaff in opening my offices here in Washington and in Mississippi.\n  I remember she had a post, more or less, in the back of the Chamber, \nand I quite often would stop by to ask her what in the world was \nhappening because the rules here are quite different from what I had \nbeen used to in the House. Of course, I was concerned about a number of \nthings that I found difficult to manage and to deal with over here, but \nshe was very helpful.\n  She has always brought professional business practices to the Senate \noperations. As director of Capitol facilities, she restructured the \ndepartment establishing career ladders, formalizing job descriptions, \ninstituting reading programs, and starting computer classes and other \ntraining programs for our employees.\n  Working with the Secretary of the Senate, she contributed to the \nmanagement and oversight of the Senate page program, serving as \nadviser, mentor, and sometime surrogate parent to the high school \nstudents who participate in the program.\n  She was a driving force in the opening of Webster Hall, the building \nthat functions both as a dormitory and as a site for the Senate page \nschool.\n  I was pleased to appoint Loretta as Deputy Sergeant at Arms in 1996, \nthe post she will serve until Friday. In that role, she has done a \nmagnificent job. In fact, I was not sure I could give these remarks \nthis morning because I still would like to ask her to change her mind: \ndon't do this; at least stay until we complete the new extension on the \neast front of the Capitol. It wouldn't be but another 2 or 3 years \nperhaps. Steve would understand. I have made that plea to no avail. I \nguess, come Friday, she will be moving on to a different and exciting \nlife, I am sure.\n  She has demonstrated an unmatched dedication to the institution of \nthe Senate and its traditions. She understands them. She helps them and \nprotects them. She contributed in large part to the restoration of the \nSenate Chamber in its current majesty, an area I have felt strongly \nabout, but she made sure we paid attention to history and that it was \ndone with good taste. The Chamber looks better today than it did 5 \nyears ago.\n\n  Loretta has ably handled the huge and demanding responsibility of \noverseeing the daily operations of the Sergeant at Arms organization \nand its 750 employees. I know our Sergeant at Arms, Jim Ziglar, has \nbeen worried about this Friday and this day and how she would ever be \nreplaced. A good choice has been made as a successor, but still I do \nnot think we could ever truly replace Loretta and the job she has done.\n  In her duties as a representative of the Senate, Loretta has assisted \nPresidents, Vice Presidents, and foreign heads of state as they made \nofficial visits here. She has led the Senate as we walked through the \nCapitol Building over to the House side for joint sessions. I always \nthought we got more than our due share of notice, probably because \nLoretta was leading the pack.\n  We will surely notice her absence next week and for a long time to \ncome, but I know Loretta is happy to exchange foreign dignitaries' \nvisits for more visits with her 10 grandchildren. It is hard to believe \nshe has 10, and here I am working only on my second one.\n  We are sad when one of our Senate family leaves us, but at the same \ntime, we could not be happier for her. I know her husband, Steve Symms, \nis going to be happier, too.\n  As Loretta moves on to new challenges, I say thank you on the \nSenate's behalf and on my own behalf. The words are inadequate to \nexpress our appreciation for the kind of person you are and the job you \nhave done. We all wish you the very best in your next career as \ngrandmother and as keeper of Steve Symms, which will be a challenge. We \nall appreciate you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1176-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1176-S1205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PIPELINE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 235, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 235) to provide for enhanced safety, public \n     awareness, and environmental protection in pipeline \n     transportation, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is now considering \nS. 235, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001. I am joined in \nsponsoring this important transportation safety legislation by Senators \nMurray, Hollings, Hutchison, Bingaman, Domenici, Breaux, Brownback, \nSmith, and Landrieu. I especially express my appreciation to Senator \nMurray, as well as former Senator Gorton, for the hundreds of hours \nthey put into this legislation.\n  This bill is the product of many months of hearings and bipartisan \ncompromise and cooperation during the last Congress. It is designed to \npromote both public and environmental safety by reauthorizing and \nstrengthening our Federal pipeline safety programs which expired last \nSeptember.\n  As most of my colleagues well know, the Senate worked long and hard \nduring the last Congress on how best to improve pipeline safety. After \nseveral months of hearings, and countless meetings, the Senate finally \nachieved a bipartisan consensus on comprehensive pipeline safety \nimprovement legislation. We unanimously approved that legislation last \nSeptember 7. I want to point out, by a voice vote, this legislation was \npassed just last September 7. Unfortunately, the House failed to \napprove a pipeline safety measure so we were never able to get to \nconference or send a measure to the President. Our collective inaction \nwas a black mark on the 106th Congress.\n  Because the Congress as a whole did not act, the unacceptable status \nquo under which a total of 38 fatalities occurred during just the last \nyear remains the law of the land. If we consider the pipeline-related \ndeaths during the last Congress, that number increases to 64 total \nfatalities. Again, there have been 64 recent deaths, yet we have done \nnothing concrete to improve the law governing pipeline safety. Timely \naction not only by the Senate, but also the House, is needed to\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\naddress identified safety problems before any more lives are lost. This \nis a call for action by both Chambers.\n  I commend and thank the Senate leadership on both sides for \nrecognizing the critical need for passage of this legislation and \nscheduling this floor action so quickly. This early attention by the \nSenate demonstrates our firm commitment to improving pipeline safety. I \nremain hopeful that the new Congress as a whole will act quickly to \ntake the necessary action to improve pipeline safety before we receive \nanother call to action by yet another tragic accident.\n  Before I discuss the specific provisions of the legislation, I would \nlike to discuss the safety record for pipeline transportation. \nAccording to the Department of Transportation, pipeline related \nincidents dropped nearly 80 percent between 1975 and 1998, and the loss \nof product due to accident ruptures has been cut in half. From 1989 \nthrough 1998, pipeline accidents resulted in about 22 fatalities per \nyear--far fewer than the number of fatal accidents experienced among \nother modes. While the fatality rate has been generally low, it has \ntaken a turn in the wrong direction during the past 2 years--with 26 \nfatalities in 1999 and 38 fatalities in the year 2000. I must also \npoint out that according to the General Accounting Office, the total \nnumber of major pipeline accidents--those resulting in a fatality, and \ninjury or property damage of $50,000 or more--increased by about 4 \npercent annually between 1989 and 1998.\n  The leading cause of pipeline failures is outside force damage, \nusually from excavation by third parties. Other causes of failures \ninclude corrosion, incorrect operation, construction, material defect, \nequipment malfunction, and pipe failure.\n  While statistically the safety record is generally good, accidents do \noccur, and when they occur, they can be devastating. That was certainly \nthe case last August when a pipeline accident claimed the lives of 12 \nmembers of two families camping near Carlsbad, NM, and the previous \nyear when three young men lost their lives in Bellingham, WA. That is \nwhy I believe so strongly that we must act now to help prevent future \npipeline-related tragedies. It is our duty to take action as necessary \nto ensure our Federal transportation safety policies are sound and \neffective, whether for air, rail, truck, or pipelines.\n\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety within the Department of \nTransportation's Research and Special Programs Administration oversees \nthe transportation of about 65 percent of the petroleum and most of the \nnatural gas transported in the United States. OPS regulates the day-to-\nday safety of 3,000 gas pipeline operators with more than 1.6 million \nmiles of pipelines. It also regulates more than 200 hazardous liquid \noperators with 155,000 miles of pipelines. Given the immense array of \npipelines that traverse our nation, reauthorization of the pipeline \nsafety program is, quite simply, critical to public safety.\n  The legislation before us today will strengthen and improve pipeline \nsafety. S. 235 will authorize additional funding for safety enforcement \nand research and development efforts. It will provide for increased \nState oversight authority and facilitate greater public information \nsharing at the local community level. It raises civil penalties, \nprovides whistle-blower protections for employees, and provides for \nmany other safety improvements. In short, it will promote both public \nand environmental safety.\n  Let me describe the major provisions of the bill:\n  First, the bill would require the implementation of pipeline safety \nrecommendations issued last March by the Department of Transportation's \nInspector General to the Research and Special Programs Administration. \nThe IG found several glaring safety gaps at OPS and it is incumbent \nupon us all to do all we can to insure that the Department \naffirmatively acts on these critical problems.\n  The legislation would also require the Secretary of Transportation, \nthe RSPA Administrator and the Director of the Office of Pipeline \nSafety to respond to all NTSB pipeline safety recommendations within 90 \ndays of receipt. The Department's responsiveness to NTSB pipeline \nsafety recommendations for years has been poor at best. While current \nlaw requires the Secretary to respond to the NTSB no later than 90 days \nafter receiving a safety recommendation, there are no similar \nrequirements at RSPA. I am aware of one case in particular where an \nNTSB recommendation sat at DOT's pipeline office for more than 900 days \nbefore even an acknowledgment of the recommendation was issued. Such \ndisregard for the important work of the NTSB is intolerable. Therefore, \nthis legislation statutorily requires RSPA and OPS to respond to each \nand every pipeline safety recommendation it receives from the NTSB and \nto provide a detailed report on what action it plans to initiate to \nimplement the recommendation.\n  The measure would require pipeline operators to submit to the \nSecretary of Transportation a plan designed to improve the \nqualifications for pipeline personnel. At a minimum, the qualification \nplan would have to demonstrate that pipeline employees have the \nnecessary knowledge to safely and properly perform their assigned \nduties and would require testing and periodic reexamination of the \nemployees' qualifications.\n  The legislation would require DOT to issue regulations mandating \npipeline operators to periodically determine the adequacy of their \npipelines to safely operate and to implement integrity management \nprograms to reduce those identified risks. The regulations would, at a \nminimum, require operators to do the following: base their integrity \nmanagement plans on risk assessments that they conduct; periodically \nassess the integrity of their pipelines; and, take steps to prevent and \nmitigate unintended releases, such as improving leal detection \ncapabilities or installing restrictive flow devices.\n  It also would require pipeline operators to carry out a continuing \npublic education program that would include activities to advise \nmunicipalities, school districts, businesses, and residents of pipeline \nfacility locations on a variety of pipeline safety-related matters. It \nwould also direct pipeline operators to initiate and maintain \ncommunication with State emergency response commissions and local \nemergency planning committees and to share with these entities \ninformation critical to addressing pipeline safety issues, including \ninformation on the types of product transported and efforts by the \noperator to mitigate safety risks.\n  The legislation directs the Secretary to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive plan for the collection and use of pipeline data in a \nmanner that would enable incident trend analysis and evaluations of \noperator performance. Operators would be required to report incident \nreleases greater than five gallons, compared to the current reporting \nrequirement of 50 barrels. In addition, the Secretary would be directed \nto establish a national depository of data to be administered by the \nBureau of Transportation Statistics in cooperation with RSPA.\n  In recognition of the critical importance of technology applications \nin promoting transportation safety across all modes of transportation, \nthe legislation directs the Secretary to focus on technologies to \nimprove pipeline safety as part of the Department's research and \ndevelopment efforts. Further, the legislation includes provisions \nadvanced last year by Senator Bingaman, myself, and others, to provide \nfor a collaborative R effort directed by the Department of \nTransportation with the assistance of the Department of Energy and the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  The bill provides for a three-year authorization, with increased \nfunding for Federal pipeline safety activities, the state grant \nprogram, and research and development efforts. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that we are seeking the views of the Administration \nregarding the funding levels and will carefully consider funding and \nother concerns as the bill proceeds through the legislative process. We \nmust ensure that the Department has the tools it needs to carry out its \ncritical pipeline safety activities and to advance research and \ndevelopment efforts.\n  The legislation requires operators, in the event of an accident, to \nmake available to the DOT or NTSB all records and information \npertaining to the accident and to assist in the investigation to the \nextent reasonable. It also includes provisions concerning serious \naccident that provide for a review\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\nto ensure the operator's employees can safely perform their duties.\n  In addition, pipeline employees are afforded the same whistle-blower \nprotections as are provided to employees in other modes of \ntransportation. These protections are nearly identical to the \nprotections aviation-related employees were granted in the Wendell H. \nFord Aviation and Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century.\n  Again, I hope this Congress can act expeditiously to approve \ncomprehensive pipeline safety legislation. We simply cannot afford \nanother missed opportunity to address identified pipeline safety \nshortcomings.\n  The Senate can be very proud to be taking action on such an important \npublic safety issue as one of its first legislative acts of the 107th \nCongress. We must act to help improve pipeline safety and prevent \nfuture tragedies like those that occurred in Washington and New Mexico. \nI urge my colleagues' support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I point out to my colleagues something that bears \nlooking at. This map behind me is a snapshot of the thousands of miles \nof gas transmission, gas distribution, and hazardous liquid pipelines \nthat crisscross our country. It is based on data compiled in 1997 by \nMAPSearch Services in the Office of Pipeline Safety. The Office of \nPipeline Safety is in the process of completing its own mapping \ninitiative that will provide a much greater level of accuracy and will \nbe made available to the public via the Internet by this legislation.\n  While the Office of Pipeline Safety is years behind in completing \nthis initiative, it is projected that by the end of February, 86 \npercent of hazardous liquid lines and 29 percent of natural gas \ntransmission lines will be mapped under this new initiative. I am \ncommitted to ensuring that OPS completes this initiative in a timely \nmanner and to the highest degree of accuracy possible.\n  What is important, from the map I have here today, is for all of us \nto realize that pipeline safety affects all of us. We owe it to our \nconstituents to pass this measure today and to press the House to act \nexpeditiously to pass a bill in order to improve pipeline safety.\n  Let me, for the benefit of my colleagues, particularly the 11 new \nMembers, provide a brief history of the work of the Commerce Committee \nand the time devoted by the Senate during the last Congress which led \nto the development of the pending legislation.\n  I understand there will be amendments that will be proposed. I in no \nway object to those amendments. I want a proper perspective to be given \non this issue. We just didn't come up with this legislation.\n  The Commerce Committee's work began nearly a year ago when we held a \nfield hearing in Bellingham, Washington, on March 13th, at which 18 \npeople formally testified--including the Governor of Washington, mayors \nand city officials, the parents of the three boys killed in the tragic \nJune 1999 pipeline accident, representatives of state and federal \npipeline safety regulatory agencies, oil and gas companies, and public \ninterest groups.\n  We then held a full committee hearing on pipeline safety on May 11th \nat which we heard from Senator Patty Murray and several Representatives \nfrom Washington State. We also received testimony from the \nAdministrator of the Department of Transportation's Research and \nSpecial Programs Administration, the DOT Inspector General, the NTSB, \nthe parents of the children killed in the Washington pipeline accident, \nand witnesses representing the natural gas transmission industry, the \nnatural gas distribution industry, the hazardous liquid pipeline \nindustry, State pipeline inspectors, and public safety advocates.\n  Each and every one of the 30 witnesses testifying before our \ncommittee recommended changes in the current law and offered views on \nthe legislative proposals pending at the time. Members both on and off \nthe Commerce Committee also offered specific recommendations. And \ncountless meetings were held by Members and staff discussing ways to \nimprove pipeline safety. The Commerce Committee operated in a manner to \nensure that anyone who wanted to participate in this process could do \nso and the input from the many diverse interests has been both useful \nand appreciated.\n  Next, the Commerce Committee met in executive session on June 15 \nduring which we considered a substitute amendment which was the product \nof the many views presented to the committee. We also adopted a number \nof other amendments and debated others that weren't adopted. We agreed \nto continue to work to resolve some outstanding issues prior to taking \nthe bill to the floor. That bill was reported by the committee without \none dissenting vote.\n  Following that markup, the interested Members continued working to \ntry to find common ground on those areas that had not been resolved \nduring the executive session. Now, I will remind my colleagues of the \ntragic pipeline accident that occurred during the August recess when 12 \nmembers of two families camping near Carlsbad, NM, lost their lives \nwhen a natural gas transmission line ruptured. Sadly, it was that \ntragic accident that spurred the prompt action upon the Senate's return \nin September. During the first week back from the August recess, we \nreached a final consensus on the legislation to enable the bill's \nprompt consideration. The bill was approved by unanimous consent on \nSeptember 7.\n\n  Unfortunately, the House failed to approve pipeline safety \nlegislation during the last Congress. As a result, the status quo under \nwhich 64 lives have been lost in just the past 2 years remains the law \nof the land. We simply must take action--both Chambers must take \naction--and allow us to get to a conference and to send a strong pro-\nsafety pipeline bill to the President.\n  Mr. President, I believe every Member of this Chamber can be proud \nthat one of our very first legislative acts for the new Congress is to \nconsider legislation to strengthen federal pipeline safety policies and \nin turn, improve public safety. I urge the House to also make pipeline \nsafety an early priority and enable the Congress to carry out its \nobligations to the American public.\n  I recognize that some Members may not have expected this bill to have \nbeen scheduled for floor action as quickly as this week. It is not my \nintent, nor do I believe it is the leadership's, to preclude any Member \nfrom having the opportunity to offer their views on how we could even \nfurther improve pipeline safety. But I want to remind all of my \ncolleagues that this measure did pass this Chamber by unanimous consent \njust 5 months ago. And it took considerable effort and bipartisan \ncooperation and compromise to enable that action to occur.\n  Some would like the bill to go further and some believe it goes too \nfar. But we did work long and hard to finally achieve a consensus in \nthis legislation and I hope our new colleagues who were not in the \nSenate during the last Congress will carefully consider the critical \nimportance of advancing this pipeline safety measure through the \nprocess. And, I want to state for the Record my strong interest in \nworking with the administration on this issue. I will certainly \nconsider any recommendations it may offer to improve pipeline safety as \nwe work to move this legislation through conference.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize two Members who \nplayed key roles in the process last year that culminated in the \ncreation of the measure before us today. They are Senator Patty Murray \nand Senator Slade Gorton. It was in large part due to their tireless \nwork and bipartisan cooperation that enabled the Senate to pass a \nstrong, pro-safety pipeline bill last year. And it is in the spirit of \ncontinued bipartisan cooperation that we are able to consider this bill \ntoday.\n  Finally, I want to again mention the other sponsors of this bill: \nThey are Senators Hollings, Hutchison, Bingaman, Domenici, Breaux, \nBrownback, Smith, and Landrieu. I thank them for their work and \nbipartisan cooperation on this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of comprehensive \npipeline safety legislation. I want to especially commend Senator \nMcCain for his strong, personal leadership on this issue. He held \nhearings on pipeline safety in the last Congress, and he's helped make \nthis legislation a priority here in the Senate. We would not be here \ntoday without Senator McCain's leadership.\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\n  I first got involved in this issue 20 months ago in the wake of a \nhorrible pipeline explosion in my home State of Washington. On June 10, \n1999 in Bellingham, Washington a gasoline pipeline ruptured. Gas poured \nout of the pipeline and overflowed into Whatcom Creek. Eventually, that \ngasoline ignited, and it created a massive fireball. The explosion sent \na plume of smoke more than 20,000 feet into the air--as you can see in \nthis picture. But most tragic of all, the explosion killed three young \npeople. It shattered a community and inflicted serious environmental \ndamage. Without warning on a quiet summer day, three young people were \ntaken from their families in a tragedy that should never have happened.\n  After the accident, I spent several months learning about pipelines. \nI learned that the Office of Pipeline Safety oversees more than 157,000 \nmiles of hazardous liquid pipelines and more than 2.2 million miles of \nnatural gas lines throughout the country. These pipelines run near our \nschools, our homes, and our communities. They perform a vital service--\nbringing us the energy we need for cars, airplanes, and home heating. \nBut at the same time, they are not as safe as they could be.\n  I learned that it's hard for citizens to find out if they live near a \npipeline--much less if that pipeline is safe. I learned that many of \nthese pipelines were laid down 30 or 40 years ago, and they are getting \nold. They're subject to internal corrosion and to external damage. And \nworst, of all--they may not receive regular inspections. I learned that \ntoo many pipeline operators don't have the training they need. And I \nlearned that we're not investing in pipeline safety--both in oversight \nand in the new technology that will make pipelines safer.\n  Mr. President, the impact of all of these problems can be seen in the \nnumber of pipeline accidents. Between January 1, 1986 and December 31, \n1999, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents in this \ncountry, 325 deaths, 1,500 injuries, and almost $1 billion in \nenvironmental damage. On average there is one pipeline accident every \nday in this country, and 6 million hazardous gallons are spilled into \nour environment every year.\n  As I worked on pipeline safety, I talked to a lot of people. I worked \nwith officials at all levels of government, with industry \nrepresentatives, environmentalists, state and federal regulators, and \nconcerned citizens.\n  Last year, I introduced my own pipelines safety legislation. I was \npleased when Senator McCain--as Chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee--made this issue a priority and held a hearing and a markup \non pipeline safety legislation. And many other Senators played key \nroles--especially Senators Hollings, Bingaman, Inouye, Domenici, \nBreaux, and Wyden--and also former-senator Slade Gorton. On June 15, \nour bill passed out of committee.\n  Then, on August 19, there was another terrible pipeline explosion \nnear Carlsbad, NM. That blast killed 12 people. That horrific accident \nreminded this Senate that we had to act. As a result, our bill passed \nthe Senate on September 7. Let me review the features of the McCain-\nMurray bill as passed last year.\n  To make pipelines safer, our bill improved the qualification and \ntraining of pipeline personnel, improved pipeline inspection and \nprevention practices, expanded the public's right to know about \npipeline hazards, raised the penalties for safety violators, enabled \nStates to expand their safety efforts, invested in new technology to \nimprove safety, protected whistle blowers, increased funding for safety \nefforts by $13 billion, and recognized State citizen advisory \ncommittees and allowed for their funding.\n  This bill--which is again being considered today--was the strongest \npipeline safety bill to ever pass either Chamber of Congress. The \nSenate has clearly made pipeline safety a priority--and we are doing so \nagain this year. Then our bill moved to the House for debate. In the \nHouse, it did gather support from a majority of Representatives. \nUnfortunately, it was brought up for a vote through a procedure that \nrequired a two-thirds majority--and it fell short.\n  Again this year, it is the House of Representatives that must step up \nto the plate on this issue. That is why I have worked with Washington's \ncongressional delegation--especially Congressman Rick Larsen who \nrepresents Bellingham--to develop additional provisions to address some \nof the concerns expressed by the House last year.\n  I am proud to report that Congressman Larsen introduced that \nlegislation in the House this week. I also plan on introducing it here \nin the Senate today so it can become part of the process we use to \nenact the best legislation. The delegation legislation that Congressman \nLarsen and I have worked on will improve the McCain bill in several \nways.\n\n  It will strengthen the provision on employee certification. It will \nfurther increase penalties for safety violations. It will improve the \ncommunity's right to know. And, it will ensure periodic inspections of \npipelines.\n  The strongest pipeline safety bill ever to pass either body of \nCongress is on the floor of the U.S. Senate right now. A vote yes is a \nvote for progress--a vote to make pipelines safer. A vote no is a vote \nfor the status quo. A vote no freezes the process. A vote no leaves us \nexactly where we were when three people were killed in Bellingham and \n12 people were killed in Carlsbad.\n  Are there things we can do to improve this bill? Yes. But we well \nnever get to them unless this bill passes out of the Senate. This bill \nrepresents our single best opportunity to make pipelines safer. That's \nclear from what happened last year. Last year, the Senate passed this \nbill, and some in the House had problems with it. The improvements will \nbe made--and the differences will be worked out--in the conference \nprocess. But we can't get to the conference process until the Senate \nand the House each pass pipeline safety legislation.\n  Voting against this bill won't make pipelines safer. Voting for this \nbill--and making improvements during conference--will make pipelines \nsafer.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I expect the bill we're debating today--S. \n235--to pass the Senate again this year--as it did last year.\n  Then--once again--the House will need to pass its own legislation.\n  At that point, the two bills will be reconciled by a conference \ncommittee. That committee's work will be critical.\n  Ultimately, I hope that the conference committee's final bill will \nresemble the bill I've been working on with the Washington state \ndelegation.\n  Mr. President, this isn't the end of our discussion on pipeline \nsafety. In fact, it's just the start and that starting process begins \nby voting yes for this bill.\n  Before I conclude, I want to comment on the current energy crisis. \nIt's something that I have spent a lot of time on in the past few \nmonths, and it is having a real impact on the people of my State.\n  I have been listening very closely to President Bush's comments. \nAmong other things, he has suggested streamlining the approval process \nfor installing pipelines. That concerns me.\n  I recognize that we need to increase our energy generation, but we \nshouldn't do it at the expense of our safety or our environment. Just \nbecause we are having an energy crisis does not mean that the families \nin Bellingham or Carlsbad will accept a rollback of safety standards.\n  I hope President Bush will agree that we shouldn't replace our \ncurrent energy crisis with a pipeline safety crisis. Let me offer four \nways President Bush can show his commitment to public safety, The first \none is simple. We shouldn't backtrack on safety. Senate bill 235--\nrepresents the new minimum of safety standards. President Bush should \nnot send us a proposal that is less stringent than this bill. Let me \ngive you one example. Our bill expands the public's right to know about \nproblems with pipelines and ensure communities and States have a role \nin pipeline safety.\n  Last week, I heard about a draft energy plan that President Bush may \nput forward. It gives the oil and gas industry a guaranteed seat at \nevery meeting on pipeline regulations. However, it provides no \nguarantee that concerned citizens, local officials or state \nrepresentatives would be part of the decisionmaking process.\n  President Bush should not undue the progress we made last year. And I \nhope he'll show a sensitivity to safety and environmental concerns that \nhave been\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nabsent from his discussions on this issue to date. Second, President \nBush should signal his support of pipeline safety legislation, which I \nhope will ultimately take the form of him signing a bill into law. \nThird, President Bush should fund pipeline safety in his budget as a \npriority. I will be fighting for pipeline safety funding in the \nupcoming budget debate, and I will hold the administration accountable \nfor its commitment to investing in pipeline safety. Finally, President \nBush's Department of Transportation should continue to issue \nadministrative rules to make pipelines safer.\n  The Clinton administration took several important administrative \nsteps.\n  They issued safety and environmental regulations that require \nmandatory safety testing of pipelines in populated areas, in sensitive \nenvironmental areas, and along waterways. And at my request, they \nstationed a pipeline inspector in Washington State. And they agreed to \ngive Washington state more of a role in pipeline inspections. I hope \nthe Bush administration will show the same level of commitment.\n  So I hope President Bush will reconsider his energy proposal to make \nsure it will heed the lessons we've learned from so many pipeline \naccidents. We do need to address our energy needs, but not at the \nexpense of our safety. Let's make pipelines safe first, before we lay \ndown more pipelines. I want to close with one final image. This chart \nshows where pipeline accidents have taken place between 1984 and 1999. \nAs you can see, pipelines fail in every State.\n  The states marked in yellow had between 3 and 19 accidents. The \nstates marked in orange had between 20 and 69 accidents. And the states \nmarked in red had 70 or more pipeline accidents. As you can see--most \nof the States are red. I don't want to have to color more of these \nStates red.\n  If we learned anything last year, it's that we must not wait for \nanother tragedy to force us to act. We must pass a comprehensive \npipeline safety bill this year. This bill represents the start of our \nefforts in Congress this year, and I will work with anyone who want to \nmake pipelines safer. I know that we can't undo what happened in \nBellingham, but we can take the lessons from the Bellingham tragedy and \nput them into law so that families will know the pipelines near their \nhomes are safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Washington that \nshe is too modest. Had it not been for her efforts and those of former \nSenator Gorton, I know we would not have achieved the product that we \nhave. I am grateful for her continued commitment not only to this \nlegislation but to the families who experienced the terrible tragedy in \nBellingham where all are very appreciative.\n  I note the presence of Senator Breaux, a friend from Louisiana who \nalso has significant background and knowledge on this issue and who has \nplayed a very important role in its passage. I will be brief.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record at this time a \nstatement from the Office of Management and Budget. Also, I ask that \ntwo letters in support of this legislation from the National Governors' \nAssociation and the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n\n            S. 235--Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001\n\n                 (McCain (R) Arizona and 7 co-sponsors)\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 235, which \n     would significantly strengthen the enforcement of pipeline \n     safety laws: The Administration appreciates the Senate's \n     action in making consideration of pipeline safety legislation \n     one of its first priorities. The tragic deaths last year of \n     12 family members in Carlsbad, New Mexico, and the earlier \n     deaths of three youths in Bellingham, Washington, underscore \n     the need for action.\n       The Administration looks forward to working further with \n     Congress to secure enactment of pipeline safety legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Governors Associations,\n\n                                                 February 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the nation's Governors, we \n     are writing to express our support for S. 235, a bill to \n     improve oil and gas pipeline safety, and to encourage prompt \n     passage of such legislation. Governors are concerned about \n     the increasing number of pipeline accidents and reported \n     regulatory inaction by the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS). \n     As you know, the General Accounting Office (GAO) report on \n     OPS issued last year noted that the agency failed to \n     implement 22 of the 49 requirements made by Congress over the \n     last decade, and has the lowest rate of any transportation \n     agency for implementing recommendations of the National \n     Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).\n       It is important to Governors that OPS be required by law to \n     comply with congressionally mandated requirements and \n     implement the recommendations of the NTSB. OPS should also \n     strengthen its rules regarding pipeline operation, \n     maintenance, and public reporting of spills and leaks.\n       Equally important to Governors, legislation should grant \n     OPS the continued authority to enter into agreements with \n     states to inspect and oversee interstate pipelines. According \n     to the GAO report, states have performed well as interstate \n     agents under these agreements, yet until recently OPS was \n     phasing out interstate agent agreements. The National \n     Governors Association (NGA) adopted a policy statement last \n     year (enclosed) that urges Congress to review this \n     unfortunate trend. State inspectors typically are able to \n     perform more frequent and more thorough inspections than \n     federal inspectors, improving their ability to detect safety \n     problems and prevent accidents.\n       NGA's policy support pipeline safety legislation that \n     provides states with the authority to protect our citizens \n     from pipeline explosions and leaks. States should be \n     authorized to establish standards that do not conflict with \n     but may exceed federal standards. Our policy also endorses \n     the ability of states to enforce violations of federal or \n     state standards. We look forward to working with you on \n     legislation that accomplishes these goals.\n       Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to \n     contact Diane S. Shea, Director of NGA's Natural Resources \n     Group, at 202/624-5389, if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Vilsack\n       Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n     Frank Keating,\n       Vice Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                    NR-20. Improved Pipeline Safety\n\n\n                             20.1  Preamble\n\n       The United States contains approximately 2 million miles of \n     natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. The U.S. \n     Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety \n     (OPS) is responsible for regulating these pipelines. OPS \n     retains oversight authority unless it grants authority to \n     individual states. A number of states have assumed oversight \n     responsibility for intrastate gas and liquid pipelines within \n     their borders following certification by OPS; a far smaller \n     number are responsible for inspection of interstate lines.\n       OPS authority derives from the 1968 Natural Gas Pipeline \n     Safety Act and the 1979 Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety \n     Act, which were substantially amended in 1992 and 1996. OPS \n     is responsible for establishing and enforcing safety \n     standards for the construction, testing, operation, and \n     maintenance of pipelines. The Pipeline Safety Program is due \n     to be reauthorized in September 2000.\n\n\n                         20.2  Recommendations\n\n                   20.2.1  Increasing State Authority\n\n       The Governors urge Congress to consider amending the 1968 \n     Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and the 1979 Hazardous \n     Liquids Pipeline Safety Act and authorize states to establish \n     safety standards for interstate pipelines that do not \n     conflict with but may exceed federal standards. States should \n     also be authorized to enforce violations of federal or state \n     standards.\n       The Governors urge Congress to review the policy of OPS to \n     decline to grant any additional states interstate agent \n     status for interstate pipelines.\n\n\n                    20.2.2  Congressional Oversight\n\n       The Governors urge that Congress, as it reauthorizes OPS, \n     require the office to strengthen its rules, as appropriate. \n     OPS should be required to explain its failure to comply, in \n     some cases for over a decade, with the recommendations of the \n     National Transportation Safety Board for periodic internal \n     and hydrostatic testing and operator certification. The \n     office should be held accountable for its failure to meet \n     congressional mandates to define ``environmentally sensitive \n     areas'' and ``high-density population areas.''\n\n\n                      20.2.3  More Effective Rules\n\n       The Governors urge that Congress require OPS to strengthen \n     rules, as appropriate, regarding pipeline operation, \n     maintenance, and public reporting of spills and leaks. These \n     should include a review of: Requiring federal certification \n     of operator training and qualification; increasing inspection \n     requirements for pipeline corrosion; requiring study and \n     implementation of state-of-the-art leak detection systems; \n     requiring installation of\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\n     effective fail-safe mechanisms; imposing safety standards for \n     liquid fuel pipelines that are at least as stringent as those \n     for natural gas pipelines; requiring pipeline operators to \n     report to OPS and affected jurisdictions all spills greater \n     than five gallons; requiring pipeline operators to disclose \n     the results of all pipeline inspections to local and state \n     authorities; requiring OPS to work with local emergency \n     response providers to develop preparedness and response plans \n     and providing appropriate funding support to local \n     jurisdictions to implement such plans; requiring pipeline \n     operators to periodically plan and drill cooperatively with \n     local emergency response providers; and requiring periodic \n     management audits of pipeline companies to ensure compliance \n     with the foregoing.\n\n\n                      20.2.4  Appropriate Funding\n\n       The Governors urge Congress to fund OPS at a level that \n     will allow an increased allocation for states, working in \n     partnership with the federal agency, to ensure pipeline \n     safety, as well as providing for federal research and \n     development on technologies for leak detection, testing, safe \n     operations, corrosion protection, and internal inspection.\n\n\n                 20.2.5  Intergovernmental Cooperation\n\n       The Governors urge the states and the federal government to \n     work together to exchange data on ways to improve their \n     inspections of intrastate pipelines and local distribution \n     companies to continue to improve the safety of these \n     facilities. The Governors also urge the states to review the \n     OPS' Common Ground Report--Study of One-Call Systems and \n     Damage Prevention Best Practices issued in August 1999, and \n     compare their state one-call systems to the proposals for \n     improving one-call systems in order to continue improving \n     ways of preventing third-party damage to underground \n     facilities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                             Regulatory Utility Commissioners,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2001.\n     Re S. 235--Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Lott: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) we \n     urge you to support swift passage of S. 235. However, NARUC \n     does not believe S. 235 should be the vehicle for broader \n     energy policy legislation. NARUC would therefore oppose \n     amendments that would attempt to expand this bill beyond its \n     current intent of improving pipeline safety.\n       Last Congress NARUC expressed strong support for the \n     reauthorization of pipeline safety legislation provided \n     sufficient funding to the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) for \n     State grants was authorized. We believe the increase in \n     funding for these grants found in S. 235 will better enable \n     OPS to meet its obligation of a 50% funding share for this \n     Federal/State partnership.\n       Additionally, NARUC and its membership strongly believe \n     there is a vital role for the States in ensuring the safe \n     operation of pipelines regardless of the interstate or \n     intrastate nature of the pipeline in question. NARUC strongly \n     supports provisions of S. 235 that provide States with \n     increased authority and increased participation in safety \n     activities of the pipelines traversing our States.\n       There will be more we can do to improve upon S. 235, and \n     NARUC is committed to working with Congress in the future to \n     produce legislation that improves upon this bill. We too \n     would like to see a stronger bill, one that provides the \n     States with more oversight. However, we believe that it is \n     vitally important to the safety and welfare of our citizens \n     to send pipeline safety legislation to the President as soon \n     as possible. Thank you for your consideration of NARUC's \n     views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nora Mead Brownell,\n       President, NARUC Commissioner, Pennsylvania Public Utility \n     Commission.\n     Edward J. Holmes,\n       Chair, NARUC Committee on Gas Commissioner, Kentucky Public \n     Service Commission.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note Senator Breaux is here. My friend \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, also wishes to speak.\n  I invite others who wish to speak on this issue. We would like to \nconsider amendments after that and move to passage of this bill today. \nThat is our intention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to follow the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank my colleagues for the remarks they have made on \nthis legislation already. I was particularly pleased to be here when \nSenator Murray from Washington was making her remarks. As the chairman \nof the committee acknowledged regarding her contributions, she was an \nactive participant in the drafting of this legislation in the last \nCongress, actually to the point of being invited by the chairman to sit \nin the committee and participating as a member because she made \nvaluable contributions in developing this legislation.\n  I rise in strong support of the bill that is now before the Senate. \nIt is a major step in ensuring the safety and the integrity of a system \nof pipelines that is covering the entire United States, bringing \nnecessary energy to our families, to our businesses, and to our \nindustry.\n  We worked over a year in the last Congress, saying we have to do a \nbetter job than we have done in the past. What we produced last year \nwas an important contribution. It took into account concerns of both \nthe operators and owners of pipelines, as well as those who are served \nby those pipelines. We all have a common interest in seeing that these \nlines have integrity, that they are technologically the best we could \nhave in this country. The bottom line is, they are safe.\n\n  We produced a bill in the last Congress that passed the Senate by a \nunanimous vote. That was not an easy accomplishment. There were a lot \nof different sides with opinions on how the legislation should look and \nwhat it should do. Some, quite frankly, thought it went too far. Others \nfelt it didn't go far enough.\n  The bottom line is that at the end of last year this bill came to the \nSenate in essentially the same form it is in today and passed by a \nunanimous vote. That indicated there was general agreement, obviously, \non what the content should be.\n  Unfortunately, the House took the legislation up on what they call a \nsuspension of the rules and it failed by a 23-vote margin from being \nadopted in the House. That was most unfortunate. Had the other body \nbeen able to do what I think most of them wanted to do--a majority, in \nfact, voted for it--this issue would be behind us and we would have in \nplace today a new system of inspection, a new system for qualifications \nfor the operators, and community right-to-know provisions would be the \nlaw of the land.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case. Therefore, under the leadership \nof our chairman, Senator McCain, and other members of the Commerce \nCommittee, and Members of the Senate, we are back on the floor where we \nleft off last year with the product that already passed, essentially, \nthe Senate in the last Congress by unanimous consent.\n  It is an important issue for my State, an important issue for me. We \nhave over 40,000 miles of pipeline in my State alone--33,000 on shore \nand about 7,000 miles in the Gulf of Mexico--bringing the largest \nsupply of natural gas in North America from the Gulf of Mexico. We have \n7,000 miles of pipeline buried under the ocean in the Gulf of Mexico \nthat brings the natural gas on shore, and that is distributed through a \npipeline system throughout the United States. Mr. President, 33,000 \nmiles of those pipelines are in my own State of Louisiana. We have a \nvery strong interest in making sure those lines are secure and safe.\n  What does the bill do? No. 1, we require periodic pipeline testing. \nThat will be a requirement. A line can be inspected by internal devices \nsuch as a ``pig,'' which is basically the name for a device that is run \nthrough the pipeline, a very sophisticated piece of technology. It is \nreferred to as a ``pig'' because it sort of squeaks through the \npipeline and takes various measurements as to integrity of the line. It \ntests for corrosion of the line, tests for leaks or potential leaks of \nthe line. A very sophisticated and very accurate piece of equipment \nthat we require would be run through all of these pipelines on a \nperiodic basis.\n  However, it is important to note that only about 35 percent of the \nnatural gas pipelines are susceptible to being tested through this type \nof technological instrument called the ``pig'', the rest of them are \nnot. In the legislation, we allow that in the areas where the so-called \n``pig'' technology is not suitable because of the type and size of the \nline or the bends in the line, there be other methods of testing that \nwould be periodically required by the legislation.\n  For instance, we require the operators perform direct assessments of \ntheir lines. What do we mean by direct\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nassessments? It is not a term of architect; it is pretty much what it \nimplies. We require operators to actually dig up the lines and \nphysically inspect them for corrosion and any other abnormalities that \nmay be interfering with the integrity of the lines actually by physical \ninspection of the lines, looking at them, and other methodologies they \nwould employ after the lines are actually dug up to ensure they are \nsafe.\n\n  We also leave room for other technology. We want to use the best \ntechnology available to inspect the lines, and we certainly leave room \nfor that.\n  We also had some concerns in the legislation which I think now have \nbeen satisfactorily worked out with regard to employees who may \npotentially be involved in any type of an accident. We still believe \npeople are innocent until proven guilty, but there are certainly \ncircumstances when people are involved in an accident where we do not \nwant to keep them doing the same thing at the same time and in the same \nplace until the responsibility for the accident is determined. That is \nnot to say we in any way presume someone to be guilty. We have worked \nout a satisfactory methodology for handling people involved in these \ntypes of accidents.\n  We are also required, with regard to the operator qualifications, to \nmake sure the people who operate the lines, the people who have the \ncapability of shutting them off when there is something that has \nhappened, have the best training and the best information and knowledge \nin order to be involved in operating something as sophisticated as a \nnatural gas pipeline. We require operator qualifications so that we \nmake certain the people in charge are qualified, and they should be \ntested in order to make sure they are qualified. This is a big \nimprovement, something that is very important.\n  We also invest in a new technology to which I was referring. Senator \nBingaman was involved in wanting to ensure that we are encouraging the \ndevelopment of better technology to improve the inspection process, \nwhich we do by this legislation.\n  Also, the States are given an increased role in their inspection of \nthe interstate pipelines. There is a legitimate argument that the lines \nrun through 50 States and you cannot have 50 different sets of \nstandards, 50 different departments investigating and inspecting them. \nIt needs to be coordinated, but the States need to be involved. We have \ngiven an increased role to the States to be involved in this. I think \nthat is positive.\n  Also, for the communities--providing increased involvement in \npipeline safety. Operators are required under this legislation, I think \nprobably for the first time, to maintain a relationship both with the \nState and local officials and providing them the information they need \non a local and State level to make sure their constituents are also \naware of where the lines are located, and additional information about \npotential hazards and other information they would need to know.\n  Again, let me conclude by saying some people say it should be a lot \nstronger than this. Others say this is far too regimented an operation \nand it should not be that restrictive. But I do think, because of the \ngood faith on both sides, we have come up with something that is a \nbalanced approach. It is a major improvement over the current system.\n  I think we should do as we did in the last Congress, pass this bill \nby unanimous consent. The other body will work their will. There will \nbe a conference. There will be differences, I point out, between the \nHouse version and the Senate version.\n  For those who think the right thing to do is try to amend it here, I \nsuggest, in all good faith, it may be better to take a look at what the \nHouse does and work within the conference to get what may be more to \ntheir viewpoint. I think it would be a mistake, just from the politics \nof handling this, to offer amendments on the floor of the Senate that \nmay not pass, and have a recorded vote which would prevent the Senate, \nwhen the bill comes back, from accepting something that maybe, frankly, \nmay be more to its liking.\n  There is a process here that people should be cautioned about. In \norder to improve the legislation in the way they may like to see it \nimproved, I caution them and I recommend the best thing to do is pass \nthis bill in its current form, work with the House in the conference, \nand then see what happens when the conference comes back.\n  To all colleagues who have helped produce this bill, I thank them; I \ncongratulate them for a job very well done, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are a number of colleagues who \nwant to speak. I had wanted to speak about an amendment that I join \nSenator Boxer on and she is on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Boxer be allowed to lead off. I myself will only take 5 minutes \nfollowing her. I think this amendment will be accepted; is that right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), for herself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Energy to request the National \n Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of, and report to Congress on, \n             increasing the reserve supply of natural gas)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . STUDY OF NATURAL GAS RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) In the last few months, natural gas prices across the \n     country have tripled.\n       (2) In California, natural gas prices have increased \n     twenty-fold, from $3 per million British thermal units to \n     nearly $60 per million British thermal units.\n       (3) One of the major causes of these price increases is a \n     lack of supply, including a lack of natural gas reserves.\n       (4) The lack of a reserve was compounded by the rupture of \n     an El Paso Natural Gas Company pipeline in Carlsbad, New \n     Mexico on August 1, 2000.\n       (5) Improving pipeline safety will help prevent similar \n     accidents that interrupt the supply of natural gas and will \n     help save lives.\n       (6) It is also necessary to find solutions for the lack of \n     natural gas reserves that could be used during emergencies.\n       (b) Study by the National Academy of Sciences.--The \n     Secretary of Energy shall request the National Academy of \n     Sciences to--\n       (1) conduct a study to--\n       (A) determine the causes of recent increases in the price \n     of natural gas, including whether the increases have been \n     caused by problems with the supply of natural gas or by \n     problems with the natural gas transmission system;\n       (B) identify any Federal or State policies that may have \n     contributed to the price increases; and\n       (C) determine what Federal action would be necessary to \n     improve the reserve supply of natural gas for use in \n     situations of natural gas shortages and price increases, \n     including determining the feasibility and advisability of a \n     federal strategic natural gas reserve system; and\n       (2) not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, submit to Congress a report on the results of the \n     study.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, so my colleagues know, I will be very \nbrief on this amendment because I am extremely pleased that it has been \naccepted by both sides. I know enough that when you have an ``aye'' \nvote, be brief. I will probably take about 5 minutes, and then I \nunderstand my friend Paul Wellstone wants to speak in support.\n  First, let me thank my colleagues, both Democratic and Republican, \nfor accepting this amendment which I think is an important one because \nit looks to the problem of natural gas prices. What we have seen when \nAmericans are opening up their utility bills this month, some of them \nare in complete shock because in many cases their bills have doubled \nand tripled. We believe the cause is the spike in natural gas prices.\n  It would be very simple if we could tell people not to use the heat \nin their homes. But heat is a necessity. Although we can all do our \nbest, this is\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\nnot similar to buying a candy bar. It is something that a lot of our \npeople need. It is not a luxury. They need the natural gas to heat \ntheir homes.\n  If we look at the facts, we can see in the last few months natural \ngas prices have skyrocketed. In California, it is hard to even believe \nthis, but the facts show that natural gas prices have increased \ntwentyfold, from $3 per million Btu's to nearly $60 per million Btu's.\n  Experts agree that one of the major causes of this price increase is \na lack of supply. That includes a lack of natural gas reserves. In \nother words, the reserves just are not there in times of crisis or a \ncrunch. In California, the lack of a reserve was compounded by the \nrupture of an El Paso Natural Gas Company pipeline in Carlsbad, NM, on \nAugust 1, 2000.\n  What is very important about this underlying legislation, and why I \nsupport it so much, is that we want to make sure similar accidents are \nprevented. We do not want to face the tragedy of lost lives anywhere in \nthis country. With safe pipelines, we will not have to face that. But, \nin addition, when we do not have these accidents, we will not see an \ninterruption in the supply of natural gas.\n  We need to look at and solve the lack of natural gas reserves in \ntimes of extreme shortages. My amendment attempts to get to the bottom \nof these issues. It requires a National Academy of Sciences study to \ninvestigate this problem. First, the study will determine the causes of \nrecent increases in the price of natural gas. Second, the study will \nidentify any Federal and State policies which may have contributed to \nthis price increase. Finally, and to me most important, the study will \ndetermine how the Federal Government can take action to ensure that \nthere is an adequate reserve supply in the future.\n  I especially want to learn about the feasibility and advisability of \na Federal strategic natural gas reserve for use during supply and price \nemergencies.\n  We all know we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We also know that \na natural gas reserve raises other issues, but, in fact, it may well be \nfeasible.\n  I trust my amendment will help all of us understand the causes of the \nnatural gas problem we are facing, and I am very optimistic that this \nstudy will give us a range of solutions to meet this crisis now and in \nthe future.\n  The spike in natural gas prices is not a California phenomenon, \nalthough we have seen, probably, the worst of the spikes in prices. We \nare beginning to see it all over the country. That is why my friend, \nBarbara Mikulski, wanted to be a cosponsor of this amendment. That is \nwhy Senator Wellstone as well wants to support it and wants to speak on \nit.\n\n  With deep thanks to my friends who have accepted this amendment, I \nyield the floor at this time. I ask for a vote on the amendment at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First, I defer to my colleagues from Arizona and \nLouisiana on this if they want to respond right now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since the Senator from Minnesota is speaking in support \nof the amendment, if it is agreeable to have him speak, then Senator \nBreaux and I speak, and then we intend to accept the amendment \nfollowing that, if that is agreeable to the Senator from California and \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I say yes, it is. I would like to add Senator \nMurkowski as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Murkowski or Mikulski?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Murkowski--Mikulski and Murkowski. This is a banner day.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Before my colleague from Minnesota starts, could I ask \nif we could get a unanimous consent on order of discussion here, so we \nknow how to organize things. I understand the Senator from California \ndesires to speak for around 20 minutes. I believe the Senator from \nIdaho wanted to respond for up to 10 minutes. I would like to see if I \ncould speak at that point in time for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment with Senators Boxer and Murkowski and Mikulski. The amendment \nis pretty simple. I thank my colleagues from Arizona and Louisiana and \nWashington for their support.\n  The amendment would require the National Academy of Sciences to \nconduct a study, A, to determine the cause of the recent increase in \nthe price of natural gas; B, to identify any Federal or State policies \nthat have contributed to price increases; and, C, to determine what \nFederal action might be necessary to improve natural gas supplies, \nincluding the feasibility of a Federal natural gas reserve system.\n  When my colleague from California says that this is not just \nCalifornia, she is absolutely right. In the State of Minnesota, a cold \nweather State, we just got hit with a big snowstorm yesterday. Families \nare seeing the price of natural gas going up 45, 50 percent, and it is \na real hardship.\n  I am going to be working with Senator Bingaman and others to expand \nthe LIHEAP program. We are going to need that. That just helps the \npoorest of poor people. And there are other ways of providing help for \nfamilies.\n  The fact is, a whole lot of families in Minnesota, a whole lot of \npeople, are just being killed by these prices. It is a huge consumer \nissue. This study is important. Frankly, I think all of us need to try \nto get a handle on what is happening.\n  For my own part, I say to the wholesalers, I do not quite understand \nwhy they were not able to anticipate some of the demand. Personally, I \nam skeptical about deregulation. This was 1989 and natural gas took \neffect in 1993. Part of the problem is the wholesalers have no \nincentive to have an inventory. Therefore, we see the economics of \nscarcity. But if they are not going to anticipate new power markets \ngoing on line, natural gas, new homes, new businesses, much less cold \nweather, then we are going to be right back again next winter for our \nState with the economics of scarcity, with the spike in prices. It is \nmurder not just for low income, I say to my colleagues, but also for \nmoderate income, middle income, small businesses--across the board.\n  I am so pleased this amendment has such strong support. I am pleased \nwe are going to vote on it. This is not a study for the sake of a \nstudy; this is a study that will provide us with more information so \nwe, as legislators, can take some action to deal with what I think has \nreally become one of the front-burner, central, family, consumer issues \nin the United States of America.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one point in \nthe form of a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is so right. Because of the urgency of this \nmatter, we have called for a 60-day study. I want to make sure my \nfriend knows that. This bill is just a 60-day study so we can get the \ninformation back and then come before the Senate with solutions. I want \nto make sure my friend is aware of that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my friend from California, if it was more \nthan 60 days, I do not think I would support it. The last thing I want \nto see is a study that will go on and on. This calls for action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we have discussed this amendment of the \nSenator from California and I certainly find no objection to it. In \nfact, it can be a very positive contribution. The National Academy of \nSciences is eminently qualified to take a look at the things this study \nrequires. I look forward to their recommendations.\n  I will just mention the obvious difference in creating a reserve for \ncrude oil. We have stored crude oil in salt domes, most of which are in \nmy State and the State of Texas, which is quite different from setting \nup a reserve for natural gas. I think the author understands that, but \nthat is the purpose of asking the National Academy of Sciences to take \na look at it, and perhaps they can come back with good recommendations.\n  The amendment of the Senator from California is helpful, and we \ncertainly support it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Feinstein be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to Senator McCain so we can dispose of this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if there is no further debate on the \namendment, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3.\n  The amendment (No. 3) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I begin by indicating my support for this bill and \nthanking the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their \nwork on the bill.\n  There is an issue relevant to natural gas, and it is electricity. I \nwant to use my time to outline what I believe has happened in \nCalifornia and to set to rest a couple of myths that have arisen during \nthe course of the debate.\n  The problem in California essentially was set into motion by a bill \npassed in the middle of the last decade, 1996. This was a deregulation \nbill. It is my understanding that at the time, virtually everyone came \ntogether--Republicans, Democrats, utilities, generators, and \nconsumers--to produce a bill which deregulated electricity. The bill \nwas approved quickly. It was signed at the end of the session by then-\nGovernor Pete Wilson, a former Member of this body.\n  The bill created what, in essence, was a flawed market structure. It \nderegulated wholesale power, but it left regulated the retail side. It \nalso demanded that 95 percent of California's power had to be purchased \non the day-ahead or spot market. That was fine when the supply of power \nwas plentiful, but as the supply of power shortened, spot prices rose \nto unprecedented levels, and those costs could not be passed on to the \nconsumer. The result was that California's large investor-owned \nutilities are now on the brink of bankruptcy, and the reason is that \nthey have been forced to purchase power that averages $300 per megawatt \nhour or 30 cents per kilowatt hour, while they can only pass it on to \nthe consumer at $75 a megawatt hour or 7\\1/2\\ cents a kilowatt hour.\n  Today, they have accumulated a debt of anywhere from $10 billion to \n$12.5 billion. They have severe difficulty in obtaining the credit they \nneed today to make forward purchases. Therefore, they stand on the \nbrink of bankruptcy.\n  California's current mix of regulated retail rates and unregulated \nwholesale rates is clearly, in my view, not a long-term workable \nscenario.\n  As I have already mentioned, generators are charging exorbitant rates \nfor power, which has led some to suspect that they are gaming the \nmarket. When Sempra Energy in San Diego tells me they are buying spot \npower at 3 a.m. in the morning at 500 times the normal price, something \nis wrong with the market.\n  Supporting that suspicion, economist Paul Joskow and Edward Hahn of \nMIT released a report this past January 15. Let me read from that \nreport:\n\n       The high wholesale electricity prices observed in the \n     summer of 2000 cannot fully be explained as the natural \n     outcome of market fundamentals in a competitive market since \n     there is a very significant gap between actual market prices \n     and competitive benchmark prices that take into account these \n     market fundamentals.\n       Moreover, there is considerable empirical evidence to \n     support a presumption that the high prices experienced in the \n     summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplies of the \n     market by suppliers.\n\n  For this reason, I believe the most critical and immediate step that \ncan be taken to address this crisis is to fix the market, which is \nterribly broken.\n  I would like to outline for a moment some of the steps California is \ntaking to fix the problem.\n  First, California has conducted an online energy auction to solicit \nbids for long-term bilateral contracts. Remember, this contracting was \nprohibited by the 1996 legislation. The State is now negotiating \ncontracts which cover up to one-third of the State's energy demand for \nthe winter. The contracts range from 3 to 10 years and average $70 per \nmegawatt hour. It is my understanding they hope to contract for up to \n5,000 megawatts. That is enough for 5 million households.\n  Second, the State is now going into the power business in a major \nway. It has exercised its authority to purchase power on the spot \nmarket and has distributed this power at cost to the utilities. By \nFebruary 15, it is estimated that the State will have spent $1 billion \nto buy this power. And it is buying power at the rate of about $50 \nmillion a day. All told, the State has provided an authorization for \nthe California Department of Water Resources to finance up to $10 \nbillion to buy power--again, to pass that power along, at cost, to the \nutilities.\n  Third, California has taken action to speed up the construction and \nsiting of new energy plants. The State has already approved 9 out of 25 \nadditional powerplants, which will generate enough energy to power 6 \nmillion households. That is about 6,278 megawatts. But the rub is that \nthese first nine plants will not be on line before the end of 2002. So \nyou can see that there is a short-term period. I am going to speak more \nabout that short-term period of excess volatility in a moment.\n  Fourth, part of AB 1890 required California's investor-owned \nutilities to sell their generating facilities. I think that was a huge \nmistake. The State has reversed this.\n  Fifth, the State has restructured the California ISO--or Independent \nSystem Operator--and essentially eliminated the Power Exchange, which \nwas a trading floor for California used to purchase energy hourly. The \nfatal flaw of the Power Exchange was that it ensured that all bidders \ninto the exchange received the highest clearing price for electricity. \nThe Power Exchange was intended to encourage bidders to use the floor, \nbut instead it became too easy to manipulate, driving up prices.\n  Sixth, the Governor recently announced an $800 million energy \nconservation program to reduce California's peak load demand by more \nthan 3,700 megawatts. As I said, the legislature approved a baseline \nconservation rate, which the PUC should begin to put in place soon and \nwill protect the cost of basic necessary electricity but charge \npremiums for use above that cost.\n  This is really the first consequential effort to begin to fix the \nregulated retail end of the market. Frankly, whether it will be enough \nor not, I do not know at this stage.\n  What is the Federal role in all of this? And why is legislation that \nSenator Boxer, I, and others have submitted so important?\n  The most significant thing the Federal Government can do, through the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, is to provide a period of interim \nprice stability, preventing price volatility or gouging, until this \nmarket is able to straighten itself out.\n  Let me show you why that is so crucial because what is anticipated to \nhappen in the summer is, despite everything the State is doing today, \nthere will still be an absence of sufficient electricity to serve the \nState.\n  The Independent System Operator has prepared this chart that shows \nwhat the shortfall will be in the summer: In May, despite everything, \n3,030 megawatts; in June, 6,815 megawatts; in July, 4,685 megawatts; in \nAugust, 5,297 megawatts; in September, 1,475 megawatts.\n  So the worst time to come for California--and it has spread for other \nStates--is going to be the summer, if this shortfall happens as has \nbeen predicted by the ISO. That is when price volatility, for that \npower that is not already under bilateral negotiated contracts, comes \ninto play in a serious way. That is why Senator Boxer and I have said \nwe need a period of short-term interim price stability, really, to get \nthrough these summer months. Therefore, we have submitted S. 26.\n  What S. 26 would do is say, if, during this short-term period, the \nFERC finds that prices are unjust and unreasonable, the FERC--the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission--has two options: The first option \nwould be to set cost-of-service rates themselves--cost-of-service rates \ntake into consideration the cost of providing the electricity plus \nmargin of profit--or, second, provide an interim or temporary wholesale\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\nprice cap across the 12 Western States from which any Governor can opt \nout if that Governor does not want their State to participate. That is \none way of looking at this.\n  The FERC has clearly found that prices charged in the year 2000 for \nelectricity are unjust and unreasonable. But the FERC refuses to do \nanything about it, saying let the market prevail. The market is broken, \nand until the State can adequately increase supply, the market is going \nto remain broken.\n  So the responsible Federal posture isn't, as some have said, that the \nFederal Government should be an ostrich, sticking its head in the sand: \nLet anything happen that may happen to California; we do not care. That \nis not the responsible role. It is to provide an absence of volatility. \nThe reason is that this volatility will also impact other States--and \nis beginning to do just that right now.\n  The impact of the crisis on our State has been tremendous. California \nhas spent more than $600 million over the past month purchasing \nelectricity. The State is suffering from lost productivity. A recent \nstudy by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation has \nconcluded that California's few rolling blackouts and interrupted \nservice have taken a $1.7 billion toll in direct and indirect costs on \nthe economy. As I have said, we want to increase the supply.\n  Here is where there is a big myth. People say: California has an \nincreased supply; right? Wrong. This past decade, California has \nactually added 2,670 megawatts of additional capacity--not enough \nbecause the demand has gone up by 14 percent. But, believe it or not, \nCalifornia has added more generation in the past decade than any other \nState in the western region. At the same time, demand in these 10 \nStates has grown by a greater percentage than it has in California.\n  People don't realize this, but this is what an examination of the \nrecord will reflect.\n  It is critical for California now to do the following: Expedite its \npowerplant siting and construction process. I have been told by \ngeneraters that it has taken them up to 6 years to get a permit. That \nclearly cannot continue. California has to assume its power to expedite \nsiting and construction.\n  Two, improve the transmission capacity in the State. Currently, you \ncan't now transmit power from the south to the north.\n  Three, reduce any bona fide environmental obstacles. I am aware of \nnone that have stopped power production at the present time, but if \nthere are, let's take a look at them. Let us do what we must.\n  Four, ensure that all large buildings, hospitals, and hotels with \nemergency generators or that have additional generation capacity use \nthese facilities in the interim. I am told there is about 2,000 \nmegawatts in generating capacity that buildings have but that are not \nin regular use.\n  To reduce demand for energy, I have written to the Secretary of \nEnergy asking him to look at the feasibility of significantly reducing \nenergy consumption by Federal Government offices in California, I hope, \nby 10 to 15 percent. I have also called upon the Bush administration to \nfully implement new energy efficienct rules for air-conditioners or \nother appliances so they can get in place as soon as possible.\n  Last week, Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, and I and \nfive of our colleagues introduced legislation to provide tax incentives \nfor energy-efficient homes, buildings, and schools, to encourage people \nto do what they must in that area. I am also introducing legislation to \nprovide tax incentives for the development of wind, solar, geothermal, \nand biomass energy, something that can be developed in a major way, \ncertainly in California.\n  It is clear to me the State is going to have to increase rates at \nsome point, as painful as that is, but do it in a way that gives \nCalifornians advanced warning and that phases in these costs over a \nperiod of time so as to protect consumers as much as possible, with a \nlifeline rate for the basic electricity use of consumers.\n  The big question I have is whether a hybrid system can work. That is \nwhat California has, a hybrid system. You cannot deregulate on the \nwholesale side and keep retail rates regulated. The dilemma facing the \nState, in my view, is going to be either move to a completely \nderegulated market and do so in a structured, commonsense way, or begin \nto reregulate. Thus far, the moves California has made show me, by \nbeginning to buy power, by legislation that would buy the utility's \ntransmission lines and then lease them back, that California is slowly \nbeginning a path to reregulation.\n  I make no value judgment. My value judgment at this stage is, we \ncan't have both worlds. We can't deregulate the wholesale end and \nregulate the retail end because it breaks the market. California has \nbeen a victim of that broken market into which generaters have charged \nthe highest possible rates. Long-term contracts obviously play a major \nrole. The 1996 legislation prohibited those contracts.\n  If I may, I will send, on behalf of Senator Boxer and I, an \nalternative piece of legislation to committee. I ask unanimous consent \nto be able to send that legislation to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand there is a UC and I have been \nincluded in that for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that 5 of my \n10 minutes be yielded to the Senator from Oregon, who is on the floor. \nPrior to proceeding with that, I am happy to yield to Senator Boxer \nfrom California for a couple of minutes to respond to the legislation \nSenator Feinstein has just introduced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be brief. I thank Senator Craig and Senator Smith \nfor their indulgence. I did not want to see a break here. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, for laying out what we are going through \nin California with this power crisis. I have already spoken about the \nnatural gas problem which is a separate problem but nonetheless very \nimportant to us. She really laid out well the situation in which we \nfind ourselves. I have maybe some differing views with her on the final \nway to solve it, but I absolutely agree with her, at this time what is \nmost important is to stabilize the market for the short-term.\n  I compliment her on putting together the chart showing us the real \nfacts; that we are going to be short electricity in the summer months.\n  I do believe--and I am optimistic; we already see signs of this--that \nCalifornia is going to come out of this. Again, we don't know exactly \nif it is going to be a more regulated system. We don't know whether it \nwill continue to be a hybrid system or a full deregulation, which I \ndon't think will happen. The fact is, we have a real short-term \nproblem. I implore my colleagues, particularly those from the western \nStates who are starting to see this problem spread to their area, to \ntake a look at this idea of a temporary cap on these wholesale prices. \nAt least in that way, we could be sure of supply at a reasonable price \nto get us through these summer months.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a column written by \nPeter King--not the Congressman--with the Sacramento Bee called ``If \nOnly Myths Were Megawatts.'' The notion is exploding a lot of myths \nabout California. For example, we rank 47th in per capita use of energy \nconsumption. Our consumption has gone up 11 percent in the last period \nof time, but the rest of the country's consumption has gone up 22 \npercent. We are doing our part. We are trying. We will succeed. Just \nremember, when California gets a cold, they eze all over the country. \nWe are the sixth largest country in the world, if measured by GDP.\n  I thank my colleague from California for her insights and yield the \nfloor.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Sacramento Bee]\n\n                   If Only Myths Were Megawatts . . .\n\n                           (By Peter H. King)\n\n       If the myths surrounding California's energy mess somehow \n     could be converted into megawatts, the state would be awash \n     in electricity and, in the words of Merle Haggard, we'd ``all \n     be drinking that free Bubble Up and eating that rainbow \n     stew.'' Whatever that means.\n       Alas, this is not the case. A haze of half-truths, revised \n     histories and other forms of\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\n     rhetorical hocus-pocus has enveloped the public dialogue over \n     what has happened with California energy and who should pay \n     for it.\n       Perhaps the most galling piece of mythology, so popular \n     among California bashers across the land, is that the problem \n     is rooted in California itself and, in particular, in a sun-\n     addled, something-for-nothing outlook on life. In an \n     editorial about the energy crunch, the Wall Street Journal \n     sneeringly labeled California the ``Alfred E. Neuman state,'' \n     a reference to the ``What, me worry?'' cover boy of Mad \n     magazine.\n       The idea seems to be that Californians have been too busy \n     meditating in the hot tub to recognize that it takes energy \n     to generate those soothing bubbles, and that as the state \n     attracts more and more hot tub soakers it will need more and \n     more electricity. The idea also seems to be that we kept \n     tilting at windmills when we should have been decorating our \n     coasts with offshore oil rigs and nuclear reactors, that \n     California's concern for its environment is a luxury that it \n     can no longer afford.\n       In fact, Californians are not hopeless energy addicts; the \n     state ranks 47th in the nation in terms of per capita \n     consumption. Over the past decade, energy usage in California \n     did rise by 11%--but nationally, according to U.S. Department \n     of Energy figures, it climbed at twice that rate. In fact, \n     the bulk of growth in consumption on the overburdened Western \n     grid has occurred in states that neighbor California.\n       In other words, it's not all about Topanga Canyon hot tubs \n     and Silicon Valley computers. The posse searching for where \n     all the energy goes might also look toward the bright lights \n     of booming Las Vegas and, come summer, the humming air \n     conditioners of Phoenix, Tucson, et al.\n       Yet what about the other side of the electrical switch? \n     Over and over again, the point is made that California hasn't \n     built any new energy plants in the last decade. The \n     impression created is that environmentalists and bureaucrats \n     have locked arms and encircled any and all prospective power \n     generation sites, gently singing ``Kumbaya'' while the energy \n     producers stalk off to Texas and the lights of the Golden \n     Land dim, flicker and go dark.\n       In fact, there are 10 power plants now under construction \n     in California, with a total generating capacity of roughly \n     6,500 megawatts. In addition, 14 projects with a collective \n     capacity of 7,500 megawatts are under review, with \n     construction scheduled to start sometime this year. Fourteen \n     thousand megawatts represents about a third of what the state \n     currently needs to survive its highest peaks in demand. \n     That's quite a lot of new energy development going on in a \n     state that forgot to develop new energy.\n       To be fair, there had been a slowdown in energy \n     development--although one not confined to California. Like \n     almost everything that drives the energy business, it had to \n     do with pure economics. As energy prices drop, so too does \n     the desire to build more plants and drill more well-heads. \n     When they climb, the opposite occurs. Some energy \n     consultants, in fact, already see signs of California's \n     energy crisis winding down. They see these signs, not in the \n     frenzied hallways of the state Capitol, but in distant \n     natural-gas oil fields where, sparked by soaring prices, \n     drilling activity has perked up again.\n       There have been other myths. There was the myth, rather \n     quickly shot down, that Southern California's air quality \n     rules somehow were behind the supply crunch. There was the \n     business of the consumer rate freeze, a feature of \n     deregulation that has prevented utilities from passing along \n     to customers wildly inflated wholesale power costs. Lost in \n     the myth-making here was the fact that this price ceiling \n     functioned for the first couple of years, by design, as a \n     price floor, keeping consumer rates propped up while the \n     utilities raked in billions.\n       ``Headroom,'' they called it.\n       There was the more amusing myth of the Christmas lights. \n     Remember how turning off Christmas lights was supposed to \n     help ease California through its crisis? To borrow once again \n     from the ever-reliable Merle Haggard: ``If we make it through \n     December, we'll be fine.'' Well, we did make it through \n     December, but we aren't fine, at least not yet. Soon enough, \n     though, we will be. To suggest that California, in the end, \n     always has frustrated those who would rush to write it off as \n     a paradise lost, as a doomed experiment in easy living, is \n     not mythology, It is history.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor not to respond to \nSenator Feinstein. There will be ample time. I understand the chairman \nof the Energy Committee has agreed to a hearing date for the Senator's \nlegislation, and there will be ample opportunity to examine the concept \nof cost plus pricing into the marketplace.\n  The reason one of Idaho's Senators is on the floor this afternoon and \nthe reason one of Oregon's Senators is on the floor this afternoon is \nthat what is happening in California is rapidly spreading into Oregon \nand Washington and Idaho. Why would a power disease in California \nspread to Oregon and Idaho? In part because we are in the same system \nor grid--we are interconnected--and in part because we sell power to \nCalifornia and California sells power to us.\n  When you distort a marketplace in one part of the market system, it \noveracts or reacts somewhere else.\n  What the Senator from California is talking about is absolutely true. \nI will have to say I am pleased when I hear Senators from California \nsay: We have a problem, and we probably didn't do it right. We are \nprobably a creator of our own problem. When you deregulate wholesale \npower and you cap retail power, you send a phenomenally loud message to \nthe marketplace: Don't come and build. You cannot evaluate or bring \nback your values, and you have protected the consumer in a false \nmarketplace environment. California has recognized that and they are \ntrying to do something about it.\n  I am pleased the Senator from California did not propose to cap \nwholesale prices.\n  I think it would be a phenomenal distortion at this time to do that. \nA couple of Governors have said, yes, it is a good idea. But eight \nGovernors just wrote the President and FERC and the Vice President and \nsaid: Please don't go in that direction, don't coddle the consumer, \nbecause if you coddle the consumer, the consumer doesn't understand and \nwill not put pressure on the politician to get out of the way and let \nthe marketplace work. That is really the problem we are in at this \nmoment.\n  Compounded with the growth of the region and the crisis in \nCalifornia, the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Idaho have a \npredominantly hydro-based system. Our system is run by water flowing \nthrough turbines held back by dams on large rivers. When it doesn't \nsnow and rain in the West, and especially in the Pacific Northwest, \nthere isn't enough water to be held by the dams to flow through the \nturbines to generate the power.\n  Come May of the year 2001--this May--when power usage starts going up \nin California, and in Oregon, and in Washington, and in Idaho, Idaho \nwill be in big trouble because our moisture for the winter is not at \n100 percent or 110 percent of normal; it is now at about 60 percent \nregion-wide. We are in a dry winter in the West, and we are not \nproducing the snow to flow to the reservoirs to generate the power.\n  We in Idaho will be in a crisis environment if it doesn't improve \nrapidly, as will be true in the State of Oregon. What California, in \nlarge part, has caused, we are now asking our consumers to pick up the \nbill for because, unlike California, the consumers in Oregon and \nWashington and Idaho are not protected by a retail price cap.\n  Our utilities, under order or fixed contract, have certain lids to \nbump up against. But the average consumer is going to feel this by 20-, \n30-, 40-, 50-percent rate increases, while California basically takes \nnone, or very little. How can that possibly be fair if California is \nlargely a part of the problem, if not the largest part of the problem? \nBecause while they have brought on some new production compared to \ntheir growth, they have brought on very little, and they have not built \nthe transmission systems to make all of that happen.\n\n  We started hearings, and we are going to ask that we move quickly, \nMr. President. We know that the President and the Vice President have \nassembled Cabinet-level counsel to look at the long-term problem. But \nwe in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are going to have to sort out the \nshort-term problem, and that is now, in April, May, June, July, August, \nand September of this year when this crisis will sweep across the \nPacific Northwest, at a time when we need power to not only fuel our \nrefrigerators at home but our factories and our irrigation pumps to \nkeep our agriculture alive and our men and women working.\n  Cost-plus pricing is not an answer--again, a false message to the \nmarket, a new bureaucracy at FERC. Power will not flow to California; \nit will flow away from California, if the markets of California do not \nreflect the true price. That is the reality of the marketplace, and you \ncan't fix it by some Federal bureaucracy or well-intended piece of \nlegislation. The Senator from California is right: Let's get to the \nbusiness of siting powerplants, building transmission lines, and doing \nit in an environmentally safe, but a responsible way, and allowing our \nconsumers once again to have affordable power. Those are some of the \nissues we must deal with quickly.\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I probably should say amen to \nwhat the Senator from Idaho has said. I agree with his message. I want \nto just add one point. Let's assume that caps made sense. I have been \ntold by Federal officials, Bonneville Power Administration officials, \nthat even if you could do it, the power of the Federal Government would \nreach about two-thirds of the generating capacity in the West. Why is \nthat the case? Well, because a lot of the West's power comes from \nCanada and comes from Mexico. We haven't the ability to cap their \nrates. I would like to see us try. I think that would generate quite a \nresponse.\n  Moreover, if you did that even to what we could control, what would \nthat then mean to the uncapped power of Canada and Mexico? It would go \nup even further.\n  I want to point out, as Senator Craig has, that the fundamental flaw \nin these proposals of cost-plus, or caps, is that they leave in place \nCalifornia's retail cap. As we speak, California's consumption is going \nup. As California's neighbor, I wish them no harm. I know their swathe \neconomically in our country and in the West. I admire so much about \nCalifornia and would like very much to be a good neighbor. But I don't \nthink many Californians understand what they are doing to their \nneighboring States. Because of a retail cap, there is absolutely no \nincentive for Californians to conserve. Those who advocate price caps \nwithout the lifting of California's retail price caps are giving the \ngreen light for Californians to send their energy bills to Oregonians. \nThat is just wrong. If anybody is serious about correcting this problem \nby conservation and production, it includes lifting these artificial \nmeasures that don't allow the marketplace to work. It is that simple.\n  I had thought the Senator from California was coming with a bill, so \nI had a second-degree amendment to her's. I appreciate that she has not \noffered that on the pipeline safety bill. That is a bill that needs to \ngo forward on its own because of its own merit. We will have this \nhearing and debate. But central to any effort to interfere further in \nthe market that is already suffering because of Government interference \nmust be, as a predicate, that California lift its retail price caps. \nAnything more or less than that will simply fail and will be a \ncontinued abuse upon the neighbors of California. It is wrong, and it \nshould be fixed. I understand the politics of fixing it. It is \ndifficult for their legislature and their Governor, but it is utterly \nunfair to California's neighbors for them to continue this without \nconsidering the impact on everyone else in the grid with them.\n  Mr. President, I will simply conclude my remarks. I was going to put \na human face on the consequence of what California has done. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from the Chenowith School District be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Chenowith School District,\n\n                                 The Dalles, OR, February 1, 2001.\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The Chenowith School District is \n     requesting your assistance to help resolve the energy crisis \n     in our area. School districts are allotted a limited amount \n     of money per pupil to provide an education for all of our \n     students. We try to use our resources as prudentially as \n     possible to see that every dollar is spent to help improve \n     instruction and to help our students achieve.\n       The recent increases in power costs are going to be taking \n     resources away from the education of students. As an example, \n     the cost of natural gas for three of our main buildings in \n     the Chenowith School District in November of 1999 was \n     $4383.59. It was a mild November. The cost of natural gas to \n     keep these same three buildings in November 2000 was \n     $11,942.14. We have not had a cold, hard winter. The increase \n     in gas costs must be paid from unbudgeted funds, funds that \n     were earmarked for the improvement of instruction.\n       The Northern Wasco People Utilities District (NWPUD) has \n     added a 20% surcharge to the cost of electricity. These, \n     again, are unbudgeted costs that, along with the tremendous \n     increase in the cost of fuel for our school buses are taking \n     valuable funds away from educating our children.\n       Today's schools are very energy dependent with our network \n     of computers and technology to provide an appropriate \n     education for students who will be living in our \n     technological society. The district has one computer for \n     every two students, has servers and a network system that is \n     run with the assistance of students and is enhancing their \n     education. Power costs are taking a disproportional amount of \n     funds away from funds needed to educate children.\n       Your assistance in helping the energy crisis in the area \n     would be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James J. Kiefert,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I think we need to understand \nwhat California sending its energy bills to Oregon means to the rest of \nthe West, my State and others. It affects school districts that have \nnot budgeted for\n50-, 60-percent increases in energy. Seniors have not budgeted for \nenergy rates going up double, triple. But that is what is, in fact, \nhappening. It isn't right, isn't fair. I want to be a good neighbor, \nand I will be open to their suggestions; but they must, as a predicate, \nlift their retail price caps because anything less than that will not \nproduce conservation and will not produce the incentives for new \nproduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nbefore the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, I want to announce that after this \ndiscussion, we are ready for amendments. If there are not amendments \nwithin about quarter after the hour--it is a little less than quarter \nof--we will move to final passage.\n  As I mentioned in my opening statement, this issue has been well \nventilated in hearings and was passed by voice vote. I understand that \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, has some amendments. If he \ndoes, come on down, or any other Member. But we are not going to sit \nhere in a quorum call. We are going to move to final passage. A quarter \nafter or 20 after the hour should be plenty of time for Members to come \nand offer amendments. I ask Members to notify the Cloakroom so we can \ndo our best to accommodate them.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 4.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make technical and minor corrections in the bill as \n                              introduced)\n\n       On page 5, line 12, after ``industry'' insert ``and \n     employee organization''.\n       On page 34, line 9, strike ``sections 60525'' and insert \n     ``section 60125''.\n       On page 34, line 14, after ``transferred'' insert ``to the \n     Secretary of Transportation, as provided in appropriation \n     Acts,''\n       On page 34, beginning in line 15, strike ``fiscal year \n     2002, fiscal year 2003, and fiscal year 2004.'' and insert \n     ``each of fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004.''.\n       On page 34, line 21, strike ``60125'' and insert ``60301''.\n       On page 35, line 1, strike ``Transportation'' and insert \n     ``Transportation, as provided in appropriation Acts,''.\n       On page 36, line 5, strike ``until--'' and \n     insert ``until the earlier of the date on \n     which--''.\n       On page 36, line 6, strike ``determines'' and insert \n     ``determines, after notice and an opportunity for a \n     hearing,''.\n       On page 36, line 14, strike ``Disciplinary action'' and \n     insert ``Action''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered by Senator \nHollings and myself. It provides technical and minor correction to the \nbill. It has been cleared on both sides. I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I thank my \ncolleague from Arizona for moving this\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nthrough so rapidly. Hopefully, we can get this through in a fashion so \nwe can send it forward. We had extensive hearings last year. I think \nmost of it was worked out quite well. The chairman, Senator McCain from \nArizona, has done a splendid job of moving this forward.\n  Therefore, today I rise to offer my support of S. 235, the Pipeline \nSafety Improvement Act of 2001. I also come to the floor to strongly \nencourage my colleagues to pass a clean bill on this issue. We have \nworked a long time in a delicate set of negotiations to get a good bill \nthrough. It is well balanced. I think we need to move this through \nrapidly to get these safety issues out there dealing with the \npipelines. I understand that the Senate is a body of amendments, but \nthis issue is too important to be killed by hasty changes--and that is \nexactly what could happen if we clutter this carefully compromised bill \nwith unnecessary changes or additions.\n\n  The oil and gas industry is very important to my state of Kansas--but \nnothing is more important than securing the safety of all our citizens. \nI have worked hard alongside my friend from Arizona to find a way to \nstrengthen safety precautions and provide strong incentives for better \npublic and environmental protection without crippling a vital industry \nto our nation.\n  Now more than ever, Americans are keenly aware of the need for a \nstrong energy infrastructure--which makes the way we tighten these \nstandards more important than ever. The bill before use today has \ncrafted a fine balance between setting tough standards, and yet \nmaintaining the flexibility which will be needed for industry to \nimplement this bill. Industry is not questioning that there needs to be \ntougher standards--even though it will cost them money and they don't \nagree with all the provisions of this bill, they stand ready to do what \nis necessary to prevent as many accidents and injuries as possible. \nEveryone wants safety first.\n  However, if this bill takes on prescriptive amendments which lock in \nthe way these standards are to be implemented, there will be opposition \nto the bill--not on substance but on procedure. While it might be good \npolitics to stir up anti-industry sentiment, it is bad policy because \nit would prevent a good bill from becoming law. I think we can all \nagree that this would hinder the cause of making America's pipelines \nmore safe, which is our objective.\n  This bill has a number of important provisions which will make our \npipelines and our people who live near them, safer--including:\n  Increased daily penalties for violation of safety regulations from \n$25,000/day to $500,000/day--a factor of 20 times.\n  Spill reporting would occur for something as small as 5 gallons as \nopposed to the 2100 gallon trigger which currently exists.\n  Training and qualification requirements strengthened along with \npublic right to know provisions.\n  The Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, worked diligently and \ncarefully to getting this bill to this point.\n  There are numerous positive things that this bill would achieve. I \nwon't detail it all here now--but the important point is that this bill \nsignificantly improves the status quo and will make our nation safer. \nThat is why it is so important that we not allow this bill to get \nbogged down, and potentially defeated by amendments that will destroy \nthe hard-won balance achieved last year.\n  I would remind my colleagues that this bill went through extensive \ndebate last year. In the Commerce Committee there were hearings and \nmarkups which addressed the very contentious question of how best to \nincrease the safety of oil and gas pipelines without jeopardizing a key \nindustry to this nation.\n  The compromise which this bill creates is a good one--but it is \nfragile. And before some of my fellow Senators try to amend this bill--\nI would ask that they weigh the changes they seek against the \npossibility of killing this important bill--because that is a distinct \npossibility. If at the end of the day, members feel that this \ncompromise is not adequate to address the concerns of pipeline safety--\nthen our recourse should be to return the bill to the committee and \naddress those concerns through the regular process. We should not make \nthe mistake of rushing through a bad bill.\n  I hope this option will not be necessary. I believe this is a good \nbill; that it is a good compromise and addresses a very serious problem \nin our country. This problem cannot await further refinement and work. \nIt needs to be addressed now.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator McCain, myself, and others to \npass this bill clean and move it on through the process so we can get a \nsafer pipeline system in this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see no other Senators on the floor \nwishing to speak. I see no other amendments. I would like to place us \nin a quorum call in just a second. I would like to tell my colleagues \nthat there is no reason why we shouldn't move forward with final \npassage of the bill unless there are amendments.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides, let's move the process forward. \nIt was announced 3 days ago that we would be taking up this bill. So it \nis time to move forward.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am curious. Can we go through a \nunanimous consent that the vote take place? You have announced to our \ncolleagues that it would be a quarter after.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not yet. We want to give the other side a chance to call \nall their Members and see if there are any further amendments or \ndiscussion of the bill.\n  At this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the floor manager, Senator \nMcCain, and the Commerce Committee, for bringing this matter before \nthis body, the pipeline safety bill.\n  I have the honor of serving as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee of the Senate. I think everyone is aware of the \nenergy crisis occurring in the country today highlighted by the \nsituation in California which can best be described as both a supply \nprogram and a credit program. In other words, they had become somewhat \ncomplacent in their ability to attract power from other States to the \npoint where they were relying on 25 percent of their energy coming from \noutside of California. The prices went up on that outside energy. They \nhave a cap on their retail sales. Their utility companies, which were \namong the largest in this country, had to pay a higher price for the \nenergy than they could pass on to the consumer. As a consequence, they \nare facing bankruptcy.\n  The significance of the California crisis has created concern all \nover America. Part of that involves our dependence on pipelines. \nPipelines, of course, provide this country with a supply of oil, supply \nof gasoline, supply of natural gas.\n  We have had some very unfortunate accidents occur in New Mexico and \nin the State of Washington. The reality is many of these pipelines are \naging, and with the increased demand for energy, we are putting more \npressure into these pipelines. Hence, the need for a responsible plan \nthat ensures safety.\n  I commend the members of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and \nothers. We are very interested in our committee, as well, because we \nhave to have a delivery system. This delivery system has been something \nwe are going to have to continue to expand, as indeed the demand for \nenergy, particularly oil and gas, natural gas, gasoline and others, \ndepends on pipelines.\n  The legislation will protect consumers by ensuring that our natural \ngas and oil pipelines are safe. I think it is fair to say that the same \nbill did pass the Senate unanimously last year. Unfortunately, the \nHouse did not have time to act before the elections. We have to have \nthe public confidence in the safety of our pipelines.\n  I think we have a tough bill that addresses the critical issues of \nsafety.\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nThe pipelines are essential to the Nation's energy delivery \ninfrastructure. As I indicated, we would not be able to receive the \nenergy that we take somewhat for granted. We forget that somebody, \nsomewhere has to produce energy. It has to come from an energy source. \nIt has to come from either oil or natural gas or hydro or clean coal or \nnuclear. It is a diminishing resource. Once we use it, obviously, it is \ngone and we have to replace it.\n  As a consequence, as we look at the increased demand associated with \nour electronic society with its computers and e-mails, the reality is \nwe simply cannot get there with conservation alone. We want to do a \nbetter job of conservation. That is why in the energy bill we will \nproduce on Tuesday, we have a great deal of emphasis on conservation, \non incentives for conservation, for CAFE standards, many of the things \nthat we believe will assist but will not supplant, of course, the \nincreased demand for energy in this country. That is why we will have \nto continue to develop technology and make our footprint smaller, open \nup new areas for oil and gas exploration, including my State of Alaska \nand ANWR.\n\n  Without going down that rabbit trail too far, I wish to comment that \nwe have, again, taken for granted the role of pipelines in the delivery \nof fuel to heat our homes, fuel for our automobiles, and, of course, \nthe ability to run our production lines. We are fortunate in this \ncountry to have a network which is extraordinary in itself because it \nhas been proven safer than any other mode of transportation. We cannot \nbe complacent. We have to improve safety. I welcome the changes to \nexisting law made by the legislation that will improve the overall \nsafety of the pipeline.\n  One example is the bill requires new periodic pipeline integrity \ninspections using a variety of new technologies such as the ``pigs'' \nthat are used to go through the pipelines now; we have smart pigs that \nnot only go through the pipeline but can get out of the pipeline and be \nexamined. As a consequence, we do have the opportunities to improve \ndramatically.\n  I have mentioned the accidents in New Mexico and Washington. However \nimportant safety is, we have to balance the safety of regulations and \nthe need to be able to efficiently operate these pipelines.\n  What we have today in this legislation is a balance that strikes \nfairness and equity in safety and the reality that there is an economic \nfactor as well. When this legislation is enacted, and there is no \nquestion in my mind that it is going to be enacted, it will be the \nstrongest, most comprehensive pipeline safety measure ever approved by \nthe Congress. At the same time I think we avoid some of the extreme \nresponses some have advocated, responses that would lead to an energy \nshortage, a lack of investment in pipelines without any measurable \nimprovement in safety.\n  I think we would agree, as a consequence of this energy crisis in our \ncountry, the pipeline industry cannot and should not be taken for \ngranted. Many of our colleagues are aware of the huge demand increases \nanticipated for natural gas, and this increasing demand has already \ncontributed to the price runup we have seen for natural gas. Last year, \nnatural gas was about $2.16 per thousand cubic feet. Today it is \nsomewhere in excess of $8.\n  Natural gas producers and pipeline operators are working feverishly \nto respond by investing billions of dollars in exploration and \nproduction and by building new pipelines. That is how we will achieve \nit. The current natural gas pipeline network simply cannot transfer all \nthe gas which Americans will demand by the end of the decade. New \npipelines already take anywhere from 3 to 7 years to permit and build. \nWithout new pipeline capacity, our Nation will only fall further \nbehind.\n  Accordingly, I urge the Senate to pass the pending legislation. I \nbelieve this legislation meets the challenge and does so in a way that \nwill complement our national energy policy rather than thwart it.\n  I again thank Senator McCain, the floor managers, and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Murkowski for his efforts, not only on \nthis legislation but on overall energy policy. It is a very difficult \ntask, a challenging one, and we are grateful for his leadership.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 5\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment on behalf of Senator \nReed of Rhode Island. I send it to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN], for Mr. Reed, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in \nconsultation with the Department of Energy, to conduct a study of, and \nreport to Congress on, the natural gas pipeline transmission network in \n  New England and natural gas storage facilities associated with that \n                                network)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . STUDY AND REPORT ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE AND STORAGE \n                   FACILITIES IN NEW ENGLAND.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in \n     consultation with the Department of Energy, shall conduct a \n     study on the natural gas pipeline transmission network in New \n     England and natural gas storage facilities associated with \n     that network. In carrying out the study, the Commission shall \n     consider--\n       (1) the ability of natural gas pipeline and storage \n     facilities in New England to meet current and projected \n     demand by gas-fired power generation plants and other \n     consumers;\n       (2) capacity constraints during unusual weather periods;\n       (3) potential constraint points in regional, interstate, \n     and international pipeline capacity serving New England; and\n       (4) the quality and efficiency of the federal environmental \n     review and permitting process for natural gas pipelines.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission shall prepare and submit to the Senate Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources and the House of \n     Representatives a report containing the results of the study \n     conducted under subsection (a), including recommendations for \n     addressing potential natural gas transmission and storage \n     capacity problems in New England.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment on behalf of Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island calls for a study of the needs of the natural gas \npipelines in New England. I think it is perfectly appropriate and \nacceptable to both sides. I believe there is no further debate on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to speak before we enter \nsome amendments. I compliment my colleagues, Senators McCain, Murray, \nHollings, and Breaux, for their hard work and dedication in bringing \nthis bill on pipeline safety to the floor. I appreciate their \nleadership on this important issue, one that is certainly vital to the \nconstituency I represent in New Jersey, and, unfortunately, one that \nhas affected their lives in a very significant way.\n  I rise today, however, because of concerns about some of the \nimportant aspects of this legislation. In its current form, I believe \nthe bill does not go far enough to ensure the safety and integrity of \ngas and oil pipelines around our Nation, particularly in New Jersey; \nand does not do enough to provide information to the communities living \nnear those pipelines.\n  Several years ago, my own State of New Jersey was the site of a major \npipeline explosion. On March 24, 1994, a natural gas pipeline exploded \nin Edison, NJ, at 12 midnight. Families living\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nin the nearby Durham Woods apartment complex awoke to a deafening roar. \nThey ran out of their homes and saw a wall of flame several hundred \nfeet high. These flames were so high they were visible in both New York \nCity and Pennsylvania. I ask you to think about that--flames were \nvisible in both New York and Pennsylvania.\n\n  Many of the residents who awoke that night thought a nuclear bomb had \ndetonated. Miraculously, only one person died. However, scores more \nsuffered injuries due to burns or smoke inhalation. Many more lost \ntheir homes and all their possessions. There was millions of dollars in \ndamages, and the explosion itself left a crater 60 feet deep.\n  At another point, I would like to submit to the record accountings of \nthe explosion from the New York Times and the Washington Post.\n  This explosion was caused by a natural gas pipeline that was buried \nin the earth. What concerns me is that there were no reports of digging \nin the area nor were there reports of any other disturbances that could \nhave set off the explosion.\n  As harrowing as this tragedy was, it is not the only one. There have \nbeen other pipeline explosions across this country: in the States of \nArizona, Washington, Michigan, New Mexico and others. These tragedies, \nwith their accompanying loss of life, are the basis for everyone's \nconcern. I applaud their efforts.\n  However I believe there is more that we can do to prevent these \nexplosions. First, we should ensure that oil and natural gas pipelines \nare inspected on a regular basis so that flawed lines can be recognized \nearly, repaired, or replaced. My first amendment will require both oil \nand gas pipelines to be inspected every 5 years.\n  The pending legislation does require pipeline operators to adopt a \nprogram for integrity management, which includes periodic assessments \nof the integrity of hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines. I am \nconcerned that this does not go far enough.\n  There is no definition of what constitutes ``periodic.'' It could \nallow inspections every 5 years, every 7 years, or every 50 years for \nthat matter. That is just not good enough. After all, lives and \nproperty are at stake.\n  GAO reported that 226 people have been killed between 1989 and 1998, \nover 1,000 injured, and $700 million in property damage.\n  I know the Office of Pipeline Safety has issued regulations regarding \nthe inspection of certain liquid pipelines and is considering \nregulations concerning natural gas pipelines. I am concerned however \nabout how long it has taken for these regulations to be issued and \nwhether they will seriously be followed through.\n  I am also concerned they do not require inspections to be conducted \nat a sufficient enough frequency. In my view, therefore, it is time to \npass strong legislation to make safety the priority it deserves to be.\n  I will also be offering an amendment which will give communities that \nlive near pipelines more information about them. Again, I understand \nthe pending bill does include some enhanced right-to-know provisions, \nand I congratulate the sponsors for that, but I believe we should go \nfurther.\n  We need, for example, ongoing reports from pipeline companies about \ntheir efforts to prevent or minimize pipeline risks. We also need \ncompanies to tell communities how frequently testing occurs and what \nthose tests find. Then we need to enact liability provisions that will \nimpose fines on all pipeline operators following oil spills.\n  Another problem is that currently, pipeline oil spills that occur on \nland alone are not a violation of any Federal law. We need to ensure \nthat when such spills occur, fines are levied as a way to prevent \nfuture releases.\n  Lastly, I believe we need to deal with the certification of pipeline \noperators. We have laws that license the drivers of cars and the pilots \nof planes. We need a Federal law, in my view, that provides standards \nfor operators of pipelines as well.\n  The principles contained in these suggestions have been supported by \nmany environmental and pipeline reform groups, as well as by almost the \nentire delegation from the State of New Jersey. They also have been \nsupported by many Members of the House of Representatives.\n  I hope my colleagues join me today in ensuring that we make sure we \nno longer have another Edison disaster.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I compliment Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Murray, my friend Senator Breaux, and those \nwho have worked on this legislation. I voted for this pipeline safety \nlegislation in the last Senate. I would like to be able to vote for it \nin this Senate. It is legislation that should be enacted.\n  As a nation in the midst of an energy crisis, we need to have the \npipeline network of the Nation constructed and expanded to supply \ncommunities in need, and to do so can only help reduce prices. This \nSenate should act forthwith to do so.\n  As I voted for this legislation previously, it is worth noting that \nthis is not the same Senate that it was a year ago. The membership is \ndifferent, the balances are different, and this bill should be \ndifferent.\n  My colleague from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, is prepared to offer a \nseries of amendments that I think are thoughtful and would help not \nsimply communities in New Jersey but communities in States throughout \nthe Nation.\n  They are centered on several specific objectives. I am going to \nreview them, but I first want to make clear that I do think the \nlegislation as offered makes some progress on these issues. The bill \ndoes require an assessment of the risks associated with pipeline \nfacilities in environmentally sensitive and high-density population \nareas and requires the implementing of a plan to mitigate these risks. \nThat is helpful, it is a beginning, and I am glad it is in the bill.\n  The bill before the Senate is a good first step in strengthening \nsafety regulations. There have not been enough in the past. It is a \ngood beginning.\n  The legislation does increase the amount of information companies \nmust provide to communities where pipelines are located so communities \ncan zone their property properly and plan for emergency services so \npeople who live in the communities know what is happening in their \ntowns. Finally, it increases civil penalties substantially for those \nresponsible for pipeline disasters.\n  In the analysis I will offer, I do not discount the work of the \ncommittee or the progress this legislation offers, but I take the \nfloor, as did my colleague, Senator Corzine, because there are people \nin my State who will watch this vote carefully, and we are not alone. \nFrom New Jersey to Washington State to Texas, communities have \nexperienced not simply disruptions in gas supplies from ruptured \npipelines, we have lost lives, a lot of lives.\n  Since 1996, there have been 18 major pipeline disasters in the United \nStates--major disasters. But if a pipeline ruptures and causes a fire \nor explosion in your neighborhood, the Federal Government may not \ndeclare it major, but I assure you, in your neighborhood, it is major.\n  The map on my left illustrates the States where in the last 10 years \nthere have been 2,241 major accidents. They are in every State in the \nNation, at least on this map indicating the lower 48 States in the \nNation; high population areas, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New \nYork, and Connecticut, which have the greatest concentration; one can \nsee in Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois, in Texas and in California--\nthese are significant numbers of pipeline explosions. One of the most \nrecognized has led to my effort today with Senator Corzine.\n  On March 23, 1994, Texas Eastern Corporation's 36-inch high-pressure \nnatural gas pipeline was running through a residential community in \nEdison, NJ. Nearby, there was an apartment building and residential \nhousing. The pipeline exploded. As it exploded, it consumed the \nneighborhood in a fireball. Buildings burned. Three hundred homes were \ndestroyed. One of the neighbors was killed. The night became an inferno \nfor miles around. One moment, a peaceful suburban community; the next, \na war zone. One can only imagine the trauma to a family living in their \nsuburban community in the middle of the night watching their \nneighborhood explode in a ball of flames.\n  The heat from the blast touched off fires in nearby neighborhoods. \nMore\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\nthan 2 hours after the explosion, the pipeline continued to send a wall \nof flame hundreds of feet into the air. Two miles away, ash rained on \ncars. On the New Jersey Turnpike, the principal artery through the \nnortheastern part of the country, roads were filled with debris. \nDrivers likened it to driving on a newly salted road. The highway was \ncovered with this debris. The National Transportation Safety Board \nfound that the inability of the pipeline operator to properly stop the \nflow of natural gas contributed to the cause of the accident.\n\n  It is the lasting impact of this incident that brings me to the floor \nand to offer and support several important amendments.\n  My State has not forgotten. If this Senate fails to address the \nreality of this problem, I can assure you, in the next 10 years, when \none of these 22 accidents comes to a neighborhood near you--it is not \nNew Jersey, it is Nevada or California or Florida--they will remember \nas well.\n  We do not ask a lot. We know the reasons these accidents are \nhappening. Here you have a 36-inch pipeline running, as the crow flies, \nno more than 8 miles from midtown Manhattan--in the most densely \npopulated area of the Nation--to New Jersey. A pipeline erupts, and the \ncompany does not have personnel trained, capable, or instructed in how \nto stop the flow of gas. The local community did not have enough \ninformation to deal with the emergency. These are not unreasonable \nrequests.\n  The bill contains provisions to deal with a cost-benefit analysis. My \ncolleagues, what is the cost-benefit analysis of the cost of ensuring \nthat personnel are trained, that a pipeline is inspected, compared to \nthe cost of 300 people running from their homes in a fireball in the \nmiddle of the night? Allow me to share with you a cost-benefit \nanalysis.\n  As you consider voting on whether or not people should have licenses \nto work on these pipelines or whether or not these pipelines should be \ninspected, this is your cost-benefit analysis.\n  Every one of these children pictured here have been killed--burned, \nkilled in an explosion because of a ruptured pipeline. They are dead. \nMr. President, 2,200 accidents in 10 years will cause that kind of \ndestruction.\n  Our amendments are very simple. I do not believe Senator Corzine and \nI are being unreasonable.\n  What is it we would like?\n  One, a community have the right to know the flow of the pipeline, \nwhat is in the pipeline, basic information about the pipeline. Even if \nit were not required by law, and you operated a pipeline, wouldn't you \nwant the fire department to know that basic information? Wouldn't you \nwant a local builder to know about the pipeline if they are going to \nput residential homes next to it? Wouldn't you want the planning board \nto know about the power of a potential explosion? We require it in the \nbill. But if we did not require it in the bill, wouldn't you want to do \nit anyway?\n  Second, mandatory testing of natural gas and hazardous liquid \npipelines themselves. This is the most extraordinary to me. I do not \nknow of any principal structure in the Nation, on a mandatory basis--\nfrom the local building authority through airplane construction, to \nyour own car--that does not get inspected. If I do not take my car to a \nlocal New Jersey motor vehicles inspection station and get it inspected \nevery year or two, I am in violation. But you want to put a 36-inch \npipeline across my State, next to thousands of residents, knowing that \nit has cost lives, and you do not want to require an inspection every 5 \nyears, every 7 years? I do not think this is unreasonable.\n  Third, the certification of pipeline personnel. I do not know a \nprofession or means of employment in the Nation which involves health--\nlife and death--and public safety where you do not have to get a \ncertification. I have a certification to drive here to work in the \nmorning in my car. It is called a driver's license. But you are going \nto operate a high-pressure gas pipeline across the Nation, and you do \nnot want a license?\n\n  Lest you think this is somebody else's abstract problem--these people \nwho are operating these pipelines--here are the areas they impact as \nshown on this map. You cannot serve in this Senate and not represent \nsomebody who lives near one of these pipelines.\n  All we want to know is, if you work on these pipelines, and you have \nresponsibility for pipeline safety, we would like to know that you know \nwhat you are doing. It does not have to be a high threshold. Give me \nthe easiest test you want. If you do not want to strain them, if you do \nnot want to make them study, OK, I will be reasonable, but how about \nsome certification?\n  The person who died in Edison, NJ, in the destruction of that \nneighborhood, did not know how to turn off the flow of the gas. When I \nbought my home, I went in the basement and said to the guy who showed \nme the house: If there is a problem here, how do I turn off the gas to \nmy house? It took me about a minute.\n  In a town of tens of thousands of people, the operator of the \npipeline did not know how to shut off the gas. Standing in midtown \nManhattan, you could see the fireball in central New Jersey.\n  This is an important business. There are more people living by these \npipelines, having their lives on the line, than people living by \nairports, but you would not have somebody operate an airplane without a \nlicense.\n  Finally, we ask for additional liability penalties, recognizing that \nin our system in this country, one sure way to ensure that the pipeline \ncompanies build a quality product, with quality personnel, to the \nhighest safety standards, with the best materials, is they know that if \nthey do not, they are liable for those kids who lost their lives and to \nthe towns that lost the housing where I live. We would like them to be \nliable so they have an incentive to ensure that people are safe and \nsecure.\n  I am concerned that this bill has been brought to the floor--\nrecognizing that Senator McCain has improved the bill. He has designed \ngood legislation, but it is not legislation that any of you can take \nback to your States, along these pipeline routes, and say: My friends, \nI have done everything I can to ensure that your family is safe. I have \nstruck a balance. We are going to have pipelines that lower the cost of \nyour natural gas. We are going to get you additional supply. We are \ngoing to meet the Nation's needs. And I am going to protect your \nfamily.\n  We have done a good job. We have not done a good enough job because \nwe can do more to ensure that people are safe. That is the balance I \nwant. That is what I think this Congress can do that is better than \nwhat the last Congress did when this legislation was before it.\n  I find it frustrating that we need to return again to deal with an \nissue that has been raised that the Senate knows is a real problem. We \nare going to offer these amendments. We are going to insist upon them. \nI ask my colleagues to think carefully in weighing the consideration of \npassing this bill today or tomorrow or waiting a day or two or a week \nand getting it done right. The stakes, I am afraid, are that high. We \nhave tried to do this voluntarily. Maybe the cost of compliance is too \nmuch.\n  We have passed statutes before. We have not seen them enforced. This \nis a list of pipeline safety regulations that have not been met in the \nlast 12 years, things we have asked to ensure that people would be safe \nand that standards would rise, only to find that, increasingly around \nthe Nation, they have been ignored. That is why we have increased \npenalties and liability. Are they really so unreasonable?\n  The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992.\n  Emergency flow restriction devices to ensure that if there is an \naccident, operators on an emergency basis can restrict the flow of gas. \nThat alone would have made the difference in destroying the \nneighborhood in Edison, NJ.\n  Underground utility location technologies in the Pipeline Act of \n1992.\n  Carry out research and develop programs on technologies so that \npeople can quickly locate where these pipelines are in an emergency so \nthey can map them properly if there is a problem.\n  These are 23 different attempts to ensure compliance. We have not met \nour responsibilities to do this properly. I know the desire to increase \nthe Nation's supply of natural gas. I believe as strongly in it as \nanyone in this Chamber. I also know how strongly we are going to feel \nif we do this wrong. If\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nwe do this wrong, a lot of people get hurt. That is the issue before \nthe Senate. Certify the personnel, let communities have a right to know \nabout the operations of these pipelines, require an inspection of them \nevery 7 years and liability to ensure compliance with the laws, laws \nthat have often been ignored, to our considerable peril.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleagues from New Jersey for offering these \nfour excellent amendments. I share their passion on this issue, having \nlost three young children in Bellingham, WA, a year and a half ago when \na pipeline exploded at a school where my sister teaches seventh grade. \nIt has impacted the lives of those families every single day since that \nexplosion.\n  This is a passionate issue in my State. I have to say, before that \nexplosion, no one knew that they lived next door to a pipeline. No one \nknew that their school was on a pipeline.\n  I commend them for bringing forward these provisions. They are all \nexcellent. They are all incorporated into a bill that I have dropped in \nwith the Washington State delegation today. If they are unable to pass \non this bill, I urge my colleagues from New Jersey to continue to work \nwith us.\n  This bill has a long way to go before passage, certainly as it goes \nthrough the House and through conference. These provisions are \nexcellent ones that I hope will be incorporated into a final bill, \nregardless of what happens on the floor today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is hard for me to comment on any \namendments because the amendments have not been proposed yet. I will \nrespond briefly to the overall comments made by the Senators from New \nJersey.\n  Last year, after we passed the legislation, U.S. Transportation \nSecretary Slater issued the following statement:\n\n       I commend the U.S. Senate for taking swift and decisive \n     action in passing the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of \n     2000. This legislation is critical to making much-needed \n     improvements to the pipeline safety program. It provides for \n     stronger enforcement, mandatory testing of all pipelines, \n     community right-to-know information, and additional \n     resources, all hallmarks of the Clinton-Gore administration \n     bill on pipeline safety that was transmitted to the Senate by \n     Vice President Gore on April 11, 2000.\n       I commend in particular the Commerce Committee Chairman and \n     Ranking Member, Senators McCain and Hollings, as well as \n     Senators Murray and Gorton for their hard work . . . I thank \n     the many others who worked for the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation and the Administration in seeking the highest \n     possible level of safety for our nation's pipelines, \n     including Senators Bingaman and Domenici, who recently \n     suffered a terrible loss in their state. . ..\n       I look forward to working with the House leadership . . . \n     to help resolve any legislative differences.\n\n  Clearly, former Secretary of Transportation Slater had a little \ndifferent view of this legislation than the Senators from New Jersey.\n  I will quote from a letter from the National Association of \nRegulatory Utility Commissioners. We all know that these individuals--\nmost of whom are elected; they certainly are in my State--are \nresponsible for the regulation of this kind of industry and responsible \nfor the safety of others. I had already included this letter for the \nRecord, but I think it is important to reference it again. This is in \nreference to S. 235, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001.\n\n       Dear Majority Leader Lott:\n       On behalf of the National Association of Regulatory Utility \n     Commissioners--\n       I assume that includes the regulatory utility commissioners \n     of the State of New Jersey--\n       We urge you to support swift passage of S. 235. However, \n     NARUC does not believe S. 235 should be the vehicle for \n     broader energy policy legislation. NARUC would therefore \n     oppose amendments that would attempt to expand this bill \n     beyond its current intent of improving pipeline safety.\n       Last Congress NARUC expressed strong support for the \n     reauthorization of pipeline safety legislation provided \n     sufficient funding to the Office of Pipeline Safety for State \n     grants was authorized. We believe the increase in funding for \n     these grants found in S. 235 will better enable OPS to meet \n     its obligation of a 50 percent funding share. . . .\n       Additionally, NARUC and its membership strongly believe \n     there is a vital role for the States in ensuring safe \n     operation. . . .\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       NARUC strongly supports provisions of S. 235 that provide \n     States with increased authority and increased participation \n     in safety activities. . . .\n\n  Finally, I will quote again from passages from the National \nGovernors' Association letter. I don't know if the National Governors' \nAssociation speaks for the Governor of New Jersey or not, but they go \non to say:\n\n       On behalf of the nation's Governors, we are writing to \n     express our support for S. 235, a bill to improve oil and gas \n     pipeline safety, and encourage prompt passage of such \n     legislation.\n       NGA's policy supports pipeline safety legislation that \n     provides states with the authority to protect our citizens \n     from pipeline explosions and leaks. States should be \n     authorized to establish standards that do not conflict with \n     but may exceed federal standards. Our policy also endorses \n     the ability of states to enforce violations of federal or \n     state standards.\n\n  The Governors, the utility commissioners, the former Secretary of \nTransportation, Secretary Slater, all are in support of this \nlegislation.\n  A majority of the House of Representatives did vote in favor of this \nlegislation last year. It was taken up under a procedural situation \nthat required a two-thirds vote.\n  I assure the Senators from New Jersey, after passage through the \nHouse of Representatives, this legislation will be going to conference, \nand we will be more than happy to examine any recommendations and \nproposals.\n  With all due respect to Senator Torricelli, at no time, during all \nthe deliberations and all of the hearings and all of the involvement of \nthis issue that our committee and the Senate had, were there any \nadditional amendments, recommendations, or ideas raised. It is a little \nhard for us at this point in time, with the legislation on the floor, \nto give serious consideration to these amendments. Obviously, I cannot \nsupport them at this time, but we will be more than happy to consider \nthem in the future.\n  So when there is an amendment pending, I will be glad to comment on a \npending amendment. But I, again, remind my colleagues that this product \nis literally months of negotiation, hours of hearings, and negotiations \nthat took place over a very long period of time.\n  I hope my colleagues from New Jersey will consider what has gone \nbefore and that we can move forward with the amending process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Breaux and Senator \nMcCain for working together on the principal issue we brought to the \nfloor today. I believe we can find real resolution. Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Corzine, Senator Murray, and I have raised a question about the \nfrequency of inspection of these pipelines for safety. We have raised \nthe issue of the community's right to know. We have raised the issue of \nliability and the certification of workers.\n  It was our hope to make progress today on the principal of these, \nwhich would be the inspection of the pipelines themselves, believing \nand taking great faith in the conference following the passage of this \nlegislation that Senator McCain would represent our bipartisan \ninterests. We know of his own commitment to safety on the issue of the \nqualification of the workers and the community's right to know and are \nleaving those for another day. We believe we can find common language \non the issue of the inspections of the pipelines themselves. Senators \nCantwell, Murray, and I join Senator Corzine who is prepared to offer \nan amendment.\n  I yield to Senator Corzine at this time.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 10\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. CORZINE], for himself, Mr. \n     Torricelli, Ms. Cantwell, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 10.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       The assessment period shall be no less than every 5 years \n     unless the DOT IG, after consultation with the Secretary \n     determines--\n       There is not a sufficient capability or it is deemed \n     unnecessary because of more technically appropriate \n     monitoring or creates undue interruption of necessary supply \n     to fulfill the requirements under this paragraph.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, before I read the amendment, I will \npreface it by expressing my gratitude to Senator McCain and Senator \nBreaux for their cooperation in working to address what all Members \nbelieve is an extraordinarily important issue with regard to \ninspections. I think all Members will be better served because of the \nefforts all Members, cooperatively and in a bipartisan way, brought \nforward.\n  The amendment reads:\n\n       The assessment period shall be no less than every 5 years \n     unless the DOT IG, after consultation with the Secretary \n     determines --\n       There is not a sufficient capability or it is deemed \n     unnecessary because of more technically appropriate \n     monitoring or creates undue interruption of necessary supply \n     to fulfill the requirements under this paragraph.\n\n  Let me say I hope the other issues with regard to certification--\nparticularly inspectors and operators, consideration of civil \nliabilities--are things that will be considered as we progress with \nregard to this legislation. But I think this is a major step forward. I \nam very grateful to the sponsors for their willingness to consider the \nefforts we are bringing to bear on inspections. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered, that has been designed by Senator Corzine and offered by \nSenator Torricelli, Senator Murray, and myself. I want to take this \nopportunity to thank the sponsor for his diligence, not just on this \namendment but the others, in hopes of improving the bill in the \nprocess.\n  I know this has been a long process for many who have been involved \nincluding the senior Senator from my State. I applaud her for her \ndiligent efforts along with Senator McCain, in trying to improve \npipeline safety.\n  As our Nation moves forward to meet our increasing energy needs in an \nenvironment where the supply of natural gas is very important, we need \nto also make sure that pipeline safety is implemented. As they \ncurrently stand, our current laws and regulations, I believe, do not \nadequately do the job in ensuring the safety of nearly 2 million miles \nof pipeline networks around this country.\n  Indeed, we heard earlier from Senator Murray that our State, \nWashington, has faced the tragic consequences of unsafe pipelines head \non. Two years ago, in a park near Bellingham, two 10-year-old boys died \nin a blast of flames and one young man drowned after being overcome by \nfumes when an aging pipeline burst. This was the worst of many pipeline \naccidents in our State, which has suffered from 47 reported incidents \nand more than $10 million in property damage between 1984 and 1999.\n  My State is not alone, as you saw from the charts that Senator Murray \nand Senator Torricelli displayed, in facing the consequences of \nsubstandard pipeline safety. Just last August, in Carlsbad, NM, 11 \npeople, including 5 children, died when a nearby pipeline explosion \nrained fire on their campsite.\n  Again I applaud Senator Murray and Senator McCain for their efforts \nin trying to improve, through this legislation, pipeline safety not \njust for the States of Washington, New Jersey, and New Mexico, but for \nthe whole country, so they may not face the tragedy the people of our \nStates have faced.\n  I believe one of the weaknesses of the underlying bill had been the \nissue of reporting and the bill's reliance on the Department of \nTransportation's Office of Pipeline Safety for implementing guidelines \nwe are seeking. OPS has not had a great record. In a June 2000 report, \nthe GAO found that, since 1988, OPS has failed to implement 22 of the \n49 requirements mandated by Congress--almost half of those \nrequirements--and 10 of these 22 requirements are now between 5 and 11 \nyears overdue.\n  Moreover, the report exposed that OPS has the lowest rate of any \ntransportation agency for implementing the NTSB regulations. Indeed, \nthe GAO report concluded that OPS:\n\n       . . .is a weak and overly compliant regulator that seldom \n     imposes fines when violations are found, fails to fully \n     involve State officials and often ignores reforms demanded by \n     Congress.\n\n  I think the amendment offered by my colleagues and myself will go a \nlong way in making sure there are at least the reporting requirements \nmandated on a 5-year basis.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the sponsors of this \nlegislation and the Washington delegation in the House and other \nMembers on improving this legislation through the process.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from New Jersey for \nbringing this very important issue as part of this legislation. I think \nit is an important issue, pipeline inspections. I think we have reached \na very reasonable result, and their amendment embodies that.\n  I thank Senator Murray, Senator Torricelli, Senator Corzine, and \nespecially Senator Breaux. I was thinking as I watched Senator Breaux \nnegotiate this agreement, I nominate him to be the Middle East peace \nnegotiator. He might be able to achieve that since he has had so much \npractice around here on the floor of the Senate. Certainly it was with \nsome entrenched constituencies.\n  I do thank him for his hard work there. I think this amendment is \nvery acceptable, and following Senator Breaux's comments, hopefully we \ncan move the amendment. Then I would like to be recognized for a \nunanimous consent agreement so we can have final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his comments. Let \nme make just a couple of comments to hopefully maybe put out some \nadditional information on what exactly I think the amendment does and \nwhy I can be supportive of it.\n  I think all of us want to have as much inspection of pipelines as \nnecessary to ensure their safety. There are a couple of problems with \njust an arbitrary statement that says we have to inspect all the \npipelines every 5 years. No. 1, some of them should be inspected more \nthan every 5 years. Pipelines that are in high-risk areas or are in \ndanger of being interrupted because of natural causes should be \ninspected more than every 5 years. On the other hand, there are \npipelines that do not necessarily need to be inspected every 5 years \nfor various reasons. So just to have an arbitrary date, as I think \noriginally was being considered, is not appropriate.\n  What we have here is a requirement which is a general requirement \nthat all lines be inspected every 5 years, but giving the Department of \nTransportation, through the inspector general, some ability to make \ndecisions on how that should be actually conducted.\n  What the amendment says is: Yes, they will be inspected every 5 years \nunless there is not the capability to do so.\n  We all know so-called pig inspection, where you run equipment through \nthe line, is only capable of doing about 30 percent of the lines. So we \nhave to look at the capability to do it in that fashion or in another \nfashion. The Department of Transportation, through the inspector \ngeneral, will have the obligation to make the determination of the \ncapacity to do this. I would like them to develop the capacity. That is \ngoing to be part of the appropriations process. We have some key people \nin that process to give them greater capability.\n\n  The second exemption would be if it is determined, again by the \nDepartment of Transportation through the inspector general, that it is \nunnecessary because of other technology being used--to assure the \nsafety of that line. For instance, there are lines that have\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nconstant monitoring on them. They are not inspected every 5 years. They \nare constantly monitored and inspected for any corrosion or any leaks. \nI think it would be foolish to require that line to undergo an \nadditional inspection every 5 years if in fact it were being monitored \non a constant basis. That is the type of thing we are talking about in \nthat part of the amendment.\n  The third thing is to say it would be inspected every 5 years unless \nthat inspection would create an undue interruption of supplies. I \nwouldn't want to shut down Newark, NJ, on a line that is running \nperfectly and has a good history, to do an inspection, if that would be \nunnecessary and unduly interrupt the supplies of natural gas to that \narea.\n  So I think, with those caveats, the concept of doing it every 5 years \nis OK. It is fine. I think we are putting the burden where it belongs, \non the Department of Transportation and the Office of Pipeline Safety, \nthrough their inspector general, to make sure that the inspections are \ndoing what we want.\n  I think the bill addresses a number of the concerns of our colleagues \nfrom New Jersey and Washington about making sure we have trained \nworkers. This bill says what the worker training programs will be and \nthey have to file it with OPS and make sure they have an adequate \ntraining program for all of their workers.\n  The public's right to know has been greatly increased. I know Senator \nMurray had a great deal to do with the public's right to know. I don't \nknow if every individual in the country needs to know where every high-\npressure valve is on a pipeline. There is some security involved here. \nWe are concerned about sabotage of lines or disruption of lines by \npeople intent on doing violence to areas. To make that type of \ninformation available to everybody all the time without any \nconsequences is going a little bit too far. People who are involved in \nsafety, fire departments and safety people, will get that information \nquickly as soon as it is on file. And the public will have a right to \nknow the information that they need to protect their local communities.\n  So I think the concerns have been addressed by our colleagues. The \nbill does an awful lot to improve the current situation, because of \ntheir involvement in this amendment, as I understand it to be, and it \nwould be an improvement as well.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. First, I again thank Senator Breaux for his \nleadership in helping to fashion this amendment, but since this was not \ndrafted in committee and was literally written on the floor, I want to \nensure the Record properly reflects our mutual intent.\n  There is a 5-year requirement for inspection basically with three \nescape clauses that I think should be properly understood and defined.\n  First, ``there is not sufficient capability'' means strictly there is \nnot the equipment available; there is not the personnel available. The \nSecretary will be certifying this was just not possible to get done \nsimply because of a shortage.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield, I agree with his explanation \nof that section.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Second, we discussed at some length ``deemed \nunnecessary because of more technologically appropriate monitoring.'' \nThis escape was created because the Senator from Louisiana noted some \nlines have constant monitoring. They do not need to be inspected every \n5 years because they are inspected every minute. That was our intent \nhere, not that someone comes forward and says: We think that is a well-\ndesigned pipeline and well done, so leave that one for 20 years. This \nwas, as the Senator noted, because of constant monitoring. Is that the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is the intent. There may be something other than \nconstant monitoring that can lead them to the same conclusion. Right \nnow, constant monitoring would be the type of technology that would \nassure the safety of that pipeline. There may be something tomorrow \nthat will be just as good as constant monitoring. I do not know that \nwould be there. It would be a technology that would ensure the \nintegrity and safety of that pipeline. That will be equally as good or \nbetter than an inspection.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. In any case, this is not some general escape where \npeople, in the future, who live in New Jersey will say: We think that \nis a good pipeline under the technology that was built so we are never \ngoing to inspect it.\n  The Senator was very specific about the kind of technology involved; \nthat it offered a superior guarantee.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Equal or superior.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The last element on this was ``created an \ninterruption of supply,'' which I take it means simply shutting down \nthe pipeline for inspection without an alternative means of delivering \nthe liquid or the natural gas and people would be without the product; \nthat there was no way to do the inspection without shutting this off \nand creating an economic or other kind of hardship.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator's point is well taken. If you have to dig up \na pipeline, obviously that is going to cause an interruption of supply. \nSometimes lines have to be dug up to be inspected. That creates a \ndisruption of supply. That does not mean that inspection should not be \ndone.\n  What we are trying to get at is interruptions that would work an \nundue hardship on communities by having an inspection that may not be \nnecessary. That is what we are talking about--not a normal \ninterruption, but an unnecessary interruption that would cause real \nproblems for a community to be without any natural gas, for instance, \nat a time when they desperately need it.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. For my purposes--\nand I think Senator Corzine is concerned about these large pipelines \ndelivering liquid and natural gas through the Northeast through densely \npopulated suburban communities in New Jersey--we have met our \nobjective; that is, the level of technology for inspection must be \nextraordinarily high or there will be regular inspections, so people \nliving in proximity to these pipelines know they can be assured of its \nsafety.\n  The Record should also reflect that we actually discussed having some \nother exemption for places that are sparsely populated. It was noted \nthat under no instances, given the density of the population in the \nNortheast or I assume in California or in Illinois, would that be \nappropriate.\n  This affords us the protection we need, and for that I am very \ngrateful. Again, my thanks to Senator McCain.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield while Senator McCain and I enter a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Senator McCain and I want to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wish to speak to this amendment for a moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe we ought to wait.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the adoption of \nthe amendment, after the statements by both Senators from New Mexico, \nthe vote occur on passage of S. 235, as amended, and that paragraph 4 \nof rule XII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding that \nprior to the vote Senator Domenici wishes to speak for 5 minutes, \nSenator Bingaman, 5 minutes, and Senator Cantwell 5 minutes, and that \nfollowing the adoption of this amendment, on which Senator Domenici \nwants to speak before it is adopted, we vote on final passage, unless \nthe Senator from Arizona wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my only amendment will be that I be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I revise my unanimous consent request that \nfollowing the adoption of the amendment, Senators Cantwell, Bingaman, \nand Domenici be allowed to speak for 5 minutes; following that, the \nvote occur on passage of S. 235, as amended, and that paragraph 4 of \nrule XII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I call to the attention of Senators on \nthe floor, in particular Senator Breaux and Senator McCain and perhaps \nthe New Jersey Senators, that one of the issues being discussed as we \nwork on this bill is the advancement of technology so inspections can \nbe done better.\n  There is a very interesting new technology--this bill provides for \nsome more money for research and technology--but there is a very \ninteresting technology that is about to be offered to the pipelines \nthat has been developed by a little company in New Mexico. Their name \nis LaSen Corporation. They have developed a system where a device is \nput on a light airplane and you fly over the pipeline. The device picks \nup the radiation from any kind of leakage whatsoever, reports it to the \ninstrumentation. They can do 500 miles of pipeline a today, where today \nwe do 5 to 10. They can do it at a cheaper price.\n  With this bill putting a little more into technologies and companies \nwith innovation such as this one, we are going to find better ways to \ndo the inspections covering a greater number of miles per day at much \ncheaper rates. This bill will push that. In the meantime, entrepreneurs \nare finding some exciting technologies such as this little company that \nwill have these devices very soon. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo.10.\n  The amendment (No. 10) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Cantwell and \nSenator Corzine for their initial success in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak on the bill for a very \nfew minutes, and, of course, congratulate Senator Corzine and the other \ncosponsors for the amendment that was just adopted, which I strongly \nsupport.\n  This bill overall is very important to the people of my State. \nSenator Domenici and I had the experience of learning last August of a \nterrible rupture of a high-pressure natural gas pipeline coming through \nNew Mexico on its way to California. It occurred on August 19 near \nCarlsbad, NM, at 5:30 in the morning. Unfortunately, the rupture \noccurred at a place where the pipeline crosses the Pecos River. It was \na place where many people came to fish and camp.\n  There was a large family there, an extended family and friends who \nwere camped there that night and the next morning when the rupture \noccurred. The rupture did kill 12 people. Shortly thereafter, there was \na 13th person who died later from injuries received at the site. It was \na terrible tragedy for our State and for the entire country.\n\n  After visiting the site with the personnel from the Office of \nPipeline Safety, it became clear to me that that office did not have \nadequate resources to do what it needed to do and it did not have \nadequate authority to do what it needed to do.\n  There are over 500,000 miles of interstate pipeline in the United \nStates. That agency needs the additional authority contained in this \nbill in order to address the different circumstances of individual \npipelines. The Senate bill requires each and every interstate natural \ngas and hazardous liquid pipeline to develop and implement an integrity \nmanagement plan.\n  The bill gives the Office of Pipeline Safety the authority to impose \nrigorous requirements to address areas with the greatest likelihood of \nfailures and, specifically, to address aging pipelines and those in \npopulated or environmentally sensitive areas.\n  The transmission line in New Mexico, as I said, was crossing the \nPecos River at the place where it ruptured. The bend in the pipe that \nwas required in order to cross that river was part of the problem that \nled to the rupture of the pipeline. As best we can determine, the \npipeline ruptured because of internal corrosion in the line. The line \nwas 40 or so years old. It is a very longstanding line. There had not \nbeen adequate inspection, particularly inspection that would have \ncaught that internal corrosion.\n  In the hopes of preventing other problems such as this which have \ngone undetected, and the ability to move some of the equipment that is \nused to determine internal corrosion that is impeded when you have a \nsharp bend in the pipe, which is what we had there where the pipe was \ncrossing the river, I introduced a bill to set up a coordinated \nresearch and development program. I am very pleased to say that has \nbeen incorporated into this bill that we are voting on today.\n  These natural gas and liquid pipelines are a critical element of the \nNation's energy infrastructure. They provide a cost-effective and \nrelatively safe means of delivering energy. As our economy has grown \nand become increasingly urbanized, the siting of new pipelines has \nbecome more and more of a challenge. At the same time, the importance \nof having these lines has increased dramatically, and the importance of \nensuring the safety of these lines has increased dramatically.\n  Earlier this week, the Energy Daily reported that inadequate pipeline \ncapacity into the northeastern part of this country will create serious \npower supply problems in the next few years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nEnergy Daily be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We do have a series of near-term crises related to \nenergy in the country. We are more and more aware of those families and \nbusinesses that have been hit by winter heating bills. There are high \nnatural gas prices affecting power prices in the western part of the \ncountry. Natural gas is a feedstock for the fertilizer industry, and \nthe high prices have shut down production of fertilizer in some parts \nof our country. Farmers are not going to find adequate supplies for the \nspring planting season.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, natural gas prices are only part of the \nproblem. After a number of years of surplus gas supplies, pipeline \ncapacity, and high electricity reserve margins, we are bumping up \nagainst the constraints of our infrastructure in each of these areas. \nWe need to deal with that. I hope we can this spring. We are going to \nwork on legislation in the Energy Committee to do that.\n  Passage of this pipeline safety bill is a small but a very important \nstep to help restore public confidence in the pipeline infrastructure \nand to avoid these catastrophes in the future. I believe this will be \nan appropriate step to take. I hope very much, after we pass this \nbill--as I believe we will today--the House of Representatives will \ntake it up and pass it quickly so that the Office of Pipeline Safety \ncan get about the business of better inspections to avoid catastrophes \nsuch as we faced near Carlsbad this last year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                 [From the Energy Daily, Feb. 6, 2001]\n\n     Pipeline Bottleneck To Pinch Gas Supplies for New England IPPs\n\n                           (By Jeff Beattie)\n\n       In a stark warning that New England's power supply is \n     becoming over-dependent on natural gas, the region's grid \n     operator said Monday that natural gas pipelines will not be \n     able to fill generators' requirements by 2005, leaving them \n     unable to operate 3,000 megawatts of gas-fired capacity.\n       The study released by ISO New England Inc. predicted \n     ``substantial unserved gas requirements'' by 2005 absent \n     major changes in infrastructure or fuel use.\n       The independent system operator urged a streamlined \n     regulatory process to expand pipeline capacity and--in a \n     proposal that raised generators' hackles--called for \n     requirements that new independent gas-fired plants develop \n     backup capabilities to burn oil.\n       The study said the gas crunch was developing because gas-\n     fired generating capacity is expected to triple between 1999 \n     and 2005, rising from 16 percent of total capacity to 45 \n     percent.\n       At the same time, pipeline capacity is not increasing at \n     the same pace, meaning independent generators likely will \n     have to keep\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\n     3,000 MW idle in the 2005 peak heating season due to lack of \n     gas. The study said smaller, brief shortfalls could occur in \n     the winter of 2003. The study said independent generators \n     would feel the impact before utilities because the current \n     system's operational flexibility could not meet coincident \n     needs of both, and ``the demands of utilities are scheduled \n     first--the majority of throughput for generation is \n     subordinated.''\n       Conducted by Boston-based Levitan and Associates Inc., the \n     study also suggests that the ability of gas-fired generators \n     to switch ``on-the-fly'' to distillate oil will be crucial \n     not only to meet the potential shortfall but to take up slack \n     in the event one of the region's major pipes has an accident \n     or shutdown.\n       The ISO said switching to oil was workable because 5,900 MW \n     of generation capacity have air permits that permit such \n     switching.\n       The region's shortfall stems from a projected installation \n     of between 7,500 and 11,600 MW of gas-fired generation by \n     2005. Virtually all of the new generating facilities plan to \n     use gas from Western Canada, the Gulf Coast, or--\n     increasingly--from new reserves off the coast of Nova \n     Scotia.\n       Pipeline industry officials say the Northeast's problems \n     are not surprising given the obstacles thrown up to the \n     industry's efforts to add capacity to the five major \n     interstate pipeline systems now serving the region.\n       ``FERC delayed one projected by over a year and a half \n     because they had 7,000 landowner complaints,'' said Jerry \n     Halvorsen, president of the Interstate Natural Gas \n     Association of America (INGAA). ``But we went into the FERC \n     document room and identified that only 5 percent of those \n     complainants were actually along the right of way, and in one \n     case they had counted one letter 14 times.''\n       Halvorsen also pointed to opposition from utilities \n     concerned that expansion would primarily feed independent \n     generators, and environmental agency concern about stream \n     crossings.\n       He added that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \n     under the leadership of new Chairman Curt Hebert, seems now \n     to be headed in the right direction.\n       ``I think FERC will do what it has to,'' he said.\n       The ISO suggests a number of ways to both increase the flow \n     of natural gas and reduce dependence, including: Requiring \n     merchant generators to certify the ``character and quality'' \n     of their gas transportation; additional modeling to predict \n     impacts of system breakdowns; and support for streamlining \n     federal pipe approval.\n       ``These fixes are doable if we get started now,'' said ISO \n     Vice President of System Operations Stephen Whitley. ``If you \n     wait until winter's over and forget about it because the cold \n     weather's gone, and then start talking about it later, that \n     would be terrible.''\n       Officials representing New England generators generally \n     agreed with the findings of the ISO's study, but objected to \n     its recommendation that IPPs be required to have fuel-\n     switching capability.\n       ``We would oppose that,'' said Neal Costello, general \n     counsel for the Competitive Power Coalition of New England. \n     ``ISO New England need to understand that they were created \n     to facilitate the development of a competitive wholesale \n     market. They are not `The Great Regulator,' which is \n     unfortunately sometimes how they view their role.\n       ``The fuel-switching capabilities of plants can be somewhat \n     misleading. Let's be honest about it: We [the generators] \n     would be switching from gas that people use to heat their \n     homes, to distillate oil that people use to heat their \n     homes.''\n       Costello said also said ``draconian environmental \n     regulations'' were part of New England's gas-dependence \n     problem.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator desire to speak? I will be glad to let \nthe Senator proceed, and then I will follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I say to my colleague from New Mexico, I appreciate \nbeing deferred. And I say to my other colleague from New Mexico, I \nappreciate and wish to be associated with his remarks.\n  Obviously, we are here discussing the best ways to move forward on \npipeline safety for the country. Obviously, despite the troubling \nrecord, this bill puts much of the responsibility of additional \nstandards into the hands of the Transportation Department and the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety.\n  In this legislation, we are relying on the Office of Pipeline \nSafety--a small office of only 55 inspectors--to be the principal \nGovernment agency responsible for ensuring the safety of 2 million \nmiles of our Nation's pipelines.\n  After years of failure in responding to congressional mandates--not \nhaving the capacity--one of the key issues for me, as this bill moves \nthrough the process of the other body, and through a conference \ncommittee, will be the level of support for funding given to the Office \nof Pipeline Safety and their ability to take on the monitoring \nresponsibilities and the responsibilities of the amendment that was \noffered by Senator Corzine, myself, and others, which was adopted.\n  The pipeline safety disruptions not only endanger human health and \nsafety but the leaks and explosions and fires associated with pipeline \nruptures can devastate the environment and disrupt critical energy \nflows.\n  Ultimately, considering the increasing incidents of pipeline \ndisruption, and a system that has led to over 243 pipeline-related \ndeaths since 1990, the unfortunate state of pipeline safety in this \ncountry demands that we make this a higher national priority.\n\n  I believe the bill today--unlike the version prior to being amended, \nwhich was not a better bill--with this amendment that was adopted is a \nbetter bill, but I can only support this in the final passage out of \nconference if we continue to improve the bill through the process. I \nwill be working diligently with my colleagues from around the country, \nwith the delegation in Washington, and in the House to make sure that \nis a reality.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor a bill to \nmodernize our nation's pipeline safety programs. The issue of our \ncountry's pipeline safety came to the forefront after tragic explosions \nin Bellingham, Washington, and later, in my own state of New Mexico.\n  On August 19, 2000, twelve members of an extended family were on a \ncamping and fishing trip along the Pecos River near Carlsbad, NM. Just \nafter midnight, a natural gas pipeline exploded, sending a 350 foot \nhigh ball of flame into the air. Six of the campers died instantly. The \nsix remaining family members later died from their horrific injuries.\n  I am not here today to argue the reasons why pipeline tragedies, such \nas the one in Carlsbad, continue to occur. I am not here today to \nfurther admonish the traditionally poor regulatory enforcement by the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety.\n  In that regard, I am confident that the new Administration will \nassume its responsibility to vigorously oversee and enforce pipeline \nregulations.\n  What I am here to do today, is to work so that we don't have to think \ntwice before camping with our families and friends. I am here to do my \npart, to assume my responsibility, so that pipeline tragedies like in \nCarlsbad, do not happen again.\n  Pipelines carry almost all of the natural gas and 65 percent of the \ncrude oil and refined oil products. Three primary types of pipelines \nform a network of nearly 2.2 million miles, 7,000 of which lie in my \nown state of New Mexico.\n  Pipelines stretch across our country. They allow us to obtain energy \nresources quickly and economically.\n  In light of the energy crisis in California, and in the west in \ngeneral, the value of our nation's pipeline system is obvious. We must \nhave access to energy.\n  Therefore, pipelines and the potential hazards they pose affect us \nall. It is time that we do something to ensure our safety while \nprotecting our access to energy.\n  Mr. President, this bill:\n  Significantly increases States' role in oversight, inspection, and \ninvestigation of pipelines.\n  Improves and expands the public's right to know about pipeline \nhazards.\n  Dramatically increases civil penalties for safety and reporting \nviolations.\n  Increases reporting requirements of releases of hazardous liquids \nfrom 50 barrels to five gallons.\n  Provides important whistle blower protections prohibiting \ndiscrimination by pipeline operators, contractors or subcontractors.\n  Furthermore, the legislation would provide much needed funding for \nresearch and development in pipeline safety technologies.\n  In fact, technology currently exists that might have detected \nweaknesses in pipelines around Carlsbad. Unfortunately, due to \ninsufficient funding those products have yet to reach the market.\n  La Sen Corporation in my own State of New Mexico has developed \ntechnology that can detect faulty pipelines\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nwhere current pipeline inspection technology is not useable. La Sen's \nElectronic Mapping System can be very effective even in pipelines where \nconventional pig devices cannot be used.\n  Pipeline inspection is costly and slow. Innovative new technologies \ncould allow us to inspect all 2.2 million miles of pipeline each year \nin a cost effective manner. Today, pipeline inspection technology only \ncovers 5-10 miles per day at a cost of $50 per mile. Again, La Sen's \ntechnology can survey 500 miles per day at a cost of $32 per mile.\n  The bottom line is that today, we can take action that will hopefully \nmake pipelines safer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the potential dangers that \npipelines pose and to minimize those dangers by unanimously passing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, on August 19th, New Mexicans, and the country to some \nextent, woke up to find out that at a camping site near Carlsbad, NM, \nright by our second largest river, which has been frequently used by \nfamilies, that a pipeline exploded reigning fire and terror. Six people \ndied instantly and six other family members and friends died shortly \nthereafter. And then one additional lived for a while and then died.\n  It was a very tragic event for a small State, especially a State \nwhere we know how important natural gas is. We produce a lot of it. We \nknow how important crude oil is. We produce a lot of it. But \nnonetheless, it was thought by many that we could do better, that these \nkinds of things should not happen.\n  I am not an expert, but I do believe that, as the facts have \ndetermined subsequent to that event, the Nation's inspection mechanism \nfor pipelines has been underfunded, understaffed, and probably at a \nminimum, lackadaisical, and to some extent totally asleep.\n  This bill says it is a far more important issue. And it comes at \nexactly the right time. Because we are assessing our country's energy \nsituation. We are going to find, when the President's task force \nreports, that we are growing more and more dependent upon natural gas \nand becoming more and more dependent upon foreign oil. Everyone should \nknow that pipelines are very important solution to our energy crisis.\n  We already know there are 2.2 million miles of pipeline carrying \nnatural gas across this country. Sixty-five percent of the crude oil \nrefined is in these pipelines. And 7,000 of these miles are in the \nState of New Mexico. This bill does a number of significant things to \nimprove the situation and, perhaps, make it such that we won't have \nthese kinds of problems in my State, and wonderful people like those \nwhose relatives woke up and read about their friends at this camp site \nthat were burned to death, at the pipeline rupture site.\n  Once again, the inspection process is rather crude today. We have to \ndo a lot better. I am quite certain, that the small corporation to \nwhich I referred the Senate a minute ago, La Sen Corporation in New \nMexico is not the only technology around, but it is among the most \nexciting. We are quite sure that company is going to succeed and that \nwe will be inspecting the pipelines of our country, whether they hang \nabove ground in some areas or whether they are underground. They are \ngoing to inspect them from small airplanes with technology on board \nthat will be so technically significant, with reference to detection of \nthe composites that are part of either natural gas or crude oil in the \npipelines. They will detect and report those composites, much like a \nradar screen in these small airplanes.\n  If that occurs, as I indicated a while ago, instead of 5 to 10 miles \na day, with crews and current equipment, we will inspect 500 miles a \nday, and it will be ultimately cheaper per mile. That is what \nultimately has to happen. This bill helps. It does put more money and \ndirects more research into pipeline safety technologies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill authorizes the Secretary of \nTransportation to take the steps necessary to protect the families of \ncommunities served by pipelines that are, or could be, hazardous. Under \nSection 14 of the bill, the Secretary can order necessary corrective \naction for hazardous facilities, including closing the facilities. In \nthe case of pipeline accidents, the Secretary can remove or reassign \nresponsible employees.\n  The Secretary's authority to deal with pipeline accidents and safety \nhazards can and should be exercised in ways that treat workers at \npipelines and pipeline facilities fairly. Under the bill, the Secretary \nmay direct pipeline operators to relieve employees from their duties, \nreassign them, or place them on leave for an indefinite period of \ntime--all without any provision for those employees to receive \ncompensation or benefits. Employees who may ultimately be determined to \nbear no responsibility for an accident could be put on extended unpaid \nleave under the bill. I believe that greater protections are needed for \nthe men and women who work at the nation's pipelines and pipeline \nfacilities. The vast majority of these workers are dedicated to \nprotecting the health and safety of the communities they serve. As we \ngo to conference with the House on this important bill, I urge the \nconferees to amend this provision to avoid the possible mistreatment of \nthese workers.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Pipeline Safety \nImprovement Act of 2001. I commend the work of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee, Senators McCain and Hollings, for \ntheir hard work on this legislation. I believe that this legislation \ntakes a balanced approach to an important issue and provides for an \nincrease in public safety without unduly burdening a vital ingredient \nof our energy infrastructure.\n  This legislation takes several important steps in improving the \nsafety of America's oil and natural gas pipelines. There are several \nelements of this legislation that I would like to highlight. First, \nthis legislation requires the implementation of pipeline safety \nrecommendations recently issued by the Department of Transportation \n(DOT) Inspector General to the DOT Research and Special Programs \nAdministration (RSPA). The Inspector General has recommended that the \npipeline industry finalize outstanding Congressional mandates \nprotecting sensitive environmental areas and high-density population \nareas. Moreover, it calls for the implementation of a training program \nfor the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) inspectors.\n  Second, it requires pipeline operators to submit to the Secretary of \nTransportation, or the appropriate State regulatory agency as the case \nrequires, a plan designed to enhance the qualifications of pipeline \npersonnel. I hope that this approach, in which the pipeline operators \nthemselves are consulted on the proper safety and training \nqualifications of their personnel, is a cooperative one that will not \nonly increase public safety, but also encourage the pipeline industry \nto take ownership in the standards they are called upon to implement.\n  Third, this bill calls upon the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations that require hazardous liquid pipelines and natural gas \ntransmission pipelines to evaluate the risks of the operator's \nfacilities in environmentally sensitive and high-density population \nareas, and to implement a program for integrity management that reduces \nidentified risks of an incident in those areas. Under these guidelines, \nthe pipeline operator's integrity management plan must be based on risk \nanalysis and must include a periodic assessment of the integrity of the \npipeline through methods including internal inspection, pressure \ntesting, direct assessment, or some other effective methods, to ensure \nthat identified problems are corrected in a timely manner. Again, I am \nhopeful that this integrity management plan will allow operators to be \neven more pro-active in identifying potential problems and correcting \nthem before any accidents occur.\n  Fourth, this legislation requires an operator of a gas transmission \nor hazardous liquid pipeline facility to carry out a continuing public \neducation program that would include activities to advise \nmunicipalities, school districts, businesses, and residents of pipeline \nfacility locations on a variety of pipeline safety matters. Educating \nthe community on issues of pipeline safety should also serve to \ndecrease the incidents of dangerous accidents in these areas.\n  While no legislation can entirely alleviate the elements of risk and \ndanger from human experience, there are ways that government, \nbusinesses, and local\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\ncommunities can cooperate to help minimize risks of serious accidents. \nWhen crafting such legislation, it is also important to ensure that any \nadditional burdens we place on private businesses will result in \nbenefits that outweigh those costs. This is especially important in the \narea of oil and gas pipelines, which are the arteries of energy \nproduction that allow us to fuel our cars, heat and cool our homes, and \ncarry out countless activities in our daily lives. All the oil and \nnatural gas in the world is worthless if we are unable to get it to the \nAmerican consumers. For this reason, I am especially heartened by the \ncooperative approach that was taken in preparing this legislation to \nensure that all the various stakeholders were heard and their \nlegitimate concerns were incorporated into this important legislation. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Pipeline Safety \nImprovement Act of 2001.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a short statement about the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001. This bill is identical to \nlegislation we considered and passed in the 106th Congress.\n  Last year, I took the time to outline the problem we now face in \nregard to this issue, and I want to take a moment to do that again. To \nunderstand this legislation, you must understand the situation from \nwhich we started. The federal government, through the Department of \nTransportation, regulates more than 2,000 gas pipeline operators with \nmore than 1.3 million miles of pipe and more than 200 hazardous liquid \npipeline operators with more than 156,000 miles of pipe. To protect the \npublic safety and the environment and maintain reliability in the \nenergy system over that massive infrastructure is an enormous \nchallenge. The responsibility for meeting that challenge, no matter how \ngreat it is, falls upon the industry and federal government, \nspecifically, DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety. It is clear that both \nOPS and the industry have failed to rise to that challenge, and we have \npaid a high price.\n  According to the OPS, since 1984, there have been approximately 5,700 \nnatural gas and oil pipeline accidents nationwide, 54 of them in my \nhome state of Massachusetts. In the 1990s, nearly 4,000 natural gas and \noil pipeline ruptures--more than one each day--caused the deaths of 201 \npeople, injuries to another 2,829 people, cost at least $780 million in \nproperty damages, and resulted in enormous environmental contamination \nand ecological damages. Two accidents in particular show us the tragic \nconsequences of pipeline accidents. On June 10, 1999, a leaking \ngasoline pipeline erupted into a fireball in Bellingham, Washington. \nThe fire extended more than one and half miles, killing two 10-year-old \nboys and a young man. The second accident took place in August in \nCarlsbad, New Mexico. A leaking natural gas pipeline erupted killing 12 \nmembers of an extended family on a camping trip. My sympathies go out \nto all those involved in these incidents. They are truly tragic.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee and others have investigated the cause \nof this tragic record. What we found, sadly, is that OPS was simply \nfailing to do its job. The head of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, Jim Hall, gave the OPS ``a big fat F'' for its work. As we \nconsidered the legislation in the Commerce Committee, I found that OPS \nhad fallen short in the area of enforcement, in particular. Enforcement \nis the backbone of any system of safeguards designed to protect the \npublic and the enforcement. Without the threat of tough enforcement, \ncompanies, the unfortunate record shows, do not consistently comply \nwith safeguards. The resulting harm to people and places is predictable \nand regrettable. I will not outline all of the details here today, but \nI recommend to anyone interested that they read the General Accounting \nOffice's investigation into OPS dated May 2000.\n  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001 includes enforcement \nreforms and enhances the role of OPS and the Department of Justice in \nenforcement. These provisions, which I proposed in the Commerce \nCommittee in the 106th Congress, will, I believe, put some teeth into \nour pipeline safety laws. They include raising the maximum fines that \nOPS can assess a company from $500,000 to $1,000,000; ensuring that \ncompanies cannot profit from noncompliance; clarifying the law \nregarding one-call services; and allowing DOJ, at the request of DOT, \nto seek civil penalties in court to ensure that serious violators can \nbe punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  The bill makes other significant improvements to existing law. My \ncolleagues Mr. McCain and Ms. Murray have outlined many of these \nprovisions and how they will improve pipeline safety. In addition, Mr. \nCorzine has offered a successful amendment that will require pipeline \ninspections on a 5 year basis when appropriate. That is a significant \nimprovement. However, Mr. President, despite the improvements in the \nunderlying bill and Mr. Corzine's amendment, S. 235 falls short in some \nareas. It is my hope that the legislation will be further improved in \nthe House and in the House-Senate conference by including worker \ncertification, enhancing right-to-know provisions and other steps that \nwould improve environmental and public safety protections. I look \nforward to continuing to work on this legislation, improve it, and, \nultimately, improving the pipeline safety throughout the nation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this legislation is very important to the \npeople of Michigan because we know what it is like to have pipeline \nsafety concerns in our own backyard. Last June, a gasoline pipeline \nruptured in Michigan, spilling more than 70,000 gallons of gasoline. \nFurther, national estimates rank Michigan second only to Texas in the \nnumber of repairs to damaged or leaking natural gas lines. Clearly, we \nneed comprehensive legislation which will help prevent further \ntragedies like those which have occurred in the United States over the \npast few years.\n  This legislation would strengthen pipeline safety regulations and \nencourage increased participation from interested and affected state \nagencies and communities as well as expand citizen right-to-know \nprovisions. It would also provide increased funding to the development \nof technologies to improve pipeline safety.\n  Although this bill could be stronger, it accomplishes many goals. I \nhope that when it comes back from Conference, we will see an even \nstronger bill. However, I will support this legislation at this time \nbecause I believe it moves us in the right direction.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of S. 235, the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001, I would like to urge my \ncolleagues to support this balanced bipartisan bill.\n  I am a new member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and have been \nprivileged to be appointed as Chair of the Surface Transportation and \nMerchant Marine Subcommittee. I have also been a member of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee for a number of years.\n  In the past few years, I have heard numerous witnesses discuss the \nneed to obtain more supply and build more energy infrastructure to \nservice the increasing energy demand. On a number of occasions I have \nheard, for example, that demand in the natural gas market is expected \nto increase from 22 trillion cubic feet to 30 trillion cubic feet by \naround 2010 to 2012 and that the interstate natural gas pipeline \nindustry is having to spend over $2.5 billion per year to build the \nnecessary pipeline and storage facilities to meet this demand.\n  More recently, these issues have taken on a sense of urgency as the \nelectricity problems in California have reached beyond that state to \naffect the availability of electricity in Oregon and to significantly \nincrease the rates that my constituents are paying at this time.\n  I also know that it is important to assure the public that both new \npipelines and existing pipelines are safe. The Pipeline Safety \nImprovement Act puts into place a number of common-sense measures that \nwill encourage pipeline operators to coordinate safety and emergency \nprocedures with national and state officials. The improvements mandated \nby this bill will help to eliminate accidents and decrease the very \nreal hazards for those who live and work near the pipelines that \ncrisscross our nation.\n  S. 235 requires the Office of Pipeline Safety to promulgate \nregulations to require operators of natural gas transmission pipelines \nand hazardous liquid\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\npipelines to evaluate the risks to the pipeline, focusing on areas that \nare highly populated or, in the case of hazardous liquid pipelines, \nareas that are environmentally sensitive.\n  S. 235 also provides more opportunity for state and local government \ninput when new regulations are promulgated. States that are interested \nin acting as interstate agents can participate in special \ninvestigations involving incidents or new construction and assume \nadditional inspection or investigatory duties or other activities under \nthe regulations issued by the Office of Pipeline Safety.\n  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act calls on pipeline operators to \nreview their public education programs for effectiveness and modify \nthem if necessary. Furthermore, S. 235 says the Office of Pipeline \nSafety may issue standards prescribing the elements of an effective \npublic communications program.\n  As the new Chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, I \nwill become very involved in this pipeline safety program. I plan to \nsit down with the staff of the Office of Pipeline Safety to learn more \nabout their plans for implementing legislation and what they may need \nto improve their effectiveness. I also plan to oversee their activities \nto make sure that, once Congress passes a reauthorization bill, they \nwill move to implement the intentions of Congress.\n  I know that S. 235 is the product of bipartisan cooperation and I \nsupport quick passage of this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 235, \nlegislation to improve the safety of pipelines carrying oil, natural \ngas and hazardous liquids. I commend Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Bingaman for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  Over the past few years, deadly pipeline explosions have destroyed \nhomes and taken lives. There is no question that safety standards need \nto be improved to ensure the safety of all Americans and to avoid \ninterruptions of energy supplies that can lead to shortages and \nsignificant price increases. This legislation will help to meet this \ngoal by strengthening safety regulations, updating penalties for safety \nviolations, improving whistleblower protections and providing increased \nfunding for safety research and enforcement.\n  I also want to express my support for the objectives mentioned today \nby Senator Torricelli and Senator Corzine, and my appreciation for the \nwillingness of Senator McCain and Senator Hollings to address these \nissues. It is my hope that the final bill will include strong right-to-\nknow, oversight, enforcement and worker certification provisions, and \nensure that those who violate regulations are held accountable for \ntheir actions. Finally, we need to ensure that adequate funding will be \navailable to meet all of these goals.\n  Once again, I want to thank my colleagues for their work on this \nissue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate has the opportunity to move \none step closer to correcting an extreme disappointment of the 106th \nCongress. S. 2438, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, which \npassed the Senate unanimously on September 7, 2000, but never made it \nacross the finish line in the House of Representatives, has been \nreintroduced this Congress as S. 235, the Pipeline Safety Improvement \nAct of 2001.\n  This legislation is the result of months of extraordinary bipartisan \neffort by Senators John McCain, Patty Murray, Slade Gorton, Jeff \nBingaman and Pete Domenici. Significant contributions to the \nlegislation were also made by Senators John Breaux, Fritz Hollings, Sam \nBrownback, Ron Wyden, John Kerry, Kay Bailey Hutchison and Byron \nDorgan.\n  I also feel some ownership of this effort. I serve on the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which prepared the \nbill for the Senate's consideration, and my home state of Mississippi \nhosts many, many miles of pipelines. These issues are extremely \nimportant to me.\n  S. 235 is an excellent bill. It is probably the most significant \nrewrite of our pipeline safety laws in more than a decade. It is a \ntough bill.\n  It comes on the heels of horrific accidents in Bellingham, \nWashington, Carlsbad, New Mexico, and in locations in Texas, that \nresulted in the deaths of a total of 17 people.\n  The authors of this bill were determined to put the necessary \nspecific requirements into the pipeline safety statutes that would \nprevent these kinds of accidents from happening in the future. They \nwere successful.\n  The bill represents a watershed change in the types of requirements \non pipeline operators for inspection, pipeline facility monitoring and \ntesting, employee training, disclosure of information, enforcement, \nresearch and development, management and accountability. It is as \ncomprehensive, tough, and complete as to be expected of a bill that \nemerged from a thorough process of hearings, both here and in the \nfield, data gathering, and working with the Administration, States and \nlocal groups.\n  It is the kind of legislative work product to be expected from the \nexperience, independence and determination of the Senators who worked \non S. 235. The pipeline industry had no choice but to submit to this \nlegislation.\n  Last year it received the affirmative vote of more than three fourths \nof the Congress--all of the Senate and just under two-thirds of the \nHouse. It received the written praise of Secretary Slater and the Vice \nPresident Gore.\n  Now, at a time when there is no question that this country is in dire \nneed of a sound energy policy, the Senate has the opportunity to \naddress one very important component of that policy--pipelines.\n  Today's fuel prices are a daily reminder that America is now at the \nmercy of foreign oil producing nations. However, before you blame your \nneighbor's SUV, your local fuel distributors, the oil companies, the \nautomakers, or any of the other usual scapegoats, consider this fact--\nAmerica is one of the leading energy producing countries in the world. \nThis country has the technology, alternative resources, and enough oil \nand gas to be much more self-sufficient. America does not have to \nrevert back to the practices of the 1970s. The goal of the soon to be \nintroduced energy policy legislation is to reduce the dependence on \nforeign sources by 50 percent by 2010. This goal can be accomplished, \nand with the accomplishment of this goal will be an increased need for \nthe use of pipelines--safe pipelines.\n  There is no question that this bill would make much needed \nimprovements in pipeline safety. There will be time in the coming \nmonths to debate energy policy. Let's keep this bill clean and focus on \npipeline safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill, as amended, having been read the third time, the question \nis, Shall it pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

QUALIFICATIONS OF PIPELINE PERSONNEL.\n\n       (a) Qualification Plan.--Each pipeline operator shall make \n     available to the Secretary of Transportation, or, in the case \n     of an intrastate pipeline facility operator, the appropriate \n     State regulatory agency, a plan that is designed to enhance \n     the qualifications of pipeline personnel and to reduce the \n     likelihood of accidents and injuries. The plan shall be made \n     available not more than 6 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and the operator shall revise or update the plan \n     as appropriate.\n       (b) Requirements.--The enhanced qualification plan shall \n     include, at a minimum, criteria to demonstrate the ability of \n     an individual to safely and properly perform tasks identified \n     under section 60102 of title 49, United States Code. The plan \n     shall also provide for training and periodic reexamination of \n     pipeline personnel qualifications and provide for \n     requalification as appropriate. The Secretary, or, in the \n     case of an intrastate pipeline facility operator, the \n     appropriate State regulatory agency, may review and certify \n     the plans to determine if they are sufficient to provide a \n     safe operating environment and shall periodically review the \n     plans to ensure the continuation of a safe operation. The \n     Secretary may establish minimum standards for pipeline \n     personnel training and evaluation, which may include written \n     examination, oral examination, work performance history \n     review, observation during performance on the job, on the job \n     training, simulations, or other forms of assessment.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall submit a report to the \n     Congress evaluating the effectiveness of operator \n     qualification and training efforts, including--\n       (A) actions taken by inspectors;\n       (B) recommendations made by inspectors for changes to \n     operator qualification and training programs; and\n       (C) industry and employee organization responses to those \n     actions and recommendations.\n       (2) Criteria.--The Secretary may establish criteria for use \n     in evaluating and reporting on operator qualification and \n     training for purposes of this subsection.\n       (3) Due date.--The Secretary shall submit the report \n     required by paragraph (1) to the Congress 3 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. PIPELINE INTEGRITY INSPECTION PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 60109 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Integrity Management.--\n       ``(1) General requirement.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations requiring operators of hazardous liquid pipelines \n     and natural gas transmission pipelines to evaluate the risks \n     to the operator's pipeline facilities in areas identified \n     pursuant to subsection (a)(1), and to adopt and implement a \n     program for integrity management that reduces the risk of an \n     incident in those areas. The regulations shall be issued no \n     later than one year after the Secretary has issued standards \n     pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section or by \n     December 31, 2002, whichever is sooner.\n       ``(2) Standards for program.--In promulgating regulations \n     under this section, the Secretary shall require an operator's \n     integrity management plan to be based on risk analysis and \n     each plan shall include, at a minimum--\n       ``(A) periodic assessment of the integrity of the pipeline \n     through methods including internal inspection, pressure \n     testing, direct assessment, or other effective methods. The \n     assessment period shall be no less than every 5 years unless \n     the Department of Transportation Inspector General, after \n     consultation with the Secretary determines there is not a \n     sufficient capability or it is deemed unnecessary because of \n     more technically appropriate monitoring or creates undue \n     interruption of necessary supply to fulfill the requirements \n     under this paragraph;\n       ``(B) clearly defined criteria for evaluating the results \n     of the periodic assessment methods carried out under \n     subparagraph (A) and procedures to ensure identified problems \n     are corrected in a timely manner; and\n       ``(C) measures, as appropriate, that prevent and mitigate \n     unintended releases, such as leak detection, integrity \n     evaluation, restrictive flow devices, or other measures.\n       ``(3) Criteria for program standards.--In deciding how \n     frequently the integrity assessment methods carried out under \n     paragraph (2)(A) must be conducted, an operator shall take \n     into account the potential for new defects developing or \n     previously identified structural defects caused by \n     construction or installation, the operational characteristics \n     of the pipeline, and leak history. In addition, the Secretary \n     may establish a minimum testing requirement for operators of \n     pipelines to conduct internal inspections.\n       ``(4) State role.--A State authority that has an agreement \n     in effect with the Secretary under section 60106 is \n     authorized to review and assess an operator's risk analyses \n     and integrity management plans required under this section \n     for interstate pipelines located in that State. The reviewing \n     State authority shall provide the Secretary with a written \n     assessment of the plans, make recommendations, as \n     appropriate, to address safety concerns not adequately \n     addressed in the operator's plans, and submit documentation \n     explaining the State-proposed plan revisions. The Secretary \n     shall carefully consider the State's proposals and work in \n     consultation with the States and operators to address safety \n     concerns.\n       ``(5) Monitoring implementation.--The Secretary of \n     Transportation shall review the risk analysis and program for \n     integrity management required under this section and provide \n     for continued monitoring of such plans. Not later than 2 \n     years after the implementation of integrity management plans \n     under this section, the Secretary shall complete an \n     assessment and evaluation of the effects on safety and the \n     environment of extending all of the requirements mandated by \n     the regulations described in paragraph (1) to additional \n     areas. The Secretary shall submit the assessment and \n     evaluation to Congress along with any recommendations to \n     improve and expand the utilization of integrity management \n     plans.\n       ``(6) Opportunity for local input on integrity \n     management.--Within 18 months after the date of enactment of \n     the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001, the Secretary \n     shall, by regulation, establish a process for raising and \n     addressing local safety concerns about pipeline integrity and \n     the operator's pipeline integrity plan. The process shall \n     include--\n       ``(A) a requirement that an operator of a hazardous liquid \n     or natural gas transmission pipeline facility provide \n     information about the risk analysis and integrity management \n     plan required under this section to local officials in a \n     State in which the facility is located;\n       ``(B) a description of the local officials required to be \n     informed, the information that is to be provided to them and \n     the manner, which may include traditional or electronic \n     means, in which it is provided;\n       ``(C) the means for receiving input from the local \n     officials that may include a public forum sponsored by the \n     Secretary or by the State, or the submission of written \n     comments through traditional or electronic means;\n       ``(D) the extent to which an operator of a pipeline \n     facility must participate in a public\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n     forum sponsored by the Secretary or in another means for \n     receiving input from the local officials or in the evaluation \n     of that input; and\n       ``(E) the manner in which the Secretary will notify the \n     local officials about how their concerns are being \n     addressed.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Senator Lieberman was an important \nsupporter of this legislation last year. Unfortunately, in spite of the \nfact that this bill received 60 votes in the Senate, Republicans opted \nto prevent the bill from becoming law.\n  However, given the fact that some in the administration and the other \nside of the aisle have indicated they may not support protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds, it is even more important that we \nenact this legislation. I look forward to working with Senator \nLieberman and all the others who have supported the idea that Social \nSecurity and Medicare funds should be used for these programs and these \nprograms alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1205-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR ALL LEARNERS ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, I am cosponsoring S.7, the \nEducational Excellence for All Learners Act. This bill increases school \ncapacity, makes schools accountable for results and ensures increased \nstudent achievement. S.7 ensures that the federal government uphold its \ncommitment to the local school districts to fully fund the IDEA \nprogram.\n  S.7 also promotes literacy by increasing the funding for the Reading \nExcellence Act. Another area in great need for resources in our \neducational system is teacher training. Senator Conrad and I have \nproposed legislation that is included in S.7 which would provide \nfederal support for teacher technology training to better prepare \nteachers to teach technology to our children.\n  But, I am gravely concerned that we will not have the resources that \nwill be needed to properly fund our obligations to education--and give \nback to the American family. A tax cut of the magnitude that George W. \nBush is pushing will not only eliminate any increase in funding for the \nmilitary--as President Bush announced a few days ago--but it will also \neliminate any increase in funding for the education of our children.\n  I say to President Bush--we should not leave our children behind. I \nam not saying that Democrats do not support a tax cut. To the contrary. \nHowever, the difference between Democrats and Republicans is that \nDemocrats are unwilling to jeopardize the domestic dividends that will \nmaterialize over the next generation for the health and education of \nour families.\n  Specifically, we have to have a fiscally responsible tax cut that \nallows us to protect social security, provide a prescription drug \nbenefit, fund education, ensure a strong and stable military, and \ncontinue to pay down the debt. Paying down the debt is better than a \ntax cut because it provides a more direct and efficient mechanism to \nstimulate the economy through lower interest rates, lower inflation and \nhigher family incomes.\n  We know that, as the Governor of Texas, President Bush made grand \nproposals, got just a little piece of what he asked for, and walked \naway declaring victory. He knows that he won't get all $1.6 trillion of \nhis tax cut. But he could have--the American people could have--a tax \ncut of $900 billion. This amount exceeds the tax cut put forward by the \nRepublicans in 1999 (that was $792 billion)--less than 3 years ago. A \ntax cut of $900 billion provides immediate elimination of the estate \ntax for virtually all taxpayers (e.g., 95 percent of family farms and \n75 percent of family businesses), complete elimination of all 65 \nmarriage penalties, college tuition tax credits and child care credits. \nAnd, we can provide business tax cuts such as incentives for research \nand development and employee pension benefits.\n  The people of Nevada want a tax cut, I want a tax cut, and Democrats \nwant a tax cut. But we should all remember--the people of Nevada want a \nstrong educational system, I want a strong educational system, and \nDemocrats want a strong educational system. Let us not leave any child \nbehind in this tax and budget debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1205-4", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1205-S1206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AMT REFORM\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Lugar and I joined \nforces with a bipartisan group of Senators to disarm one of the \nquickest ticking time bombs hidden away in our tax code. Senator Lugar \nand I were joined by Senators Breaux, Kyl, Landrieu, Cochran, and Bayh \nin introducing a bill to permanently provide tax protection for \nmillions of taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax.\n  The AMT was created to reduce the ability of some individuals to \ncompletely avoid taxation by using tax preference items excluded from \nthe income tax. The AMT was first established in 1969 after the \nSecretary of Treasury testified before Congress that 155 high-income \nindividuals had paid no federal income taxes in 1966. Over the years \nthe AMT has been amended several times and has gone from what was \nessentially a surcharge on tax preference items to the current system, \nwhich is generally considered a separate tax system that parallels the \nregular individual income tax but having its own definitions of income, \nits own rates, and its own problems.\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\n  There are two basic problems with the AMT. Number one, there are many \nitems considered in AMT determination that simply should not be there, \nand number two, the exemption amounts are not indexed. Last Congress I \ntook the lead on combating the former problem, and Senator Lugar took \nthe lead on the latter. This year we have come together in a bipartisan \nway to fight both.\n  There are several tax credits, including the child tax credit which \nPresident Bush proposes to double and the Adoption Credit which Senator \nLandrieu is working so hard to revise and expand, that are considered \npreference items when determining AMT liability. These personal credits \nalong with the standard deduction and the personal exemption can hardly \nbe considered luxury preference items and including them in the AMT \ncalculation goes against the spirit of the reform which brought about \nthe AMT. The bill which I have introduced will permanently remove the \nnonrefundable personal credits, the standard deduction and the personal \nexemptions from the AMT formula. In short, Mr. President, no one should \nbe forced into paying higher taxes because they took the Hope \nScholarship Credit, the deduction for their spouse and dependents, or \nbecause they take the credit for the dependent care services necessary \nfor keeping a job! It is time to permanently protect working families \nfrom having to choose between higher taxes and family credits.\n  The second provision of this bill increases the individual exemption \namount for the AMT, and indexes it from here on out. This indexing will \nmake sure that limits we set stay economically accurate as inflation \nreduces the value of the exemption over time.\n  I believe this plan is a comprehensive and bipartisan way to take on \nthis issue and put it to rest for the long term. Even if we do not \nchoose this approach, which I believe is the most effective and cost \neffective approach, something clearly has to be done now or the AMT \nwill explode in the coming few years. According to research by the \nJoint Tax Committee and the Treasury Department, the number of \ntaxpayers affected by the AMT is expected to balloon from 1.3 million \nin 2000 to 17 million by 2010. That is almost 16 percent of all taxable \nreturns! A return, by the way, which takes on the average 5 hours and \n39 minutes to fill out. Of those 17 million taxpayers, 4.5 million are \nexpected to be taxpayers who have to give up part of their tax credits \nto avoid the AMT tax liability. That is wrong and hard working middle-\nincome families deserve better.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a fair look at this legislation and let's \nwork together to put the AMT back into reason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1206-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1206-S1207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, a study by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities just came out. I want to read one statistic. This is \nBob Greenstein's organization. Bob received one of those McArthur \ngenius grants. He deserves it. This data on the tax cuts is so \nimportant. It says:\n\n       An estimated 12.2 million low- and moderate-income families \n     with children--31.5 percent of all families--would not \n     receive any tax cut from the Bush proposal . . . .\n\n  Approximately 24.1 million children--33 percent of all the children \nin the country--live in these families, and among African Americans and \nHispanics, the figures are even more striking: 55 percent of African \nAmerican children and 56 percent of Hispanic children will receive no \ntax break at all because it is not refundable. We have to live up to \nour words of ``leave no child behind.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this study by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Feb. 7, 2001.]\n\n  An Estimated 12 Million Low- and Moderate-Income Families--With 24 \n         Million Children--Would Not Benefit From Bush Tax Plan\n\n             (By Isaac Shapiro, Allen Dupree and James Sly)\n\n       About 12 million low- and moderate-income families with \n     children--nearly one in every three U.S. families--would not \n     receive any assistance from the tax provisions that President \n     Bush is likely to send to Congress on February 8. An \n     estimated 24 million children under age 18--one in every \n     three children--live in these families.\n       For certain groups, the proportions of families and \n     children not benefitting from the plan are higher. A majority \n     of black and Hispanic children live in families that would \n     not benefit from the plan. For these families and their \n     children, the tax package neither raises after-tax income nor \n     reduces their frequently high marginal tax rates.\n       This analysis investigates these figures in more detail and \n     then examines the reason that so many families and children \n     do not benefit--the families have incomes too low to owe \n     federal income taxes. This leads to a discussion of whether \n     families that do not owe income taxes should benefit from a \n     large tax-cut proposal and the extent to which they owe taxes \n     other than income taxes, most notably the payroll tax.\n\n\n                         Who Would Be Excluded?\n\n       We examined the latest data from the Census Bureau to \n     estimate the number of families and children under 18 who \n     would receive no assistance from the Bush tax plan. The data \n     are for 1999. We examined the Bush plan as proposed in the \n     campaign and recently introduced by Senators Gramm and \n     Miller; our analysis considers the effects of the plan as if \n     it were in full effect in 1999.\n       The findings of this analysis are consistent with an \n     independent analysis of who is left out of the Bush plan that \n     has been conducted by researchers at the Brookings \n     Institution and with data from the tax model of the Institute \n     on Taxation and Economic Policy. The findings of the \n     Brookings researchers (as part of a general analysis of tax \n     ideas to assist working families that will be published later \n     this week) and the unpublished data from the Institute on \n     Taxation and Economic Policy both indicate that nearly one in \n     three families would not receive any assistance from the \n     Administration's proposal.\n       The key findings of our analysis include:\n       An estimated 12.2 million low- and moderate-income families \n     with children--31.5 percent of all families--would not \n     receive any tax cut from the Bush proposal. Some 80 percent \n     of these families have workers.\n       Approximately 24.1 million children--33.5 percent of all \n     children--live in the excluded families.\n       Among African-Americans and Hispanics, the figures are \n     especially striking. While one-third of all children would \n     not benefit from the Bush tax plan, more than half of black \n     and Hispanic children would not receive any assistance. An \n     estimated 55 percent of African-American children and 56 \n     percent of Hispanic children live in families that would \n     receive nothing from the tax cut.\n       Of the 24.1 million children living in families that would \n     receive no benefit from the tax cuts, an estimated 10.1 \n     million are non-Hispanic whites, 6.1 million are black, and \n     6.5 million are Hispanic.\n       Even the Bush proposal to double the child tax credit--the \n     feature of his tax plan that one might expect to provide the \n     most assistance to children in low- and moderate-income \n     families--would be of little or no help to many of them. This \n     proposal would provide the largest tax reductions to families \n     with incomes in the $100,000 to $200,000 range and confer a \n     much larger share of its benefits on upper-income families \n     than on low- and middle-income families.\n       Under the Bush plan, the maximum child credit would be \n     raised from $500 per child to $1,000. Filers with incomes in \n     the $110,000 to $200,000 range would benefit the most from \n     this proposal because the proposal raises the income level \n     above which the child credit phases out from $110,000 to \n     $200,000 extending the credit for the first time to those in \n     this income category. For many of these relatively affluent \n     taxpayers, the child credit would rise from zero to $1,000 \n     per child. By contrast, millions of children in low- and \n     moderate-income working families would continue to receive no \n     child credit, or their credit would remain at its current \n     level of $500 per child or rise to less than $1,000 per child \n     (because their families would have insufficient income tax \n     liability against which to apply the increase in the child \n     credit).\n       As a consequence, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy \n     data indicate that when the increase in the child credit is \n     fully in effect:\n       Some 82 percent of the benefits from the child credit \n     proposal would accrue to the 40 percent of families with the \n     highest incomes. Only three percent of the benefits from this \n     proposal would accrue to the bottom 40 percent of families.\n       The top 20 percent of families would receive 46 percent of \n     the tax-cut benefits from this proposal, a larger share than \n     any fifth of the population would receive.\n\n\n                     Why families would not benefit\n\n       During 2000, Bush campaign officials touted their tax-cut \n     plan as benefitting lower-income taxpayers substantially in \n     two key ways--by doubling the child credit to $1,000 per \n     child and by establishing a new 10 percent tax-rate bracket. \n     Some married families also would benefit from the plan's two \n     earner deduction. None of these features, however, affect a \n     family that has no income tax liability before the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit is computed.\n       A large number of families fall into this category. As a \n     result of the combination of the standard deduction (or \n     itemized deductions if a family itemizes), the personal \n     exemption, and existing credits such as the child tax credit, \n     these families do not owe\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\n     federal income taxes. (As described below, these families can \n     pay substantial amounts in other taxes, such as payroll and \n     excise taxes, even after the Earned Income Tax Credit is \n     taken into account.)\n       The level at which families now begin to pay federal income \n     taxes is approximately 130 percent to 160 percent of the \n     poverty line, depending on family type and family size. For \n     example, in 2001, a two-parent family of four does not begin \n     to owe income tax--and thus does not begin to benefit from \n     the Bush plan--until its income reaches $25,870, some 44 \n     percent above the poverty line of $17,950. Families below the \n     poverty line would receive no assistance from the tax cut. \n     Nor would many families modestly above the poverty line.\n       The framers of the Bush plan could have assisted low-income \n     working families by improving the EITC. Alternatively, the \n     Bush plan could have expanded the dependent and child care \n     tax credit and made it available to the low-income working \n     families who currently are denied access to this credit \n     because it is not refundable. Or, the plan could have \n     increased the degree to which the child tax credit is \n     refundable. The plan takes none of these steps.\n\n\n                     What families should benefit?\n\n       Since the reason 12 million families and their children \n     would not benefit from the Bush plan is that they do not owe \n     federal income taxes, some have argued that it is appropriate \n     they not benefit. ``Tax relief should go to those who pay \n     taxes'' is the short-hand version of this argument. This line \n     of reasoning is not persuasive for several reasons.\n       1. A significant number of these families owe taxes other \n     than federal income taxes, often paying significant amounts. \n     For most families, their biggest federal tax burden by far is \n     the payroll tax, not the income tax. Data from the \n     Congressional Budget Office indicate that in 1999, three-\n     quarters of all U.S. households paid more in federal payroll \n     taxes than in federal income taxes. (This comparison includes \n     both the employee and employer share of the payroll tax; most \n     economists concur that the employer's share of the payroll \n     tax is passed along to workers in the form of lower wages.) \n     Among the bottom fifth of households, 99 percent pay more in \n     payroll than income taxes. Low-income families also pay \n     excise taxes and state and local taxes. While the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit offsets these taxes for most working \n     families with incomes below the poverty line, many families \n     with incomes modestly above the poverty line who would not \n     benefit from the Bush plan are net taxpayers.\n       Consider two types of families earning $25,000 a year in \n     2001, an income level the Administration has used in some of \n     its examples:\n       A two-parent family of four with income of $25,000 would \n     pay $3,825 in payroll taxes (again, counting both the \n     employee and employer share) and lesser amounts in gasoline \n     and other excise taxes. The family pays various state taxes \n     as well. The family's Earned Income Tax Credit of $1,500 \n     would offset well under half of its payroll taxes.\n       Even if just payroll taxes and the EITC are considered, the \n     family's net federal tax bill would be $2,325. Nonetheless, \n     this family would receive no tax cut under the Bush plan.\n       The Administration has used the example of a waitress who \n     is a single-mother with two children and earns $25,000 a \n     year. If this waitress pays at least $170 a month in child \n     care costs so she can work and support her family--an amount \n     that represents a rather modest expenditure for child care--\n     she, too, would receive no tax cut under the Bush plan \n     despite having a significant net tax burden. In her case as \n     well, her payroll taxes would exceed her EITC by $2,325.\n       2. The Bush approach fails to reduce the high marginal tax \n     rates that many low-income families face. Throughout the \n     presidential campaign and early into the new Presidency, \n     President Bush and his advisors have cited the need to reduce \n     the high marginal tax rates that many low-income working \n     families face as one of their tax plan's principle goals. \n     They have observed that a significant fraction of each \n     additional dollar these families earn is lost as a result of \n     increased income and payroll taxes and the phasing out of \n     the EITC. Ironically, however, a large number of low-\n     income families that confront some of the highest marginal \n     tax rates of any families in the nation would not be aided \n     at all by the Bush plan.\n       Analysts across the ideological spectrum have long \n     recognized that the working families who gain the least from \n     each additional dollar earned are those with incomes between \n     about $13,000 and $20,000. For each additional dollar these \n     families earn, they lose up to 21 cents in the EITC, 7.65 \n     cents in payroll taxes (15.3 cents if the employer's share of \n     the payroll tax is counted), 24 cents to 36 cents in food \n     stamp benefits, and additional amounts if they receive \n     housing assistance or a child care subsidy on a sliding fee \n     scale or are subject to state income taxes. Their marginal \n     tax rates are well above 50 percent. Yet the Bush plan does \n     not provide any assistance to them.\n       Ways to reduce marginal tax rates for such families are \n     available and not especially expensive. They basically entail \n     raising the income level at which the EITC begins to phase \n     down as earnings rise, and/or reducing the rate at which the \n     EITC phases down. Bipartisan legislation introduced last year \n     by Senators Rockefeller, Jeffords, and Breaux follows such a \n     course, as do proposals made by Rep. Ben Cardin and the \n     Clinton Administration.\n       3. Consistent with the objective of helping working \n     families lift themselves out of poverty, an additional income \n     boost would be worthwhile. A key theme of welfare reform has \n     been to prod, assist, and enable families to work their way \n     out of poverty. The principle of helping families work their \n     way out of poverty has gained support across the political \n     spectrum. This principle is important for married families \n     and single-parent families, and there is considerable \n     evidence that welfare reform--in combination with a strong \n     economy, low unemployment rates, and the EITC--has \n     significantly increased employment rates among single \n     mothers. Providing increased assistance to the working poor \n     through the tax system could further the goal of making work \n     pay.\n       Such assistance is particularly important since much of the \n     recent gains in the earnings of the working poor have been \n     offset by declines in other supports. For example, from 1995 \n     to 1999 the poorest 40 percent of families headed by a single \n     mother experienced an average increase in earnings of about \n     $2,300. After accounting for their decrease in means-tested \n     benefits and increases in taxes, their net incomes rose a \n     mere $292. (Both changes are adjusted for inflation.)\n       In addition, a study the Manpower Demonstration Research \n     Corporation has just released finds that improving income--\n     and not just employment--is important if the lives of \n     children in poor families are to improve. The MDRC report \n     examined five studies covering 11 different welfare reform \n     programs. The report's central finding was that increased \n     employment among the parents in a family did not by itself \n     significantly improve their children's lives. It was only in \n     programs where the parents experienced increased employment \n     and increased income that there were positive effects--such \n     as higher school achievement--for their elementary school-\n     aged children.\n       4. The rewards from the surplus should be spread throughout \n     the population. The Bush tax package is likely to consume \n     most, if not all, of the available surplus outside Social \n     Security and Medicare. A recent Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities analysis pegs the cost of the Bush plan at more \n     than $2 trillion over 10 years, which would exceed the \n     surplus that is likely to be available outside Social \n     Security and Medicare when realistic budget assumptions are \n     used. If large tax cuts are to be provided, it is appropriate \n     to dedicate some portion of those tax cuts to the people with \n     the most pressing needs, such as low-income working families \n     with children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1207-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1207-S1208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE PUBLIC EDUCATION REINVESTMENT, REINVENTION AND RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today in support \nof the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility \nAct. I want to congratulate my good friends, the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Indiana, for their strong leadership \non this issue. When they first introduced this legislation back last \nyear, the prospects for bipartisan education reform looked far \ndifferent than they do today. Members on the two sides of the aisle \nwere sharply divided over the future of the Federal role in education. \nAs a result, the Congress failed last year to reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act for the first time in its 35-\nyear history.\n  Last year, it took courage and foresight for the supporters of this \nlegislation to step into the partisan breach in the way that they did. \nThis bill received all of 13 votes when it was first brought to the \nfloor. Today, we ought to all be grateful for the leadership of those \n13 senators, because this year the Public Education Reinvestment, \nReinvention, and Responsibility Act represents the best hope and the \nbest blueprint for finally achieving meaningful, bipartisan reform of \nthe Federal role in education.\n  For the last eight years, I had the great privilege of serving my \nlittle State as governor. During that time, I worked together with \nlegislators from both sides of the aisle, with educators and others, to \nset rigorous standards, to provide local schools with the resources and \nflexibility they needed, and in return to demand accountability for \nresults. We in Delaware have not been alone in this endeavor. We have \nbeen part of a nationwide movement for change--a movement of parents \nand teachers, of employers, legislators and governors, who believe that \nour public schools can be improved and that every child can learn.\n  As a former chairman of the National Governors' Association, I can \nattest that the Federal Government is frequently a lagging indicator \nwhen it comes to responsiveness to change. It\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nis clearly states and local communities that are leading the movement \nfor change in public education today. The bill we introduce today does \nnot seek to make the Federal Government the leader in education reform \nby micromanaging the operation of local schools. Nor does this \nlegislation seek to perpetuate the status quo in which the Federal \nGovernment passively funds and facilitates failure. Rather, this \nlegislation seeks for the first time to make the Federal Government a \npartner and catalyst in the movement for reform that we see all across \nthis country at the State and local level. This legislation refocuses \nFederal policy on doing a few things, but doing them well. It redirects \nFederal policy toward the purpose of achieving results rather than \npromulgating yet more rules and regulations.\n  I believe we have a tremendous opportunity this year to achieve \nbipartisan consensus to reform and reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, and in so doing to redeem the original intent \nof that landmark legislation. I want to express my appreciation to our \nnew President for his interest in renewing educational opportunity in \nAmerica and leaving no child behind. There is much in the legislation \nwe introduce today that squares with the plan that the President sent \nto Congress last week. We on this side of the aisle agree with the \nPresident that we need to invest more Federal dollars in our schools, \nparticularly in schools that serve the neediest students. We also agree \nthat the dollars we provide, we should provide more flexibly. And we \nagree that if we are going to provide more money, and if we are going \nto provide that money more flexibly, we should demand results. That's \nthe formula: invest in reform; insist on results.\n  I believe we also agree with our new President that parents should be \nempowered to make choices to send their children to a variety of \ndifferent schools. We agree that parents are the first enforcers of \naccountability in public education. Where we disagree is in how we \nprovide that choice. The President believes that the best way to \nempower parents and to provide them with choices is to give children \nand their parents vouchers of $1,500. With all due respect, that is an \nempty promise. In my State, you just can't get your child into most \nprivate or parochial schools for $1,500 per year. That is simply an \nempty promise.\n  I believe there is a better way. I believe we've found a better way \nin my little state of Delaware. Four years ago, we introduced statewide \npublic school choice. We also passed our first charter schools law. I \nknew that this was going to work when I heard the following \nconversation between a school administrator and some of his colleagues. \nHe said, ``If we don't provide parents and families what they want and \nneed, they'll send their kids somewhere else.'' I thought to myself, \n``Right! He's got it.''\n  We have 200 public schools in my small State, and students in all of \nthese schools take our test measuring what they know and can do in \nreading, writing, and math. We also measure our schools by the \nincidence of poverty, from highest to lowest. The school with the \nhighest incidence of poverty in my state is the East Side Charter \nSchool in Wilmington, Delaware. The incidence of poverty there is 83 \npercent. Its students are almost all minority. It is right in the \ncenter of the projects in Wilmington. In the first year after East Side \nCharter School opened its doors, very few of its students met our state \nstandards in math. Last spring, every third grader there who took our \nmath test met or exceeded our standards, which is something that \nhappened at no other school in the state. It's a remarkable story. And \nit's been possible because East Side Charter School is a remarkable \nschool. Kids can come early and stay late. They have a longer school \nyear. They wear school uniforms. Parents have to sign a contract of \nmutual responsibility. Teachers are given greater authority to innovate \nand initiate.\n  We need to ensure that parents and students are getting what they \nwant and need, and if they're not getting what they want and need that \nthey have the choice--and most importantly that they have the ability--\nto go somewhere else. A $1,500 voucher, doesn't give parents that \nability, at least not in my State. Public school choice and charter \nschools do.\n  We agree on many things. Where we disagree, as on vouchers, I believe \nwe can find common ground. I believe that we can come together, for \nexample, to provide a ``safety valve'' to children in failing schools, \nin the way of broader public school choice and greater access to \ncharter schools. I am therefore hopeful, about the prospects for \nbipartisan agreement and for meaningful reform. To that end, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, \nand Responsibility Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1208-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1208-S1213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise today \nto pay tribute to our friend and colleague Alan Cranston. His death on \nDecember 31 last year was a shock. Alan was such a life force that it \nis hard for me to imagine his silence and his not being there for great \narms control debates.\n  Senator Cranston was a man of conviction, a true humanitarian in \nevery sense of those words. He began his career in public policy in the \n1930s as a journalist warning his readers of the dangerous rise of \nfascism. He knew even then that the United States was locked in an \nintricate web of relations with the rest of the world and that our \nattempts to ignore that web could only lead to calamity for ourselves \nand those around us. Alan understood the concept of globalization at \nleast 50 years before it gained such notoriety to earn a name.\n  It was primarily that impulse to engage the world that brought Alan \ninto elective office and eventually to the United States Senate. As \nState of California Controller from 1958 to 1967, he worked to \nrationalize the booming state's finances and ensure that all \nCalifornians could benefit from that phenomenal rise.\n  But it was in the Senate where Alan could most effectively work \ntoward his vision of a peaceable world. Before the people of California \nsent him here in 1968, he learned about the Senate's moderating \ninfluence and the consequences of its shirking that role. In his post-\nWorld War ``Killing of the Peace,'' Alan explained how the U.S. \nSenate's defeat of the League of Nations contributed to the outbreak of \nthat war and the horrible events that followed.\n  Most of his activities during his impressive 24 years here were an \nexpression of his deep desire for the Senate to avoid similar mistakes. \nHe brought a special seriousness of purpose and attentiveness to arms \ncontrol issues as diverse as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and \nongoing production of the B-2 Stealth Bomber. On several occasions, I \njoined him in opposing the production of new, destabilizing types of \nnuclear weapons, and I was always struck by Alan's sense of nuance and \nwillful resolve.\n  Alan was not one to ignore his own personal responsibilities to the \nSenate. As Democratic Whip, Alan made this body run efficiently. If \nthere is anyone who was never afraid to count the votes, it was Alan. \nHe knew how to smoke us out on our intentions. What made him so \neffective was his persuasive argumentation and downright persistence. \nSometimes he could change my mind faster than he could run a 100-yard \ndash, which was pretty fast considering he was a lifelong record-\nsetting sprinter.\n  It was unsurprising that after his Senate career he led the non-\nprofit Global Security Institute where he continued to press from arms \ncontrol initiatives. The Institute provided a perfect platform from \nwhich he could promote his expanded notion of security. After the Cold \nWar, Alan realized before everyone else that security no longer meant \nmerely protection from weapons of mass destruction. He saw that \nsecurity in the new millennium was also about avoiding environmental \ndegradation, securing our food supply, and educating our children.\n  Alan was a forward-thinker and an alternative voice at a time when \nconventional wisdom demanded examination. He worked to make our world \nsafer, and he was a good friend. I will miss him greatly.\n\n\n     THE ALAN CRANSTON I KNEW: INTENSITY, INTEGRITY, AND COMMITMENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. A couple of weeks ago I had the sad duty to travel to \nCalifornia\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\nto represent the Senate and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a \nmemorial service for Senator Alan MacGregor Cranston. It was a moving \nceremony, a chance for all those in attendance to rededicate themselves \nto the noble goals which shaped Alan Cranston's life.\n  Alan Cranston will be remembered by those of us who knew and loved \nhim as a man of peace who devoted much of his adult life--four terms in \nthe Senate and a decade as director of the Global Security Institute--\nto the tasks of promoting nuclear arms control and encouraging world \npeace. These are not small objectives, but of course Alan Cranston's \ninterests extended beyond them, literally, ``. . . from the Redwood \nForests to the Gulf stream waters.'' Never content to sit on the \nsidelines, Alan Cranston fought tirelessly for the causes in which he \nbelieved: nuclear disarmament, the environment, civil rights, and \ndecent housing. He brought the intensity of a sprinter and the \nendurance of a marathoner to each of these causes.\n  During his tenure as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee from 1981-1993, Alan Cranston was a devoted supporter of \nstrong U.S. leadership in the world, whether it meant promoting the \ndevelopment of democracy in the Philippines and Cambodia or working to \nhalt the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  Alan Cranston knew that the United States could not go it alone in \nthe world. In an age when American unilateralism, if not isolationism, \nhas gained a certain currency in Washington, Alan Cranston's life \nreminds us that the highest aspirations of the American people are \nthose which lead us to care about others and work with others to \naddress common problems.\n  The intensity, integrity, and commitment Alan Cranston brought to \npublic service stand as an example we all might follow as we begin work \nin this 107th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that a transcript of the \nremarks made at Senator Cranston's memorial service be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Alan MacGregor Cranston Memorial Service, Grace Cathedral in San \n                     Francisco, January 16th, 2001\n\n       The following friends and family took part in the \n     extraordinary memorial service of Alan MacGregor Cranston:\n       The Very Reverend Alan Jones, Dean, Grace Cathedral.\n       Colette Penne Cranston, daughter-in-law of Alan Cranston.\n       Kim Cranston, son of Alan Cranston.\n       Gray Davis, Governor of California.\n       Joseph Biden, US Senator from Delaware.\n       Ted Turner.\n       Sally Lilienthal, President, Ploughshares Fund.\n       William Turnage, former President, Wilderness Society.\n       James Hormel, former U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n       Harris Wofford, former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania.\n       Jane Goodall, Primatologist.\n       Cruz Reynoso, former Justice, California Supreme Court.\n       Jonathan Granoff, CEO, Global Security Institute.\n       The Very Reverend Alan Jones, Dean, Grace Cathedral.\n       Alan Jones. Good afternoon. I am Alan Jones, the Dean of \n     the Cathedral, and it is my privilege to welcome you to Grace \n     Cathedral for this celebration of the life of Alan MacGregor \n     Cranston.\n       It is fitting that such a large-hearted man be honored and \n     remembered in a soaring and splendid space.\n       There was a comment in the London Times about the public \n     reaction to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. First, it \n     showed that our instinct for devotion is still deep within \n     us. Second, that huge emotions require huge spaces, like \n     cathedrals. And third, that the things we do in them are \n     always up for change.\n       And so I invite you first to allow the instinct for \n     devotion, the call of something and someone larger than \n     ourselves to well up in you this afternoon, and I think the \n     Senator would have applauded anything that called us out of \n     our cynicism and challenged us not to accept futility as \n     normal.\n       I invite you also to acknowledge that huge emotions require \n     huge spaces. We need great spaces and ways of celebration in \n     order to locate ourselves in a larger vision of the human \n     enterprise.\n       And finally I invite you to be open to that fact, the fact \n     that things we do in places like this are always up for \n     change. Life is never business as usual, and nothing would \n     have pleased Alan more than for us to leave this place \n     resolved to make a difference.\n       So, we welcome you to the Cathedral for this celebration of \n     the life of a man who held a large and generous vision of \n     what it is to be human.\n       Our best way to honor him is to share and maintain that \n     vision of a just and humane society on a planet fit for all \n     living beings.\n       So as you remain seated, I invite you to pray.\n       Dear God, we thank you for the life and the work of Alan \n     MacGregor Cranston. His generous spirit opened doors and \n     touched many lives for good. His faith in the human \n     enterprise inspired us to accept the great joy and \n     responsibility of being human. His political skills \n     ensured an enduring legacy.\n       He was friend to those who had no voice, and a lover of the \n     great spaces of the wilderness. His long life touched and was \n     touched by the great events of our time. He was a man for all \n     seasons.\n       In public life, he fought for what he believed with passion \n     and hard work. His caring, open-heartedness and his respect \n     for people touched the lives of many. His generous spirit \n     wanted everybody to do well, and this generosity was \n     infectious.\n       And so we thank you for his capacity for friendship, his \n     probing intelligence, and his refusal to be enticed into \n     meanness and pettiness.\n       Finally, we thank you for his life and example, and we \n     commend him into your gracious care. May we honor him by \n     rededicating ourselves to peace on Earth, and goodwill to all \n     people, and to building a more just and inclusive America. \n     Amen.\n       Colette Penne Cranston. Hello! I am Alan's daughter-in-law, \n     Colette. I am the first speaker because I need to be. Our \n     daughter has commented that I seem to have an endless supply \n     of tears. Since I was honored to have such a close, personal \n     relationship with Alan, I wanted to give you some insights \n     into his gentle, unwavering spirit. He was much more than my \n     father-in-law, he was my friend, my advisor and now and I \n     know he will love this he has become my Jiminy Cricket, that \n     little voice in my conscience that says, 'think before you \n     leap!'\n       Kim, Evan our seven-year-old daughter and I live right next \n     to Alan's on the same property. Alan's big sister, who we \n     call RE, lived up the hill from us until recently. This \n     arrangement was such a gift for everyone! Alan and Evan had \n     great sunset walks together, evenings of art work and stories \n     around the fire at his place, and dinner dates out just the \n     two of them. They would dress up and go to a restaurant, \n     often one with a piano player, and make an evening of it. \n     Evan called him ``Gran.'' One night when the two of them were \n     returning from a walk, Kim called me out to the balcony and \n     said, ``Listen!'' We could hear their voices but couldn't see \n     them yet. Alan was saying, ``Well, you know, Evan, I don't \n     know why that's true, but it is true dogs love to ride in \n     cars and cats don't.'' Just then they rounded the corner to \n     come up the driveway and they were holding hands.\n       A couple of years ago, the four of us spent three weeks in \n     the UK. Our first week in London, Alan was occupied with \n     meetings and a quick turn-around to Geneva, but the final two \n     weeks we toured the countryside with no particular itinerary \n     except to visit some relatives in Scotland and the grave of \n     Rob Roy MacGregor, an ancestor who Alan's middle name is \n     from. We also visited the graves of Alan and RE's great-\n     grandparents six generations back, whose tombstones were \n     leaning together and touching. Each evening before dinner, \n     Alan would tell Evan a story, some lasting forty-five \n     minutes. In the parlor of one bed and breakfast where we \n     stayed for three nights, other guests would join in to listen \n     and ask if they could come the next night to hear the \n     stories, they were that good.\n       One of the most important, and I believe, reassuring \n     lessons that we can take from Alan's life is that we do not \n     have to be limited in our later years. When we tell people \n     that Alan never retired, he never stopped working, they do \n     not really hear that. The truth is that he was the most \n     disciplined, diligent, and determined person I have ever met. \n     He was also still making friends with and inspiring young \n     people. Two such friends, a man in his thirties and a woman \n     in her forties, touched us with their expressions of personal \n     grief following Alan's death. The young men in their twenties \n     who work with Alan's Global Security Institute, Patrick Neal, \n     Zack Allen, and Tyler Stevenson, are bright and motivated and \n     will do great things in their own lives with memories of \n     Alan staying with them. Don't we all wish for a life of \n     impact and meaning and a quick, painless end surrounded by \n     those we love? He did most everything right!\n       I can, of course, remember a difficult time in Alan's \n     career. At the time I was in an elected position also, so I \n     was very interested in how he was handling it. As I watched \n     what was happening to him, I asked him, ``Alan, how can you \n     bear this?'' He answered, ``Colette, there are politics in \n     the locker room, the boardroom and the United States Senate. \n     Since you have to put up with them wherever you are, I want \n     to be in the Senate, where the politics are intense, but I \n     can get the most done.''\n       Over Thanksgiving, Alan and his sister took a week's \n     vacation together. He was working to finish his book on \n     sovereignty rather than just relaxing by the pool and she \n     said, ``you work too hard''. He replied, ``I want to stagger \n     across the finish line knowing I've done all I possibly \n     can!'' He did not stagger, he was still sprinting!\n       I want to close with a message from our seven-year-old \n     daughter, Evan. Her Brownie\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\n     troop leader read a story about loss that she said helped \n     her. It was about a badger who was the oldest and wisest \n     member of a community of animals. He knew that because of his \n     age, he might die soon. Dying meant only that he would leave \n     his body behind, and as his body didn't work as well as when \n     he was young, he wasn't too concerned about that. His only \n     worry was how his family and friends would feel. He died \n     before the start of a winter and the animals were very sad. \n     But as they thought about him they realized he had given them \n     each something to treasure: a parting gift of a skill or \n     piece of knowledge. Evan said, ``Didn't Gran help lots of \n     people and do lots of things to make the world better?'' I \n     said, ``Yes, he left behind countless parting gifts for all \n     of us to never forget!''\n       Kim Cranston. Thank you all for being here today to \n     celebrate Alan's life--yes, I too called him Alan.\n       In the program for this ceremony is the observation of the \n     Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu that Alan carried in his pocket \n     most of his life as a guide to the style of leadership he \n     practiced. It begins by observing that leaders are best when \n     people barely know that they exist, and concludes by \n     observing that of the best leader, when his work is done and \n     his aim fulfilled, the people will all say, ``we did this \n     ourselves.''\n       In the world of modern politics in which name recognition \n     is so important, this approach to leadership presented an \n     interesting paradox for Alan, which is also present today as \n     we celebrate the accomplishments of his life.\n       I understand, however, that there is a little known \n     addendum to Lao-Tzu's observation that states that ``after \n     such a leader has passed on, people will join together to \n     mourn their loss, celebrate their accomplishments, and \n     recommit to the causes they shared.'' I welcome you here \n     today in that spirit.\n       Alan touched many people's lives in many different ways. We \n     all have stories we can tell about times we spent and things \n     we did with Alan to make the world a better place. This \n     afternoon we have time for just a few of Alan's friends and \n     collaborators to share some of their stories with us. I want \n     to invite each of you to join us after this ceremony at the \n     reception at the Fairmont Hotel where, in addition to having \n     the opportunity to catch up, laugh, and cry, there will be \n     video cameras so each of you can take a moment if you'd like \n     to tell your story.\n       My own story is simple. I was incredibly blessed to have \n     had Alan as a wonderful father, my dearest and oldest friend, \n     a treasured teacher and mentor, and an invaluable \n     collaborator and leader in addressing the great challenges of \n     our time.\n       It is almost unbearable for me to think we will never again \n     in this life share another meal, or football game, or joke or \n     prank, or afternoon discussing strategy.\n       I learned many, many things from Alan. Five stand out \n     today.\n       First, I learned about the subtle, profound power of the \n     style of leadership he practiced. In the past few days it's \n     been very enriching for me to reflect on Lao-Tzu's \n     observation of leadership and everything that Alan helped us \n     accomplish in his lifetime.\n       Second, I learned that the greatest meaning in life is \n     found in making the world a better place. As one of Alan's \n     heroes, Martin Luther King, Jr., observed ``Life's most \n     persistent and urgent question is ``What are you doing for \n     others?''\n       Third, I learned something Alan understood early on: We \n     live in one of the most extraordinary moments in human \n     history. In our lifetimes, for the first time since humans \n     have inhabited the earth, we have developed the capacity to \n     destroy human and perhaps all known life in the universe \n     forever, either through a sudden nuclear holocaust or the \n     more gradual destruction of the environment. Simultaneously, \n     we are developing the capacity to create sustainable and \n     economically just societies.\n       What those of us alive now do together may well determine \n     which of these two paths we take, and could help decide the \n     fate of the human race. There exists a small window of \n     opportunity for us to act. A window of opportunity that may \n     well not exist for the generations of our children or their \n     children. If humanity is to continue, if we are to prosper \n     rather than perish, we must transform our society and develop \n     effective approaches to resolve those challenges that we \n     share and can only address at the global level. This is the \n     task before our generation and it was to that end that Alan \n     devoted most of his working life.\n       The fourth lesson is that in view of all this it is \n     important to keep a sense of humor. Colette told me she'd \n     recently spoken with Alan about something someone had done \n     that affected them both, which she found very disturbing. \n     Colette asked Alan why it didn't seem to bother him as much \n     and he replied: ``I find that in situations like this I can \n     choose to be either terrified or amused.''\n       And the fifth lesson is to be compassionate to our fellow \n     living beings.\n       Of course, I learned a great deal more from Alan, but these \n     are the lessons foremost in my mind today.\n       While to many people Alan seemed a whirlwind of activity, \n     he was also a voracious reader and a prolific writer.\n       In 1945, he published ``The Killing of the Peace,'' which \n     detailed how a small group of people defeated Woodrow \n     Wilson's campaign to create the League of Nations to address \n     the global challenges we face, and which the New York Times \n     called one of the ten most important books of the year.\n       And just a few days before he passed on, Alan completed a \n     book--``The Sovereignty Revolution'' that begins with the \n     following passage:\n       It is worshiped like a god, and as little understood.\n       It is the cause of untold strife and bloodshed. Genocide is \n     perpetrated in its sacred name.\n       It is at once a source of power and of power's abuse, of \n     order and of anarchy. It can be noble and it can be shameful.\n       It is sovereignty.\n       I commend this book to you all and I'm happy to announce \n     today it will soon be available through, among other places, \n     the web site for the Global Security Institute \n     (www.gsinstitute.org), the nonprofit organization Alan \n     recently founded to advance his work to abolish nuclear \n     weapons and advance global security.\n       While we all miss Alan, we can take solace in knowing that \n     he fulfilled the purpose of making a difference with his life \n     and leaving the world a better place.\n       In closing, I want to thank you again for being here to \n     mourn the loss we all share, celebrate what we've \n     accomplished, and recommit to the causes that brought us \n     together. As Alan would say at the end of nearly all of his \n     speeches, I thank you for all you are doing and urge you \n     onward.\n       Thank you.\n       Gray Davis, At first I want to express the deep condolences \n     of my wife Sharon and I to Eleanor Cameron, Alan's sister, to \n     Kim, Colette, and to the extended Cranston family.\n       My friends, we come here today not just to mourn Alan \n     Cranston, but to honor him. We're greatly saddened by his \n     passing, but we're grateful for his extraordinary life and \n     the rich legacy he left behind.\n       Alan was a native Californian who grew up to be an \n     extraordinary public servant. He had a sharp intellect, a \n     humility of spirit, and a quality of compassion that is rare \n     in life and rarer still in public life. He was an \n     extraordinary person. Yes, he was a pragmatist who understood \n     that progress was a long struggle for common ground. But he \n     was also an idealist who believed that violence anywhere was \n     a threat to freedom everywhere.\n       He reminded us that there is a moral force in this world \n     more powerful than the mightiest of nations or the force of \n     arms. And one by one, he tackled the great issues of our \n     time: World peace; arms control; veterans' health; \n     environment. One by one, he made a difference.\n       For those of you fortunate enough to spend some time in the \n     Golden Gate National Recreational Area or the Santa Monica \n     Mountains or the desert lands that he protected, you know \n     what a difference he made. Future generations will \n     acknowledge their debt of gratitude to Alan Cranston, and it \n     is most appropriate that we thank him today.\n       Alan was also a very good politician. He ran every race \n     with the same focus and intensity that he learned running the \n     hundred-yard dash back at Stanford. He was almost always the \n     underdog. Critics dismissed his chances, saying he lacked the \n     charisma to win. But Alan proved time and again that in this \n     state character, not charisma, is what people want most.\n       He became only the second Californian to be elected four \n     times to the United States Senate--Hiram Johnson being the \n     first. He became the patron saint of every candidate for \n     office inflicted with a charisma deficit, myself included. He \n     is my personal hero.\n       Alan may have lacked charisma, but he was enormously \n     resourceful. Eleanor tells in her book the story of Alan's \n     first race for Controller in 1958. Alan knew someone who had \n     a television show in Los Angeles. But the host of the show \n     reminded Alan he was contractually obligated to talk about \n     contact lenses. He couldn't mention he was a candidate for \n     office and under no circumstances could he say he was a \n     Democrat. But as I said before, Alan was very resourceful. So \n     he went on the show just a few days before his election and \n     he said, ``My name is Alan Cranston. I'm running up and down \n     the state making contacts and jumping in front of lenses. I \n     am Alan Cranston.'' The viewing audience didn't have a clue \n     what he was talking about. But he mentioned the name Alan \n     Cranston eight times. And even though he'd never been elected \n     to public office before, he was elected Controller of the \n     State of California. So Alan knew what he was talking about.\n       Finally my friends, Alan Cranston was part of the World War \n     II generation. A generation that Tom Brokaw has aptly \n     described as our ``Greatest Generation.'' A generation from \n     which much was asked and a great deal was given. A generation \n     that went to Europe and stood down Adolf Hitler's Nazi \n     regime, rescued the survivors of the Holocaust, and literally \n     saved democracy as we know it today.\n       It was a generation that came home with no expectation of \n     recognition and went about rebuilding a new America. A \n     generation that built roads, hospitals and businesses, and \n     paved the way for the digital economy, although most did not \n     live to enjoy it. A generation that did their duty, and then \n     came home.\n       God has called Alan Cranston home. I know God has blessed \n     his soul. I know God will give Alan enduring peace for which \n     he struggled his entire life to try and obtain for all the \n     peoples of the world. I ask you to say a prayer tonight for \n     Alan, his family and his loved ones.\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\n       It was my honor to lower the flag today in recognition of \n     his remarkable career, and it's my honor now to present it to \n     Kim and Colette. Thank you.\n       Joseph Biden. My name is Joe Biden. I served with Alan for \n     twenty of his twenty-four years in the Senate, but I consider \n     myself more a student of Alan's. Kim, Colette, Evan, I never \n     fully understood your father's tenacity, by the way, until I \n     heard the repeated emphasis on the middle name MacGregor. Now \n     I understand it better. Eleanor, my sister Valerie says it's \n     very difficult raising a brother; you obviously did well at \n     your chore.\n       I'm very grateful, and indeed privileged, for having the \n     honor of being here today to represent the US Senate and the \n     Senate Foreign Relations committee. It's a task that's well \n     beyond my capabilities, because the life we commemorate was \n     so extraordinary. To you, his family, to us, his colleagues \n     and friends, and to the people of this state and nation, \n     we're not likely to see anyone like Alan, anytime soon.\n       I can't help but think of American architect Daniel \n     Burnham's credo when I think of Alan. He said--\n       ``Make no little plans, they have no magic to stir men's \n     blood. Make big plans, aim high in hope and work, remembering \n     that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, \n     but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting \n     itself with ever-growing intensity.''\n       Intensity, big plans, no little plans, that was the Alan \n     Cranston that I knew. Most of us would consider it a \n     successful career if we did nothing other than be sued by \n     Adolf Hitler. But here's a fellow, a young man who came back \n     from Europe as a correspondent, who felt obliged to translate \n     accurately Mien Kampf, who felt obliged to begin a crusade to \n     expose Adolf Hitler. This is a fellow who didn't just decide \n     to help a little bit. I remember the lecture I got on redwood \n     forests. I had not seen one and did not know they had to be \n     preserved. This is a fellow who had no lesser aim than to \n     eliminate nuclear weapons in his time, to guarantee racial \n     equality, to provide durable, affordable housing. I know of \n     no man that I've served with in the Senate, and I've been \n     there twenty-eight years, who had as many intense interests \n     and contributed so much to so many different endeavors.\n       What accounted for that intensity that dominated Alan's \n     character? It used to baffle me until one day I figured it \n     out--it was Alan's integrity, his honesty, his inability to \n     rationalize to himself that he didn't have any responsibility \n     for this or that problem that he observed in this country.\n       Alan had an inner compass that would have plagued most of \n     us. He could spot injustice a mile away. He smelled hypocrisy \n     almost before he walked in the room. He knew what had to \n     be done, and he unfailingly did it, or at least attempted \n     to do it, usually before anyone else, and almost always at \n     some risk to himself. I think integrity, political \n     integrity, personal integrity, is doing what you know to \n     be right even when you know it's likely not to benefit \n     you. Alan was one of the few people I served with who \n     never, never wondered whether he should act based on \n     whether what he was about to do was popular.\n       Alan MacGregor Cranston, born in 1914. He was almost thirty \n     years my senior, yet he was one of the youngest people I have \n     ever known and have ever served with.\n       It was not just that his policy priorities would fit under \n     the heading of progressive, although they would, but with \n     Senator Cranston, the senator from California, it was more \n     than that. There was what Robert Kennedy described as--\n       ``The qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of \n     mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a \n     predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for \n     adventure over the love of ease.''\n       We've all heard that quote a thousand times, but I can \n     think of none other that describes the Alan Cranston that I \n     worked with, although some of you knew him much more \n     intimately.\n       Alan's commitment to arms control, his passion for \n     environmental protection, his leadership in public housing \n     and transportation, women's rights, civil rights, civil \n     liberties, his concern for justice in immigration laws; those \n     efforts, those views had nothing to do with fashion, and \n     everything to do with conviction.\n       The Senator was not one for looking at a situation and \n     deciding what he believed, he knew exactly what he believed. \n     His public positions were not just what he said and what he \n     did, they were who Alan Cranston was.\n       The senator was armed with conviction, but he always knew \n     that wasn't enough. He was an athlete, after all, and \n     understood that it's not enough to have talent; that if you \n     want it to matter, you have to do something with it, and work \n     like hell at it.\n       Alan Cranston did work, and he worked at leadership. He \n     understood power, not as a reflection of status, but a tool \n     for a purpose, and he used it as well as any man or women \n     I've ever known.\n       In his 24 years in the Senate and the years since, Alan \n     Cranston pushed our consciousness and our conscience on every \n     issue of consequence, particularly nuclear weapons. He was \n     not just a powerful senator from California, not just an \n     influential member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \n     not just a democratic whip; he was truly a world leader on \n     nuclear policy. In China, in North Korea, in the Middle East, \n     they had to factor in Alan Cranston when they made their \n     decisions.\n       He was an internationalist in the great American tradition, \n     with an idealist's love of peace and a passion for freedom, \n     and he had a realist's understanding of the global balance of \n     power and simple human nature.\n       He had learned from history, he taught from history, but \n     kept his eye and his aim always on the future: the future of \n     the Philippines, the future of our relationship with Russia, \n     and what that would mean to the world, the future of our \n     natural resources, and the generation of Americans that we'll \n     never know.\n       Alan Cranston ran the hundred-yard dash in under ten \n     seconds when he was at Stanford, and I might add under twelve \n     and a half seconds when he was almost sixty years old. He was \n     consistent, and he was fast, in a hurry. I would suggest not \n     to reach the finish line, but to get to the next race, the \n     next test, the next opportunity, the next possibility, \n     always possibilities. The certainty of a redwood, the \n     spirit of a wild river, ``a predominance of courage over \n     timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of \n     ease.''\n       The playwright Sam Shepherd wrote, ``character is an \n     essential tendency. It can be covered up, it can be messed \n     with, it can be screwed around with, but it can't ultimately \n     be changed. It is the structure of our blood that runs \n     through our veins.'' Evan, you've got good blood, kid. It \n     runs through your veins.\n       Ted Turner (via video). I could not begin to say enough \n     about my dear friend Senator Cranston, so sorry he's passed \n     away. He has been an inspiration to me for a number of years, \n     no more so than in the area of weapons of mass destruction. \n     And even though he did not live to get to see the end and the \n     abolition of nuclear weapons from this world, there are a lot \n     of us that are going to continue his work, and I am one of \n     them. We're going to miss you very much, Senator. Thank you \n     very much.\n       Sally Lilienthal. Jonathan Schell wrote recently that Alan \n     Cranston has quietly done more than any other American to \n     marshal public will to abolish nuclear weapons. He brought \n     the issue of nuclear arms reductions and abolition to the \n     attention of business leaders, policy makers and cultural \n     figures--and most difficult of all, to retired generals and \n     admirals. And never by email--he didn't have it.\n       Our last endeavor together was a national campaign to \n     mobilize places of worship, which is gathering steam today in \n     Christian churches, Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques, and \n     which was originally housed and organized at the Washington \n     Cathedral in the nation's capital--The other cathedral.\n       Early last summer, two years of work came to fruition at an \n     ecumenical service where religious figures together with \n     former generals and admirals called for the reduction and \n     abolition of nuclear weapons. That started the ongoing \n     campaign, the nub of which was the statement Alan wrote and \n     rewrote to get it finally signed by eighteen retired admirals \n     and generals joining in with twenty-one religious figures \n     around the country. Alan was a marvelous writer and consensus \n     builder. It wasn't easy to sign up the top military figures \n     to reduce and finally abolish nuclear weapons, for abolition \n     is not part of Pentagon thinking. And besides less than four \n     years before he had traveled widely to recruit sixty-three \n     different internationally based generals and admirals to sign \n     another affirmation on the same subject. Let me read you two \n     short sentences from the statement signed by military and \n     church which is at the nub, one might say, of our ecumenical \n     campaign.\n       ``We say that a peace based on terror, a peace based upon \n     threats of inflicting annihilation and genocide upon whole \n     populations, is a peace that is corrupting--a peace that is \n     unworthy of civilization.''\n       And he went on to write: ``We say that it defies all logic \n     to believe that nuclear weapons could exist forever and never \n     be used. This nuclear predicament is untenable in the face of \n     a faith in the divine and unacceptable in terms of sound \n     military doctrine.''\n       Alan was always positive. I never saw him downhearted \n     during this laborious struggle to rid the world of nuclear \n     weapons. He was tireless in working toward our goal and he \n     never ever thought of failure. So he leaves us with an active \n     legacy--the most important legacy of all--that of hope, good \n     solid hope.\n       William Turnage. My name is Bill Turnage. I came to know--\n     and to love--Alan Cranston during my seven years in \n     Washington as President of the Wilderness Society. Kim \n     has asked me to talk about Alan's great work as an \n     environmentalist.\n       California--our golden state--has been twice-blessed by the \n     mountain gods.\n       We have been granted a land among earth's most sublime yet \n     diverse.\n       And we've been granted a few splendid champions to protect \n     that heritage.\n       In early days, farsighted San Franciscans like Thomas Starr \n     King and Frederick Billings came forward to protect the \n     Yosemite.\n       The idea of a national park was born at the time--perhaps \n     the best new idea our American democracy has ever had.\n       And these early champions enlisted a great Californian \n     photographer--Carleton Watkins--to make pictures that would \n     help persuade the Congress.\n       And their dream of a Yosemite park was first given shape \n     and form by America's greatest landscape architect, Frederick \n     Law Olmsted.\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\n       And when the Yosemite Sierra was threatened by hooved \n     locusts--and loggers--and miners--John Muir came forward and \n     founded the Sierra Club--and he protected the heart of the \n     High Sierra, the range of light.\n       And great Muir bequeathed the protection of the Yosemite to \n     his inheritor, San Francisco's native son, Ansel Adams.\n       They were two of the greatest environmental philosophs in \n     our nation's history.\n       And to turn their dreams into reality, California was \n     blessed with two of our nation's greatest environmental \n     legislators, Phil Burton and Alan Cranston.\n       And Alan and Ansel formed a very special friendship--a \n     friendship dedicated to saving wild California. Ansel wrote, \n     in his autobiography, ``I have known many great people in \n     California's history, spanning my 60 active years. But I have \n     never been in contact with a public official of such \n     integrity, imagination, concern and effectiveness as Alan \n     Cranston...I have found him to be a great leader, one who \n     transcends party politics for causes of essential human \n     importance.''\n       The honor roll of California's wild places Alan helped save \n     is too long to recite here; it encompassed our state from the \n     Oregon border redwoods to the Mojave desert in the south.\n       Perhaps Alan's most lasting contribution to our country's \n     future was his characteristically quiet, determined and \n     effective leadership of the long, arduous but ultimately \n     successful campaign to save the best of wild Alaska.\n       One hundred million acres--the size of the state of \n     California--preserved for all time. We simply could not have \n     done it without Alan's undaunted leadership.\n       And it could be said that Alan's most lasting contribution \n     to our golden state was his characteristically patient yet \n     visionary leadership of the long, arduous but ultimately \n     successful campaign to save the best of the great Californian \n     desert. We simply could not have done it without Alan's \n     undaunted leadership.\n       In 1994, when the Desert Protection Act was finally coming \n     to fruition in a Democratic presidency--and Alan had retired \n     from the Senate--I proposed, with Alan's consent, naming the \n     vast wilderness areas of Death Valley National Park--95% of \n     the largest park in the lower 48--``the Alan Cranston \n     Wilderness.''\n       Regrettably, the proposal was declined. Today--at this time \n     of remembrance and in this hallowed place--I would like to \n     again propose that we join together to ask the congress to \n     name this wilderness--now known simply as ``The Death Valley \n     Wilderness''--for our great friend and Senator. The honor, \n     like the wilderness he made possible, will last for all time.\n       James Hormel. My admiration for Alan Cranston began over a \n     half century ago, although he was not aware of it at the \n     time. The United Nations was four years old. The Iron Curtain \n     had fallen. Isolationists were urging the United States to \n     avoid international commitments. And President Truman was \n     moving--against that tide--to facilitate the economic revival \n     of western Europe.\n       In that climate, at the age of sixteen, I became a member \n     of a student chapter of the United World Federalists, which \n     was hailed by some as a major movement toward peaceful co-\n     existence and was excoriated by others--a very vocal \n     opposition--as a gathering of Communist sympathizers. Alan \n     had just become president of the organization. It was typical \n     of the many challenges which he so willingly took on during \n     the course of his long and productive life.\n       Alan already had taken on Adolph Hitler by publishing an \n     unexpurgated version of Mien Kampf. He already had served \n     during the Second World War both in the Office of War \n     Information and in the army. He would augment that service \n     during a long political career, including the resuscitation \n     of the Democratic party in California and the outstanding \n     twenty-four years during which he was a United States \n     Senator.\n       It was during his Senate years that we met and developed a \n     friendship which meant so much to me. I admired Alan's \n     courageous stands on conservation and social justice, and his \n     unswerving dedication to the peaceful resolution of conflicts \n     around the world. I discovered coincidentally that his \n     grandfather had built the house next door to mine, a fact \n     which underscored his California roots and his deep concerns \n     for the well-being of his California constituents. \n     Independently I met and became a friend of his son Kim, which \n     gave me a window into another dimension of Alan--Alan as \n     father.\n       One of Alan's last acts as a Senator was to write the \n     letters which started the long and arduous process of my \n     Ambassadorial appointment. Alan was instrumental not only in \n     beginning the process, but also in guiding me through many of \n     the minefields which lay in my path.\n       My memory of Alan is as a gentle giant. His goodness \n     radiated to all around him. He was a great leader--the very \n     embodiment of the highest level of leadership as described by \n     Lao-Tzu, whose words he carried with him as his life's \n     philosophy, as he sought quietly and selflessly to make this \n     planet a better place for all of us.\n       May we have the wisdom and courage to follow his example.\n       Harris Wofford. You may not know that in her last years \n     while still painting, Georgia O'Keefe wrote some still not \n     published short stories that she showed me. The one that \n     rises in my memory was about a man she met in her first days \n     in New Mexico. He invited her to see his ranch, three hundred \n     miles away, and one day she drove down (hiding her suitcase \n     in case she decided not to spend the night). She stayed \n     overnight and from time to time they would visit, doing very \n     prosaic things, sometimes just watching the horses he \n     trained, or walking over the land, or looking at the hills.\n       Five decades later she drove down to his ranch, maybe for \n     the last time, she thought. They sat a long time looking at \n     the hills and she found herself saying to herself with great \n     satisfaction: ``Fifty years of friendship with Richard.''\n       That's all the story said. Well, for me it's fifty-five \n     years of friendship with Alan. There was little--too little--\n     time just sitting and watching the hills. He was always on \n     the go, running sprints or long distance.\n       When we met just after World War II we were setting out on \n     no little prosaic mission--it was a crusade to make one world \n     a reality in a United Nations with the power to keep the \n     peace and prevent nuclear war. When we last met at his home \n     in Los Altos a year ago, his smile was still infectious \n     and he was still hard at work, in his irrepressible way, \n     on the same mission, persuading generals and admirals and \n     people of power to join in a new declaration for the \n     abolition of all nuclear weapons.\n       When I reread Eleanor's wonderful, perceptive, loving \n     biography of her brother, I realized how much our lives \n     intersected over the years and how much his life intersected \n     with the great issues of our time.\n       In 1948, Alan gave my wife Clare her first job directing \n     United World Federalists of Northern California. He caused \n     one of the greatest tensions in our half century of marriage \n     when he ran for President on the great central issue of \n     nuclear peace and asked me to be one of the three co-chairs \n     of his campaign with Marjorie Benton and Willie Brown. Clare \n     did not want me to do that. She loved, Alan but did not think \n     he could win, and thought it was the one time in our life \n     when I should stick to working as a lawyer and make some \n     money.\n       Like many who would rally to his quiet calls over the \n     years, I could not say ``no.'' In his sixty years of public \n     service Alan brought many people of different persuasions to \n     say ``yes'' and to work together for good things. One of \n     those times he played a key part in my appointment to the \n     U.S. Senate--which I like to think was a good thing.\n       Two days after Senator John Heinz died in an air crash, \n     Governor Casey asked me if I knew a particular major donor to \n     the Democratic Party and I said no. ``Then why did he write \n     me this extraordinary letter asking me to appoint you to the \n     Senate?'' Casey asked. I had no idea. That was the beginning \n     of a flood of different, well-done letters in the same vein, \n     from a range of significant people around the country. A few \n     days later Alan telephoned to tell me that as soon as he \n     heard the news of John Heinz's death he had gone to work on \n     the phone, producing those letters--which I'm sure influenced \n     Casey in my selection.\n       But the intersection of our lives began way back. From \n     Eleanor's book I realized that Alan's first journalistic \n     break was covering Mussolini in 1938, and that the speech he \n     heard in the Piazza de Venezia when Mussolini took Stalin out \n     of the League of Nations was the same one I heard in that \n     same square as a twelve-year-old boy. Alan's greatest \n     adventure in journalism was getting into Ethiopia for some \n     months after the Italian invasion. One of my greatest \n     adventures was going to Ethiopia with my family, in the Peace \n     Corps.\n       Before we met, each of us had written a book, in 1945, \n     calling for a world union to keep the peace. Alan's was the \n     powerful story of how isolationism in the Senate had killed \n     the peace after World War I. It was a sign of his \n     determination to go to the Senate to see that this did not \n     happen again.\n       Despite all the help that Alan gave me in my election \n     campaigns--and Joe Biden and John Kerry who are here--my \n     tenure in the Senate was very short. His was very long--and \n     great.\n       By my count only Ted Kennedy, in this century, rivals Alan \n     in legislative accomplishments. Alan's mark was on a thousand \n     bills and countless votes, large and small, where his \n     coalition-building skill was the key to success.\n       Like Lincoln, Alan Cranston truly believed that the better \n     angels of our nature can be brought forth in this land. He \n     did not discount the demons and distractions in the way, but \n     he demonstrated that politics is not only the art of the \n     possible--it is the only way to make reason rule.\n       It was our good luck--the good luck so many of us here and \n     around the country--to have had these many years of \n     friendship with Alan Cranston.\n       Jane Goodall (via video). I'm tremendously honored to have \n     been asked to take part in the memorial to someone I admired \n     so much as Alan Cranston. My body is far away in Africa but I \n     want you to know that my thoughts are with you now.\n       I never got a chance to know Alan really well in life \n     because our paths didn't cross that often. But what I saw I \n     loved, and like everyone, I admired Alan so much for his \n     integrity and his sincerity and his determination to try and \n     rid the world of the most evil weapons of mass destruction \n     that we ever created, and Alan did so much to alert people to \n     the hidden dangers of these weapons stockpiled around the \n     world.\n       And we shall miss his leadership most terribly, but his \n     spirit is still around, still with\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\n     us, guiding us, encouraging us, and above all, joining us \n     together so that we can move confidently towards the goal \n     that he was setting, and make this world a safer place for \n     his grandchildren and ours and the children yet unborn. Thank \n     you, Alan, for being who you were. Thank you.\n       Cruz Reynoso. I once read that `The most powerful weapon on \n     earth is the human soul on fire.'\n       Alan's soul was always on fire for the welfare of those in \n     need, for the strength of our democracy, for human dignity, \n     and for a world at peace.\n       It must have been 1959 or 1960 when my wife and I, with \n     others from the El Centro Democratic Club from Imperial \n     Valley (the center of the world) traveled to Fresno for the \n     annual convention of the CDC, Council of Democratic Clubs. A \n     featured speaker was Alan Cranston. To this day, I remember \n     being inspired--he spoke of the role of government in helping \n     the disadvantaged, of the need for economic democracy, of the \n     right we all have in equal protection and fairness, and \n     government's responsibility in protecting those rights, and \n     of our responsibility to be active participants. That a \n     person with his soul on fire for those ideals I held dear \n     could actually be elected to state wide office was, to me, a \n     marvel and inspiration. I never forgot.\n       A decade later I found myself as director of California \n     Rural Legal Assistance. CRLA was the leading legal services \n     for the poor. Many entrenched interests, including the state \n     government, found themselves on the loosing side of many \n     lawsuits CRLA brought on behalf of its clients--farmworkers, \n     Medical recipients, working poor. Those interests fought \n     back. Alan worked closely with CRLA to protect our \n     professional independence and assure our continued existence. \n     As I saw it, there was little political gain for Alan--it was \n     his devotion to fairness and to the concept of human dignity \n     that brought us together. Eventually, it was President Nixon \n     who overrode the state veto of CRLA, thereby saving legal \n     services.\n       And years later Alan's son, Kim, I and countless others \n     joined Alan in our mutual efforts to register thousands of \n     new voters, an effort to include all in our democratic \n     society.\n       Not all efforts were on a grand scale. My last, and still \n     ongoing task, has been to represent a prisoner who is in \n     Soledad for a life term. Alan was convinced that the prisoner \n     was fully rehabilitated. He called to see if I could help. My \n     associate, Tom Gray, and I worked with Alan. We will \n     continue.\n       Not all was work. I remember those wonderful conversations \n     as we dined in the Senate restaurant. Once, Alan invited me \n     to a marvelous San Francisco eatery. At the end of the \n     evening Alan invited me to join his Washington, D.C. office \n     in a position of considerable responsibility. Unfortunately, \n     I could not accept the offer, but the food had been great.\n       Alan's interest went beyond prison walls or the fifty \n     United States. His efforts have sought peace for this globe. \n     John Amos Gomenius, the Czech Religious and Educational \n     leader wrote about 350 years ago:\n       ``We are all citizens of one world, we are all of one \n     blood. To hate a man because he was born in another country, \n     he speaks a different language, or because he takes a \n     different view on this subject or that, is a great folly . . \n     . Let us have one end in view, the welfare of humanity.''\n       Alan's soul was always on fire--for the welfare of an \n     individual human being--or the welfare of all humanity.\n       Jonathan Granoff. My name is Jonathan Granoff. I've had the \n     privilege of working with Senator Cranston on the abolition \n     of nuclear weapons with Lawyer's Alliance for World Security, \n     with the State of the World Forum, with the Middle Powers \n     Initiative, and most recently, with the Global Security \n     Institute.\n       Recently, some journalists from Japan were here in the \n     beginning of December interviewing Senator Cranston, and I \n     was there, and they asked me what I did as the CEO of the \n     Global Security Institute. So I said, and I meant this, when \n     a tree is ripe with fruit, an intelligent person will sit \n     beneath the tree and gather the sweet fruit. Alan is still \n     giving us fruit. And Alan's example of being a true human \n     being is the sweetest fruit that we could be given, because \n     Alan taught by seamlessly integrating the highest human \n     values with his daily life.\n       He exemplified decency and elegance in action. He lived \n     without prejudice. People say they live without prejudice; \n     Alan didn't say it, he just lived it. He didn't harbor any \n     doubts or suspicions about others, he never engaged in \n     backbiting or any pettiness, and he was tranquil in the midst \n     of an extraordinary dynamism, like a smooth, powerful river.\n       He was full of grace. Alan Cranston remains for us a \n     statesman in a state of grace. His grace was exemplified in \n     the ease he had in the midst of conflict, because that ease \n     rested on a real faith in the intrinsic goodness of humanity. \n     Because he had found that goodness in himself, and for those \n     of us who had the privilege of working with him, we know \n     that's how he got us to do things, because we knew that he \n     never asked anybody to do anything he wouldn't do; he's the \n     guy who would be up at two in the morning, and then up again \n     at six-thirty.\n       Adversaries were only so as to the issue at hand, but never \n     as to the person, because Alan honored everyone. His inner \n     clarity and strength was coupled with this unique ability, \n     and even desire, to hear everyone's point of view, not as a \n     political ruse, but because Alan honored everyone.\n       Alan understood fully two icons his parents did not have \n     that we inherited from the Twentieth Century. The first is \n     the awesome, horrific mushroom cloud arising from science and \n     the quest for unbridled power, unreined by morality, law and \n     reason, and the other icon is the picture of the planet from \n     outer space, borderless, majestic, alive and sacred.\n       Alan honored all life by holding the second icon before \n     him, and that is why he focused most intensely on the nuclear \n     issue, because that and that alone can end all life on the \n     planet, and it becomes the moral standard of our \n     civilization. I had the privilege of traveling with Alan and \n     going all over the world working on this issue, and one of \n     the amazing things is I would forget how old he was, because \n     his body got old, but he didn't. He had found that secret of \n     the joyous heart, he had found that place of tranquility in \n     action.\n       George Crile is a CNN and 60 Minutes producer, beloved, \n     very beloved of Alan, and he has put together some footage to \n     give us all a sense of what it's like to be on the road with \n     Alan Cranston.\n       [video insert]\n       Death is such a mystery, and the only comfort is the love \n     that we bring to our lives, and the faithfulness with which \n     we carry forth the mission that great men have given us. \n     Alan, we will follow in your loving memory. We will stay the \n     course. We will be vigilant until nuclear weapons are \n     abolished.\n       We are guided by the philosophy that you held with you.\n       Lao-Tzu:\n       A leader is best\n       When people barely know\n       That he exists,\n       Less good when\n       They obey and acclaim him,\n       Worse when\n       They fear and despise him.\n       Fail to honor people\n       And they fail to honor you.\n       But of a good leader,\n       When his work is done,\n       His aim fulfilled,\n       They will all say,\n       ``We did this ourselves.''\n       Senator Cranston sought no honor for himself. He honored \n     life itself through his service. Together and with your help, \n     we will follow in his large footsteps, and on the day when \n     the work is done, the aim fulfilled, we will know that we did \n     not do it alone. Thank you, Alan. May God give you infinite \n     peace, infinite bliss, infinite love, Amen.\n       Alan Jones. We've come to the end of a deeply felt tribute \n     to a great soul. And any celebration of a great soul \n     confronts us with choices. And so I offer this final \n     blessing.\n       There are only two feelings. Love, and fear.

Mr. President, there has been much talk by the President \nand other members of the Administration about developing a \ncomprehensive energy strategy that will help avert national supply \nshortages and protect the environment.\n  I hope we'll all work together on a balanced approach. That is a \nlaudable goal. However, it seems the Administration may already have \nbegun backpedaling or backsliding away from the bipartisan rhetoric and \nthe environmental gains that we've recently made.\n  One matter, in particular, bothers me. That is the subject of dirty \ndiesels and the recently issued EPA rules to clean up that source of \npollution.\n  I would like to put in the Record a copy of a letter that I have just \nreceived from a broad coalition of groups that is concerned about the \nfate of this rule. They fear that the rule and its benefits to the \npublic's health may be delayed or even withdrawn entirely. It's an \nimpressive group that the Administration should heed.\n  I understand that the Administrator is considering acting to delay \nthe implementation of the final rule to cut down on emissions from \nheavy-duty diesel engines and reduce sulfur in diesel fuel. In addition \nto the fact that this potential action and others already taken by \nagencies to delay recently issued rules to protect the environment do \nnot appear to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, it's just \nplain bad policy.\n  On December 18, 2000, EPA promulgated a final rule that mandates a 97 \npercent reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel by September \n2006, from\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\napproximately 300 to 15 parts per million.\n  The rule also requires that diesel engines emissions get much \ncleaner. They must reduce particulate matter and nitrogen oxide \nemissions by 90 and 95 percent, respectively, from today's levels. As a \nresult, diesel vehicles will finally be on par with emissions from \ngasoline vehicles.\n  The public health and environmental benefits from this rule will be \ntremendous. Quantified benefits are expected to total $70.3 billion by \n2030 when the new, cleaner fleet of vehicles is fully phased in. This \nrule means fewer hospital admissions, probably less lung cancer, and \nmajor reductions in other respiratory illnesses and premature deaths.\n  I don't begrudge the Administration time to review existing laws and \nregulatory requirements. But, there is a legal and substantive process \nto be followed, not a political one. This rule has already been through \nthat wringer and should not be further delayed.\n  Thus far, we have been willing to work with the President on his \nnominees and have not delayed their confirmations unduly. Now it is \ntime for the Administration to reciprocate. Administration actions to \ndelay rules with major public health and environmental benefits will \npollute that atmosphere of good will.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 8, 2001.\n     Hon. Christine Todd Whitman,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Administrator Whitman: We, the undersigned, represent \n     an unusually diverse coalition of groups united in our strong \n     support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \n     December 21, 2000 final rulemaking that sets onroad heavy-\n     duty diesel emission and fuel standards. Together, we write \n     to you today to urge that this extremely important regulation \n     be upheld, intact.\n       The rulemaking process that produced this regulation was \n     not only extensive, it was thoughtful and inclusive. We are \n     very pleased that the result is a comprehensive program that \n     most responsibly takes full advantage of the opportunity to \n     reduce a wide variety of diesel emissions by applying a \n     systems approach that sets aggressive engine standards and, \n     necessarily, a commensurately low cap on sulfur in diesel \n     fuel. The framework established under this rule which \n     includes a particulate matter standard of 0.01 grams per \n     brake horsepower-hour (g/bhp-hr) to take full effect in 2007, \n     a nitrogen oxide standard of 0.20 g/bhp-hr to be phased in \n     between 2007 and 2010 and a national cap on sulfur in diesel \n     fuel of 15 parts per million, to take effect June 1, 2006 \n     represents a critical and delicate balance that will help \n     enable the successful achievement of a 90-percent reduction \n     in particulate matter emissions, a 95-percent reduction in \n     nitrogen oxide emissions and a 97-percent reduction in levels \n     of sulfur in highway diesel fuel. These reductions will \n     translate into enormous public health and environmental \n     benefits all across the nation.\n       We are proud to have contributed to the open process that \n     led to this landmark rule and equally proud, and supportive, \n     of the result. Each of us now looks forward to doing our \n     respective part to implement the important programs that have \n     been established, so that our nation can begin to reap the \n     benefits on schedule. To this end, we urge you not to allow \n     this rule to be delayed or, in any way, compromised. Rather, \n     we look to you to ensure that the rule will be upheld, \n     intact. In addition, we request an opportunity to meet with \n     you at your earliest convenience to discuss the vital \n     importance of this rule to our respective organizations.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers; American Lung \n           Association; Association of International Automobile \n           Manufacturers; Association of Local Air Pollution \n           Control Officials; California Trucking Association; \n           Clean Air Network; International Truck and Engine \n           Corporation; Manufacturers of Emission Controls \n           Association; Natural Resources Defense Council; \n           Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management; \n           Sierra Club; State and Territorial Air Pollution \n           Program Administrators; U.S. Public Interest Research \n           Group; and Union of Concerned Scientists.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern regarding \nthe possibility that the Bush administration will delay the effective \ndate of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's December 21, 2000 \nfinal rulemaking that sets onroad heavy-duty diesel emission and fuel \nstandards--also known as the diesel/sulfur rule.\n  This rule, the result of years of work and negotiations, would \nprovide essential protections for the public health and the environment \nby drastically reducing emissions from diesel engines. It is sorely \nneeded. Heavy-duty vehicles are significant contributors to elevated \nlevels of ozone, fine particulate matter, and the primary emissions of \nseveral key toxic air pollutants, particularly in the Northeast. \nTogether, highway and non-road heavy-duty engines are responsible for \nroughly 33 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions, 75 percent of motor \nvehicle related PM, and 60 percent of aldehyde emissions in the \nnortheast corridor. In addition to fouling our air, diesel exhaust has \nalso been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the National \nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the International \nAgency for Research of Cancer and the US EPA.\n  This rule will greatly reduce the health and environmental risks \nresulting from these pollutants, with a projected 90-percent reduction \nin particulate matter emissions, a 95-percent reduction in nitrogen \noxide emissions and a 97-percent reduction in levels of sulfur in \nhighway diesel fuel. In particular, the rule would bring badly needed \nrelief to my home state of Connecticut, and to the Northeast in \ngeneral, which need to drastically reduce both nitrogen oxides and \nvolatile organic compounds in order to fulfill the requirements of \ntheir state implementation plans.\n  In light of the environmental and health benefits of the rule, I \nwould be troubled if the administration were to consider modifying the \nrule without providing the essential due process and thoughtful \nconsideration required by the Administrative Procedure Act. The \neffective date of a rule is an integral part of the rule, and the \nAdministration must not cut corners when considering changing that \ndate. Legal requirements aside, I think it is critical for the \nAdministration to consider the voices of the public--whose health and \nenvironment are at stake with this rule-making as well as the affected \nindustry before changing the effective date or instituting any other \nchanges to the rule.\n  In that vein, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit the \nattached letter to be printed in the Record, signed by a broad \ncoalition of industry, public interest groups, and regulators, which \ncalls upon US EPA Administrator to implement the diesel/sulfur rule \nwithout delay or alteration.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 8, 2001.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, today I rise to voice my support of \nSenator Kennedy's effort to restore the minimum wage. The Fair Minimum \nWage Act of 2001 would raise the minimum wage by $1.50 in three \nincremental steps, benefitting over 11 million workers. We owe a pay \nraise to the hard-working Americans who would be affected by a minimum \nwage increase. To do so would demonstrate the real value of their hard \nwork.\n  Care givers in our preschools and nursing homes, service workers in \nour retail and restaurant industries, the domestic workers in our homes \nand offices--these are the real people upon whom each of us relies \nevery day. These are the workers who deserve to have their wages \nrestored to a level that will afford them a reasonable standard of \nliving.\n  In West Virginia alone, over one-fifth of our workers will directly \nbenefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum hourly wage. This would \nmean an increase of almost $3,000 a year for full-time workers. In more \nconcrete terms, this translates into more than a year of groceries, \nrent for seven months, seventeen months of utility bills, or a year of \ntuition at a two-year college. Currently, a full-time minimum wage \nearner with two children may be faced with difficult decisions when \ntrying to both feed and clothe her children. We need to make sure that \na mother or father who works forty hours a week does not have to decide \nbetween groceries for the family and paying the electric bill.\n  Ultimately, we must acknowledge that the minimum wage standard has \nbeen allowed to slowly erode over the past thirty years. At present, \nthe $5.15 hourly minimum has reached its lowest purchasing power in two \ndecades, which has aggravated problems for the working poor. Today, the \nreal value of the minimum wage is $2.90 below what it was in 1968. As \nour country continues to make unprecedented economic gains, this is \nsimply unacceptable. We have an obligation to the working families in \nWest Virginia, and across the Nation, to raise the minimum wage to a \nlevel that will lift them out of the day-to-day struggle of meeting \ntheir most basic needs.\n  I believe that raising the minimum wage over the next two years is \nessential to help families and to reinforce the fundamental American \nvalues of hard work and self-sufficiency. The goal of the country's \nminimum wage is to ensure that working Americans earn a living wage \nthat makes work a truly better choice than welfare or other public \nassistance. The fact that 70 percent of workers earning minimum wage \nare adults over the age of twenty, that 60 percent are women, and that \nnearly half have full-time jobs means that this is an issue central to \nmillions of hard-working families in our country. In West Virginia \nalone, almost 14 percent of our work force earn at the minimum wage, \nand our state has one of the largest populations of workers receiving \nthe minimum wage. I am proud to join Senator Kennedy and my colleagues \nto work together to enact this essential bill for working Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1215-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation \nwhich I hope is the first of several steps taken by Congress to correct \na terrible injustice currently imposed on seniors who have worked hard \nall of their lives and are receiving Social Security benefits.\n  Many people do not realize that, after they have paid Social Security \ntaxes throughout their work careers, up to 50 percent or 85 percent of \nthe monthly benefit they receive from Social Security may be taxed \nagain.\n  Prior to 1993, up to 50 percent of Social Security benefits were \ntaxable for individuals with incomes above $25,000, and couples with \nincomes above $32,000. In 1993, after President Clinton raised the \nportion of Social Security benefits which are taxable up to 85 percent \nfor individuals with incomes over $34,000, and couples with income over \n$44,000.\n  President Clinton's 1993 tax increase on senior citizens made a bad \npolicy even worse. Essentially, this graduated tax scheme penalizes \nseniors with fixed incomes who have worked hard to ensure their \nretirement security.\n  S. 237, the Social Security Benefits Tax Relief Act, which I have \nintroduced along with my colleagues, Senators Cochran, Frist, Inhofe, \nLott, Murkowski and Warner, would repeal the 1993 Clinton tax increase \non Social Security benefits and rolls the tax levels back to their pre-\n1993 levels.\n  By eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits, we will \nallow seniors to have more money to pay for prescription drugs, medical \ncare, housing and food. This legislation provides greater tax fairness \nfor increasing numbers of middle-income seniors.\n  It is widely agreed that Social Security was never intended to be the \nsole source of income for retirees. In light of Social Security's \nfinancial troubles, now is the time to remove disincentives for those \nwho wish to save and plan early for their retirement. Hopefully, this \nlegislation is a first step toward the repeal of all taxes on Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to provide tax relief to seniors \nby passing this important legislation and by examining ways to make the \nsystem as fair as possible for all beneficiaries who have paid into the \nsystem and who may or may not be subject to taxes on their benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1215-4", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1215-S1216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Sunday, February 11, 2001, Americans of \nLithuanian descent will be gathering, in my home State of Michigan, to \ncelebrate the 83rd anniversary of Lithuanian Independence.\n  Given the Lithuanian people's long history of successfully preserving \nand maintaining their culture and identity, there is reason for all \nthose of Lithuanian descent to be proud. Such an achievement stands as \nan inspiration for people everywhere.\n  The Lithuanian people have long refused to be placed under the yoke \nof oppression. They became independent in 1918, fought the Nazis during \nthe Second World War and refused to lose hope during many years of \nSoviet rule. Reflecting on these trials can be cause for great sadness \nbut also much hope.\n  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuania has experienced \nnearly eleven years of democracy and free markets. The Lithuanian \npeople are to be commended for the significant steps they taken to \nensure Lithuania's place in the free world. In 1999, I had the \nopportunity to meet with President Valdas Adamkus, and discuss many \nissues facing both our nations. Many of my colleagues may not know \nthis, but so great is President Adamkus' love for\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nhis ancestral homeland that he returned to Lithuania to run for \nPresident after a successful career in the United States, including \nservice as an official in the States Environmental Protection Agency.\n  In its efforts to reform, Lithuania has placed a premium on joining \nthe European Union, EU, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nNATO. Sound monetary policy and a stable currency have given Lithuania \nthe framework for economic growth and prosperity. On the security \nfront, Lithuania was the first member of the former Soviet Union to \nparticipate in the Partnership for Peace. The Partnership for Peace is \nan important program where the United States and its NATO allies work \nwith former Warsaw Pact nations on common security measures.\n  At this time when we honor Lithuania's independence, it is only \nfitting that we laud the extraordinary advances made by the Lithuanian \npeople. I know my Senate colleagues join me in saluting the Lithuanian \npeople for their tremendous courage in promoting participatory \ndemocracy and free markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1216-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as Congress considers President Bush's \ncomprehensive tax relief plan in the coming weeks, I sincerely hope \nthat we will examine ways to make the tax system more equitable to \nsmall business.\n  As we look at the economic indicators, it is clear that the economy \ncould use a boost. One way we can do this is to encourage the further \ngrowth and success of small businesses, which for decades have been the \ncornerstone of our growing economy.\n  A proposal I would like my colleagues to seriously consider is the \nSmall Business Tax Relief Act of 2001, which I introduced last week.\n  Small businesses owners generally have restricted cash flow, as well \nas limited access to credit. Funds are not readily available to invest \nin new equipment that may be needed to operate the business \neffectively.\n  Small businesses need to be allowed to expense a significant portion \nif not all of the costs for new equipment purchases in the year the \npurchase was made, rather than depreciating it over many years, which \nfrees up necessary capital to make necessary investments and \nimprovements.\n  Specifically, the Small Business Tax Fairness Act provides small \nbusinesses relief from an outdated rule that currently only allows a \nbusiness to expense $24,000 per year for new or used equipment. S. 236 \nproposes two key changes to the equipment expensing rule that will ease \nthe cost on small businesses when necessary updates are needed in their \nfacilities:\n\n       The bill increases the current $24,000 allowable equipment \n     expensing amount to $100,000; and\n       It increases the cap beyond which limits the equipment \n     expense deduction from $200,000 to $400,000.\n  Another important provision of this legislation directly impacts \nsmall businesses which are restaurants or franchises. Because \nrestaurants find themselves at a competitive disadvantage with other \nbusinesses, such as convenience stores, which are allowed a 15-year \ndepreciable life, the Small Business Tax Fairness Act would allow \nrestaurants to depreciate the cost of their original building, and any \nsubsequent renovations or improvements to the building, at a same rate \nof 15 years, instead of the current depreciation schedule of 39 years.\n  Unlike other commercial buildings, restaurant buildings are \nspecialized, single-purpose structures that are rarely converted to \nnon-restaurant use. Restaurants also experience considerably more \ntraffic, and remain open longer than most retail buildings. This daily \nassault causes rapid deterioration of restaurant properties, and forces \nrestauranteurs to constantly repair and upgrade their buildings.\n  Because restaurant facilities do have a much shorter life span than \nother commercial establishments, this bill would alleviate the punitive \ndepreciation schedule for restaurants that currently exists.\n  Similarly, most franchise contracts cover a span of 15 or 20 years. \nBy reducing the depreciation period from 39 to 15 years for franchise \nand restaurant properties, this legislation more accurately reflects \nthe true economic life of the properties.\n  S. 236 is supported by the International Franchise Association, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the National Association \nof Women Business Owners, and the National Restaurant Association. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1216-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1216-S1217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      INTERNET NON-DISCRIMINATION AND SALES TAX SIMPLIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to add my support to promoting \nelectronic commerce and keeping it free from discriminatory and \nmultiple state and local taxes. I am pleased to join the senior senator \nfrom Oregon as an original cosponsor of the Internet Non-Discrimination \nand Sales Tax Simplification Act. I commend Senator Wyden for his \ncontinued leadership on Internet tax policy.\n  The Internet has changed the way we do business. Today, businesses \ncan sell their goods and services all over the world in the blink of an \neye. E-commerce has created new markets, new efficiencies and new \nproducts. In fact, retail revenues from electronic commerce grew from \n$13 billion in 1999 to $26 billion in 2000. Retail sales are expected \nto continue to grow on the Internet to $178 billion in 2005.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home \nstate of Vermont. Today, hundreds of Vermont businesses are doing \nbusiness on the Internet, ranging from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company \nto Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream.\n  Let me just give you a few examples of Cyberselling in Vermont:\n  The New York Times recently profiled Buch Spieler, a Montpelier music \nstore, as a shining example of the power of the Internet to boast sales \nand change the way many local stores do business. According to Fred \nWilber, who has been running Buch Spieler for the past 27 years, \noverall sales has jumped by 10 percent and its customer base has \nexpanded by 20 percent in the 18 months since he took his business \nonline.\n  Gardeners Supply Company of Burlington opened its web site five years \nago to accompany its catalog of environmentally-sound products. With an \naverage annual growth rate of about 150 percent, Gardeners now sells \nmore than $10 million worth on products online.\n  Pompanoosuc Mills, a furniture company in Thetford, has been online \nfor about two years. In its first year, the company made about $1,300 a \nweek from Internet-related sales. By its second year, online sales had \ntripled to $4,000 a week.\n  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, based in Waterbury, went on the web \nto gain more direct access to consumers since its coffee business was \nabout 95 percent wholesale. Today, Green Mountain has doubled its \nretail sales through the Internet.\n  And Burr Morse, President of Morse Farm Sugar Works, outside \nMontpelier, sold so much maple syrup online that he testified before \nthe Senate Commerce Committee on the benefits of e-commerce for small \nbusinesses nationwide.\n  For the past five years I have learned first-hand about this e-\ncommerce explosion by hosting annual workshops on Internet sales. At my \nDoing Business On The Internet Workshops in Vermont, small business \nowners recounted tales of successful selling on the Web and share their \ntips for future success with fellow entrepreneurs. For instance, Megan \nSmith of The Vermont Inn in Killington attended one of the workshops \nand now takes reservations over the Net from customers all across the \ncountry and around the world. And Maura Malone attended our workshops \nfor the past three years in a row to learn how to reach more customers \nfor her fabric/quilt store, Back Country Threads, which is deep in the \nwoods in Essex. She created her own website and won the ``Top Customer \nService Award'' from Yahoo Store for the last 10 months running.\n  These Vermont cybersellers are of all sizes and customer bases, from \nMain Street merchants to boutique entrepreneurs to a couple of famous \nex-hippies who sell great ice cream. But what Vermont online sellers do \nhave in common is that Internet commerce allows\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nthem to erase the geographic barriers that historically have limited \nour access to major markets. With the power of the Internet, Vermonters \ncan sell their products and services anywhere, anytime. Cyberselling is \npaying off for Vermont and the rest of the nation.\n  With the Internet's exciting economic opportunities come unique \nchallenges. One of the critical challenges in our new economy is \ndeveloping fair and balanced tax policy that respects the rights of \nstates and local jurisdictions while fostering a stable environment for \ne-commerce to continue to grow. I believe the Internet Non-\nDiscrimination and Sales Tax Simplification Act strikes that fair \nbalance.\n  Our legislation extends the current moratorium against discriminatory \nand multiple taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet through \n2006. The current three-year moratorium, enacted as part of the 1998 \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, which I was proud to cosponsor, is set to \nexpire in October 2001. This five-year extension of the moratorium was \none of the recommendations in the Advisory Commission on Electronic \nCommerce's April 2000 report to Congress.\n  Electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, but it is still in its \ninfancy. Stability is key to reaching its full potential, and creating \nnew tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing to do. \nInternet commerce should not be subject to discriminatory new taxes \nthat do not apply to other commerce.\n  Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are 30,000 different \njurisdictions around the country that could levy discriminatory or \nmultiple Internet taxes on e-commerce. We need to continue the \nmoratorium to provide the stability necessary for electronic commerce \nto flourish. We are not asking for a tax-free zone on the Internet; if \nsales taxes and other taxes would apply to traditional sales and \nservices, then those taxes would also apply to Internet sales under our \nlegislation. But our legislation would continue the ban on any taxes \napplied only to Internet sales in a discriminatory manner.\n  Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce--with its great \npotential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses--to be \ncrushed by the weight of multiple or discriminatory taxation.\n  While Congress should continue to prevent discriminatory e-commerce \ntaxes, we also need a national policy to make sure that the traditional \nstate and local sales taxes on Internet sales are applied and collected \nfairly and uniformly. Our bill encourages states to simplify their \nsales tax rules and to develop national standards on e-commerce. To \nhelp state and local governments improve their collection of sales \ntaxes on e-commerce, our bill authorizes Congress to consider \nlegislation under fast-track procedures to require sellers to collect \nsales taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet.\n  I commend the National Conference of State Legislatures and the \nNational Governors Association for their efforts to create uniformity \namong states for the collection of remote sales taxes. I hope our \nlegislation will further this simplification process as state \nlegislatures and governors around the nation work together to come up \nwith national standards for e-commerce taxation. I pledge to work with \nthem to reach consensus on these difficult remote tax issues.\n  Today, there are more than a million businesses selling their sales \nand services on the World Wide Web around the world. This explosion in \nWeb growth has led to thousands of new jobs and exciting opportunities \nfor businesses from Main Street to Wall Street. A March 1999 survey of \ne-commerce in Vermont that I commissioned found that Vermont businesses \nhad already created 1,404 jobs as a result of Internet commerce--with \nthe potential to create 24,280 new jobs in my home state by the end of \nthis year. The Internet Non-Discrimination and Sales Tax Simplification \nAct will insure that Vermonters continue to reap the rewards of \nelectronic commerce.\n  E-Commerce is booming, our moratorium law is working, and we should \nkeep a good thing going and growing. I am proud to cosponsor the \nInternet Non-Discrimination and Sales Tax Simplification Act to \nencourage online commerce to continue to grow with confidence. I urge \nmy colleagues to support its swift passage into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1217-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           CONGRATULATIONS TO PROVIDENCE'S NEW ENGLAND STORM\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the New \nEngland Storm, a Women's Professional Football League, WPFL, team based \nin Providence, Rhode Island. Established just one year ago, the New \nEngland Storm logged an impressive first season capped by winning the \nNational Conference Championship January 6, 2001.\n  This was truly an amazing accomplishment--a testament to the players' \ndedication, sacrifice, and hard work.\n  As a Rhode Islander, I am particularly proud of the Storm's success. \nIn January 2000, Rhode Island native Melissa Korpacz--know to all as \n``Missi''--founded the Storm and rooted it in Providence's Mt. Pleasant \nStadium. Missi put aside her fledgling education law practice and \ninvested her time and money into helping the New England Storm take \nflight. She secured a venue, recruited 43 top athletes, a dedicated \nstaff of managers, coaches, and trainers and secured the necessary \nbusiness licenses.\n  And, throughout the season, she balanced the roles of team owner and \nregional director of team management for the WPFL while taking to the \nfield each game as the Storm's fullback.\n  To be sure, Missi's efforts were boosted by the spirit and \nprofessionalism of her fellow teammates. Together, their performance \nstirred an enormous amount of pride in Rhode Island and set a laudable \ngoal toward which young women athletes across our state can strive.\n  And so, I offer my heartiest congratulations to all the members of \nthe New England Storm Women's Professional Football Team, and all who \nwere associated with their championship season.\n  I ask that a copy of the team roster be printed in the Record.\n  The roster follows.\n\n New England Storm Women's Professional Football Team 2000-2001 Season\n\n       Jennifer Blum; Kathleen Bolduc; Sue Burtoft; Patricia \n     Carey; Linda Caruso; Kendra Cestone; Deb Cote; Heather Davis; \n     Karolyn Domini; Kerry Dudley; Audrey Everson; Toni Farfaras; \n     Tara Fay; Chantalle Forgues; Sandy Frizell; Christina \n     Gibbons; Nicole Girard; Theresa Gomes; Ann Hadwen; Cheryl \n     Hancin; Kim Hickey; Rumonda Holder; Debra Hutter; Jessica \n     Johnson; Stephanie Kehas; Catherine Kidd; Missi Korpacz; \n     Tracey Kowalski; Stephanie Lake; Veronica Milinazzo; Darci \n     Mix; Sara Moon; Amy O'Hara; Samantha Phillips; Leah Proia; \n     April Riccardone; Beatrice Robinson; Lori Rubolotta; Amy \n     Saur; Jeanne Sherlock; Kate Skidmore; Karen Sweet; and Sarah \n     Ward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1217-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDDIE RATHBUN\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

I am sure you remember the horrible tornados \nthat ravaged Oklahoma in May of 1999 that killed 44 people and injured \n795 others. For many of my constituents this was a very difficult time \nand Mr. Rathbun and the staff of the Natural Resources Conservation \nService went out of their way to be helpful to those who's lives had \nbeen altered by this disaster. Mr. Rathbun and his crew worked long \nhours, in difficult working conditions, to ensure that the people in \nBridge Creek could return their lives to normal. The people of this \ncommunity have informed me that he was a great help to them in a time \nof need, and have expressed a deep appreciation of him, which I share \nhere today.\n  Mr. Eddie Rathbun and the crew of the Natural Resources Conservation \nService exemplify the Oklahoma spirit of going beyond what is necessary \nto help a neighbor in a time of need. I wanted to recognize the efforts \nof a good man, for the kindness he has provided to the people of \nOklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1217-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1217-S1218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A SALUTE TO LORENA DeROIN\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

This dance honors what is perhaps one of the most \nimpressive and prestigious achievements of Lorena DeRoin's lifetime: \nbecoming the first and only American Indian ever to serve as president \nof American War Mothers.\n  American War Mothers is a national, patriotic organization dedicated \nto recognizing mothers whose children have served in the military. As \nnational president, she is able to expound on years of experience \nleading women in both state and local chapters of the organization.\n  Born February 9, 1915, in Red Rock, Oklahoma, Mrs. DeRoin has made \nher mark as an American Indian and a patriot. She belongs to the White \nPigeon Clan of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe. In 1962, she joined Otoe War \nMothers, a local chapter of American War Mothers. During her years of \nservice, she worked on all standing committees and then became \npresident of the chapter. She is also retired from the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs as an employee of the old Chilocco Indian School.\n  Showing her dedication to our country, she has served as Mistress of \nCeremonies for three separate years on Mothers Day at Arlington \nNational Cemetery and laid the Wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown \nSoldier.\n  Mrs. DeRoin's contributions to our community and our country are an \nexample of true servant leadership. Oklahoma is fortunate to count \nLorena DeRoin as one of our own.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize the use of State revolving loan funds for construction of \nwater conservation and quality improvements; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 25 years after enactment of the Clean Water \nAct, we still have not achieved the law's original goal that all our \nnation's lakes, rivers and streams would be safe for fishing and \nswimming.\n  After 25 years, it's time for the next generation of strategies to \nsolve our remaining water quality problems. We need to give States new \ntools to overcome the new water quality challenges they are now facing.\n  The money that has been invested in controlling water pollution from \nfactories and upgrading sewage treatment plants has gone a long way to \ncontrolling these urban pollution sources. In most cases, the remaining \nwater quality problems are no longer caused by pollution spewing out of \nfactory pipes. Instead, they are caused by runoff from a myriad of \nsources ranging from farm fields to city streets and parking lots.\n  In my home State of Oregon, more than half of our streams don't fully \nmeet water quality standards. And the largest problems are \ncontamination from runoff and meeting the standards for water \ntemperature.\n  In many cases, conventional approaches will not solve these problems. \nBut we can achieve water temperature standards and obtain other water \nquality benefits by enhancing stream flows and improving runoff \ncontrols.\n  A major problem for many streams in Oregon and in many other areas of \nthe Western United States is that water supplies are fully appropriated \nor over-appropriated. There is currently no extra water to spare for \nincreased stream flows.\n  We can't create new water to fill the gap. But we can make more water \navailable for this use through increased water conservation and more \nefficient use of existing water supplies.\n  The key to achieving this would be to create incentives to reduce \nwasteful water use.\n  In the Western United States, irrigated agriculture is the single \nlargest user of water. Studies indicate that substantial quantities of \nwater diverted for irrigation do not make it to the fields, with a \nsignificant portion lost to evaporation or leakage from irrigation \ncanals.\n  In Oregon and other States that recognize rights to conserved water \nfor those who conserve it, irrigators and other water users could gain \nrights to use conserved water while also increasing the amount of water \navailable for other uses by implementing conservation and efficiency \nmeasures to reduce water loss.\n  The Federal government can play a role in helping meet our nation's \nchanging water needs. In many Western States, water supply problems can \nbe addressed by providing financial incentives to help water users \nimplement cost effective water conservation and efficiency measures \nconsistent with State water law.\n\n  And, we can improve water quality throughout the nation by giving \ngreater flexibility to States to use Clean Water Act funds to control \npolluted runoff, if that's where the money is needed most.\n  Today, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Burns, in \nintroducing legislation to authorize the Clean Water State Revolving \nFund program to provide loans to water users to fund conservation \nmeasures or runoff controls. States would be authorized, but not \nrequired, to use their SRF funds for these purposes. Participation by \nwater users, farmers, ranchers and other eligible loan recipients would \nalso be entirely voluntary.\n  The conservation program would be structured to allow participating \nusers to receive a share of the water saved through conservation or \nmore efficient use, which they could use in accordance with State law. \nThis type of approach would create a win/win situation with more water \navailable for both the conservers and for instream flows. And, by using \nthe SRF program, the Federal seed money would be repaid over time and \ngradually become available to fund conservation or other measures to \nsolve water quality problems in other areas.\n  My proposal has the support of the Farm Bureau, Oregon water users, \nthe Environmental Defense Fund, and the Oregon Water Trust.\n  I urge my colleagues to support giving States greater flexibility to \nuse their clean water funds for water conservation or runoff control \nwhen the State decides that is the best way to solve water quality \nproblems and the water users voluntarily agree to participate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, in introducing the Water Conservation and \nQuality Incentives Act. This bill aims to authorize the use of State \nrevolving loan funds for construction of water conservation and quality \nimprovements. Senator Wyden and I have worked together to bring some \ncommon sense improvements to the existing revolving fund program. One \nof the big changes we would like to see will encourage additional \nconservation of water resources by the many irrigation districts in the \nNation. Every Montanan understands that water is the lifeblood of our \nState, and I am glad to be working on this bipartisan effort to more \neffectively use this vital resource.\n  This bill will encourage water conservation by providing the \nopportunity for loans to be made to irrigation districts from the State \nrevolving funds. These loans will be used to construct pipelines and \ndevelop additional conservation measures. In the West, irrigators are \nby far the largest water users. They use the water to produce the many \nagricultural products we enjoy in this country. Between the water \nsource and the field, a large portion of the water used in irrigation \nis displaced due to seepage as the water flows through the canals and \nditches. The water is not lost, since it seeps into the soil and \nassists in the overall soil moisture, but it makes for an inefficient \nsystem because it is not immediately available to the irrigator.\n  One of the reasons this is damaging to producers is the fact that in \nmost irrigation districts, irrigators pay for water that is released to \nthem whether it makes it to the crop or not. Displacement of this water \ndoes not help a producer's bottom line. At a time when prices are low \nand markets are questionable, it is important that we give tools to the \nproducer to make sure they have every opportunity to stay in business.\n  Water saved under the proposal in this bill will not only assist the \nproducer in water and cost savings, but will also make certain the \nfuture of water in the many rivers and streams in the west. Efficient \nirrigations systems make good environmental sense because the more \nwater you have to pump out of a river, the less water there is left for \nthe fish and animals that depend on it as part of their habitat.\n  This bill creates a win-win situation both for water users and for \nthe multiple users of water in our states, particularly Oregon and \nMontana. We have an opportunity here to do something useful and \nworthwhile for the irrigators and also for those who enjoy fishing, \nboating and other instream water uses. I thank Senator Wyden for his \nwork on this measure and I am pleased to work with him on this issue of \ngreat importance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 286. A bill to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a \nprogram to make no-interest loans to eligible small business concerns \nto address economic harm resulting from shortages of, and increases in \nthe price of, electricity and natural gas; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very proud today to introduce \nlegislation designed to help small businesses hurt by the power crisis \nin the Western United States.\n  This bill authorizes funds for the Economic Development \nAdministration to operate a revolving loan fund to assist small \nbusiness owners in California and other States affected by the \nshortage.\n  This fund will help dozens of small manufacturers with so-called \n``interruptible contracts'' that have been forced to lay off employees \nand, in many cases, close their doors.\n  Interruptible contracts are defined as price discounts to users who \nagree to\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\nreduce consumption during peak demand periods.\n  But while companies can withstand infrequent power interruptions, the \nfact is that California has been hit hard by the electricity crisis and \nthe service interruptions have come far too frequently.\n  Today, even small business owners who chose not to join the \ninterruptible list--and opted instead to brave the higher gas and \nelectric bills--have found the price spikes too much to handle.\n  Sadly, many of these firms have discovered that they too are being \nforced to shut down because they can't pay their electricity bills. \nHere are a few examples of companies that have been affected:\n  A small business owner in San Diego operating a fluff-and-fold \nlaundry facility was forced to close when his December electricity bill \njumped fourfold to $4,000. At this time last year, his monthly bill was \nroughly $1,000.\n  The Saint-Gobain Calmar company--a plastics manufacturer in Los \nAngeles with roughly 300 employees--has been forced to stop production \n22 times in the past six months because of the business' \n``interruptible'' status. Although the company has been able to avoid \nlayoffs up to now, the owners say the outlook is not good.\n  Another example is the McKoen and Associates potato-flake plant in \nTulelake, California. The owner of the facility says he may be forced \nto lay off about 100 employees permanently due to the mandatory shut \ndowns.\n  While all California companies, both large and small, are feeling the \ncrunch of the power shortage, smaller firms are taking a larger hit \nbecause these companies pay a larger percentage of their budgets to \nenergy and gas bills.\n  Small businesses, classified as those with 500 workers or fewer, \nemploy 37 percent of the California's total workforce.\n  This current power drain has led to higher costs for businesses \nthroughout the Northwest.\n  Some aluminum and paper manufacturers in Washington and Oregon have \nalready been forced out of business--and they are not alone.\n  The bill I am introducing today authorizes $25 million for a \nrevolving no-interest loan fund to be operated by the Economic \nDevelopment Administration.\n  The bill allows small businesses, as defined by the Small Business \nAdministration to be eligible for loans if their monthly gas or \nelectric bills are at least double what they were a year ago.\n  If a company's gas bill, for example, was $4,000 in the months of \nJanuary, February, and March 2001 and the company averaged only $2,000 \nin January, February, and March 2000, that company is eligible for a \nloan.\n  The legislation will allow small business customers of the Pacific \nGas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, or San Diego Gas \nand Electric who are not covered by a State-mandated cap to apply for \nthe no-interest loans to stave off lay offs, re-hire employees, and \nkeep their facilities up and running.\n  Small business that were covered by a State cap on energy expenses \nwill not be eligible for the loan program.\n  The bill is designed to help both small business owners who opted for \nthe ``interruptible list'' and those who tried to brave the cost spikes \nand failed.\n  The legislation will not affect those who are not covered by a State \nmandated program that caps retail electric commodity rates.\n  I believe this measure will be of great assistance to the hundreds of \nsmall businesses in the Western region that are facing skyrocketing \ncosts for power.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me on this important legislation to help \nkeep these hard working businessmen and women from being forced to lay \noff employees and close their doors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 287. A bill to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nimpose cost-of-service based rates on sales by public utilities of \nelectric energy at wholesale in the western energy market; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise today to introduce a bill to direct the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute cost-of-service based \nrates with a reasonable rate of return on energy produced in the \nwestern energy market.\n  I had planned on introducing this bill as an amendment to the \npipeline safety bill but I understand that the chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski and the ranking \nmember of that committee, Senator Bingaman, would be amendable to \nscheduling a hearing on this bill before the end of the month, if the \nlegislation is introduced as a stand-alone bill rather than as an \namendment to the pipeline safety bill.\n  After the hearing, I intend to exercise my right under the rules of \nthe committee to ask that the chairman put this bill on the schedule \nfor mark-up.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I remain concerned about the energy crisis that is \naffecting not just California but other Western states as well. I am \nwilling to hold a hearing on your legislation during the week of \nFebruary 26, right after the Senate recess.\n  I cannot commit to a markup of the bill, but I expect that the \nSenator's legislation will be given its due consideration by the \ncommittee in a timely manner.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The situation in California is very serious. It is now \naffecting not only the price and supply of electricity in California \nbut the price and supply of electricity throughout the West. It poses a \ngrave danger to the economy of the nation as a whole. The State of \nCalifornia is doing what it can to cope with this crisis. It is past \ntime for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to use its existing \nauthority to bring wholesale prices under control.\n  I commend the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, for her \ninitiative in crafting the bill, and the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, for agreeing to give us a hearing on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Shelby, Ms. Collins, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Santorum, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 289. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax incentives for education; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the concept of \nprepaid tuition plans and why they are so critically important to \nAmerica's families. As a parent who has put two children through \ncollege and who has another currently enrolled in college, I know \nfirsthand that America's families are struggling to meet the rising \ncost of higher education. In fact, American families accrued more \ncollege debt in the 1990's than during the previous three decades \ncombined. The reason is twofold: the Federal Government subsidizes \nstudent debt with interest rate breaks and penalizes educational \nsavings by taxing the interest earned on those savings.\n  In recent years, however, many families have tackled rising tuition \ncosts by taking advantage of prepaid college tuition and savings plans. \nThese plans allow families to purchase tuition credits years in \nadvance. Families are able to pay for their child's future college \neducation at today's price. Currently, 48 states have or are in the \nprocess of creating a tuition savings or prepaid tuition plan. These \nplans are extremely popular with parents, students, and alumni. They \nmake it easier for families to save for college, while at the same time \ntaking the uncertainty out of the future cost of college.\n  My home State of Alabama was one of the first in the nation to \nestablish a prepaid college tuition plan. Nearly 50,000 Alabamians are \ncurrently enrolled in the Prepaid Alabama College Tuition Plan. \nFamilies across the State of Alabama are setting aside a few dollars \neach month to pay for the future college education of their child. \nAlabama is not the only success story, 18,000 children have been \nenrolled in the College Savings Iowa plan.\n  Mr. President, 2,500 families in Montana are saving for their child's \ncollege education through the Montana Family Education Savings Program:\n  13,000 are enrolled in the Alaska Advance College Tuition Plan; \n100,000 are\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nparticipating in the Texas Tomorrow Fund; 7,000 children have accounts \nin the West Virginia Prepaid College Plan; 38,000 have joined the Maine \nNext Generation College Investing Plan; over 10,000 parents have \ncontracts in the Mississippi Prepaid Affordable College Tuition Program \nfor their children.\n\n  As you can see, people across the country are wisely taking advantage \nof these plans. Congress has supported participating families by \nexpanding the scope of the prepaid tuition plans and by deferring the \ntaxes on the interest earned until the student goes off to college. I \nbelieve that we must go one step further. That is why today, I along \nwith Senators, Bob Graham, Collins, Bingaman, Phil Gramm, Frist, \nBreaux, Shelby, Helms, Inhofe, Tim Hutchinson, Santorum, Murkowski, \nLandrieu, and Roberts are introducing the Collegiate Learning and \nStudent Savings, CLASS, Act.\n  This is a common sense piece of legislation that will make the \ninterest earned on all education tuition savings plans completely tax-\nfree. Currently, the interest earned by families saving for college is \ntaxed twice. Families are taxed on the income when they earn it, and \nthen again on the interest that accrues from the savings. We strongly \nbelieve that this trend must no longer continue.\n  In order to provide families a new alternative, the CLASS Act will \nprovide tax-free treatment to all tuition savings plans. This \nbipartisan piece of legislation is sound education policy and tax \npolicy that provides incentives for savings rather than bureaucratic \nsolutions. It is a small tax break--estimated at less than $200 million \nover 5 years--but the CLASS Act will give families an extra incentive \nto be prudent savers for their children's education. Indeed, this small \ntax relief plan could produce billions in savings for college in the \nyears to come. Many individuals have questioned whether these plans \nwill benefit all types of students.\n  Let me say this, it is wrong to assume that tuition savings and \nprepaid plans benefit mainly the wealthy. In fact, the track record of \nexisting state prepaid plans indicates that working, middle-income \nfamilies, not the rich, benefit the most from prepaid plans. For \nexample, in 1996 families with an annual income of less than $35,000 \npurchased 62 percent of the prepaid tuition contracts offered by the \nState of Pennsylvania. In the same year, 71 percent of the 600,000 \nfamilies participating in the Florida Prepaid College Program had an \nincome of less than $50,000. It is clear this plan is helping middle \nincome families save for college.\n  In 1995, the average monthly contribution to a family's college \nsavings account in Kentucky was $43. These families in Kentucky are \nputting a few dollars aside each month to save for their child's \neducation. Tax-free treatment for tuition savings plans must become \nlaw. We passed this legislation as part of a larger tax bill last \nCongress. However, it was vetoed by President Clinton.\n  President Bush articulated his support for this plan during the \ncampaign. The time to act is now. This is not expensive, and the small \ncost will produce a huge benefit. I encourage my colleagues to work \nwith me to push for passage of this common sense piece of legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Sessions and my \nother Senate colleagues in launching an initiative to increase \nAmericans' access to college education. Today, we are introducing the \nCollegiate Learning and Student Savings Act. This bill extends tax-free \ntreatment to all state sponsored prepaid tuition plans and state \nsavings plans. This legislation also gives prepaid tuition plans \nestablished by private colleges and universities tax-deferred treatment \nin 2001, and tax-exempt status by 2005.\n  Prepaid college tuition and savings programs have flourished at the \nState level in the face of spiraling college costs. According to the \nCollege Board, between 1980 and 2000, the cost of going to a four-year \ncollege has increased 115 percent above the rate of inflation. The \ncause of this dramatic increase in tuition is the subject of \nsignificant debate. But whether these increases are attributable to \nincreased costs to the universities, reductions in state funding for \npublic universities, or the increased value of a college degree, the \nfact remains that financing a college education has become increasingly \ndifficult.\n  In response to higher college costs the States have engineered \ninnovative ways to help its families afford college. Michigan \nimplemented the first prepaid tuition plan in 1986. Florida followed in \n1988. Today 49 States have either implemented or are in the process of \nimplementing prepaid tuition plans or state education savings plans.\n  Prepaid college tuition plans allow parents to pay prospectively for \ntheir children's higher education at participating universities. States \npool these funds and invest them in a manner that will match or exceed \nthe pace of educational inflation. This ``locks in'' current tuition \nand guarantees financial access to a future college education. In 1996, \nCongress acted to ensure that the tax on the earnings in these state-\nsponsored programs is tax-deferred.\n  Mr. Sessions and I believe the 107th Congress must move to make these \nprograms completely tax free. Students should be able to enroll in \ncollege without the fear of incurring a significant tax liability just \nbecause they went to school. The legislation extends this same tax \ntreatment to private college prepaid programs beginning in 2005.\n  We believe that these programs should be tax free for numerous \nreasons. First, prepaid tuition and savings programs help middle income \nfamilies afford a college education. Florida's experience shows that it \nis not higher income families who take most advantage of these plans. \nIt is middle income families who want the discipline of monthly \npayments. They know that they would have a difficult time coming up \nwith funds necessary to pay for college if they waited until their \nchild enrolled. In Florida, more than 70 percent of participants in the \nstate tuition program have family income of less than $50,000. Second, \nCongress should make these programs tax free in order to encourage \nsavings and college attendance. Finally, for most families, these plans \nsimply represent the purchase of service to be provided in the future. \nThe accounts are not liquid, and the funds are transferred from the \nstate directly to the college or university. The imposition of a tax \nliability on earnings represents a substantial burden, because the \nstudent is required to find other means of generating the funds to pay \nthe tax.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this bill which makes a college education easier to obtain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 290. A bill to increase parental involvement and protect student \nprivacy; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Student Privacy \nProtection Act with my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator \nShelby. Senator Shelby recently asked me to join him as a co-chair of \nthe Congressional Privacy Caucus and I am pleased that we are today \nintroducing legislation to help protect the privacy of one of America's \nmost vulnerable groups-- our students.\n  A recent GAO report confirms that more and more, schools are being \nperceived by some not just as centers for learning, but as centers for \ncommercial research. Our children should be instilled with knowledge, \nnot mined for knowledge on their commercial preferences and interests. \nSchools are there to help children grow up to be good citizens--not to \nprovide a captive audience for market researchers and major \nadvertisers.\n  Our bill is simple--it provides parents and their children with \nmodest, appropriate, privacy protections from market research in \nschools that would gather personal information about students, during \nschool hours, for purely commercial purposes. It does not ban \nadvertising, nor does it ban market research. It simply requires that, \nbefore a researcher can start asking a young student to provide \npersonal information, that researcher must obtain parental consent or \nits equivalent.\n  Surely, that is not too much to ask. If someone came to your home and \nstarted to ask your child about his or her age, gender, neighborhood, \nfood\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\npreferences, and entertainment preferences, surely you would want to \nknow the purpose of such questions before deciding whether to consent \nto them. We think parents and children are entitled to no less \nconsideration just because a child is in school.\n  This is part of a larger phenomenon that is familiar to anyone who \nhas walked through a school in the past few years--the stunning \nincrease in commercial advertising in schools. Gone are the days when \ncommercial advertising simply meant the local hardware store's name on \nthe basketball scoreboard or the local dry-cleaner's name on the \nfootball scoreboard.\n  Schools, teachers and their students are daily barraged with \ncommercial messages aimed at influencing the buying habits of children \nand their parents. A 1997 study from Texas A, estimated that \nchildren, age 4 to 12, spent more than $24 billion themselves and \ninfluenced their parents to spend $187 billion.\n  One major spaghetti sauce firm has encouraged science teachers to \nhave their students test different sauces for thickness as part of \ntheir science classes. A cable television channel in New Jersey had \nelementary school students fill our a 27-page booklet called ``My All \nAbout Me Journal'' as part of a marketing survey. In one school, a \nstudent was suspended for wearing a Pepsi T-shirt on the school's Coke \nDay. In another, credit card applications were sent home with \nelementary school students for their parents and the school collected a \nfee for every family that signed up.\n  Advertisers focus on students and schools for the same reason Willie \nSutton robbed banks--because that's where the money is. And many \nschools enter into commercial contracts with advertisers because, as \nthe GAO found, they are strapped for cash. Schools often are faced with \ntwo poor choices--provide computers, books, and other educational and \nrecreational equipment with commercial advertising, or not at all.\n  The bill that Senator Shelby and I offer today does not second guess \nthe hard decisions that school administrators are making each and every \nday. Nor does it ignore the fact that business leaders often are the \nstrongest advocates for school improvement and the greatest benefactors \nof the educational process. What it does is address what the GAO report \nconsiders to be perhaps the most troubling form of commercial activity \nin schools--the ``growing phenomenon'' of market research.\n  According to GAO, ``none of the education officials we interviewed \nsaid schools were appropriate venues for market research. . . .'' \nNevertheless, none of the districts surveyed by GAO had policies \nspecifically addressing market research and the GAO found that this \nactivity is widespread. One firm alone has conducted market research in \nmore than 1,000 schools.\n  Another company, which since has discontinued these activities, \nprovided computers to 1,800 schools, about 8.6 percent of all U.S. \nsecondary schools. In exchange, the company was allowed to advertise to \nand ask questions of students using these computers. There are other \nexamples. Suffice it to say that this is a practice that not only is \ninappropriate in the opinion of education officials, but is unknown to \nmany parents. Nearly half of parents in a recent survey were not aware \nthat websites can collect personal information about students without \ntheir knowledge.\n  This bill would return to parents the right to protect their \nchildren's privacy. It's simple, it's modest, it contains appropriate \nexceptions, and it's our hope that it will become law together with \nother educational reforms being considered by this Congress.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nDodd to introduce the ``Student Privacy Protection Act''. This \nlegislation is intended to ensure that parents have the ability to \nprotect their children's privacy by requiring that anyone who wishes to \ncollect data for commercial purposes from kids in school must first \nseek and obtain parental permission.\n  The need for this legislation stems from the fact that a large number \nof marketing companies are going into classrooms and using class time \nto gather personal information about students and their families for \ncommercial gain. In many cases, parents are not even aware that these \ncompanies have entered their children's school, much less that they are \nexploiting them in the one place they should be the safest, their \nclassroom.\n  Our legislation builds on a long line of privacy legislation to \nprotect kids, such as the Family Educational Rights Act, the Children's \nOnline Privacy Protection Act and the Protection of Pupil Rights Act. \nThe goal of these laws, as is the case with our legislation, is to \nensure that the privacy of children is protected and that their \npersonal information cannot be collected and/or disseminated without \nthe prior knowledge, and in most cases, consent of the parents.\n  We understand that schools today are financially strapped and many of \nthese companies offer enticing financial incentives to gain access. Our \ngoal is not to make it more difficult for schools to access the \neducational materials and the computers that they so desperately need. \nRather our goal is to ensure that the details of these arrangements are \ndisclosed and that parents are allowed to participate in the decision-\nmaking process.\n  The bottom line here is that parents have a right and a \nresponsibility to be involved in their children's education. Much of \nwhat is occurring now is being done at the expense of the parents' \ndecision making authority because schools are allowing companies direct \naccess to students. This legislation enhances parental involvement by \ngiving them an opportunity to decide for themselves who does and does \nnot get access to their children during the school day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Gramm):\n  S. 291. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for State and local sales taxes in lieu of State and local \nincome taxes and to allow the State and local income tax deduction \nagainst the alternative minimum tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill address an inequity in the tax code that affects the citizens of \nmy state and citizens of other states that do not have a state income \ntax. Tennesseans are discriminated against under federal tax laws \nsimply because our state choose to raise revenue primarily through a \nsales tax instead of an income tax. My bill would end this inequity by \nallowing taxpayers to deduct either their state and local sales taxes \nor their state and local income taxes on their federal tax forms, but \nnot both. My bill would also ensure that Tennesseans who benefit from \nthis deduction would not be caught under the federal alternative \nminimum tax, AMT, by allowing individuals to deduct their state and \nlocal taxes paid when computing their AMT tax liability.\n  Under current law, individuals who itemize their deductions for \nfederal tax purposes are only permitted to deduct state and local \nincome taxes and property taxes paid. State and local sales taxes are \nnot deductible. Therefore, residents of nine states are treated \ndifferently from residents of states that have an income tax. Seven \nstates--Texas, Wyoming, Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Washington, and \nNevada--have no state income tax. Two states--Tennessee and New \nHampshire--only impose an income tax on interest and dividends, but not \nwages.\n  Prior to 1986, taxpayers were permitted to deduct all of their state \nand local taxes paid, including income, sales and property taxes, when \ncomputing their federal tax liability. The ability to deduct all state \nand local taxes is based on the principle that levying a tax on a tax \nis unfair.\n  In 1986, however, Congress made dramatic changes to the tax code. The \nTax Reform Act of 1986 significantly reduced federal tax rates on \nindividuals. In exchange for these lower rates, Congress broadened the \nbase of income that is taxed by eliminating many of the deductions and \ncredits that previously existed in the code, including the deduction \nfor state and local sales taxes. The deduction for state and local \nincome taxes, however, was retained.\n  The 1986 Act also tightened the alternative minimum tax rules. The \nAMT is a separate, complicated tax system that was originally intended \nto ensure\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\nthat wealthy taxpayers could not use the tax code's many deductions and \ncredits to completely zero out their federal tax liability. However, \neach year more and more middle income individuals are being caught \nunder the AMT who were never intended to be affected by it. Under \ncurrent law, individuals are not permitted to deduct their state and \nlocal taxes when computing their alternative minimum tax liability. \nThis is a major factor pushing Americans under the AMT. By allowing \nindividuals to deduct state and local taxes under the AMT, my bill will \nensure that restoring equity in this area will not push more \nTennesseans under the AMT. It makes no sense to me to give Tennesseans \na tax cut on the one hand, then take it away with the other.\n  I believe that our federal tax laws should be neutral with respect to \nthe treatment of state and local taxes. As I have said, that is not the \ncase now. The current tax code is biased in favor of states that raise \nrevenue through an income tax. The current tax code is also needlessly \ncomplex. There is widespread agreement among tax experts that the AMT \nis a primary cause of complexity in the tax code and should be \nrepealed. I strongly support comprehensive reform of the tax code that \nwill address issues such as neutrality, fairness and simplicity. As we \nwork to reform the overall tax code, restoring equality in these areas \nand should be a part of the discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 292. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe enhanced deduction for corporate donations of computer technology \nto senior centers and community centers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Commerce's latest \nreport on Internet access in the U.S. is out. According to the \nDepartment's Falling Through the Net: Toward Digital Inclusion, \npublished last October, more Americans than ever have Internet access \nand own computers.\n  The number of Americans using the Internet jumped to 116.5 million in \nAugust 2000, 31.9 million more Americans than were online in December \n1998. And groups that have traditionally been digital ``have nots'' are \nmaking significant gains, according to the Commerce report's findings. \nAlmost 39 percent of rural households, for example, now have Internet \nconnections, a 75 percent increase over the last 20 months. The report \nfound that African American households are now more than twice as \nlikely to have Internet access at home than they were 20 months ago. \nSimilarly, Internet access in Hispanic households has also nearly \ndoubled and now stands at 23.6 percent. And more Americans at every \nincome level have Internet access in their homes, especially at the \nmiddle income levels. Today, two out of every three households earning \nmore than $50,000 have Internet connections.\n  Although more Americans than ever are connected to the Internet, the \nreport concludes that a ``digital divide'' still exists ``between those \nwith different levels of income and education, different racial and \nethnic groups, old and young, single and dual-parent families, and \nthose with and without disabilities.'' According to the Commerce \nDepartment report, for example, more than three-fourths of all \nhouseholds earning in excess of $75,000 use the Internet at home, while \nless than one-fifth of the households with incomes of under $15,000 do. \nIn some cases, the digital divide has even expanded over the last 20 \nmonths. The gap in Internet access rates between African American \nhouseholds and the nation as a whole is now 18 percent--3 percent more \nthan in December 1998. And the gap in Internet access between Hispanic \nhouseholds and the national average is 17.9 percent--4.3 percent more \nthan it was 20 months ago.\n  Increasing numbers of Americans are using the Internet to vote, shop, \npay bills, take education courses, and acquire new skills. It is \ntherefore becoming more and more critical that all Americans have the \ntools necessary for full participation in the Information Age economy. \nAccess to these tools is essential to ensure that our economy continues \nto grow and that in the future no one is left behind.\n  A viable alternative for many of these under-served individuals is \nInternet access outside the home, and statistics show that computer use \nat schools, libraries, and other public access points such as community \ncenters is on the rise. Today I am joined by my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, in introducing the Community Technology \nAssistance Act. Currently, the special enhanced tax deduction exists in \nthe case of computer equipment donated to elementary and secondary \nschools and public libraries. Our bill would expand this tax incentive \nto include computer donations to community and senior centers as well. \nConsider the many high-profile technology and Internet related \ncompanies, such as Microsoft, Intel and AmericaOnline, that have \ndonated computer equipment and web access to schools and universities \nacross America. Our bill would encourage companies and individuals to \ninvest in their community and jump start efforts to help bridge the \ndigital divide in rural and low-income areas everywhere.\n  In addition, we know a digital divide exists between seniors and the \npopulation as a whole. In fact, the October 2000 Commerce Department \nreport found that individuals over the age of 50 are among the least \nlikely to be connected to the Internet, with an Internet use rate of \nless than 30 percent. Internet access at senior centers offers older \nAmericans a promising opportunity. According to the National \nAssociation of State Units on Aging, eight states have conducted \nsurveys on computer and on-line access at their senior centers. \nPennsylvania reports, for example, that while more than 250 of their \n650 senior centers are linked to the Internet, many more need \ncomputers. West Virginia indicates that every center that has opened a \ncomputer training program presently has a waiting list. In an informal \nsurvey, Georgia reports that no more than half of the state's \napproximately 200 senior centers have computers available for \nparticipant use--and ``that would be a generous estimate.'' Clearly, \nthe need is there to increase the availability of 21st Century \ntechnology to America's senior citizens.\n  In a society that increasingly relies on computers and the Internet \nto deliver information and enhance communication, we need to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to the fundamental tools of the \nInformation Age. As the Commerce Department report concludes, there is \nstill much more to be done to make certain that we close the gap \nbetween the digital ``haves'' and ``have nots\" and ensure that everyone \nis included in the 21st Century economy. The Community Technology \nAssistance Act is a positive step in creating digital opportunity for \nall Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Technology \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From December 1998 to August 2000, the share of \n     Americans using the Internet jumped by over 35 percent, from \n     32.7 percent to 44.4 percent, according to the recent United \n     States Department of Commerce report, Falling Through the \n     Net: Toward Digital Inclusion. If growth continues at that \n     rate, more than half of all Americans will be using the \n     Internet by the middle of this year, the report projects.\n       (2) Although more Americans than ever are connected to the \n     Internet, the most recent data show that a ``digital divide'' \n     still exists between those with different levels of income \n     and education, different racial and ethnic groups, old and \n     young, single and dual parent families, and those with and \n     without disabilities, according to the United States \n     Department of Commerce.\n       (3) Although both African Americans and Hispanic Americans \n     have shown gains in Internet access over the past 20 months, \n     still only about 16 percent of Hispanic Americans and just \n     under 19 percent of African Americans use the Internet at \n     home, compared to a third of the United States population as \n     a whole.\n       (4) The gap in Internet access rates between African \n     American households and the national average is 18 percent; 3 \n     percent more than in December 1998 and the gap in Internet \n     access between Hispanic American households and the national \n     average is 17.9 percent; 4.3 percent more than it was in \n     1998.\n       (5) Individuals over 50 years old are among the least \n     likely to be Internet users, with an\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\n     Internet use rate of less than 30 percent. However, \n     individuals in this age group are almost 3 times as likely to \n     be Internet users if they are in the labor force than if they \n     are not.\n       (6) Less than 1 in 5 individuals living in households with \n     incomes of less than $15,000 were Internet users in August \n     2000. In contrast, 7 out of 10 individuals living in \n     households with incomes of at least $75,000 had Internet \n     access.\n       (7) Schools, libraries, and other public access points, \n     such as community centers, continue to serve those groups \n     that do not have access at home.\n       (8) Of those States that have surveyed computer access at \n     senior centers, many report a need for computer and software \n     acquisition.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENHANCED DEDUCTION FOR CORPORATE DONATIONS OF \n                   COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO SENIOR CENTERS AND \n                   COMMUNITY CENTERS.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Computer Technology Donations to Senior \n     Centers and Community Centers.--Section 170(e)(6)(B)(i)(II) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to qualified \n     computer contribution) is amended by striking ``or'' at the \n     end of subclause (II) and by inserting after subclause (III) \n     the following:\n\n       ``(IV) a multipurpose senior center (as defined in section \n     102(35) of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. \n     3002(35)), as in effect on the date of the enactment of the \n     Community Technology Assistance Act which is described in \n     section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a) \n     for use by individuals who have attained 60 years of age to \n     improve job skills in computers, or\n       ``(V) a nonprofit or governmental community center, \n     including any center within which an after-school or \n     employment training program is operated,''.\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to contributions made after December 31, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dorgan, \n        and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 293. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable tax credit against increased residential energy costs and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Home Energy \nAssistance Tax Act with Senators Durbin, Clinton, Dorgan, and Kennedy.\n  The rising cost of utility bills has reached near crisis proportions \nin my home state and in states across this country. Right now, millions \nof Americans are being buried by massive home heating bills. And if we \ndon't do something soon, a lot of people are going to be left out in \nthe cold.\n  This winter has been an especially cold one. As a result, demand for \nnatural gas is way up, and prices have skyrocketed.\n  In the past few months, I've gotten phone calls and letters from \npeople all across Iowa telling me about their outrageous heating bills. \nA man in West Des Moines told me that while his gas bill was $189.87 in \nDecember--it jumped to $601.67 in January.\n  A couple in Duncombe said that their $79 gas bill in December was \nfollowed by a $330 gas bill in January--even though they never paid \nmore than $120 a month last year.\n  And a man from Merrill told me that his bill was $575 this month and \n$475 last month, even though it was never higher than $280 last year.\n  This man and his wife receive $1,300 a month for Social Security--\n$100 of which goes for Medicare and $300 for Medicare supplement. After \nfood and other expenses, they just don't have enough left to pay their \nutility bills.\n  Heating bills this high force people to make the kind of sacrifices \nthat no one should have to make. A recent survey showed that 20 percent \nof the Iowa residents who asked for LIHEAP assistance went without \nmedical care because of high heating bills. 12.3 percent went without \nfood. 7.4 percent didn't pay their rent or make their house payment.\n  The bottom line here is that people are struggling, and they need our \nhelp to keep from freezing in their homes this winter.\n  That's why I believe that we should take the following three steps \nimmediately:\n  First, we've got to provide more emergency funds for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP. Many low income and elderly \npeople simply cannot afford $300 and $400 and $500 heating bills. We \nalso need to increase the income limits on who can receive LIHEAP \nassistance.\n  Second, bills have gotten so high that even middle income Americans \nare struggling--we've got to find a way to help them pay their energy \nutility bills as well. That's why I am introducing the Home Energy \nAssistance Tax Act to give taxpayers a 50 percent tax credit for the \ndifference between their utility bills this winter compared to last \nwinter.\n\n  This credit will also cover the estimated increased costs of heating \na home from heating oil or propane. It will not cover the first $100 in \nincreased costs. It will not benefit high-income tax-payers. The credit \nis phased out for those making more than $100,000. However, this credit \nwill be refundable so that people with low incomes could still receive \nit.\n  One key problem with using the tax code to provide assistance is that \npeople do not normally see its benefit until after they file their next \ntax return and receive a refund. However, taxpayers can reduce their \npayroll withholding by the amount of this credit and get the money \nquickly. So this credit can provide quick and meaningful help.\n  The bill--much like a measure introduced by Senator Bob Smith--will \nalso propose tax credits for energy efficient new homes and energy \nefficient heating, air conditioning and water-heating appliances. It \nwill also provide tax benefits for similar energy conservation by \nbusinesses.\n  Energy efficiency is crucial for quelling our home heating crisis. By \nhelping people conserve energy, we reduce consumption and help them \nlower their heating bills. And when we reduce the demand that has \ndriven prices up, we restore balance to the market and lower prices for \neveryone. Also, when we use less fuel, we create less air pollution and \nreduce our dependence on foreign sources. So energy efficiency tax \ncredits are a win-win-win solution.\n  I am also joining Senator Kerry in introducing a separate bill today \nthat will provide some relief for small business owners by allowing \nthem to acquire low interest emergency.\n  I am, of course, fully aware that high gas prices have spurred new \ndrilling which should eventually increase supply and bring prices back \ndown. But this could take years. People are being hammered by high \nheating bills right now, and we need to act now to help our \nconstituents.\n  No one should be left out in the cold this winter. I hope that we can \ncome together in the next few weeks and pass important legislation to \nhelp keep America warm.\n  I urge that the Senate consider and pass this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fact sheet be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Home Energy Assistance Tax Act (HEAT)\n\n     Exactly what is covered? Who is covered? What is covered?\n       Provides a refundable 50 percent credit from the first \n     utility bill covering a period starting in November till the \n     one ending during March this year minus a similar period last \n     winter. This is a one time benefit.\n       Who: All taxpayers who have a principal residence and who \n     have energy utility costs this winter that are more than $100 \n     more than last year's costs. There is a phase out of benefits \n     for those with higher incomes stating at $75,000 adjusted \n     gross income. The benefit is completely phased out at \n     $100,000.\n       What: All energy utility bills plus any fuel used to heat \n     the home like heating oil or propane.\n       It covers bills that people are responsible for, not \n     including LIHEAP and other government payments. A renter \n     benefits if they are responsible for their bills.\n     How easy is this going to be for people to figure out?\n       Utilities can very easily supply customers with the total \n     bills for the period from a year ago. Then all they need to \n     do is subtract.\n       For those who use a bulk purchased fuel such as heating oil \n     or propane to heat their homes: There will be an estimated \n     average cost for each county determined by: (1) The number of \n     degree days in the two years from November 15 to May 15; (2) \n     the difference in the price of the fuel used this winter and \n     last, and (3) the amount needed to heat an average home. That \n     figure would be used to cover the cost of that fuel in \n     addition to the other energy utility bills.\n       The IRS would calculate this number, getting their numbers \n     from NOAA, DOE and HUD.\n     What about those who just bought their home?\n       They would be allowed to use a government estimate of the \n     average increase for their county.\n                                   ____\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 294. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nestablish a program to provide dairy farmers\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\na price safety net for small- and medium-sized dairy producers; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nassist our nation's dairy farmers. I represent a state where \nagriculture is the number one industry--dairy being the leading sector, \nand ranks fourth in national dairy production. Agriculture has, and \ncontinues to be, the backbone of our rural communities and our social \ncharacter. While heated debates and regional politics have eclipsed \nopportunities to pass meaningful dairy legislation, I feel strongly \nthat we must forge consensus in order to assist our nation's dairy \nfamilies.\n  I am pleased to have joining me in this effort my colleague from \nWisconsin Senator Herb Kohl. While I am grateful for the opportunity to \nwork with Senator Kohl on an issue of great importance to both of our \nhome states, it unfortunately signals that our nation's dairy industry \ncontinues to grapple with difficult economic times.\n  Senator Kohl and I worked together over the past year to forge a \nconsensus plan that addresses the concerns of dairy farmers nationwide. \nFor far too long, regional politics have plagued efforts to achieve a \nfair and equitable national dairy policy. As a result, milk pricing has \nbecome increasingly complex and overly prescriptive. Given that dairy \nfarmers have been receiving the lowest price for their milk in more \nthan twenty years, I feel strongly that Congress needs to step to the \nplate and offer a fair and responsible solution.\n  The National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act has two major goals: (1) \nCreate a dairy policy that is equitable for farmers in all regions of \nthe country; and (2) provide more certainty for farmers in the prices \nthey receive for their milk. To accomplish these goals, this \nlegislation creates a safety net for farmers by providing supplemental \nassistance when milk prices are low. Specifically, a sliding scale \npayment is made based upon the previous year's price for the national \naverage of Class III milk. In short, the payment rate to farmers is \nhighest when the prices they received were the lowest. In order to be \neligible, a farmer must have produced milk for commercial sale in the \nprevious year, and would be compensated on the first 26,000 \nhundredweight of production. All dairy producers would be eligible to \nparticipate under this scenario.\n  Without a doubt, our dairy pricing policy is flawed. Many solutions--\nmodest to sweeping--have been proposed, discussed, and debated on the \nSenate floor yet final agreement among interested parties has eluded us \nfor years. Considering that we will begin laying the groundwork for \nreauthorization of the Farm Bill over the next year, the time for \nconsensus is now.\n  I am committed to preserving the viability of Pennsylvania's dairy \nfarmers. This legislative proposal represents the strong concern and \ninterest of mine to find a middle ground in the often heated debate on \ndairy policy. I am pleased to join with Senator Kohl in this effort, \nand I believe it sends a strong signal that compromise can be achieved \neven on the most contentious of issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Dairy Farmers \n     Fairness Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide emergency relief to small businesses \naffected by significant increases in the prices of heating oil, natural \ngas, propane, and kerosene, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nhelps to address the significant price increase of heating fuels and \nthe adverse impact those prices are having on our 24 million small \nbusinesses and the self-employed. I thank my colleagues who are \ncosponsors. Senators Lieberman, Snowe, Bingaman, Landrieu, Johnson, \nDomenici, Levin, Wellstone, Jeffords, Harkin, Schumer, Clinton, Kohl, \nEdwards, Leahy, Baucus, and Collins.\n  As so many of my colleagues know, many small businesses are dependent \nupon heating oil, propane, kerosene and natural gas. They are dependent \neither because they sell or distribute the product, or because they use \nit to heat their facilities or as part of their business. The \nsignificant and unforseen rise in the price of these fuels over the \npast two years, compounded by cold snaps and slowed economic conditions \nthis winter, threatens their economic viability.\n  The financial falter or failure of small businesses has the potential \nto extend far beyond the businesses themselves, and we simply can't \nafford that.\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nJobs alone make this a reason to mitigate the small business \ndisruptions or failures because they provide more than 50 percent of \nprivate-sector jobs. And the self-employed, who largely work out of \ntheir homes, and number 16 million according to the National \nAssociation for the Self-Employed, NASE, represent more than 7 percent \nof the nation's workforce.\n  My bill, the Small Business Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001, \nwould provide emergency relief, through affordable, low-interest Small \nBusiness Administration Disaster loans, to small businesses adversely \naffected by, or likely to be adversely affected by, significant \nincreases in the prices of four heating fuels--heating oil, propane, \nkerosene, and natural gas.\n  Who are these business owners? They are the self-employed who work \nout of their homes and can't turn down the thermostat to 55 degrees \nwhile they are at the office from 8 am to 6 pm. They are the home \nheating oil distributers who see the price of their inventory skyrocket \nbeyond the reach of their credit lines and cash flows. They are the \nMom-and-Pop stores, local restaurants and corner cafes that need to \nkeep a warm place for folks to enjoy. They are the small day-cares for \nchildren and nursing homes for the elderly.\n  According to Department of Energy statistics, the cost of heating \nfuel has been highly volatile in recent years. For example,\n  The cost of heating oil nationally climbed 72 percent from February \n1999 to February 2000.\n  The cost of natural gas nationally climbed 27 percent from September \n1999 to September 2000.\n  And the cost of propane climbed 54 percent from January 2000 to \nJanuary 2001.\n  While these national fluctuations capture the larger market trends, \nthey do not demonstrate how some localities have been even harder hit \nby unpredictable and sudden price spikes because of a greater \ndependence on a single fuel, insufficient inventories, distribution \nproblems and other reasons. Last year in New England, for example, the \nthreat of a relatively common cold winter snap put such serious \npressure on the insufficient supply of heating oil that Massachusetts \ndeclared a state of emergency. With consumers at the mercy of a \nmarket--need up and supply down--the price of heating oil soared. In a \nmatter of weeks, the average price per gallon of heating oil fuel went \nup 60 percent, from $1.12 to $1.79. When operating costs rise \ngradually, small businesses have time to plan and adjust their pricing \nand operations accordingly. Rapid shifts in operating costs, however, \ncan disrupt a small company's business plans causing short-term cash \nflow difficulties. It is the kind of volatility that can make planning \nmonth to month as difficult as planning year to year.\n  Here's the situation. For those businesses in danger of or suffering \nfrom significant economic injury caused by crippling increases in the \ncosts of heating fuel, they need access to capital to mitigate or avoid \nserious losses. However, commercial lenders typically won't make loans \nto these small businesses because they often don't have the increased \ncash flow to demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. In fact, the \nMassachusetts Oilheat Council in Wellesley Hills, which is a state \ntrade association that represents the heating oil industry, and whose \nmembers deliver more than 60 percent of the heating oil to homes and \nbusinesses across the state, retailers of heating oil faced not only \n``stretched credit lines'' but even ``negative cash flows.'' Who is \ngoing to give you a loan when you have a negative cash flow?\n  To exacerbate the situation, banks have tightened their lending to \nsmall businesses by 45 percent over the past three months. According to \nthe Federal Reserve Board's quarterly survey on lending practices that \nwas released Monday, February 5th, banks surveyed said they have \ntightened credit to small businesses, particularly on riskier loans, by \nmaking borrowing more expensive and requiring customers to have less \noutstanding debt. They have changed their lending policies because they \nare concerned about ``a less favorable or more uncertain economic \noutlook . . . and a reduced tolerance for risk.'' While the banks say \nthat only a handful of borrowers canceled their plans under the \nstricter lending policies, I think the Federal Reserve Board's survey \nreinforces the need for this legislation.\n\n  You see, Mr. President, commercial lenders are unlikely to make the \ntype of loans we're talking about without an added incentive, such as a \nFederal loan guarantee. And last year I supported that approach to help \nsmall businesses deal with the heating oil problem by enlisting the \nSBA, its lending partners, and relevant trade associations to use and \npublicize the SBA 7(a) government guaranteed loan program to make loans \nto affected small businesses. In the 7(a) loan program, the bank makes \nthe loan, and the SBA guarantees 75 to 80 percent so that if the \nborrower can't repay the loan, the bank isn't on the hook for every \noutstanding dollar.\n  I wrote to the SBA. I called the Massachusetts Bankers Association, \nand I called individual bank presidents and asked them to use this tool \nfor affected small businesses and to aggressively market the \navailability of the 7(a) loans and SBA's other programs. Some of the \npublications helped to spread the word, including the Boston Business \nJournal and the Boston Herald. It was a real team effort.\n  While tapping into the SBA's guaranteed loan programs was helpful for \nsome, and one part of the solution, the heating fuel price spike has \nturned out to be more than a one-year anomaly and so there is a need to \ngo a step further--we need to make capital accessible to even more \nsmall businesses. We can do that through the SBA's Economic Injury \nDisaster Loans.\n  Economic injury disaster loans give affected small business necessary \nworking capital until normal operations resume, or until they can \nrestructure or change the business to address the market changes. These \nare direct loans, made through the SBA, at subsidized interest rates, \nof 4 percent or less, versus the current Federally guaranteed lending \nrate of Prime + 2\\1/4\\ percent, 10\\3/4\\ percent on Monday. Paying 4 \npercent versus almost 11 percent in interest makes a big difference to \nthat small business owner. Further, SBA tailors the repayment of each \neconomic injury disaster loan to each borrower's financial capability, \nenabling them to avoid the robbing Peter to pay Paul syndrome, as they \njuggle bills.\n  Clearly, these loans are much more affordable for the already \nstruggling small businesses, and, since time is of the essence, the \ninfrastructure is already in place to quickly distribute the loans. SBA \ndelivers disaster loans through four specialized Disaster Area Offices \nlocated in New York, Georgia, Texas and California. In addition, the 70 \nSBA District Offices can help small businesses learn the program and \ndirect the paperwork to the disaster offices. And there are the Small \nBusiness Development Centers in every state, with a network of more \nthan 1,000 service locations, the Business Information Centers, and the \nWomen's Business Centers to help small businesses seeking information \nabout and applying for these loans.\n  Building on the SBA's Disaster Loan Program so that small businesses \nadversely affected by the heating fuel prices are eligible to apply for \neconomic injury loans complements our efforts last year. I encourage \nSBA's lending partners to continue to publicize and provide guaranteed \nloans to affected small businesses. It creates a comprehensive approach \nto helping small businesses across the nation get the assistance they \nneed, and gives us one more way to assist in the success of our small \nbusinesses. And again, economic injury disaster loans are a reasonable \napproach to the problem.\n  By providing assistance in the form of loans which are repaid to the \nTreasury, the SBA disaster loan program helps reduce the Federal \nemergency and disaster costs, compared to other forms of disaster \nassistance, such as grants.\n  On practical terms, SBA considers economic injury to be when a small \nbusiness is unable, or likely to be unable, to meet its obligations as \nthey mature or to pay its ordinary and necessary operating expenses. To \nbe eligible to apply for an economic injury loan, you must be a small \nbusiness, you must have used all reasonably available funds, and you \nmust be unable to obtain credit elsewhere.\n  Under this program, the disaster must be declared by the President, \nthe SBA Administrator, or a governor at\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nthe discretion of the Administrator. Small businesses will have six \nmonths to apply from November 1, 2000 or, for future disasters, from \nthe day a disaster is declared.\n  This legislation will help those who have nowhere else to turn. We've \ngot the tools at the SBA to assist them, and I believe it's more than \njustified, if not obligatory, to use the economic injury disaster loan \nprogram to help these small businesses.\n  The volatile price jumps of heating fuels are tied to international \nfactors relating to larger energy issues--among them the supply and \ndemand of crude oil--and therefore beyond the control of small business \nowners. While you have scholars and industry experts making \nprognostications about whether the price spikes were temporary or here \nfor the long haul, I have grown weary of long-term prognostications. As \nYogi Berra is alleged to have said, ``Predictions are always difficult, \nespecially about the future.''\n  I believe small business owners can be cautious and budget for the \nproverbial rainy day, but I think it is unreasonable to expect that \nthey can anticipate, and afford to budget enough money to cover, price \njumps of 60 to 100 percent. And who can predict the weather, \nparticularly cold snaps during historically mild winter conditions? \nThese price spikes are largely unforeseeable, even though there will \nalways be the people who say, ``I told you so.''\n  Introducing this legislation is only a first step. We need to \nconsider it in Committee, Congress to pass it, and the President to \nsign if before it is too late to help struggling small business owners. \nI thank Senator Bond for his cooperation on this legislation, \nparticularly his willingness to expedite judicious consideration by the \nSmall Business Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. SBA's programs make \nrecovery affordable, and with the right support, can help mitigate the \ncost of significant economic disruption in your states caused when \naffected small businesses falter or fail, leading to job lay-offs and \nunstable tax bases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter to \nAida Alvarez be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Aida Alvarez,\n     Administrator, Small Business Administration,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Alvarez: I am writing to urge immediate \n     action on a critical problem facing small businesses in the \n     Northeast that deliver home heating oil. As you may know, the \n     price of home heating oil has increased dramatically in \n     recent weeks--as much as 80 to 100 percent in certain areas--\n     creating a tremendous burden on the financial resources of \n     several small companies. Many of these businesses do not have \n     the credit lines or cash flow to compensate for the price \n     increase and are in dire need of assistance.\n       As a general matter, home heating oil distributors develop \n     seasonal business plans, including credit lines, based on \n     anticipated oil prices, customer demand, customer repayment \n     schedules and obligations to repay suppliers. However, the \n     surge in heating oil prices exceeds what most businesses \n     could have possibly anticipated, and it has placed a \n     tremendous strain on several companies' cash-flow. \n     Compounding this problem is the fact that the repayment \n     schedules to pay suppliers is often considerably shorter than \n     the repayment schedules for customers. This problem is \n     becoming acute and is threatening the financial viability of \n     many small businesses in the home heating oil market place. \n     The financial failure of these small businesses has the \n     potential to extend far beyond the businesses themselves if \n     the delivery of the fuel to commercial and residential \n     consumers is disrupted.\n       SBA, with its network of district offices in every state, \n     is uniquely situated to respond quickly to this situation. On \n     behalf of the businesses and consumers affected by this \n     current price spike, I ask that you immediately start working \n     with SBA-participating lenders in affected states to expedite \n     short-term loans to credit-worthy home heating oil dealers.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this problem. I \n     am ready to facilitate this assistance in any way I can.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John F. Kerry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 296. A bill to authorize the conveyance of a segment of the Loring \nPetroleum Pipeline, Maine, and related easements; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Loring \nPipeline Reunification Act, a bill to authorize the conveyance of a \nsegment of the Loring Petroleum Pipeline from the U.S. Air Force to the \nLoring Development Authority, LDA, in Limestone, ME. The LDA will soon \ncontrol more than two-thirds of this pipeline as the result of a \nprocess that was initiated nearly 3 years ago. By conveying the \nremaining segment to the LDA with this bill and placing the pipeline \nunder the control of one entity, its value will\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nbe maximized as will its ability to foster the economic development of \nnorthern Maine.\n  The pipeline at issue originally was built to supply the Loring Air \nBase with fuel products critical to its mission. Prior to the base's \nclosure in 1994, Defense Fuels, now known as the Defense Energy Support \nCenter, DESC, would deliver fuel products by tanker to Searsport, where \nthe line originates, and then pump them through the line to the base. \nFor a period following the base closure, the Maine Air National Guard \ncontinued to use the Searsport to Bangor segment to supply their \nactivities in Bangor. After a study by Defense Fuels, however, the Air \nNational Guard changed their means of transporting fuel from pipeline \nto truck. Consequently, in 1999, the U.S. Air Force made the largest \nsegment of the pipeline, which runs from Bangor to Limestone, available \nto LDA for reuse. The Air National Guard supports the reunification of \nthis pipeline under LDA's control as does the Maine State Department of \nTransportation.\n  In consideration of the large geographical expanse of my State, the \noften treacherous winter driving conditions, and the fuel shortages \nthat have vexed the Northeast over the past two winters, I believe that \nthe reunification and return to use of this pipeline would serve the \npublic good in northern Maine. It would provide a safer and more \nefficient means of transporting fuel and, thereby improve the climate \nfor manufacturing and processing plants currently considering new \noperations in the economically challenged area surrounding Limestone.\n  It is also worth noting, that from a cost-avoidance perspective, my \nbill will save the U.S. taxpayer more than $100,000 which would \notherwise be required to support the administrative disposal of this \ncurrently unused pipeline. By passing this bill, the Senate and, \nultimately, the Congress can help expand the options and opportunities \nfor Aroostook County.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 298.

A bill to amend the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \nto require that Federal agencies consult with state agencies and county \nand local governments on environmental impact statements; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State and \nLocal Government Participation Act of 2001 which would amend the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. This bill is designed to \nguarantee that federal agencies identify state, county and local \ngovernments as cooperating agencies when fulfilling their environmental \nplanning responsibilities under NEPA.\n  NEPA was designed to ensure that the environmental impacts of a \nproposed federal action are considered and minimized by the federal \nagency taking that action. It was supposed to provide for adequate \npublic participation in the decision making process on these federal \nactivities and document an agency's final conclusions with respect to \nthe proposed action.\n  Although this sounds simple and quite reasonable, NEPA has become a \nreal problem in Wyoming and many states throughout the nation. A \nstatute that was supposed to provide for additional public input in the \nfederal land management process has instead become an unworkable and \ncumbersome law. Instead of clarifying and expediting the public \nplanning process on federal lands, NEPA now serves to delay action and \nshut-out local governments that depend on the proper use of these \nfederal lands for their existence.\n  The State and Local Government Participation Act is designed to \nprovide for greater input from state and local governments in the NEPA \nprocess. This measure would simply guarantee that state, county and \nlocal agencies be identified as cooperating entities when preparing \nland management plans under NEPA. Although the law already provides for \nvoluntary inclusion of state and local entities in the planning \nprocess, too often, the federal agencies choose to ignore local \ngovernments when preparing planning documents under NEPA. \nUnfortunately, many federal agencies have become so engrossed in \nexamining every environmental aspect of a proposed action on federal \nland, they have forgotten to consult with the folks who actually live \nnear and depend on these areas for their economic survival.\n  States and local communities must be consulted and included when \nproposed actions are being taken on federal lands in their state. Too \noften, federal land managers are more concerned about the comments of \nenvironmental organizations located in Washington, D.C. or New York \nCity than the people who actually live in the state where the proposed \naction will take place. This is wrong. The concerns, comments and input \nof state and local communities is vital for the proper management of \nfederal lands in the West. The State and Local Government Participation \nAct of 2001 will begin to address this troubling problem and guarantee \nthat local folks will be involved in proposed decisions that will \naffect their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1228-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1228-S1229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 7\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 7, a bill to improve public \neducation for all children and support lifelong learning.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n                                 S. 21\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 21, a bill \nto establish an off-budget lockbox to strengthen Social Security and \nMedicare.\n\n\n                                 S. 27\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), and the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 27, a bill to amend the Federal Election \nCampaign Act of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n\n                                 S. 88\n\n  At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the names of the Senator from \nVirginia (Mr. Warner), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) were added as cosponsors of S. 88, a \nbill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an incentive \nto ensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable access to the \nInternet over current and future generations of broadband capability.\n\n\n                                 S. 122\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Brownback) was added as a cosponsor of S. 122, a bill to prohibit \na State from determining that a ballot submitted by an absent uniformed \nservices voter was improperly or fraudulently cast unless that State \nfinds clear and convincing evidence of fraud, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 123\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Cochran) was added as a cosponsor of S. 123, a bill to \namend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend loan forgiveness for \ncertain loans to Head Start teachers.\n\n\n                                 S. 126\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cleland, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Durbin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 126, a bill to authorize \nthe President to present a gold medal on behalf of Congress to former \nPresident Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter in recognition of \ntheir service to the Nation.\n\n\n                                 S. 135\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from \nWashington (Mrs. Murray) was added as a cosponsor of S. 135, a bill to \namend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve payments for \ndirect graduate medical education under the medicare program.\n\n\n                                 S. 152\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), the \nSenator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nCleland), and the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 152, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto eliminate the 60-month limit and increase the income limitation on \nthe student loan interest deduction.\n\n\n                                 S. 170\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 170, a bill \nto amend title 10, United States Code, to permit retired members of the \nArmed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive both \nmilitary retired pay by reason of their years of military service and \ndisability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for \ntheir disability.\n\n\n                                 S. 174\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kerry, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Burns) was added as a cosponsor of S. 174, a bill to amend the \nSmall Business Act with respect to the microloan program, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 219\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dodd, the names of the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. L.

Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the chorus of \nthose singing the praises of Loretta Symms. Much as I hate to say it, \nLoretta will be retiring as Deputy Sergeant of Arms at the end of this \nweek.\n  We hear a lot of talk about bipartisanship these days--and that's \ngood. But Loretta Symms was the walking, breathing personification of \nbipartisanship before bipartisanship was cool.\n  She is a consummate professional. As Deputy Sergeant at Arms, one of \nLoretta's many responsibilities is greeting visiting dignitaries. Over \nthe years, she has escorted Presidents, Vice Presidents, foreign heads \nof state, and other visiting dignitaries through these hallways. In \nfact, she has probably met more foreign leaders than most Senators. She \nis a good and gracious ambassador for this institution.\n  When it comes to the Senate, no chore is too big for Loretta--or too \nsmall. I understand she even put on rubber gloves once to show her \nstaff how to clean. Her reverence for this building is something I \nshare, and one of the many reasons I like her. Loretta feels strongly \nthat the Capitol is the People's House. When visitors come here, she \nwants them to be treated with respect, and she wants them to be able to \nlearn something they may not have known before. That is why she works \nso closely with the staff who work directly with the public.\n  Loretta has also made a difference in the lives of people in this \nbuilding whom the public never sees. In her 14 years in the Sergeant at \nArms office, she started a broad array of training programs to help \nemployees sharpen their skills and advance their careers.\n  Beyond her considerable professional strengths, what I admire most \nabout Loretta are her personal qualities: her kindness, and her \ngenerosity of spirit.\n  She has given her time--and in some cases, her own financial \nresources--to help other members of our Senate family through difficult \ntimes.\n  Between them, Loretta and her husband, our former colleague Steve \nSymms, share seven children. Many parents of seven would not have time \nfor anyone else's children. But not Loretta. She is a surrogate Mom and \nconfidante to many of our Senate pages.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle also know they can count on \nLoretta to tell us honestly if she thinks we are wrong, and to \nencourage us when she thinks we are right. We will miss her good \nadvice, her kind smile--and much more. As Loretta and Steve begin this \nnext chapter in their lives, we wish them good luck and good health. We \nhope they have many great adventures, and we hope Loretta will come \nback to visit often.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 12, S. Con. Res. 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 6) expressing \n     sympathy for the victims of the devastating earthquake that \n     struck India on January 26, 2001, and support for ongoing aid \n     efforts.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor S. Con. Res. 6. \nThis concurrent resolution sends a message of sympathy and support to \nthe people of India, who have been struck by one of the worst natural \ndisasters to afflict their nation in the half-century since \nIndependence.\n  The earthquake which devastated the Western Indian state of Gujarat \nkilled untold thousands. The magnitude of this tragedy is demonstrated \nby the fact that 30,000 dead is now referred to as an optimistic \nestimate. Other sources, such as the Indian Minister of Defense, have \nsuggested a worst-case scenario of 100,000 dead.\n  As President Bush noted, a disaster such as this knows no national \nboundaries. The victims have been the people of India, but the burden \nof humanitarian relief rests on the shoulders of the entire world \ncommunity.\n  I congratulate the relief workers, from many nations, who have \nstepped up to the challenge. The most important work, of course, has \nbeen done by the Indians themselves tens of thousands of military and \ncivilian personnel who have labored tirelessly to help save the lives \nof those trapped in the wreckage.\n  Working alongside them have been search and rescue teams from \nBritain, Switzerland, Germany, Russia and Turkey. They helped locate \nvictims with state-of-the-art thermal sensors, and with specially-\ntrained canine units.\n  Following closely after the search and rescue teams have been medical \nunits from France, Japan, Israel, Denmark and NGOs like the \nInternational Federation of the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders. \nThese nations and groups have set up field hospitals and shipped in \nmedical supplies to tend to the needs of tens of thousands of wounded.\n  Many other countries have offered cash donations, food, tents, \nblankets, or other humanitarian assistance. Of these donor countries I \nwould like to single out Pakistan for particular commendation: in light \nof recent tensions, and of Pakistan's own losses in the earthquake--at \nleast a dozen dead, with a full reckoning not yet made--the shipment of \nrelief supplies was an important gesture of peace.\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n  The United States, for logistical reasons, has concentrated its \nefforts on providing potable water, shelter, and food to those rendered \nhomeless by the quake. USAID has already made several airlifts of vital \nmaterial, and more aid is in the pipeline.\n  When a disaster occurs at such a great geographical remove, US assets \nmight not always be the first to arrive on the spot. But once the US \ngears up for a challenge, it is equal to any task. The job of the world \ncommunity now is to make sure that the earthquake does not claim more \nvictims after the last tremors have ceased.\n  The basic human-needs infrastructure of Gujarat has, in many areas, \nbeen entirely wiped out: hundreds of thousands of people will be \neffected, to one degree or another. In a situation like this, diseases \nlike cholera or dysentery--easily preventable, with proper medical and \nnutritional facilities--can spread like wildfire. Simply insuring that \nthe dispossessed people have access to food, shelter, and clean water \ncan save countless lives.\n  We Americans are a compassionate people. But from the stark figures \nof relief provided and pledged, the extent of our compassion may not be \nclear. In the crucial first days following the disaster--when a dozen \nother countries were actively engaged in rescue and medical support--\nour financial pledge was one-third that of Great Britain, a million \ndollars lower than that of Germany, and a sum less than than the \ncombined pledges of Holland and Italy.\n  Our contribution has since risen, and I am told that it will continue \nto rise in the days and weeks to come. I certainly hope that it does. \nAnd when the time comes to fund the reconstruction of Western India's \nbasic infrastructure a task that will require more than $1 billion in \nloans from international financial organizations I hope that we will \ndemonstrate the full extent of our country's compassionate nature.\n  Today, as India works to save the lives of its citizens and mourns \nthe lives of those who could not be saved, our thoughts and prayers are \nwith the people of Gujarat. I hope that the United States will \naccelerate its efforts to put these thoughts and prayers into generous, \nconcrete action.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, the men and women who wear the uniform of \nthe United States Armed Forces have great abilities, supreme \ndedication, and they deserve the highest level of support that this \nNation can give them.\n  But despite outstanding military troops, a number of challenges lie \nahead for the Department of Defense, particularly in the area of \nallocating monetary resources. One of the first budget challenges that \nPresident Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld will face is how to improve \nmilitary readiness. By now, we are all familiar with the myriad \nproblems confronting our military forces today--recruitment and \nretention problems, crushing deployment burdens, aging ships and tanks \nand aircraft, a scarcity of spare parts--even a scarcity of ammunition \naccording to yesterday morning's Washington Post--substandard housing \nand outdated facilities--and the list can go on and on.\n  All of these factors affect readiness. All of these deficiencies will \nrequire money to correct. Already, representatives of the Joint Chiefs \nare lobbying the Senate Armed Services Committee for a supplemental \nappropriations bill to increase the current defense budget by perhaps \nas much as $10 billion. Presumably, the Services will get around to \nmaking their wishes known to the Appropriations Committee as well, \nsince it is that committee that actually has the responsibility over \nthe supplemental appropriations. But regardless of the tactics \nemployed, the supplemental is just the first sortie. Beyond the current \nbudget, we are bracing for the likelihood of requests for major leaps \nin defense funding--perhaps as much as $50 billion a year--just over \nthe horizon.\n  With that said, I was heartened to read President Bush's comments in \nMonday's New York Times, in which he called for a comprehensive review \nof Pentagon priorities and strategies before seeking funding increases \nfor modernization that make sense to me, it seems. Hopefully, President \nBush and Secretary Rumsfeld will be able to impose some order and \ndiscipline on the Pentagon budget process. That is probably going to be \na pretty big order--a pretty big order to impose some order and \ndiscipline on the Pentagon budget process.\n  Clearly, it is necessary to focus on defense, readiness, and national \nsecurity. The United States cannot afford to lose sight of the fact \nthat a strong defense is the key to national security. We must never \nrisk complacency in a world that encompasses the likes of Saddam \nHussein and Osama bin Laden; a world in which the proliferation of \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons represents a threat to our \nvery existence.\n  But before we consider how much more money we need to spend on \ndefense, I believe we should take a close look at how the Pentagon is \nmanaging the money and the assets it already has.\n  Now, one of our colleagues, Senator Grassley, has been very \ninterested in this same subject. It was his intention to speak this \nafternoon, but other matters have intervened, and he will speak on this \nsame subject one day next week.\n  Just recently, the General Accounting Office gave us a good insight \ninto the current situation with the release of a status report on the \nDefense Department's management of key programs and assets. The \nconclusions are disturbing. In six key areas--financial management, \ninformation technology, acquisitions, contracts, support \ninfrastructure, and logistics--the GAO found Defense Department \nmanagement practices to be vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement. Together, these deficiencies represent a tremendous \ndrain on the ability of the Defense Department to operate efficiently, \neffectively, and safely.\n  The GAO report put it starkly. Here is what it said: If these \nproblems are not addressed, the report stated, ``inefficiencies will \ncontinue to make the cost of carrying out assigned missions \nunnecessarily high and, more important, increase the risks associated \nwith those missions. Each dollar that is spent inefficiently,'' said \nthe report, ``is a dollar that is unavailable to meet other internal \nDepartment priorities such as weapon system modernization and \nreadiness.''\n  What is most disturbing to me is that, in program after program, \nmanagement procedures are so garbled that the General Accounting Office \ncannot even estimate--cannot even estimate--the level of inefficiency. \nThis is a critical knowledge gap when one considers the fact that the \nDefense Department accounts for about 15 percent of the entire Federal \nbudget, and roughly half of all discretionary spending--roughly half of \nall discretionary spending.\n  The Defense Department has a budget of about $310 billion a year and \nassets estimated at $1 trillion. Clearly,\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\nkeeping score when dealing with numbers of that magnitude is a huge \nchallenge. But it is a challenge that must be faced. In an agency as \nvast as the Defense Department, which has approximately 3 million \nmilitary and civilian employees, sloppy accounting and accountability \nprocedures can have enormous ramifications on personnel, on readiness, \nand on national security.\n  Some of the details of the GAO report are shocking. For example, in \nthe area of financial operations--just plain old bookkeeping in lay \nterms--the General Accounting Office reported that the Defense \nDepartment does not know with any certainty how much money it has \navailable, and its books are in such disarray that it cannot pass a \nstandard financial audit. Now, how about that? How about that? Let me \nrepeat that for emphasis: The Defense Department, which is talking \nabout needing an additional $50 billion dollars a year to meet \nreadiness requirements, does not know with any certainty how much money \nit currently has available and cannot pass the test of receiving a \nclean audit opinion on its financial statements.\n  Now, take that home with you and sleep on it. That is worth \nrepeating. The Defense Department--this is not Robert Byrd saying this. \nI am just repeating what the General Accounting Office, the arm of the \nCongress, reported: The Defense Department does not know with any \ncertainty how much money it has, and its books are in such disarray \nthat it cannot pass a standard financial audit.\n  The Defense Department, which is talking about needing an additional \n$50 billion--they want $50 more for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn; that is $50 billion--a year to meet readiness requirements. Yet \nthe Defense Department does not know with any certainty how much money \nit currently has available. It would seem to me that before Congress \nappropriates $50 billion more, we ought to know how much money the \nDefense Department has available.\n  It cannot pass the test of receiving a clean audit opinion on its \nfinancial statements; that, despite the fact the Chief Financial \nOfficers' Act of 1990 requires the Department of Defense to prepare \nannual audited financial statements. So the Defense Department is not \nliving up to the law, is it? The Chief Financial Officers' Act of 1990 \nrequires DOD to prepare annual audited financial statements. That was \n1990. Yet 10 years, 10 long years after the enactment of that law, DOD \nhas yet to produce financial statements that can be certified as \ncomplying with generally accepted accounting principles.\n  Examples of DOD's financial management weaknesses abound. For \ninstance, the GAO found that the Defense Department could not reconcile \na $7 billion difference between its available fund balances and the \nTreasury's. GAO also discovered that the Department of Defense was \nunable to substantiate the $378 billion it had reported as total net \nreporting costs in 1999. DOD was unable to substantiate the $378 \nbillion it reported as total net operating cost in 1999.\n  Given this lack of accountability, is it any wonder then that DOD is \nconstantly pressed for cash?\n  In the space of one year, from 1998 to 1999, the DOD recalculated its \nenvironmental and cleanup requirements, increasing estimated \nenvironmental liabilities from $34 billion to $80 billion. Despite the \nincrease, DOD still does not have a comprehensive inventory of all \npotential environmental and disposal liabilities. The final bill could \nbe billions of dollars more.\n  So here is the question I have: If the Department of Defense does not \nknow what it has in terms of assets and liabilities, how on Earth can \nit know what it needs?\n  Bookkeeping is only the tip of the iceberg. DOD's logistics \noperations, particularly inventory control, are a management nightmare. \nUnfortunately, this should come as no surprise to anybody. The DOD's \ninventory control practices have been flagged as inadequate and high \nrisk every year since the General Accounting Office began assessing \nhigh-risk areas a decade ago.\n  I was on the floor a decade ago talking about it, pointing out that \nthe inventories were huge and talking about the inventory control \npractices. It seems to me one of the television networks was doing a \npiece on this several years ago.\n  As a result, billions of taxpayer dollars are very probably being \nsquandered. According to the General Accounting Office, the Defense \nDepartment continues to stockpile more than it needs. I think that is \nwhat it was doing 10 years ago when we had the television networks \nlooking into that. It seems to me that it was Lesley Stahl, as I \nrecall--my memory may be playing tricks on me, but I believe it was \nLesley Stahl at that time--who was doing this, who went to where some \nof these inventories were stored and was doing a piece on that. Here we \nare 10 years later--same old problem.\n  As a result, billions of taxpayer dollars are very probably being \nsquandered. According to the General Accounting Office, the Defense \nDepartment continues to stockpile more than it needs. The television \nnetwork at that time--the particular channel, I don't remember--was \nsaying the same thing, bringing out the same thing. In the Baptist \nChurch, we have a song: ``Tell me the old, old story.'' Well, this is \nthe old, old story.\n  According to GAO, the Defense Department continues to stockpile more \nthan it needs, purchases items it does not need while at the same time \nmaintaining insufficient quantities of key spare parts, and is unable \nto keep track of material being shipped to and from military \nactivities. The General Accounting Office discovered that about half of \nDoD's $64 billion dollar inventory in spare parts, clothing, medical \nsupplies and other support items exceeds war reserve or current \noperating requirements. At the time GAO reviewed the accounts, DoD had \n$1.6 billion dollars worth of inventory on order that was not needed to \nmeet current requirements. GAO found that the Army had no way of \nknowing whether shipped inventory had been lost or stolen, and the \nNavy, in a 1999 review, was unable to account for more than $3 billion \nworth of shipped inventory, including some classified and sensitive \nitems.\n  And yet this bloated inventory is being amassed at a time when the \nPentagon admits that it is experiencing readiness problems due to a \nlack of key spare parts. According to GAO, insufficient quantities of \nspare parts is one of the primary reasons that airlift and aerial \nrefueling aircraft are performing below the Air Force's mission capable \nstandard rates.\n  GAO also red-flagged the Pentagon's 100 billion dollar a year weapons \nsystem acquisition program. The problems are pervasive: questionable \nrequirements; unrealistic cost, schedule, and performance estimates; \nquestionable program affordability; and high-risk acquisition \nstrategies. Simply put, in its rush to acquire the next new thing, DoD \nis riding roughshod over reality, compressing systems acquisition \ndecisions into unrealistic schedules and pursuing new weapons systems \nwilly-nilly without adequate testing and evaluation, regardless of \ncosts or the prospect of future funding, and despite a lack of reliable \nevidence that the systems can actually do what they are supposed to do.\n  Was it a mere coincidence in timing or merely a matter of time that \nthe GAO's questioning of DoD acquisition strategies involving the V-22 \nOsprey aircraft collided with headlines reporting allegations that a \nMarine Corps officer engineered the falsification of maintenance \nrecords to cover up problems with the Osprey?\n  In its report, GAO noted that the Navy was moving toward a full-rate \nproduction decision on the Osprey aircraft program without having ``an \nappropriate level of confidence that the program would meet design \nparameters as well as cost and schedule objectives.'' Subsequently, GAO \ncited evidence that Navy and Marine Corps officials, in an apparent \neffort to cut costs and stay on schedule, deleted or deferred tests on \nthe Osprey that could have revealed crucial information on system \nperformance.\n  The allegations of doctored records, as well as two crashes in the \npast year that killed 23 Marines, have resulted in the Osprey being \ngrounded, the production decision deferred, and numerous investigations \nlaunched. But the damage has been done.\n  Mr. President, the problems emerging from DoD's acquisition decisions \nfor the Osprey are alarming enough. Even more alarming is the chronic \nnature of these problems. The Osprey is\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\nonly the most recent questionable acquisition strategy to dominate the \nnews. As GAO noted, ``After having performed hundreds of reviews of \nmajor weapon systems over the last 20 years, we have seen many of the \nsame problems recur cost increases, schedule delays and performance \nshortfalls. The problems have proven resistant to reform in part \nbecause underlying incentives have not changed.''\n  It appears, from the data that GAO has gathered, that the Defense \nDepartment has fallen into the trap of making budget and management \ndecisions on the basis of wishful thinking, not facts. ``Overly \noptimistic planning assumptions'' is the way GAO framed it. As a \nresult, DoD has more programs than money.\n  For example, GAO found that although the Defense Department planned \nto increase funding for its $11 billion dollar Defense Health Program \nby $615 million dollars between 2001 and 2005, DoD officials admitted \nthat the program actually needed an extra $6 billion dollars during \nthat time. That, Mr. President, is a $6 billion dollar understatement \nof need. Defense Department officials admitted to GAO that they \nunderfund the health program in outyears to free up current funds for \nother defense programs. ``Overly optimistic'' in my opinion is an \noverly charitable way of characterizing that kind of deceptive \nbudgeting.\n  The General Accounting Office is not the only entity that has pointed \nout the flaws in DoD financial management practices. According to the \nDefense Department's own Inspector General's audit, the department's \nbooks are riddled with holes. The Inspector General found that 30 \npercent of all entries were made to force financial data to agree with \nvarious sources of financial data without adequate research and \nreconciliation, were made to force buyer and seller data to agree in \npreparation for eliminating entries, did not contain adequate \ndocumentation and audit trails, or did not follow accounting \nprinciples.\n  Something is wrong with this picture. At a time when the Defense \nDepartment is scrambling to make ends meet, there is no excuse to \ninvite waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement into the mix year after \nyear after year. These are not merely administrative headaches. Like a \nsteady trickle of water can wear away the mightiest foundation, \ninefficient management and sloppy bookkeeping can undermine the ability \nof America's men and women in uniform to carry out their \nresponsibilities efficiently, effectively, and safely.\n  GAO concluded that, ``Until DoD presents realistic assumptions and \nplans in its future budgets, the Congress will lack the accurate and \nrealistic information it needs to properly exercise its decision-making \nand oversight.'' That summation goes to the heart of the matter. \nCongress cannot make reasonable decisions on future budget needs for \nthe Department of Defense until DoD can offer a reliable budget basis \non which to proceed.\n  The Defense Department has been besieged by financial and related \nmanagement problems for years. We all understand that there is no quick \nfix. But we should also understand the magnitude of the problem, and \nthe impact that it has on readiness and the impact it will have on \ncongressional confidence, the impact it will have on congressional \nappropriations, the impact it will have on the taxpayer.\n  GAO is performing a valuable national service by identifying high-\nrisk management problems at the Defense Department, but Congress needs \nto do more than express dismay at the annual reports. It may cost money \nto modernize the Pentagon's financial systems, but it would be money \nwell spent, and could well pay for itself in a short period of time.\n  Mr. President, I raised the issue of DoD's financial management woes \nwith Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld at his nomination hearing before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. To his credit, Secretary Rumsfeld did \nnot attempt to gloss over the difficulties facing the Defense \nDepartment in improving its financial management systems. He pledged to \ntackle the problem, but he said that it would probably take outside \nhelp to find a solution, and that it could take a period of years to \nsort it out.\n  I urge Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush to make financial and \nperformance accountability in the Defense Department a top priority, \nand to work with the appropriate congressional committees to slay this \nparticular dragon once and for all.\n  As I said at the beginning of my statement, Senator Grassley will \nhave something to say on this matter next week. He has devoted much \ntime and thought to the problem. I am sure his concerns will continue. \nI look forward to working with him and others on the committee to try \nto be of assistance to the Department in cleaning up its act.\n  The United States has real national security problems to confront. We \ncan anticipate trouble from Saddam Hussein. Talk about all of these \nsurpluses that have been projected now for years away from the present \nday. Who knows what Saddam Hussein may do overnight? Remember when he \nwent into Kuwait? The world was shocked. America put a lot of men and \nwomen on the ground in the desert in the Middle East and a lot of money \non the barrel head. That can happen again. Saddam Hussein is probably \none of the most dangerous men in the world. There is no doubt about it. \nWe don't know what he is doing by way of developing chemical, \nbiological, and other weapons. He may threaten a neighboring state at \nany moment, and then watch those projections, those budget surpluses, \nvanish. We can anticipate trouble from him, and we must be ready for \ntrouble from other hot spots on the globe.\n  So we must invest in readiness. But we must also invest in \naccountability. The United States cannot afford to allow performance \nand accountability problems at the Defense Department to sap the \nstrength of our investment in readiness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/08/senate-section/article/S1238-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M., MONDAY, FEBRUARY 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
