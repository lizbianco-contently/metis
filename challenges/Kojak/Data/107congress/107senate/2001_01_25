Mr. President, it is my honor to welcome Father Jim \nTrainor to the Senate this morning, but I think it was his honor to be \nescorted to the President's chair by one of the great men of the \nSenate, Senator Strom Thurmond. I am sure one of the things that Father \nTrainor will take from this experience is, not particularly the fact \nthat he gets to see Senator Carper and me--he sees us all the time at \nhome--but the fact he got to meet Strom Thurmond, the legendary Strom \nThurmond.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you. That is kind of you.\n  Mr. BIDEN. When Father Trainor put his hand out--Senator Thurmond was \nintroduced to Father Trainor a moment before the prayer--he looked at \nSenator Thurmond and said: ``Senator, you are an inspiration.'' And you \nare an inspiration, Strom. You are an inspiration to all of us and you \nare a darned good friend of mine and I'm glad you got to meet my buddy, \nFather Jim Trainor.\n  My colleagues do not know this, but Father Trainor prays for us every \nSunday in Wilmington. I think he prays particularly hard for me because \nhe is always making an extra prayer--maybe the Irish part of him--\npraying for the politicians and public officials.\n  I say to the majority leader, Senator Lott, I go to a church called \nSaint Joseph's on the Brandywine, an old church that was built by the \nDu Pont family for ``their Irish'' back at the turn of the century, the \nturn of the 19th century, the early 1800s.\n  But my daughter and my wife like to go to Saint Patrick's Church, \nwhich is an inner-city church that, when I was a kid growing up, was in \nan Irish parish, and is now in the middle of the city and the parish is \npredominantly African American. It has become the haven for everyone in \nneed in the city. Father Trainor has been there for about 25 years and \nhas built and rebuilt that parish.\n\n  There is a long series of steps to go up to the church. It is an old-\nfashioned church where the actual church altar is on the second floor \nand below are all the meeting rooms. You walk up these two flights of \nstairs and occasionally--I know my colleagues will find this hard to \nbelieve--I am late.\n  It is such an honor to be invited here and an honor to have an \nopportunity to invite someone here. As you all know,\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\nthis invitation went out over 6 months ago, a long time ago.\n  So I made the mistake of walking in a little bit late this Sunday \nevening for 5 o'clock mass. As I walked in the door, I knew I made a \nmistake. It was like being back in school. Father Trainor was up in the \npulpit and I missed part of his sermon. He looked down to the \ncongregation and he said: By the way, one other thing I want to tell \nyou all. I want to tell you that I have had the great honor of being \ninvited to open a session of the U.S. Senate this week. It came from \nthe late Joe Biden--who just walked in the door. And then he proceeded \nto tell a story I hope he won't mind my telling.\n  He was standing in front of the entire congregation last Sunday--and \nby the way, this congregation attracts most of its people not from the \nparish. They are young professionals who come from all over the city to \ncome into that 5 o'clock mass at night because of Father Trainor. It is \nalways packed. It is literally standing room only. The few of us who \nare occasionally late, we stand a lot.\n  He told the following story: ``I want the congregation to pray for \nme,'' he said, ``because I hope I don't make the mistake I made the \nfirst time I was in Washington.''\n\n       I was a young seminarian, in graduate school, and I came to \n     Baltimore to drop off my trunk early in the summer. I had a \n     good friend with me who was wheelchair bound. It was his car. \n     We decided to go visit Washington. The only thing I remember \n     in Washington is everything is steps, steps, steps, steps. I \n     was a pretty tough guy, and I would take that wheelchair and \n     move it up the stairs.\n\n  He is going like this in the pulpit.\n\n       So we went all over the city. We finished up at the \n     Capitol.\n\n  That was before, thanks to Bob Dole and others, we had accessible \nentrances to our buildings in 1961 or 1962. I don't remember the exact \nyear.\n  He said:\n\n       I got to the Capitol steps and I looked up and said, \n     ``Sweet Lord, I can't do that.'' I walked around the side. \n     There was a nice Capitol Policeman there. I said, ``You guys \n     have elevators here?'' He said, ``Sure, bring your friend \n     in.'' I brought my friend in, and the officer said, ``You can \n     use those elevators. You can use them. I am sure they won't \n     mind because of the circumstances.''\n\n  Then two senatorial fellows got in the elevator and he said they both \nlooked at him.\n  He said:\n\n       I didn't know what to say.\n\n  I hope I am saying this accurately.\n  He said:\n\n       Senators, I am sorry we are in here, but the police officer \n     told us that because the other umbrella was broken, we could \n     take this umbrella to the second floor.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I hope I don't do that when I say my prayer this time.\n\n  I told him a story. The first time I came here, I was a student at \nthe University of Delaware. A number of my friends went to Georgetown, \nand I loved coming up here. On a Saturday morning, I came up. There was \nan unusual Saturday session which had just closed down.\n  There were no metal detectors. A lot of you guys worked here as pages \nand had experience as staff. I walked through the double doors. The \nSenate had just gone out. I just walked in. The doors were open. I \nwalked back by the Marble Room. No one was around. I opened the Chamber \ndoors, and I was in awe. I think we all felt that the first time we \never stood in this Chamber. I was in awe. Literally, it took my breath \naway.\n  I walked in, looked around, and I walked up and sat in the chair. I \nwas not being a wise guy. I was in awe. I sat down in the President's \nchair, looking out, and all of a sudden this officer grabs me, spins me \naround, and stands me up. He scared the devil out of me, \nunderstandably. He knew what I was doing and arrested me.\n  Most of you do not know that there is a police station downstairs \nunderneath this building. He took me down. By the time we got down \nthere, he realized I was just a college student in total awe of this \nplace.\n  I was elected to the Senate 10 years later. The first day I walked \ninto the Senate Chamber, and a police officer tapped me on the \nshoulder. He said: Do you remember me, Senator?\n  I said: No, I don't.\n  He said: I arrested you 10 years ago when you came in.\n  We both had inauspicious starts in the Senate. I say to you, Father, \nyour prayer was right on target, and the finish was much stronger than \nthe finish I have had. I thank you for being here.\n  I conclude by saying it is genuinely an honor for the State of \nDelaware to have a Senate host Chaplain today. Reverend Ogilvie, I \nthank you. You are a consummate gentleman, and I appreciate the \nhospitality you offered to Father and always to all of us in the \nSenate.\n  I note for the Record and say to my colleague from Delaware, Senator \nCarper, I only know of a total of three other Delawareans since I have \nbeen here who have ever been guest Chaplains. Senator Carper knows them \nall: Rabbi Kenneth S. Cohen from Congregation Beth Shalom was a guest \nChaplain in 1982, and Father Robert Balducelli from St. Anthony's \nParish. We need a little Irish levity brought into this. Now we have it \nall covered in my State. I thank you again, Father Trainor. I know the \nmajority leader wishes to speak. After he does, I want to ask \npermission to yield to my colleague from Delaware for brief comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the welcome speech from the \nSenator from Delaware, and I look forward to hearing from the other \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Welcome, Father Trainor. We all welcome you. Thank you for being \nhere. You and our Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie, mean a great deal, \nobviously, to the Senators from Delaware, but also to the spirit of our \ncountry. We thank you for being here this morning and being our guest \nChaplain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S558-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S558-S559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the Senate will now be in a period for \nmorning business and will adjourn after that morning business until 12 \nnoon on Monday. During Monday's and Tuesday's session, we will consider \nthree Cabinet nominations with the votes to occur at 2:45 p.m. on \nTuesday, unless we get an agreement for some change. Right now, \nSenators should expect recorded votes at 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday.\n  I must say early, so I will not be accused of not putting Senators on \nalert, already we are being squeezed on both ends of the week. Senators \nsay: Please don't have any votes after Wednesday night. Oh, please \ndon't have any votes before Tuesday night.\n  We are not going to be able to do that, and we are going to have to \nstart on Mondays. We are going to have to have votes on Tuesday \nmornings, Thursdays and Thursday nights, too. I realize it is early in \nthe session and we are not under the gun, but we do need to get done as \nsoon as possible the other nominations that have been agreed to so we \ncan move to the last nomination and debate and vote on that one.\n  Those votes on confirmation at 2:45 p.m. will be Elaine Chao to be \nSecretary of Labor, Gale Norton to be Secretary of the Interior, and \nGov. Christine Todd Whitman to be Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  I ask all Senators for their assistance. Senator Reid from Nevada is \nhere.

Mr. President, I certainly support the leader's efforts to \nhave us work a full workweek in the Senate Chamber. I do say we can \nreally develop some bad habits. I know our leader has already been \nrequested to see if we can get off on Wednesday nights. We really have \nto get started having some votes on more than 3 days a week.\n  I also say to the leader that we worked hard on this side, as I have \nindicated. There is a spirit of bipartisanship. I think that was helped \nyesterday with the meeting at the White House.\n  We really want to move these along, and the record should reflect, \nexcept for one nomination, Tuesday afternoon they will all have been \ncompleted. We hope in the foreseeable future we will be able to work \nthe final one, debate it, resolve it. Hopefully, that can be done \nexpeditiously.\n  We are willing to do the best we can. The record should reflect, with \nthe remaining nomination, there are tons of questions. I know the \ncommittees are trying to work their way through that so we can have \nthose answers so the debate can take place expeditiously.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond to Senator Reid's comments, \nwith regard to the questions that need to be answered by the designee \nto be Attorney General, former Senator Ashcroft, this very morning we \nworked to encourage that those questions be answered as quickly as \npossible and gotten to the committee. Hopefully, that will be done \ntoday, and I understand Senator Daschle, if that can be done, is going \nto work with us to see if we can move that nomination in a reasonable \ntime next week. I appreciate that very much.\n  Senator Reid touched on our meeting with the President yesterday \nmorning. It was a bipartisan, bicameral meeting. I thought it was a \nvery good meeting. Again, the President was reaching out to the \nCongress and to the American people through their leaders. That was the \nsixth meeting he has had with congressional leaders in only 3 days as \nPresident, or workweek as President. He did have Sunday.\n\n  It has been Republicans, Democrats, leaders on education, the elected \nleaders, but the thing I liked about it, it\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nwas not just an effort to reach out with platitudes of courtesy. We got \ninto a discussion on issues, not in great depth, but Senators and \nCongressmen were able to raise points of concern and interest.

Mr. President, I want to briefly thank Senator Biden for \ninviting Father Trainor to open this session of the Senate with the \nprayer that he has given. Senator Biden shared with us a story of his \nfirst visit here as a very young man, and his second visit, at 30 years \nold, when he was sworn into office, barely just old enough to take the \noath.\n  When I think of his youth, the first time he stepped into this room \nas a Senator, and the first time I stepped into this room as a Senator \nearlier this month, I am so old, they named me a member of the Aging \nCommittee. So there is a little bit of difference between his \nperception and mine. But I am delighted to be here and just thrilled to \nbe able to welcome Father Trainor today.\n  Joe Biden mentioned that Senator Thurmond is an inspiration to us \nall. I just want to say Father Trainor continues to serve as an \ninspiration to us all, whether we be Catholic--or in my case, \nProtestant--or some other faith.\n  St. Pat's is in the inner-city part of Wilmington. It is an urban \nparish and an urban ministry, but people actually worship there from \nall over the northern part of our State.\n  I will be privileged to worship there, too, in a month or 2 at the \nend of our St. Patrick's Day parade, which winds down and ends right at \nthe front door of St. Patrick's Church. We will go in and worship \ntogether--people of all faiths. We will appreciate the warm welcome, \nthe hospitality, and the grace that is shared at that time.\n  I want to say one other word, if I may, about St. Pat's and Father \nTrainor. In a passage of Scripture in the New Testament, Matthew 25, \npeople are gathered at the Heavenly Gates. Some are going to get in and \nsome are not, and those who are going to be extended the privilege of \nliving there forever in Heaven are told: When I was hungry, you fed me; \nwhen I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink; when I was naked, \nyou clothed me; when I was sick and in prison, you came to visit me.\n  I just want to say at St. Pat's, as much as any church, as much as \nany parish in our State, that litmus test is still adhered to. And for \nthose who are thirsty or hungry or homeless, or sick, they have a place \nto go.\n  I just want to say to Father Trainor, thank you for all that you do \nto make that the case and for sharing the Gospel with all of us and for \nreally serving as a wonderful example. We welcome you here today. I am \ndelighted to be able to be here to join with Senator Biden for this \nopportunity, and to say that the umbrellas still do work here, as \nSenator Biden alluded to earlier, and so do the elevators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S560-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S560-S562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDGE ROGER GREGORY\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the appointment of \nRoger L. Gregory to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \nand the pending approval process of the Senate.\n  Judge Gregory was appointed to the bench during the congressional \nrecess in December. He was sworn into office last Thursday, on January \n18, 2001, in Charlottesville, VA. To many, this recess appointment was \nunacceptable because the President had nominated Judge Gregory last \nsummer and he was never considered by the Senate or the Judiciary \nCommittee before adjournment sine die.\n\n  There are Senators who understandably believe that promises and \nunderstandings have been breached concerning recess appointments. \nHowever, it is my belief that in Roger Gregory, the Fourth Circuit--\nand, indeed, America--has a well-respected and honorable jurist who \nwill administer justice with integrity and dignity. He will, in my \njudgment, decide cases based upon and in adherence to duly adopted laws \nand the Constitution. I respectfully urge my colleagues and the \nadministration to join me in supporting Judge Gregory.\n  I want to share with you my observations, and let you all know a bit \nmore about Roger Gregory, the man.\n  Judge Gregory is a testament to what can be achieved in America \nthrough hard work and personal determination. He is the first person in \nhis family to finish high school. He went on to graduate summa cum \nlaude from Virginia State University, where his mother had once worked \nas a maid. He received his juris doctorate degree--his law degree--from \nthe University of Michigan and later taught at Virginia State as an \nadjunct professor. Before his investiture as a judge, as a founding \npartner of the firm of Wilder & Gregory, Judge Gregory was a highly \nrespected litigator representing mostly corporate and municipal clients \nin his hometown of Richmond, VA.\n  Last week, Roger Gregory became the first African American to be \nseated on the Fourth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  He has been active in many civic and community affairs. He and I both \nserved together on the Board of the Historic Riverfront Foundation in \nRichmond. He has served for many years on the board of directors of the \nChristian Children's Fund, the Richmond Renaissance Foundation, and the \nBlack History Museum, among others.\n  In 1983, Commonwealth Magazine named Roger Gregory as one of \n``Virginia's Top 25 Best and Brightest.'' In 1997, he was a recipient \nof the National Conference of Christians and Jews Award. He has an AV \nrating in Martindale-Hubbell, which is the highest combined legal \nability and general recommendation rating given to lawyers. He has been \na leader of the Old Dominion Bar Association, having served as \nPresident from 1990 through 1992.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to personally sit down and \ntalk with and kind of interview Judge Gregory. I am truly impressed and \ncomfortable with his judicial philosophy. Judge Gregory understands \nthat the judicial branch is not the legislative branch. He believes in \nthe rule of law and stated that he would adhere to precedents \nestablished by the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court to guide his \ndecisions.\n  During our conversation, Judge Gregory told me that he does not \nbelieve justice is what he called, ``result oriented,'' and instead, he \nbelieves the ``administration of justice is a process.'' He was firm in \nhis conviction that his charge as a judge is to ``follow the rule of \nlaw and not participate in an activist court; as result-oriented judges \nare very dangerous.''\n  Moreover, Judge Gregory articulated to me an appreciation of the \nrights, prerogatives, and powers reserved to the States in our Federal \nsystem. In particular, Judge Gregory believes the States have broad \npowers to regulate and pass laws, and that unless the law is clearly \nrepugnant and violates established constitutional principles, he \nbelieves the laws enacted by legislators should be upheld and respected \nby the courts.\n  Mr. President, and fellow Senators, I am cognizant that this body has \nthe prerogative of ``advice and consent'' and could deny Judge Gregory \na permanent appointment. No one should mistake my support of Judge \nGregory's\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\nconfirmation with approval of the manner in which the former President \nhandled this nomination.\n  At the time this nomination was first sent to the Senate last summer, \nI pledged to consider the nominee on his merits but took exception to \nthe lateness of the nomination. It seemed to me the timing was \ncalculated to accomplish a short-term political objective more than to \nachieve confirmation of a judge, and I felt that Mr. Gregory deserved \nbetter treatment.\n  Whatever the motive, the tardiness of the former President's action \nput the Senate in an impossible position. And the recess appointment \nhas only compounded the harm. Still, we must act in the best interest \nof the judiciary and the country. I ask my colleagues today to \nrecognize that no good for our judiciary or our country can be achieved \nby now striking back at the former President.\n  Let us rise above this procedural aggravation and act in a statesmen-\nlike manner.\n  Mr. President, I submit to you and to my colleagues that Judge Roger \nL. Gregory is an exemplary citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia. He \nhas a sense of the properly restrained role of the judiciary and is \neminently qualified to serve with distinction.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully ask my colleagues to hold the requisite \nhearing, after which I believe you will share my positive impression of \nJudge Roger Gregory, and thereafter confirm him to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nirrespective of the adjournment order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to advise my colleagues, I will not \ntake a lengthy period.\n  I commend my partner in the Senate, Senator George Allen, a man for \nwhom I have had the highest respect for so many years. We have worked \ntogether now for close to two decades, and this is our first joint \nappearance on the floor of the Senate; it is for a very important \nreason. I commend my colleague for his remarks and wish to associate \nmyself with each and every word he has said.\n  Mr. President, I met Judge Gregory on July 13, shortly after he was \nnominated, and thereafter I sent a letter to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in which I asked for hearings. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your willingness over the \n     past several weeks to repeatedly discuss with me the \n     nomination of Roger Gregory to serve as a judge on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n       I am confident that Roger Gregory would serve as an \n     excellent jurist on this distinguished court. I regret that \n     the President, for reasons unknown to me, did not nominate \n     Mr. Gregory until very near to the end of this Congress; \n     however, I remain steadfast in my belief that the Senate \n     should act on his nomination. Therefore, I once again \n     respectfully request that you schedule a confirmation hearing \n     for Mr. Gregory.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I have prepared a letter to the President of the United \nStates, George W. Bush, dated today, and my distinguished colleague has \njoined me in signing this letter. It is very short, and I shall read \nit:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: As a Virginian, Judge Roger Gregory is \n     now serving in the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit. The circumstances preceding his oath of \n     office taken on January 18, 2001 are well known.\n\n  In the course of this process, we publicly announced--\n\n  That is Senator Allen and myself--\n\n     our support for then nominee Gregory and requested that the \n     Judiciary Committee hold a confirmation hearing. Now, Judge \n     Gregory's future tenure on the Fourth Circuit rests with your \n     administration and, subject to your decision, then with the \n     Senate's Judiciary Committee and the full Senate under its \n     ``Advice and Consent'' responsibilities.\n       We continue to support Judge Gregory's nomination.\n       We have interviewed Judge Gregory, consulted with members \n     of the bar, Judiciary, and others throughout the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia about Judge Gregory's credentials. It is our \n     belief that Judge Gregory is a well qualified candidate who \n     will serve with distinction.\n       We fully respect the responsibilities you have to carefully \n     review the overall situation regarding the Fourth Circuit and \n     the views of the Chief Judge. Historically, Presidents have \n     sought to achieve geographic representation in a circuit with \n     members drawn from the several states within the circuit. It \n     may well be that following your review of the Fourth Circuit, \n     you will consider nominating or supporting a slate of \n     candidates to provide to each state within the Fourth Circuit \n     as a judge.\n       As you know, the Fourth Circuit serves the states of \n     Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and \n     Maryland. Currently, of the 11 judges sitting on the Fourth \n     Circuit, four are Virginians, three are South Carolinians, \n     two come from Maryland, and two are West Virginians.\n       We respectfully request that Judge Gregory's name be among \n     those names that you support for confirmation to the Fourth \n     Circuit.\n\n  Now, a few personal observations. I always go back to the \nConstitution and article I:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States. . . .\n\n  Then we proceed to article II:\n\n       The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the \n     United States. . . .\n\n  And lastly, article III:\n\n       The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in \n     one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the \n     Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The \n     Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold \n     their offices during good Behaviour. . . .\n\n  Three coequal branches of Government, and we are addressing an issue \nrelating to a member of a coequal branch of the Federal Government, a \nsitting Federal judge. In my judgment, despite all of the unusual \naspects of the nominating process, we should support this jurist, if \nfor no other reason, out of respect for the Senate towards the coequal \nbranch of another part of our Republic and the members therein.\n  Now, as I say, I interviewed him. I have known him. He is a law \npartner of one of our distinguished living former Governors, Governor \nWilder.\n\n  My colleague pointed out he would be the first African American on \nthe Fourth Circuit. It was my privilege many years ago, then as a \nrelatively junior Senator, to nominate an African American, the first \nin the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia, to serve in the Federal \njudiciary, James Spencer.\n  I say to my colleague, I am privileged to join with him in now \nsupporting this eminently qualified jurist for continuation on the \nFourth Circuit.\n  Out of respect to our former colleague, Senator Robb, we should note \nthat he was very much involved in the nomination process that preceded \nin the fall.\n  Lastly, I will say, with regard to the advice and consent role of the \nSenate, each time we exercise that important constitutional \nresponsibility--I guess I speak for myself--I consider the nominees of \na President are human beings, people with sensitivities that all of us \nhave, people who have families, people who have friends. I will have \nthat very much in mind as we proceed to consideration of our role with \nregard to Judge Gregory. Sometimes we lose sight of that. Couple that \nwith the fact that we are examining a member of a coequal branch of our \nFederal Government and of our Republic. For that reason we should \naccord him every respect we can.\n  Nevertheless, we shall examine thoroughly such qualifications as our \ncolleagues wish to raise. It is my hope and, indeed, my expectation \nthat eventually this Chamber will render its advice and consent such \nthat Judge Gregory may continue as a member of the Fourth Circuit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the reasons why the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia is so well respected in this place is not only the fact \nthat he is a consummate gentleman, but he pays\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\ntribute to and honors the traditions of this great place.\n  I am aware that today was the maiden speech of his new colleague and \nour new colleague, the former Governor of Virginia.\n  I recall 28 years ago, when I got here, one's maiden speech was taken \nin a much more formal way, not by the speaker but by other Members of \nthe Senate. I remember when I made my first speech, Senator John \nStennis, Senator Allen, Senator Mansfield, Senator Javits all came and \nsat. I don't even remember what it was. It was an innocuous speech. \nThey were all gracious enough to sit, turn their chairs, and act as if \nI was delivering the Declaration of Independence. I appreciated it very \nmuch.\n  Unlike my maiden speech, the maiden speech of the former Governor of \nthe State of Virginia portends well for this body. To come here in the \nfirst speech he makes, to be in support of not the process but the \nperson, who the Senators from Virginia could easily have concluded, \nbecause it was a Democratic nominee originally, should no longer remain \non the bench because of the recess appointment and the manner in which \nit was taken, I take the speech of the Senator from Virginia to be more \nthan merely about the nominee, who I agree is incredibly well \nqualified, having sat on the Judiciary Committee and sitting on the \nJudiciary Committee and being aware of his background.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, for making a maiden \nspeech that meant something, that meant something about an individual \nand sent a signal to this body that I hope we on both sides of the \naisle emulate for the next 2 years; that is, that we should look beyond \npartisan advantage and look to quality, the quality of what we are \ndoing.\n  I compliment him on his maiden speech. I compliment him on the \nsubstance of the speech. I compliment my friend from Virginia, senior \nSenator, for being here. Senator Allen could have spoken about the \ndome, and he would have been here because that is the nature of the \nman. He understands the traditions of this place. They mean something. \nI am glad I get to serve with him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my profound appreciation and \nrespect for my colleague from Delaware. We have enjoyed a very warm, \npersonal, and professional relationship throughout my 23 years. I note \nthat my colleague from Delaware has been here a number of years beyond \nthat.\n  And I don't know of any Members, except maybe Senator Byrd or Senator \nThurmond, who feel more deeply about the traditions here than my \ncolleague from Delaware. I believe this morning was the longest speech \non record with regard to a visiting member of the clergy, but it was \nheartfelt and it was fascinating to sit and listen.\n  These are some of the rare moments we share in this great institution \nwhen events such as that take place. I commend him and thank him. I \nknow Senator Biden is the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand he is well experienced regarding judicial nominations and the \nadvice and consent role. Indeed, you noted the maiden speech of George \nAllen. The majority leader leaned over a few minutes ago and said \nbeneath the tones of the system here, ``Usually, we wait 3 months.''\n  Two of us reminded the leader that this is a very important subject \nand one on which, indeed, the Senator could have extolled other \naspects, particularly regarding education. But I think he chose the \nsubject wisely, I say to my colleague from Virginia, and he chose the \ntime wisely, because we should be without a moment's doubt in the minds \nof our colleagues about our support for this nominee and, indeed, our \nrespect for the judicial branch.\n  I thank my colleague for the privilege of joining him today, and I \ncommend him for his remarks. I also thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business notwithstanding the order \nfor the recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This document, dated December 31, 2000 is titled a \n``Review and Report on the Applicability to the Legislative Branch of \nFederal Laws Relating to Terms and Conditions of Employment and Access \nto Public Services and Public Accommodations.''\n  Section 102(b) requires this report to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, and referred to committees with jurisdiction. \nTherefore, I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the \nRecord and that the report be appropriately referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Section 102(b) Report--Review and Report on the Applicability to the \nLegislative Branch of Federal Laws Relating to Terms and Conditions of \n   Employment and Access to Public Services and Public Accommodations\n\n    (Prepared by the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n pursuant to section 102(b) of the Congressional Accountability Act of \n            1995, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(b), December 31, 2000)\n\n       Section 102(a) of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) lists the eleven laws that, ``shall apply, as \n     prescribed by this Act, to the legislative branch of the \n     Federal Government.'' 1 Section 102(b) directs the \n     Board of Directors (Board) of the Office of Compliance \n     (Office) to: ``review provisions of Federal law (including \n     regulations) relating to (A) the terms and conditions of \n     employment (including hiring, promotion, demotion, \n     termination, salary, wages, overtime compensation, benefits, \n     work assignments or reassignments, grievance and disciplinary \n     procedures, protection from discrimination in personnel \n     actions, occupational health and safety, and family and \n     medical and other leave) of employees, and (B) access to \n     public services and accommodations.''\n       ``And, on the basis of this review, ``[b]eginning on \n     December 31, 1996, and every 2 years thereafter, the board \n     shall report on\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\n     (A) whether or to what degree the provisions described in \n     paragraph (1) are applicable or inapplicable to the \n     legislative branch, and (B) with respect to provisions \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch, whether such \n     provisions should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch.''\n\n\n                             I. Background\n\n       In December of 1996, the Board completed its first biennial \n     report mandated under section 102(b) of the CAA (1996 Section \n     102(b) Report or 1996 Report).2 In that Report the \n     Board reviewed and analyzed the universe of federal law \n     relating to labor, employment and public access, made initial \n     recommendations, and set priorities for future reports. To \n     conduct its analysis, the Board organized the provisions of \n     federal law according to the kinds of entities to which they \n     applied, and systematically analyzed whether and to what \n     extent they were already applied to the legislative branch or \n     whether the legislative branch was already covered by other \n     comparable legislation. This analysis generated four \n     comprehensive tables of laws which were categorized as: (1) \n     provisions of law generally applicable in the private sector \n     and/or in state and local government that also are already \n     applicable to entities in the legislative branch, a category \n     which included nine of the laws made applicable by the CAA; \n     (2) provisions of law that apply only in the federal sector, \n     a category which included the two exclusively federal-sector \n     laws applied to the legislative branch by the CAA; (3) \n     private-sector and/or state- and local-government provisions \n     of law that do not apply in the legislative branch, but \n     govern areas in which Congress has already applied to itself \n     other, comparable provisions of law and; (4) private-sector \n     laws which do not apply or have only very limited application \n     in the legislative branch.\n       The Board then turned to its task of recommending which \n     statutes should be applied to the legislative branch. In \n     light of the large body of statutes that the Board had \n     identified and reviewed, the Board determined that it could \n     not make recommendations concerning every possible change in \n     legislative-branch coverage. In setting its priorities for \n     making recommendations from among the categories of statutes \n     that the Board had identified for analysis and review, the \n     Board sought to mirror the priorities of the CAA. Because \n     legislative history suggested that the highest priority of \n     the CAA was the application of private-sector protections to \n     congressional employees where those employees had little or \n     no protection, the Board focused its recommendations in its \n     first report on applying the private-sector laws not \n     currently applicable to the legislative branch.\n       The Board also determined in its 1996 Section 102(b) Report \n     that, because of the CAA's focus on coverage of the Congress \n     under private-sector laws, the Board's next priority should \n     be to review the inapplicable provisions of the nine private-\n     sector laws generally made applicable by the CAA. In December \n     1998 the Board set forth the results of that review in its \n     second biennial report under Section 102(b) of the CAA (1998 \n     Section 102(b) Report or 1998 Report).3\n       The 1998 Section 102(b) Report was divided into three \n     parts. In Part I the Board reviewed laws enacted after the \n     1996 Section 102(b) Report, resubmitted the recommendations \n     made in its 1996 Report, and made additional recommendations \n     as to laws which should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch. In Part II the Board analyzed which provisions of the \n     private-sector CAA laws do not apply to the legislative \n     branch and recommended which should be made applicable. In \n     Part III of the 1998 Report, although not required by section \n     102(b) of the CAA, the Board reviewed coverage of the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO), the Government Printing Office (GPO) \n     and the Library of Congress (the Library) under the laws made \n     applicable by the CAA and made recommendations to Congress \n     with respect to changing that coverage. The Board noted that \n     the study mandated by Section 230 of the CAA which was \n     submitted to Congress in 1996 4 did not include \n     recommendations to Congress with respect to coverage of these \n     three instrumentalities.5 The Board concluded that \n     the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, which focused on omissions in \n     coverage of the legislative branch under the laws generally \n     made applicable by the CAA, provided the opportunity for the \n     Board to make recommendations to Congress regarding coverage \n     of GAO, GPO and the Library under those laws.6 As \n     discussed in Section IV.C below, the Board Members identified \n     three principal options for Congress to consider but were \n     divided in their recommendation as to which option was \n     preferable.\n       In the preparation of this 2000 Section 102(b) Report, the \n     third biennial report issued under section 102(b) of the CAA, \n     the Board has reviewed new statutes or statutory amendments \n     enacted after the Board's 1998 Section 102(b) Report was \n     prepared. The Board has also reviewed the Section 102(b) \n     reports issued in 1996 and 1998 and the analysis and \n     recommendations contained therein.\n\n\n    II. Review of Laws Enacted after the 1998 Section 102(b) Report\n\n       After reviewing all federal laws and amendments relating to \n     terms and conditions of employment or access to public \n     accommodations and services passed since October 1998, the \n     Board concludes that there are no new provisions of law which \n     should be made applicable to the legislative branch. As in \n     the two previous Section 102(b) reports, the Board excluded \n     from consideration those laws that, although employment-\n     related, (1) are specific to narrow or specialized industries \n     or types of employment not found in the legislative branch \n     (e.g., employment in fire protection activities, or the armed \n     forces); (2) established government programs of research, \n     data collection, advocacy, or training, but do not establish \n     correlative rights and responsibilities for employees and \n     employers (e.g., statutes authorizing health care research); \n     (3) authorize, but do not require, that employers provide \n     benefits to employees, (e.g., so-called ``cafeteria plans''); \n     or (4) are not applicable to public sector employment (e.g., \n     an amendment clarifying the treatment of stock options under \n     the FLSA).\n\n\n                    III. 1996 Section 102(b) Report\n\n       In preparation for the first Section 102(b) Report, as \n     noted earlier, the Board reviewed the entire United States \n     Code to identify laws and associated regulations of general \n     application that relate to terms and conditions of employment \n     or access to public services and accommodations. Noting the \n     underlying priorities of the Act itself, the Board chose to \n     focus its 1996 Report on the identified provisions of law \n     generally applicable in the private sector for which there \n     was no similar coverage in the legislative branch. The Board \n     has reviewed the 1996 Section 102(b) Report and the \n     recommendations contained therein, as well as the additional \n     discussion of those recommendations found in the 1998 Section \n     102(b) Report.\n       The Board of Directors again submits the following \n     recommendations which were made in the 1996 Section 102(b) \n     Report and resubmitted in the 1998 Section 102 (b) Report:\n       (A) Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of \n     bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. Sec. 525).--Section 525(a) provides \n     that ``a governmental unit'' may not deny employment to, \n     terminate the employment of, or discriminate with respect to \n     employment against, a person that is or has been a debtor \n     under the bankruptcy statutes. The provision currently does \n     not apply to the legislative branch. For the reasons set \n     forth in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, the board has \n     determined that the rights and protections against \n     discrimination on this basis should be applied to the \n     legislative branch.\n       (B) Prohibition against discharge from employment by reason \n     of garnishment (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1674(a)).--Section 1674(a) \n     prohibits discharge of any employee because his or her \n     earnings ``have been subject to garnishment for any one \n     indebtedness.'' This section is limited to private employers, \n     so it currently has no application to the legislative branch. \n     For the reason set forth in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, \n     the Board has determined that the rights and protections \n     against discrimination on this basis should be applied to the \n     legislative branch.\n       (C) Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of jury \n     duty (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1875).--Section 1875 provides that no \n     employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, \n     or coerce any permanent employee by reason of such employee's \n     jury service, or the attendance or scheduled attendance in \n     connection with such service, in any court of the United \n     States. This section currently does not cover legislative-\n     branch employment. For the reason set forth in the 1996 \n     Section 102(b) Report, the Board has determined that the \n     rights and protections against discrimination on this basis \n     should be applied to the legislative branch.\n       (D) Titles II and III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2000a to 2000a-6, 2000b to 2000b-3).--These \n     titles prohibit discrimination or segregation on the basis of \n     race, color, religion, or national origin regarding the \n     goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n     accommodations of ``any place of public accommodation'' as \n     defined in the Act. Although the CAA incorporated the \n     protections of titles II and III of the ADA, which prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to \n     access to public services and accommodations, it does not \n     extend protection against discrimination based upon race, \n     color, religion, or national origin with respect to access to \n     such services and accommodations. For the reasons set forth \n     in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, the Board has determined \n     that the rights and protections afforded by titles II and III \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against discrimination with \n     respect to places of public accommodation should be applied \n     to the legislative branch.\n\n\n                     IV. 1998 Section 102(b) Report\n\n     A. Part I of the 1998 Report (new laws enacted and certain \n         other inapplicable laws)\n       In the first part of the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, the \n     Board noted the enactment of two new employment laws and \n     concluded that no further action was needed because \n     substantial provisions of each had been made applicable to \n     the legislative branch. Next, as noted above, the Board \n     discussed and resubmitted the recommendations made in the \n     1996 Section 102(b) Report. In addition, the Board made three \n     new recommendations, one based upon further review and \n     analysis of statutes discussed in the 1996 Section 102(b) \n     Report and two others based upon experience gained by the \n     Board in the administration and enforcement of the CAA.\n       The Board of Directors resubmits the three new \n     recommendations made in Part I of the 1998 Section 102(b) \n     Report:\n       (1) Employee protection provisions of environmental \n     protection statutes (15 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\n     Sec. 2622; 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1367; 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 300J-\n     9(i), 5851, 6971, 7622, 9610).--These provisions generally \n     protect an employee from discrimination in employment because \n     the employee commences proceedings under applicable statutes, \n     testifies in any such proceeding, or assists or participates \n     in any way in such a proceeding or in any other action to \n     carry out the purposes of the statutes. For the reasons \n     stated in the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, the Board believes \n     that these provisions are applicable to the legislative \n     branch. However, because it is possible to construe certain \n     of these provisions as inapplicable, the Board has concluded \n     that legislation should be adopted clarifying that the \n     employee protection provisions in the environmental \n     protection statutes apply to all entities within the \n     legislative branch.\n       (2) Employee ``whistleblower'' protection.--Civil service \n     law 7 provides broad protection to \n     ``whistleblowers'' in the executive branch and at GAO and \n     GPO, but these provisions do not apply otherwise in the \n     legislative branch. Employees subject to these provisions are \n     generally protected against retaliation for having disclosed \n     any information the employee reasonably believes evidences a \n     violation of law or regulation, gross mismanagement or abuse \n     of authority, or substantial danger to public health or \n     safety. The Office has continued to receive a number of \n     inquiries from legislative branch employees concerned about \n     protection against possible retaliation by an employing \n     office for the disclosure of what the employee perceives to \n     be such information. For the reasons set forth in the 1998 \n     Section 102(b) Report, the Board has determined that \n     whistleblower protection comparable to that provided to \n     executive branch employees under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2302(b)(8) \n     should be provided to legislative branch employees.\n       (3) Coverage of special-purpose study commissions.--Certain \n     special-purpose study commissions that include members \n     appointed by Congress or by officers of Congressional \n     instrumentalities are not expressly listed in section 101(9) \n     of the CAA in the definition of ``employing offices'' covered \n     under the CAA. For the reasons set forth in the 1998 Section \n     102(b) Report, the Board recommends that Congress \n     specifically state whether the CAA applies to special-purpose \n     study commissions, both when it creates such commissions and \n     for those already in existence.\n     B. Part II of the 1998 Report (inapplicable private-sector \n         provisions of CAA laws)\n       In the second part of the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, the \n     Board considered the specific exceptions created by Congress \n     from the nine private-sector laws made applicable by the CAA \n     8 and made a number of recommendations respecting \n     the application of currently inapplicable provisions, \n     ``focusing on enforcement, the area in which Congress made \n     the most significant departures from the private-sector \n     provisions of the CAA laws'.9 The Board noted that \n     it intended that those recommendations ``should further a \n     central goal of the CAA to create parity with the private \n     sector so that employers and employees in the legislative \n     branch would experience the benefits and burdens as the rest \n     of the nation's citizens''.10\n       The Board of Directors has reviewed the 1998 Report and \n     resubmits each of the following recommendations made in Part \n     III of the 1998 Section 102(b) Report:\n       (1) Authority to investigate and prosecute violations of \n     Sec. 207 of the Act, which prohibits intimidation and \n     reprisal.--Enforcement authority with respect to intimidation \n     or reprisal is provided to the agencies that administer and \n     enforce the CAA laws 11 in the private sector. For \n     the reasons set forth in the 1998 Report, the Board has \n     concluded that the Congress should grant the Office the same \n     authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of \n     intimidation or reprisal as each implementing Executive \n     Branch agency has in the private sector.\n       (2) Authority to seek a restraining order in district court \n     in case of imminent danger to health or safety.--Section \n     215(b) of the CAA provides the remedy for a violation of the \n     substantive provisions of the OSHAct made applicable by the \n     CAA. Among other things, the OSHAct authorizes the Secretary \n     of Labor to seek a temporary restraining order in district \n     court in the case of imminent danger. The General Counsel of \n     the Office, who enforces the OSHAct provisions as made \n     applicable by the CAA, has concluded that Section 215(b) of \n     the CAA gives him the same standing to petition the district \n     court for a temporary restraining order. However, it has been \n     suggested that the language of section 215(b) does not \n     clearly provide that authority. For the reasons set forth in \n     the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, the Board recommends that the \n     CAA be amended to clarify that the General Counsel has the \n     standing to seek a temporary restraining order in federal \n     district court and that the court has jurisdiction to \n     issue the order.\n       (3) Record-keeping and notice-posting requirements.--For \n     the reasons set forth in the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, the \n     Board has concluded that the Office should be granted the \n     authority to require that records be kept and notices posted \n     in the same manner as required by the agencies that enforce \n     the provisions of law made applicable by the CAA in the \n     private sector.\n       (4) Other enforcement authorities.--For the reasons set \n     forth in the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, the Board generally \n     recommends that Congress grant the Office the remaining \n     enforcement authorities that executive-branch agencies \n     utilize to administer and enforce the provisions of law made \n     applicable by the CAA in the private sector.\n     C. Part III of the 1998 Report (options for coverage of the \n         three instrumentalities)\n       In the third part of the 1998 Report, the Board, building \n     upon its extensive Section 230 Study, exhaustively re-\n     examined the current coverage of GAO, GPO and the Library \n     under the CAA laws, and identified and discussed three \n     principal options for coverage of these instrumentalities:\n       (A) CAA Option.--Coverage under the CAA, including the \n     authority of the Office of Compliance as it administers and \n     enforces the CAA. (The Board here took as its model the CAA \n     as it would be modified by enactment of the recommendations \n     made in Part II of its 1998 Report.)\n       (B) Federal-Sector Option.--Coverage under the statutory \n     and regulatory regime that applies generally in the federal \n     sector, including the authority of executive-branch agencies \n     as they administer and enforce the laws in the federal \n     sector.\n       (C) Private-Sector Option.--Coverage under the statutory \n     and regulatory regimes that apply generally in the private \n     sector, including the authority of the executive-branch \n     agencies as they administer and enforce the laws in the \n     private sector.\n       The Board noted that other hybrid models could be developed \n     or, it could ``be possible to leave the `patchwork' of \n     coverages and exemptions currently in place at the three \n     instrumentalities and fill serious gaps in coverage on a \n     piecemeal basis.'' 12\n       The Board compared the three options against the current \n     regimes at GAO, GPO and the Library, as well as against each \n     other, and identified the significant effects of applying \n     each option. The Board unanimously concluded that coverage \n     under the private sector model was not the best of the \n     options. However, the Board was divided as to which of the \n     remaining options should be adopted. Two Board Members \n     recommended that the three instrumentalities be covered under \n     the CAA, with certain modifications, and two other Board \n     Members recommended that the three instrumentalities be made \n     fully subject to the laws and regulations generally \n     applicable in the executive branch of the federal sector. \n     13\n       A review of the analysis, discussion and recommendations \n     contained in the Section 230 Study and Part III of the 1998 \n     Section 102(b) Report demonstrates the complexity of the \n     issues relating to coverage of GAO, GPO and the Library under \n     the CAA laws. The current regime is an exceedingly \n     complicated one, with differences evident both between and \n     among instrumentalities and between and among the eleven CAA \n     laws. Any proposals for changes in existing coverage must not \n     only take into account the existing statutory regime, but \n     also the practical effects of any recommended changes, as \n     well as the mandates of the CAA, including Section 230. \n     Indeed, the degree of the difficulties and challenges \n     encountered in determining how the coverage of the \n     instrumentalities might be modified is evidenced by the fact \n     that after three years of study and experience, the Members \n     of the Board in 1998 were unable to arrive at a consensus on \n     the manner in which the CAA laws should be applied and \n     enforced at GAO, GPO and the Library.\n       While the current Board Members are mindful of the \n     institutional benefits of providing Congress with a clear \n     recommendation as to coverage of the instrumentalities, the \n     Board is of the view that further study and consideration of \n     the questions presented is warranted in light of the \n     complexity of the issues and the substantial impact that a \n     modification would have on the instrumentalities and their \n     employees.\n       The Board believes that Congress, and the instrumentalities \n     and their employees, would derive greater benefit from a \n     recommendation based upon further study, consideration and \n     experience on the part of Board Members. Therefore, the Board \n     has determined not to make any recommendations with respect \n     to coverage of GAO, GPO and the Library under the CAA laws at \n     this time.\n\n\n                                ENDNOTES\n\n       1 The nine private-sector laws made applicable \n     by the CAA are: the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C.

Mr. President, the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board \nrecently completed a review of the Department of Energy's (DOE) \nnonproliferation programs with Russia and released a report card \nassessing the contributions and needs of those programs. Two renowned \nAmericans, former Senator Howard Baker and Lloyd Cutler, served as co-\nchairmen of a bipartisan task force comprised of technical experts, \nrespected academicians and distinguished Congressmen and Senators from \nboth political parties representing both chambers of the Congress. My \ncolleagues will be interested to know that former Senators on the task \nforce included Senators Baker, Boren, Hart, McClure, Nunn, and Simpson. \nFormer House Members included Representatives Derrick, Hamilton, and \nSkaggs. In short, this task force brought together an experienced \nbipartisan group of esteemed experts whose views are well respected to \nexamine the status of DOE's nonproliferation programs with Russia. The \nreport they have produced should be required reading for everyone \nconcerned about what the nation needs to do to meet our most important \nnational security requirements.\n  No one could question that the greatest risks of proliferating \nweapons and materials of mass destruction (WMD) come from the massive \nWMD infrastructure left behind when the Soviet Union dissolved. Experts \nestimate that the former Soviet Union produced more than 40,000 nuclear \nweapons and left behind a huge legacy of highly enriched uranium (HEU) \nand plutonium---enough to build as many or more than 40,000 additional \nnuclear weapons. We are just now beginning to comprehend the vast \nquantities of chemical and biological weapons produced in the former \nSoviet Union. We have learned much about the stockpiles of nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical materials that still exist in today's Russia. \nWe have a fuller understanding of the extensive industrial \ninfrastructure in Russia which is still capable of conducting research \nand producing such weapons. We are anxiously aware of the thousands of \nexperienced Russian scientists and technicians who worked in that \ncomplex, many of whom are in need of a stable income.\n  Those huge numbers assume frightening implications when one considers \nthat two years ago, conspirators at a Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy \nfacility were caught trying to steal nuclear materials almost \nsufficient to build a nuclear weapon. At the same time, the mayor of \nKrasnoyarsk, a closed ``nuclear city'' in the Russian nuclear weapons \ncomplex, warned that a popular uprising was unavoidable in his city \nsince nuclear scientists and other workers had not been paid for many \nmonths and that basic medical supplies were not available to serve the \npopulation. In December, 1998, Russian authorities arrested an employee \nat Russia's premier nuclear weapons laboratory in Sarov for espionage \nand charged him with attempting to sell nuclear weapon design \ninformation to agents from Iraq and Afghanistan. I am certain that many \nof my colleagues in the Senate have heard the stories regarding \nattempted smuggling of radioactive materials by Russian Navy personnel \naboard their decaying submarine fleet. There are numerous other \nincidents that bring the Russian proliferation threat from \nincomprehensible quantities to real life threats of massive \ndestruction.\n  In reviewing those threats and the various DOE programs underway to \nmeet those dangers, the task force drew several major conclusions and \nrecommendations on how we should proceed to reduce and ultimately \neliminate the proliferation threats posed by Russia. Mr. President and \ncolleagues of the Senate, let me cite those findings and \nrecommendations for you.\n  The task force found that the ``most urgent unmet national security \nthreat to the United States today is the danger that weapons of mass \ndestruction or weapons--usable material in Russia could be stolen and \nsold to terrorists or hostile nation states and used against American \ntroops abroad or citizens at home.'' They noted that ``current \nnonproliferation programs in the Department of Energy, the Department \nof Defense (DoD), and related agencies have achieved impressive results \n(in supporting nonproliferation objectives) . . ., but their limited \nmandate and function fall short of what is required to address \nadequately the threat.''\n  The task force calls for the new Administration and the 107th \nCongress to increase our efforts to meet the proliferation threat, the \ndimensions of which we are only beginning to fully understand. In so \ndoing, the report recommends that we undertake a net assessment of the \nthreat, develop a strategy to meet it using specific goals and \nmeasurable objectives, establish a centralized command of our financial \nand human resources needed to do the job, and identify criteria for \nmeasuring the benefits to the United States of expanded \nnonproliferation programs. In particular, the task force urges the \nPresident in consultation with the Congress and in cooperation with the \nRussian Federation to quickly formulate a strategic plan to prevent the \noutflow of Russian nuclear weapons scientific expertise and to secure \nor neutralize all nuclear weapons-usable material in Russia during the \nnext eight to ten year period. The task force estimates that it would \ntake less than one percent of the U.S. defense budget or less than $30 \nbillion over the next decade to do the job.\n  In short there is no more cost effective way to achieve our own \nnational security goals than by investing in the DOE and DoD \nnonproliferation programs being conducted in cooperation with Russia. I \nurge the President, members of his administration, and my colleagues in \nthe Senate to understand the importance of these programs to the \nnation. As we proceed in the uncharted waters of relations between the \nUnited States and Russia in the coming months and years, I hope we will \nbe mindful of the central importance of these programs to our national \nsecurity and to their great significance to cooperative relationships \nbetween our countries. I urge all of you to read this report carefully \nand support its recommendations during the forthcoming legislative \ncycle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S565-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S565-S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING MR.

My \nfriend and colleague has provided the State of Colorado, the Nation and \nthe Republican\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\nParty outstanding service where he has devoted countless hours and \ntireless efforts with the Republican National Committee. I am here \ntoday to say a heartfelt ``Thank You Jim,'' on behalf of all \nColoradans.\n  He rose through the ranks of the Republican National Committee over \nthe years. Based on his record of ability and accomplishments, he was \nelected Chairman where he served with honor and distinction.\n  Jim Nicholson has definitely demonstrated his commitment to ideals \nand an organization that has changed so dramatically over the years. \nHis dedication and experience in business and politics will be sorely \nmissed, but I know he will not be far away.\n  Also, Jim's quiet demeanor belies his gung-ho nature. As a ranger in \nVietnam, he proved his dedication to a cause. And, Jim brought that \nsame gung-ho quality to Washington where his efforts in the Republican \nNational Committee gave us all a stronger voice and better means of \nresolving the hardships that all Americans face everyday. I would also \nlike to mention his major role in helping win a trifecta in the last \nelection, where Republicans won the White House, a majority in the \nHouse and retention of the Senate for the first time in many years.\n  When I first heard that Jim's tenure was coming to an end I was \npleased for him and his wonderful family, but I also realized that the \nRepublican Party, the State of Colorado and the entire Nation will be \nlosing a devoted advocate.\n  I remember conversations with individuals telling me about his \ncommitment and his passion for duty and honor. Well, I think Jim \nepitomizes duty and honor. Through boom and bust he has always been on \nthe right side and I admire his steadfast devotion.\n  Jim and I have shared numerous experiences in our different roles. We \nhave attended dinners and speeches together, and we have fought side by \nside in Colorado and in Washington. I know that he will still be \ninvolved in our lives, and I hope that our paths soon cross again. He \nhas been a great professional associate and a greater friend. I wish \nJim only the best in his next career move.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S566-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RUTLAND HIGH SCHOOL BAND\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncommend Vermont's Rutland High School Band that performed Saturday, \nJanuary 20, 2001, at the Inauguration of our Nation's 43rd President. \nThe Rutland High Band represented our State with dignity and pride, \ncelebrating one of our country's finest traditions, the peaceful \ntransfer of power from one administration to the next. Their \noutstanding performance made me proud to be a Vermonter.\n  Hours of practice and preparation shone through during their two hour \nand fifteen minute performance. Ninety-two talented students made up \nthis extraordinary band.\n  Students woke up on Inauguration Day at 4 a.m. in order to arrive at \nthe Pentagon for an early morning security check, then played on a \nstage at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street, both \nbefore and after the President's swearing-in ceremony. Their dedication \nto excellence set an example for all of us.\n  The band was directed by Marc Whitman, who is a motivated and worthy \nleader of his students. Under his supervision, the Rutland High School \nBand was a true asset to the Inauguration festivities. I congratulate \neach and every band member and their musical directors on a superb job \non January 20. All Vermonters are proud of them.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record an excerpt from an \narticle about the band that appeared in the Rutland Daily Herald on \nJanuary 22.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Jan. 22, 2001]\n\n                      Hail (and Rain) to the Chief\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Ask anyone in the Rutland High School band: Playing at \n     George W. Bush's inaugural Saturday left its mark.\n       Make that watermark.\n       ``To see the bands, the floats, the protestors and the \n     signs was significant, and then to be a part of that \n     experience was something in itself,'' saxophonist Charles \n     Romeo said. ``We made our place in history and being in the \n     rain makes it better--it's a better story to tell.''\n       The 18-year-old senior was one of 92 students who soaked up \n     the chance to represent Vermont at inaugural ceremonies this \n     past weekend in Washington, DC.\n       Rutland High first played for a president when John F. \n     Kennedy took office in 1961--a moment frozen in time by a \n     blizzard of snow and 22-degree winds.\n       Forty years later, the band again took the inaugural by \n     storm.\n       How wet did it get?\n       ``Very, very wet,'' French horn player Devon Balfour said \n     in a phone interview after the band returned to its hotel \n     late Saturday night. ``We were all drenched, but I don't \n     think it mattered to many of us, because it was so \n     exciting.''\n       Students were set to wake Saturday as early as 4 p.m. so \n     they could reach a Pentagon security check by 6:30 a.m., and \n     play on a stage at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and \n     Sixth Street before and after the president's swearing-in.\n       But the weather almost washed out their plans. Inaugural \n     organizers didn't commit to outdoor ceremonies until late \n     Friday, leaving the band, its two music teachers and 10 \n     parent chaperons wondering for hours.\n       ``I didn't even consider it as an option,'' band director \n     Marc Whitman said of cancellation, ``but the kids would have \n     gotten their chance to swim in the hotel pool all day.''\n       Band members didn't march in the inaugural parade like \n     their predecessors, but instead performed for some of the \n     thousands of spectators around the U.S. Capitol from 10:30 to \n     11:30 a.m. and 12:45 to 2 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S566-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WILLIMANTIC LIONS CLUB\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Their members have worked to provide \neye exams, eyeglasses, low vision devices and guide dogs for members of \nthe community through a variety of local fundraisers. The Lions Club \nalso has lent its support to such worthwhile local causes as soup \nkitchens, the Red Cross, Special Olympics, the Boy and Girl Scouts and \nacademic scholarships for local students.\n  As the Willimantic Lions Club has grown over the years, it has \nattracted more than 700 men and women as members of their club. Their \nnumerous good works have touched many lives and demonstrated the true \nvalue of volunteerism. The people of Connecticut thank the Willimantic \nLions Club and all its members for their service, dedication, and \ncontributions to our state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S566-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUN SAFETY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on October 16, 2000, Mr. Charlton \nHeston, President of the National Rifle Association (NRA), gave a \nspeech at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. On the campaign \ntrial in Michigan, Mr. Heston asserted that Vice President Al Gore's \nposition on guns had changed and suggested that ``in any other time or \nplace, you'd be looking for a lynching mob.''\n  Such inflammatory and extremist remarks are an outrage. The NRA \nitself should condemn them. The fact that an average of ten children \nsuffer gun-related deaths each day demands that we work together to end \ngun violence, yet Mr. Heston's comments serve only to further polarize \nthe debate over guns and gun safety.\n  Although some in the crowd at the NRA rally in October may have been \nin support of Mr. Heston's rhetoric, the majority of people in Michigan \nreject the hate that was exuded by NRA's leader that October day in \nMichigan. In November, voters in Michigan also demonstrated that they \noppose the tactics of the gun lobby and voters around the country \nvoiced their support for gun safety measures, such as closing the gun \nshow loophole that gives youth and criminals illegitimate access to \nfirearms.\n  Mr. President, the American people have called on all of us to work \ntoward decreasing the amount of gun violence in their schools and \ncommunities, and I am hopeful that the 107th Congress will be able to \nrespond to their call by passing responsible gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S567-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S567]]\n            RESTORING MILITARY RETIREES' CONCURRENT RECEIPT\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, last year I had the honor of \ncelebrating the fifty-sixth anniversary of D-Day with thousands of U.S. \nVeterans in my hometown of New Orleans. Listening to these men account \ntheir travails along the Normandy shores and honoring the memories of \ntheir fallen comrades, I was stirred with a sense of awe for our \ncountry's greatest patriots, America's military veterans.\n  I joined historian Stephen Ambrose at the opening of our National D-\nDay museum, where we memorialized not only those fallen in World War \nII's European Theater, but in Pacific battles as well.\n  As we recalled General Douglas MacArthur's fateful proclamation in \n1942, I shuddered with the irony of it all-- MacArthur, forced to \nretreat off Corregidor in the Philippines for Australia, vowed, I shall \nreturn. He did, and led our Nation to the most decisive victory in \nmodern history. MacArthur's promise was heralded as a testament to \nAmerica's convictions. Our troops fulfilled their duty to our country, \ndefeating the Axis powers resoundingly. But our country never fully \nfulfilled its obligations to its troops. Promised compensation for \nservice related disabilities, U.S. veterans have been denied critical \nbenefits owed to them.\n  For over one hundred years, the Pentagon has cut into military \nretirees' incomes, acquiring non-appropriated funds off the backs of \ndisabled veterans. This so-called concurrent receipt issue derives from \nan fiscal year 1892 appropriations bill. That's right, 1892.\n  In the aftermath of the Mexican War, Congress had hoped to prevent \nveterans from burdening America's budget by acquiring more than one \npension payment. At this time, some veterans were receiving retired \npay, disability pension, active duty pay, and a pension based on a \ndisability from the Mexican War of 1846-1848. Congress decided to \nforbid such dual compensation for either past or current service and a \ndisability pension. The fiscal year 1892 appropriations legislation for \nveterans' benefits included the first prohibition of concurrent \nreceipt.\n  Since its inception, Members of Congress have tried to overturn \nconcurrent receipt prohibitions, but have failed. Indeed, in the last \nCongress, we began to make substantial ground in our effort. I \nsupported an amendment to the Senate's Defense Authorization Bill to \npermit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected \ndisability to receive military retirement pay concurrently with \nveteran's disability compensation. House conferees over this bill \nrejected the provision. Instead, Congress was only able to secure $100 \nto $300 monthly special compensation for severely disabled retirees.\n  I can only hope that this measure will be the first of several steps \nthat the Federal government takes to meet its commitments to our \ndisabled military retirees. U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nstill put their lives and abilities on the line for our nation's \ndefense. And yet, the government fails to meet its commitments in \ncompensation. I predict that we will not overcome our services' \nrecruiting and retention crises until we begin to restore such critical \nretiree benefits. In so doing, the United States will promote its \nnational security and honor its guardians of liberty; our troops and \nour country deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S567-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH SEWELL\n\n Mr. EDWARDS.

She authored four \nnovels, three volumes of poetry, and 5 volumes of criticism, as well as \nscores of short stories.\n  Dr. Sewell was born in India and educated at Cambridge University in \nEngland. She made Greensboro, North Carolina her home starting in 1960 \nand became a citizen of the United States in 1974.\n  A gifted writer and thinker, Dr. Sewell studied and wrote on topics \nas diverse as race relations in the South, the role of the imagination \nin science and literature, and life in the academic world.\n  Her work garnered the prestigious poetry, fiction and non-fiction \naward from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in \n1981.\n  Elizabeth Sewell was more than a prolific writer. She was also a \ntalented teacher who shared her love of great literature with students \nin North Carolina and elsewhere.\n  She served as a visiting professor and writer-in-residence at Vassar \nCollege, the University of Notre Dame, and Bennett College in \nGreensboro. She became Joe Rosenthal Professor of Humanities at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1974.\n  As North Carolinians, we are proud to claim Elizabeth Sewell as one \nof our own.

A bill to permanently reenact chapter 12 of title 11, United \nStates Code, relating to family farmers; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators \nHarkin, Feingold, Conrad, and Dorgan to introduce legislation that \nwould make permanent Chapter 12 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n  Chapter 12, the Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code designated for \nfarmers, provides critical protection for family farmers who find \nthemselves in desperate economic circumstances. Ideally, the goal of \nfederal farm policy should be to sustain the ability of family farmers \nto produce and sell a competitive product, to preserve healthy and \nviable rural communities and to keep family farmers out of bankruptcy. \nHowever, when farmers are forced to seek bankruptcy protection, Chapter \n12, because it is tailored specifically to farmers, often allows the \nfarmer to keep his or her farm while reorganizing debt and making \npayments to creditors.\n  Extension of Chapter 12 is made all the more urgent by the current \nstate of the farm economy. Prices are now so low that many family \nfarmers are lucky to stay in business as market prices are lower than \ntheir cost of production. The value of field crops is expected to have \nbeen more than 24 percent lower in 2000 than it was in 1996--42 percent \nlower for wheat, 39 percent lower for corn, and 26 percent lower for \nsoybeans. But farmers' expenses are not falling by the same amount. In \nfact, they are not falling at all. Farmers cannot maintain cash flow if \ntheir selling prices are falling through the floor while their buying \nprices are shooting through the roof.\n  Chapter 12 expired on June 30th of last year. Efforts last year to \nextend it or to make it permanent were held hostage to controversial \nbankruptcy ``reform'' legislation and, as a result, Congress adjourned \nin December without taking any action to reinstate this critical safety \nnet. This legislation would make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the \ncode, eliminating the need for future extensions. It is also \nretroactive to July 1, 2000.\n  I hope that in the 107th Congress we can stop using farmers as pawns \nin the debate over bankruptcy reform. Permanent Chapter 12 is \ncompletely noncontroversial. We could pass this bill by unanimous \nconsent tomorrow, and we should. I note that a nearly identical measure \nhas been introduced in the House by Congressman Nick Smith. Given that \nthe House last year passed two chapter 12 extensions which the Senate \ndeclined to act on, if the Senate this year took leadership on this \nissue and passed this bill, the House would swiftly follow. Farmers \nhave been\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\nwithout this safety net long enough, and I urge my colleagues to take \naction by passing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 179. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase in \na full estate tax deduction for family-owned business interests and to \nincrease the unified credit exemption; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \naddress an estate tax problem that many Americans want fixed without \ndelay.\n  Over the years, I have heard from farmers, bankers and other business \npeople in North Dakota and elsewhere who say it is nearly impossible \nfor them to pass along the family business to their children to operate \nbecause of the estate taxes they would pay. They say emphatically that \na family should never be forced to sell off any portion of their \nbusiness just to pay the estate tax. I think they're absolutely right!\n  I believe that families who want to pass their business to other \nfamily members to own and operate should never have to worry about \nlosing that business or farm to taxes. The sale of a portion of a \nfamily business to pay estate taxes does not happen very often, but it \nshouldn't happen at all. In fact, families ought to know that our \nfederal tax laws will be supportive of their enterprises because of the \nimportance of such businesses to this nation's economic well-being. And \nthat's exactly what the bill I'm introducing would do.\n  This legislation is nearly identical to a bill I authored in the last \nCongress. It increases the current estate tax exemption for family \nbusiness assets to $10 million over the next five years, and then \ntotally eliminates the tax for them starting in the year 2006. At that \ntime, family-owned and operated businesses will be completely exempt \nfrom the tax.\n  I have spoken often on the Senate floor about the importance of the \nfamily as an economic unit as well as a social unit. This nation was \nbuilt upon an economy of family-based farms and businesses, and it is \ncrucial that we strive to keep the family farms and businesses that we \nhave, and to encourage new ones. I think that is why there's already \nwide agreement in the Senate that we should act to reform the estate \ntax to help ensure the continuity of family businesses.\n  We ought to address this critical family business estate tax issue \nearly in this Congress and save for later, if necessary, those other \nparts of the estate tax on which there is still significant \ndisagreement. My bill offers a common sense approach for changing the \nestate tax to help family enterprises survive to the next generation.\n  The legislation that I'm introducing today differs in two important \nways from the bill, S. 3098, that I authored last year. First, I have \nadded a provision to increase the general unified estate tax credit \nthat is available to everyone from $675,000 to $4 million per couple by \nthe year 2006. This will help families wishing to pass along to the \nchildren or grandchildren significant stock, proceeds from a life \ninsurance policy or other assets they may have acquired over the years. \nSecond, my bill makes the general credit and family-owned business \nexemption fully portable. This would help ensure that a surviving \nspouse will get the full benefit of any unused general credit or \nfamily-owned business exemption without having to have hired a \nsophisticated and costly tax advisor.\n  Let me briefly clarify one point. Together, the provisions of my \nlegislation would effectively abolish the estate tax for over 99 \npercent of all taxpayers. But it does not exempt from estate taxes \nentirely the heirs of multi-billion dollar investment fortunes and the \nlike, as the tax bill passed by the majority party last summer would \nhave done.\n  Many of us voted against that bill because we believed that complete \nestate tax repeal along with the other sizable tax cuts proposed at \nthat time threatened to put us right back into federal budget deficits \nonce again. That is certainly something I can not support.\n  We also were concerned that repealing the estate tax completely would \nshift the burden of paying for the federal government even more onto \nthe working men and women of this country. That is not fair. The gap \nbetween the very rich and everyone else has gotten wider in recent \nyears, and repealing the estate tax in its entirety would only make it \nworse. I also think it is reasonable to ask those who have benefitted \nmost from our democracy in the past to contribute to its security and \nwell-being in the future.\n  I know that there is disagreement on these and other points. But they \ndo deserve an honest debate, and I expect that we will have such a \ndebate later in this Congress. But as I have said previously, we should \nnot hold family based farms and businesses hostage to that debate and \nwe should move quickly on estate tax reforms where there is already \nstrong bipartisan agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 180. A bill to facilitate famine relief efforts and a \ncomprehensive solution to the war in Sudan; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Peace Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Sudan has intensified its prosecution \n     of the war against areas outside of its control, which has \n     already cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more \n     than 4,000,000.\n       (2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored \n     peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best \n     chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of \n     human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\n       (3) Continued strengthening and reform of humanitarian \n     relief operations in Sudan is an essential element in the \n     effort to bring an end to the war.\n       (4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.\n       (5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas \n     of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, \n     the absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a \n     major impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese \n     people and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace \n     process.\n       (6) Through manipulation of traditional rivalries among \n     peoples in areas outside their full control, the Government \n     of Sudan has effectively used divide and conquer techniques \n     to subjugate their population, and internationally sponsored \n     reconciliation efforts have played a critical role in \n     reducing the tactic's effectiveness and human suffering.\n       (7) The Government of Sudan is utilizing and organizing \n     militias, Popular Defense Forces, and other irregular units \n     for raiding and slaving parties in areas outside of the \n     control of the Government of Sudan in an effort to severely \n     disrupt the ability of those populations to sustain \n     themselves. The tactic is in addition to the overt use of \n     bans on air transport relief flights in prosecuting the war \n     through selective starvation and to minimize the Government \n     of Sudan's accountability internationally.\n       (8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it \n     intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to \n     increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas \n     outside its control.\n       (9) Through its power to veto plans for air transport \n     flights under the United Nations relief operation, Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the Government of Sudan has been able \n     to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese people \n     from the United States and other donor countries as a \n     devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the \n     Government of Sudan to subdue areas of Sudan outside of the \n     Government's control.\n       (10) The efforts of the United States and other donors in \n     delivering relief and assistance through means outside OLS \n     have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in \n     OLS and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food \n     donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.\n       (11) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan \n     facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the \n     population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n     Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption \n     of their ability to sustain themselves.\n       (12) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal, \n     Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions have been excluded \n     completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently \n     placing their populations at increased risk of famine.\n       (13) At a cost which has sometimes exceeded $1,000,000 per \n     day, and with a primary focus on providing only for the \n     immediate food needs of the recipients, the current\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\n     international relief operations are neither sustainable nor \n     desirable in the long term.\n       (14) The ability of populations to defend themselves \n     against attack in areas outside the Government of Sudan's \n     control has been severely compromised by the disengagement of \n     the front-line sponsor states, fostering the belief within \n     officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the \n     battlefield can be achieved.\n       (15) The United States should use all means of pressure \n     available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war \n     in Sudan, including--\n       (A) the multilateralization of economic and diplomatic \n     tools to compel the Government of Sudan to enter into a good \n     faith peace process;\n       (B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil \n     authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside \n     government control;\n       (C) continued active support of people-to-people \n     reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of \n     government control;\n       (D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide \n     humanitarian relief to those areas; and\n       (E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United \n     States and within multilateral institutions toward those \n     ends.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase \nout the taxation of Social Security benefits; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Older \nAmericans Tax Fairness Act of 2001. My bill would completely eliminate \nthe unjust taxation of Social Security benefits by the end of 2005. The \npremise of my legislation is simple: Social Security benefits were \nnever intended to be taxed. At its inception and continuing on for the \nnext fifty years, Social Security benefits were exempt from taxation. \nBudgetary shortfalls in 1984 and 1993, however, led to the taxation of \nthese benefits. The economic situation of America is now such that the \ncontinued taxation of Social Security benefits is wasteful and \nunnecessary.\n  Under the current law, beneficiaries of Social Security are taxed on \nas much as 85 percent of their benefits. Furthermore, under the latest \nchanges made by the Clinton Administration, some older Americans find \nthemselves in a situation where for every dollar they earn over a \nthreshold amount, $1.85 is subject to tax. In addition to being \nfundamentally and logically unfair, I believe such taxation provides \nsenior citizens with a strong disincentive to work. In other words, \ntaxation of benefits creates a situation where many senior citizens \ndecide to not work rather than to earn additional income which may \ntrigger taxation of their Social Security benefits.\n  Working senior citizens add a wealth of knowledge and experience to \nthe workplace. As such, we must make sure that our American workforce \nis not deprived of these valuable assets. Our laws should encourage, \nnot discourage, older Americans with a desire to work to continue \ncontributing to our society. Unfortunately, that is not what is \nhappening today.\n  Despite disincentives to work, many older Americans are forced to do \nso to be able to pay for living expenses, healthcare, prescription \ndrugs and other essentials. To these people, every penny counts in \ndetermining whether they are able to meet these costs. However, when we \ntax Social Security benefits, we make it virtually impossible for \nmillions of older Americans to make ends meet. In effect, taxation of \nSocial Security benefits forces many Americans to endure stressful \nsituations in what should be a special time of their lives. Clearly, we \ncannot allow such an unjust situation to continue.\n  The taxation of Social Security benefits impacts a wide segment of \nsociety, including a large portion of the middle class. For example, a \nperson with $35,000 in income and $10,000 in benefits pays almost \n$1,000 more in taxes than he or she would, had the Clinton-Gore \nincrease not been enacted. By repealing the 1993 Clinton-Gore increase, \nas well\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\nas the 1984 tax on Social Security benefits, my bill would give \nmillions of Americans the financial freedom and security they deserve.\n  Mr. President, every day my office receives letters and calls from \nolder Americans throughout the country voicing their opinions on the \ntaxation of Social Security benefits. Their message is clear--stop the \nunfair taxation of these benefits. I ask my colleagues to listen to \ntheir constituents and to do the right thing by joining me in support \nof this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 182. A bill to amend the Small Business Act with respect to the \nmicroloan program; to the Committee on Small Business.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation I \nfirst offered during the 106th Congress during the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee's consideration of legislation to reauthorize the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  This legislation is very simple and straight forward. It is designed \nto enhance the SBA Microloan program, which provides small, short-term \nloans for purchase of machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, \ninventory, supplies, and working capital for small businesses. These \nloans are made through SBA-approved nonprofit groups or intermediaries, \nwhich also provide counseling and educational assistance to firms or \nindividuals.\n  Under the Microloan program, intermediaries operate both as lenders \nand as technical asistance providers. Through technical assistance, the \nintermediaries help the borrower to develop a business plan, to secure \nfinancing and to learn how to operate a business. I am very proud of \nthe four Microloan intermediaries in my home state of Maine: Coastal \nEnterprises, Northern Maine Development Company, Eastern Maine \nDevelopment Company, and Community Concepts. Mr. President, these \norganizations do great work in my state, and I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to recognize them.\n  I have long been a supporter of the Microloan program, and I am proud \nto sponsor this legislation today, which is designed to enhance and \nexpand the program. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing \ntoday is to support efforts to increase the reach of and the number of \nMicrolenders by authorizing peer-to-peer mentoring where experienced \nlending intermediaries can share their knowledge and experience with \nother intermediaries or organizations looking to develop a mcirolending \nprogram.\n  Currently, there are no resources to support such activities. Under \nthis legislation, industry would develop a network of intermediaries \nwith training experience and develop a system to match them with \nintermediaries seeking assistance. Under my bill, the program would \nauthorize $1 million annually, and the funding would come out of \nalready-authorized funding for Microloan technical assistance.\n  I hope this legislation will be a constructive step in the ongoing \neffort to improve the successful Microloan program, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 183. A bill to enhance Department of Education efforts to \nfacilitate the involvement of small business owners in State and local \ninitiatives to improve education; to the committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, the Small \nBusiness Employment and Education Act of 2001, which is designed to \nenhance federal efforts to facilitate the involvement of small business \nowners and entrepreneurs in state and local initiatives to improve the \nquality of education programs for our young people.\n  In 1999, the Small Business Committee, of which I am a member, held a \nhearing chaired by Senator Bond, chairman of the committee, on the \nchallenges facing the small business community as a result of the \nfailure of many of our educational institutions to teach students the \nbasic skills that are necessary to succeed in today's work environment. \nThe committee heard testimony from a number of small businesses and \norganizations about this growing problem.\n  And just how big is the problem? A 1999 American Management \nAssociation survey on workplace testing found that approximately 36 \npercent of employees tested for basic skills were found to be deficient \nin these skills, and small businesses reported deficiency rates well \nabove the national average. Sixty percent of AMA-member companies \nreported that the availability of skilled manpower was scarce, and 67 \npercent believe that the shortages will continue.\n  A 1999 NFIB report found that 18 percent of NFIB members report that \nfinding qualified labor is the single most important problem facing \ntheir business today.\n  Likewise, a 1999 poll of U.S. Chambers of Commerce found that 83 \npercent reported the ability--or lack thereof--to find qualified \nworkers was among their biggest concerns, and 53 percent said education \nis the single most pressing public policy issue to them.\n  This information clearly illustrates that the business community, and \nsmall businesses in particular, have an important stake in the \neducation of our youth. One of the most fundamental needs that any \ngrowing business faces is the need for employees with basic skills, and \nconcerns have been expressed by the small business community that many \nstudents are not graduating with the basic skills in reading, writing, \nmathematics, and science--skills they need to succeed in today's \nworkplace or become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the growth of high-skilled \njobs is outpacing growth in all other fields. We must not allow basic \nskills to slip away if we are to remain competitive in an increasingly \naggressive and technology-based global market.\n  Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and as we \nauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we must take into \naccount the needs of businesses, and small businesses in particular. To \nthat end, locally-driven initiatives are crucial. In order to create \njobs, we must encourage small business expansion and foster small \nbusiness entrepreneurship and, and I believe that education initiatives \nare key to this.\n  Under the Small Business Employment and Education Enhancement Act, \nthe Department of Education would disseminate information and \nfacilitate the sharing of information designed to assist small \nbusinesses in working with school systems in an effort to improve our \neducational institutions. For example, the agency would \npublish guidance materials, best practices, checklists and other \nmaterials on the World Wide Web, in Department of Education \npublications and articles, letters, links to related World Wide Web \nsites, public service announcements, and through other means at the \nDepartment's disposal.\n\n  The Department of Education would establish a centralized database of \nmaterials and act as a clearinghouse for information on initiatives \nthat have proven successful.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Education would also establish an \nOffice of Small Business Education to promote efforts to address the \nneeds of small businesses though education programs. This division \nwould work to remove any existing impediments to partnerships between \nschool systems and small businesses, and propose solutions to \neducation-related problems facing small businesses.\n  The goal of the bill I am introducing today is to facilitate \npartnerships between communities and businesses. I believe it should be \neasy for communities that are interested in designing business/school \npartnerships to get the information they need on how to do so. With \naccess to the kinds of sources envisioned in this legislation, \ncommunities would be able to model a program after a proven approach.\n  In addition, my bill authorizes technical assistance to be \nadministered by the Office of Small Business Education to be used to \nprovide guidance to small businesses, small business organizations, \nschool systems, and communities working cooperatively to enhance the \nteaching of basic skills.\n  The bill would also establish tax credits to encourage companies to \nprovide work study, internship, or fellowship opportunities for \nstudents and teachers.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision directing the Department of \nEducation\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nto conduct a study and report to Congress on the challenges facing \nsmall businesses in obtaining workers with adequate skills; an \nassessment of the impact on small businesses of the skills shortage; \nthe costs to small businesses associated with this shortage; and the \nrecommendations of the Secretary on how to address these challenges.\n  Mr. President, I hope this legislation will provide a foundation for \ncooperative initiatives between small businesses and school systems, \nand I look forward to working with the Small Business Committee, the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and others as \nwe work to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 184. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to eliminate \ngood time credits for prisoners serving a sentence for a crime of \nviolence, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  S. 185. A bill to provide incentives to encourage stronger truth in \nsentencing of violent offenders, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer legislation today that would \nstrengthen our Trust in Sentencing guidelines and limit the ability of \nviolent criminals to be released early due to ``good time'' credits.\n  Let me tell you why we need these bills. If you commit murder in this \ncountry, on average, you are going to be sentenced to about 21 years in \njail but that criminal will serve, on average, only 10 years behind \nbars.\n  Most people will be startled to hear that. And why is this the case? \nBecause people are let out early. Murderers go to prison, and they get \n``good time,'' time off for good behavior: If you want to get out \nearly, just be good in prison, and we will put you back on the streets. \nA murderer can get credit for good behavior. That sounds like an \noxymoron to me.\n  And what happens when you are put back on the streets? You read the \nstories. These people commit crimes again. They rape or they rob or \nthey kill. They molest children. They repeat their crimes.\n  I am introducing legislation today, along with my friend Senator \nCraig of Idaho to address this problem. The point of it is very simple. \nI believe that in the criminal justice system we ought to have \ndifferent standards for those who commit acts of violence. Everyone in \nthis country who commits acts of violence ought to understand: You go \nto prison, and your address is going to be your jail cell until the end \nof your sentence.\n  I do not mind early release for nonviolent offenders. If prison \nofficials want to use ``good time'' as a management tool for nonviolent \ncriminals, fine. But for violent offenders, we ought to have a society \nin which everyone understands: If you commit an act of violence, the \nprison cell is your address to the end of your sentence. No good time \noff for good behavior, no getting back to the streets early. You are \ngoing to be in prison to serve your term. My legislation says, this is \nan important standard for state and federal prisons.\n  We know the current system isn't working. Too many violent offenders \nare sent back to America's streets. There is a way to stop that. My \nlegislation will do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 186. A bill to provide access and choice for use of generic drugs \ninstead of nongeneric drugs under Federal health care programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation as \none more step in my fight to combat rising prescription drug prices and \nreduce the cost of medication for consumers in this country. My \nlegislation, called the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For \nConsumers Act of 2001, aims to reduce the cost of prescription \nmedication to American taxpayers and the U.S. government by encouraging \nthe use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, therapeutically \nequivalent generic prescription drugs within the federal health care \nprograms, except if the non-generic form is either ordered by the \nprescribing physician or requested by the patient.\n  The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of \n2001 establishes a straightforward and cost-effective means of \nincreasing consumers' access and choice to safe, affordable generic \nprescription drugs under federal health care programs which could \nresult in savings of millions of dollars.\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which spends \napproximately $18.4 billion providing health insurance coverage to its' \nestimated nine million enrollees, including employees, retirees and \ntheir families, spends nearly twenty percent, $3.6 billion, of their \ninsurance program costs on pharmaceutical benefits alone. This year \nbrought little relief when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \nannounced that FEHBP premium increases for the year 2001 were on \naverage 10.5 percent, mostly attributable to the cost increase in \nprescription drug plans to fill prescriptions with FDA approved, \ntherapeutically equivalent generic prescription drugs. In fact, the \nrising cost of prescription drugs accounts for about 40 percent of the \ntotal rise in premiums for this year alone.\n  In 1997, about one-third of all prescriptions under the FEHBP were \nfor generic drugs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which \nadministers the FEHBP, estimated that total costs for prescription \ndrugs would drop by about fifteen percent if half of all prescriptions \nwere for generic drugs.\n  A 1998 study conducted by the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat generic pharmaceutical substitution saves consumers nationwide \napproximately eight to ten billion dollars a year.\n  Some FEHBP plans and other federal health care programs do to some \nextent encourage the use of generic prescription drugs but the practice \nis not mandatory or universally incorporated into all programs. The \nGeneric Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act simply \ndirects all federal health care programs that provide prescription drug \nplans to fill prescriptions with FDA approved, therapeutically \nequivalent generic prescription drugs, except if the non-generic form \nis either ordered by the prescribing physician or requested by the \npatient.\n  I believe we can take greater steps to increase the utilization of \nhigh-quality, FDA approved generic drugs, which cost between twenty-\nfive and sixty percent less than brand-name drugs, resulting in an \nestimated average savings of fifteen to thirty dollars on each \nprescription filled. In fact, independent studies have even estimated \nthat generics provide an average savings of $45.50 for each \nprescription drug sold.\n  Generic pharmaceutical drugs are widely accepted by both consumers \nand the medical profession, as the market share held by generic drugs \ncompared to brand-name prescription drugs has more than doubled during \nthe last decade, from approximately nineteen to forty-three percent, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. Yet, despite accounting \nfor just over forty percent of the prescriptions drugs dispensed, \ngeneric drugs represent only 8 percent of the total dollar volume spent \non drugs in this country. Studies have shown that consumers can save an \nadditional $1.32 billion per year for every one percent increase in the \nuse of generic drugs. That is why I strongly believe that generic \npharmaceutical utilization can help both consumers and the government \nreduce the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Since there exists no current coverage for outpatient prescription \ndrugs under the Medicare program, a second component of my bill \nincludes a sense-of-the-Senate that, to the extent feasible, a \npreference for the safe and cost-effective use of generic drugs be \nconsidered in conjunction with any legislation that adds a prescription \ndrug benefit to the Medicare program. I strongly believe that the \nutilization of high-quality, safe generic pharmaceutical drugs in a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit would provide a built in cost \ncontrol mechanism that would help ensure the economic feasibility and \nsustainability of any new benefit.\n  And third, the bill I am introducing today works to prevent a tactic \nused by the brand drug industry to prevent generics from reaching the \nconsumer by convincing state legislatures to pass unwarranted \nrestrictions to the substitution of generic versions of brand name \ndrugs. The campaign that some brand name drug companies lobby in\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\nsome states is nothing more than an attempt by the brand name companies \nto protect their market share. The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and \nChoice For Consumers Act increases the level playing field for generic \ndrugs by requiring the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where \nappropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is the \ntherapeutic equivalent of its' brand-name counterpart, and affording \nnational uniformity to that determination.\n  The legislation would also prevent a State from establishing or \ncontinuing any requirement that keeps generic pharmaceutical drugs off \nthe market once FDA has determined that a generic drug is \n``therapeutically equivalent'' to a brand name drug. This provision \nwill ensure that generic prescription drugs get to the market in a \ntimely fashion and provide consumers with access and choice to low \ncost, high-quality alternatives.\n  As the year continues, I hope that we will move forward in a \nconstructive debate about providing relief from the escalating costs of \nprescription drugs. However, I believe that minimizing cost through \nfull access to generic drugs must be part of any effort to address the \nprescription drug pricing issue. I introduced the Generic \nPharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of 2001 to lay the \nground work early in these discussions and take some constructive steps \nin the right direction so that the American public can get the full \nbenefit of safe, affordable generic prescription drugs and taxpayers \nare treated right at the same time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n     Drug Administration on the basis of scientific testing and \n     other information establishing that such pharmaceuticals are \n     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n     alternative to brand-name innovator pharmaceuticals.\n       (2) The pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-\n     name pharmaceuticals will save purchasers of pharmaceuticals \n     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n       (B) quality generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent \n     and 60 percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     resulting in an estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on \n     each prescription filled.\n       (4) Independent studies have estimated that generics \n     provide an average savings of $45.50 for each prescription \n     drug sold.\n       (5) Generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by both \n     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share \n     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       (6) Generic pharmaceuticals can save consumers an \n     additional $1,320,000,000 each year for each 1 percent \n     increase in the use of such pharmaceuticals.\n       (7) Generic pharmaceutical use can help both consumers and \n     the Government reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the United \n     States Government and to beneficiaries under Federal health \n     care programs while maintaining the quality of health care by \n     requiring the use of generic drugs rather than nongeneric \n     drugs, unless no therapeutically equivalent generic drug has \n     been approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or the nongeneric drug is \n     specifically--\n       (A) ordered by the prescribing provider; or\n       (B) requested by the individual for whom the drug is \n     prescribed; and\n       (2) to increase the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals \n     by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where \n     appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is \n     the therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and \n     by affording national uniformity to that determination.\n\n              TITLE I--REQUIRING THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to establish the position of Assistant United States \nTrade Representative for Small Business, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions \nthat if one committee reports, the other committee has thirty days to \nreport or be discharged.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of our Nation's small business community. This legislation will \nbenefit small businesses by requiring an\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\nestimate of the cost of each piece of congressional legislation on \nsmall businesses before Congress enacts the legislation, and also by \ncreating an assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business.\n  Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and in order \nto create jobs--both in my home State of Maine and across the Nation-- \nwe must encourage small business expansion.\n  Nationwide, an estimated 13 to 16 million small businesses account \nfor over 99 percent of all employers. They also employ over 50 percent \nof the workers. Small businesses account for virtually all of the new \njobs being created. Maine, in particular, is a state with a historical \nrecord of self-reliance and small business enterprise. In Maine, of the \nroughly 36,660 employers, 97.6 percent are small businesses. Maine also \nboasts an estimated 71,000 self-employed persons. Surveys credit small \nbusinesses with all of the new jobs in Maine as well.\n  I believe that small businesses are the most successful tool we have \nfor job creation. They provide a substantial majority of the initial \njob opportunities in this country, and are the original--and finest--\njob training program. Unfortunately, as much as small businesses help \nour own economy--and the Federal Government--by creating jobs and \nbuilding economic growth, government often gets in the way. Instead of \nassisting small business, government too often frustrates small \nbusiness efforts.\n  Federal regulations create more than 1 billion hours of paperwork for \nsmall businesses each year, according to the Small Business \nAdministration. Moreover, because of the size of some of the largest \nAmerican corporations, U.S. commerce officials too often devote a \ndisproportionate amount of time to the needs and jobs in corporate \nAmerica rather than in small businesses.\n  My legislation will address these two challenges facing small \nbusinesses, and I hope it will both encourage small business expansion \nand fuel further job creation.\n  One, this legislation will require a cost analysis of legislative \nproposals before new requirements are imposed on small businesses. Too \noften, Congress approves well-intended legislation that shifts the \ncosts of programs to small businesses. This proposal will help avert \nsuch unintended consequences.\n  According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small business \nowners spend at least 1 billion hours a year filling our government \npaperwork, at an annual cost that exceeds $100 billion. Before we place \nyet another obstacle in the path of small business job creation, we \nshould understand the costs our proposals will impose on small \nbusinesses.\n  This bill will require the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice to prepare for each committee an analysis of the costs to small \nbusinesses that would be incurred in carrying out provisions contained \nin new legislation. This cost analysis will include an estimate of \ncosts incurred in carrying out the bill or resolution for a 4-year \nperiod, as well as an estimate of the portion of these costs that would \nbe borne by small businesses. This provision will allow us to fully \nconsider the impact of our actions on small businesses--and through \ncareful planning, we may succeed in mitigating unintended costs.\n  Two, this legislation will direct the U.S. Trade Representative to \nestablish a position of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small \nBusiness. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is overburdened, \nand too often overlooks the needs of small business. This is a concern \nthat I have heard time and again from those in the small business \ncommunity. A new Assistant U.S. Trade Representative would promote \nexports by small businesses and work to remove foreign impediments to \nexports.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that this legislation will truly assist \nsmall businesses, resulting not only in additional entrepreneurial \npotential but also in good new jobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 188. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe tax credit for electricity produced from certain renewable \nresources; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Biomass \nEnergy Equity Act of 2001. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Boxer, my colleague from California. This legislation makes a \ncommonsense change to the renewable energy production tax credit by \nexpanding it to include additional types of biomass plants. I would \nlike to take a few minutes now to discuss the need for this important \nbill and to describe what it would do.\n  Simply put, biomass energy production uses combustion to turn wood \nand organic waste into energy in an environmentally sound process. \nBiomass takes a public liability, organic waste, and converts it into a \npublic asset, energy.\n  The renewable energy production tax credit enacted in 1992 provides \nincentives to the solid-fuel biomass and wind energy industry to \ndevelop economically viable and environmentally responsible renewable \nsources of electricity. In enacting that legislation, Congress \nrecognized that biomass energy offers substantial environmental \nbenefits, specifically a reduced dependence on oil and coal, a \ndesirable alternative to open field burnings and the landfilling of \norganic material, and a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Unfortunately, the 1992 legislation was drafted too narrowly to \nrealize the full benefits of biomass energy production. The 1992 act \nnarrowly defined an eligible biomass facility as including only so-\ncalled closed-loop biomass plants. Closed-loop biomass is a \nhypothetical form of electricity generation where the fuel is planted, \ngrown, and harvested specifically and solely for the fuel of the power \nplant. This definition rules out the significant environmental benefit \nof disposal of organic waste otherwise destined for a landfill or \nfield-burning and, therefore, remains unused. Since the biomass tax \ncredit was passed, no taxpayer, not one, has taken advantage of the tax \nbenefit.\n  Simply put, the closed-loop tax credit is not a sufficient incentive \nto develop a costly ``fuel plantation,'' which entails large-scale land \npurchases, property taxes, and growing material for the sole purpose of \nburning it. By demanding that newly grown material be used rather than \norganic waste, the closed-loop biomass definition flies in the face of \nthe commonly accepted environmental principle that products should be \nput to as many ``highest value'' uses as possible.\n  The legislation that I introduce today would expand the eligibility \nof the biomass tax credit to include conventional biomass plants. This \nlegislation is designed to encourage a source of energy generation that \noffers substantial air quality, waste management, and greenhouse gas \nreduction benefits. The national biomass industry currently uses over \n22,000,000 tons of wood waste a year. The waste the biomass industry \nconverts into energy otherwise would be disposed of in one of three \nways: burned in an open field, which generates pollution instead of \nenergy; landfilled, where it fills limited landfill space and \nbiodegrades, emitting methane, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse \ngases; or left in the woods or fields, increasing the risk and severity \nof forest fires.\n  The air quality benefits of biomass energy are of particular \nimportance. According to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use \nManagement, an organization of all the Northeastern States' Air Quality \nBureaus, biomass energy produces less nitrogen oxide than alternatives \nand generates virtually no sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or \nmercury. Biomass energy production also results in a net reduction of \ngreenhouse gases.\n\n  In addition to their environmental benefits, biomass plants \ncontribute to the economy of many rural towns throughout America. \nBecause of their dependence on organic waste, biomass facilities are \nusually located in rural areas where they are often important engines \nof economic growth. For example, in the small town of Sherman, Maine, a \nbiomass facility provides 56 percent of the property tax base. It also \ndirectly employs 24 individuals and indirectly provides work for \nhundreds of truck drivers, wood operators, mill workers and maintenance \ncontractors.\n  In another small town of Maine, Athens, a biomass facility provides a \nthird\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\nof that small town's tax base and directly employs 20 people, while \nsupporting a local wood operator who, in turn, employs 40 people.\n  The point is, the economy in many of the small towns in Maine, in \ntowns such as Livermore, Ashland, Greenville, Fort Fairfield, Stratton, \nand West Enfield benefit considerably from these biomass facilities. In \ntotal, there are over 100 biomass facilities in the United States, \nrepresenting an investment in excess of $7 billion. These facilities \ncontribute jobs, property taxes and a disposal point for waste \nproducts. In addition, rural biomass facilities provide ash for use by \nlocal farmers, reducing their purchases of lime. I understand there is \nregularly more demand for the ash produced by these biomass plants than \nthere is supply.\n  With biomass energy production, nothing is wasted. Biomass turns \nwaste products--the byproducts of timber, paper or farming operations--\ninto needed energy, wasting nothing. Even the ash is returned to the \nearth to grow organic matter yielding both crops and waste to generate \nstill more electricity.\n  We in Congress often discuss ways to help rural America. This \nproposal offers an opportunity to do so in a manner that not only \nbenefits the economy of small towns in rural America but also in a way \nthat generates considerable environmental benefits.\n  This measure makes both economic and environmental sense. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Boxer and me in supporting this important \nlegislation and working for its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 189. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise because I have just come from a very \ninteresting and informative hearing in the Budget Committee. Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan came in today to talk about what he has \nseen as the tremendous productivity growth in this economy. The \nproductivity growth essentially has come about because of the \ninvestment in information technology which has allowed our country to \nproduce more in less time and to increase the output of the many \nsources of goods and services in this country. It has brought with it, \nas Chairman Greenspan noted, a significant increase in revenues to the \nFederal Government, which are allowing us to pay down even more rapidly \nthan previously thought the debt now held by the public.\n  Last year, Chairman Greenspan was adamant. He said the best thing we \ncould do was to pay down the debt. He said, ``I have absolutely zero \nconcern that we are going to pay the debt down too fast.'' Remarkably, \ntoday he has said that there is a real danger: We are potentially \npaying down the debt too quickly. He said if we get to the point where \nwe have paid down the debt and the Federal Government is starting to \naccumulate private assets--in other words, having to put its surpluses \ninto investments in the country--we could have a serious political \nproblem. He therefore said that, in addition to continuing debt \nreduction, it is time to take ``surplus-lowering policy initiatives.''\n  Now sometimes the Chairman doesn't speak in the clearest language, \nand we questioned him as to what he meant. He indicated that a \nreduction in taxes beginning now, prior to the time we get to the point \nwhere there is no debt held by the public, is a good idea. He said, \nfrom an economist's standpoint, the most effective way to generate \ngrowth in the economy is to reduce marginal rates.\n  Well, this was very informative and useful testimony. I urge my \ncolleagues to read it. He also warned that we are in serious trouble if \nwe follow the path we have followed in this Congress and in the last \nseveral years of spending explosions, going above the budget and \ncontinuing to spend more. He said that spending too much can be a real \ndanger. There is much less danger of cutting taxes too much because \nthere are limits on how much taxes can be cut.\n  Mr. President, I introduce the Small Business Works Act of 2001. This \nlegislation is built on one inescapable fact--small business ``works'' \nin this country. The men and women who venture into small businesses \ntake incredible risks. They work countless hours, often seven days a \nweek, just to see their businesses break even. They risk their life \nsavings and often capital put up by family and friends. And they forego \nvaluable time with their families all for the promise of working for \nthemselves and creating prosperous businesses in their communities.\n  Our country also reaps the benefits of successful small enterprises. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, small businesses \nrepresent more than 99 percent of all employers, employ 53 percent of \nthe private work force, and create about 75 percent of the new jobs in \nthis country. In addition, these small firms contribute 47 percent of \nall sales in this country, and they are responsible for 51 percent of \nthe private gross domestic product. With these kinds of results, it is \nquite clear that small business works for America.\n  Despite their success in recent years, one thing clearly does not \nwork for small business--the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of \ncollecting the lowest amount of taxes necessary in the least burdensome \nmanner, the current tax law represents a morass of rules, regulations, \nforms, and, of course, penalties, with which the self-employed must \ncontend. Just to put this into perspective, by some estimates, small \nbusiness owners spend more than 5 percent of their revenues just to \ncomply with the tax laws. In fact, a small business owner from Kansas \nCity testified before the Senate Committee on Small Business that his \nbusiness routinely spends more than 16 percent of the company's net \nincome just to keep the records and file the appropriate tax forms. And \nthat's even before he writes the tax check.\n  These revenues are taken away from the business and spent on \naccountants, bookkeepers, and lawyers to sort out all the rules and \nfiling requirements. In addition, small business owners must dedicate \nvaluable time and energy on day-to-day recordkeeping and other \ncompliance requirements, all of which keep them from doing what they do \nbest--running their business.\n  And then there are the taxes themselves. As the chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, I have heard from small business owners in \nMissouri and across this country that they are more than willing to pay \ntheir fair share of taxes. What they object to, however, is paying high \ntax bills and vast amounts for professional tax assistance only to end \nup the victim of an unfair tax code.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today continues my long-\nstanding commitment to helping small businesses obtain much needed tax \nrelief and common-sense simplifications of our tax laws. For their \nunending contribution to the prosperity of this country, they deserve \nno less.\n  The bill is designed to complement the broad-based tax stimulus \npackage that President Bush has proposed. With an economy that appears \nto be slowing, small businesses are likely to be among the first \naffected. We need to ensure that they benefit from any tax stimulus we \nenact this year to secure their continued vitality in the future.\n  The Small Business Works Act also draws from the priorities of the \nnation's small business organizations including the National Federation \nof Independent Business, the Small Business Legislative Council, and \nmany others. While there are too many organizations to name them all \nindividually, I am grateful for their ideas, their insights, and their \nsupport, without which this bill would not have been possible.\n  This legislation also includes recommendations from the National \nWomen's Small Business Summit, which I chaired in Kansas City, \nMissouri, last June. That summit brought together hundreds of women \nbusiness owners who focused on specific areas of concern to their \nbusinesses, one of which was taxes. As the Summit's final report \nconcludes, ``the Congress and the Executive Branch have a new mandate--\nlisten to what women small-business owners have said and answer their \ncall to action.'' During the Summit, I listened carefully to the views \nand recommendations of the participants, and with this legislation I am \ntaking steps to answer their needs.\n  Lastly, this bill incorporates a number of the recommendations that \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) National Taxpayer Advocate set out \nin\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\nhis Annual Report to Congress for 2001. The Taxpayer Advocate has \nbecome an invaluable resource for identifying problems facing small \nbusiness taxpayers and offering legislative proposals to address them.\n  Mr. President, the Small Business Works Act recognizes the incredible \ncontribution that entrepreneurs, farmers and ranchers, and home-based \nbusiness owners continually make to our economy despite the financial \nand paperwork headaches they face at every turn. To ease those burdens, \nthe legislation provides tax relief for the self-employed and small \nfirms, includes broad ranging tax simplifications for small \nenterprises, and accords small businesses greater protection as they \nstrive to comply with our increasingly complex tax code.\n  When it comes to paying taxes, small business really works for the \ngovernment. According to recent IRS data, small business owners pay \napproximately 40 percent of the nearly $2 trillion that the Federal \ngovernment collects each year. With the growing budget surpluses, small \nbusinesses, like American families, are clearly paying more than the \ngovernment needs to carry out its programs and obligations. So when we \ntalk about a tax cut, small enterprises cannot be left behind. The \nSmall Business Works Act embraces that fact by reducing the tax burden \non small firms in several ways.\n  First, the bill includes the legislation that I introduced earlier \nthis week to provide 100 percent deductibility of health insurance for \nthe self-employed beginning this year. This was among the top \npriorities named by the National Women's Small Business Summit last \nsummer, and it has been identified by the IRS National Taxpayer \nAdvocate as a legislative recommendation for small business taxpayers.\n\n  With the self-employed able to deduct only 60 percent of their \nhealth-insurance costs today, and only 70 percent next year, it comes \nas no surprise that 24.2 percent of the self-employed still do not have \nhealth insurance. In fact, 4.8 million Americans live in families \nheaded by a self-employed individual and have no health insurance. A \nfull deduction will make health insurance more affordable to the self-\nemployed and help them and their families get the health-insurance \ncoverage that they need and deserve today--not years in the future.\n  Full deductibility also levels the playing field for the self-\nemployed, who for too long have only had partial deductibility while \ntheir large corporate competitors have been able to deduct all of their \ninsurance costs. Full deductibility against income taxes, however, is \nonly part of the battle. My bill also corrects an additional \npeculiarity of the tax code, which prevents the self-employed from \ndeducting their health-insurance premiums against their self-employment \ntaxes. As the Taxpayer Advocate noted in his 2001 Report to Congress, \n``[a]lthough self- employed individuals can reduce their taxable income \nby the cost of their health insurance, they still must pay self-\nemployment taxes on this amount.'' In contrast, the Taxpayer Advocate \ncontinues, ``Wage earners who participate in pre-tax plans do not pay \nSocial Security tax on their health insurance payments.'' My bill \neliminates this narrow disparity in the law and allows the self-\nemployed to exclude their health-insurance premiums from their self-\nemployment tax.\n  As a result, the self-employed will truly be on an equal footing with \nowners and employees of corporations whose health-insurance benefits \nare not subject to income or employment taxes. It is a simple matter of \nfairness.\n  Second, the Small Business Works Act addresses the increasingly \nonerous consequences of the individual and corporate Alternative \nMinimum Tax (AMT). For the sole proprietors, partners, and S \ncorporation shareholders, the individual AMT increases their tax \nliability by, among other things, reducing depreciation and depletion \ndeductions, limiting net operating loss treatment, eliminating the \ndeductibility of state and local taxes, and curtailing the expensing of \nresearch and experimentation costs. In addition, because of its \ncomplexity, this tax forces small business owners to waste precious \nfunds on tax professionals to determine whether the AMT even applies. \nFor these reasons, the bill includes the recommendation of the Taxpayer \nAdvocate to repeal the individual AMT. This will be accomplished by \neliminating 20 percent of the tax each year until it is completely \nrepealed in 2006.\n  For small corporations, the AMT story is much the same--high \ncompliance costs and additional taxes draining away scarce capital from \nthe business. In fact, the Committee on Small Business heard at a \nhearing in the last Congress that the corporate AMT resulted in a \n$95,000 tax bill for one small business in Kansas City, all because the \ncompany purchased life insurance on the father, who was the primary \nowner of the business, to prevent the estate tax from closing the \ncompany down. That type of nonsense must come to an end here and now.\n  Accordingly, for small corporate taxpayers, the bill increases the \ncurrent exemption from the corporate AMT. As a result, a small \ncorporation will initially qualify for the exemption if its average \ngross receipts are $7.5 million or less (up from the current $5 \nmillion) during its first three taxable years. Thereafter, a small \ncorporation will continue to qualify for the AMT exemption for as long \nas its average gross receipts for the prior three-year period do not \nexceed $10 million (up from the current $7.5 million).\n  Third, the Small Business Works Act, repeals the unemployment surtax. \nSince 1976, small businesses have had to bear the burden of a 0.2 \npercent surtax on the unemployment taxes they pay for their employees. \nThis surtax was enacted to repay loans from the Federal unemployment \nfund made during the 1974 recession. Those loans were fully repaid in \n1987, and yet the surtax continues to be extended, adding to the tax \nburden facing small employers. With the Federal surplus proving that \nsmall businesses are paying too much, this tax clearly should go.\n  Fourth, the Small Business Works Act incorporates a central piece of \nPresident Bush's tax plan to help businesses dedicated to developing \nnew products and technology; it permanently extends the research and \nexperimentation tax credit. Over the years this credit has stimulated \nresearch and development in this country and has contributed to the \nleadership of American businesses in the technological revolution. \nUnfortunately, this credit has also had a checkered history of \nexpiration and reauthorization, which is simply untenable for \nbusinesses trying to plan for long-term research programs. It is time \nto end the on-again/off-again nature of this credit and provide \nbusinesses the certainty of knowing it will be available for the \nfuture.\n  Finally, the bill responds to the recommendation from the National \nWomen's Small Business Summit to enhance the business-meals deduction. \nUnlike their large competitors, small enterprises often sell their \nproducts and services by word of mouth and close many business \ntransactions on the road or in a local diner. In many ways the business \nbreakfast with a potential customer is akin to formal advertising that \nlarger businesses purchase in newspapers or on radio or television. \nWhile the newspaper ad is fully deductible, however, the business meal \nis only 50 percent deductible for the small business owner.\n  In addition, individuals who are subject to the Federal hours-of-\nservice limitations of the Department of Transportation (such as truck \ndrivers) are currently able to deduct 60 percent of their business \nmeals and are on schedule to deduct up to 80 percent in coming years. \nAs a result, small business owners have a significant lack of parity \nwith individuals subject to hours-of-service limitations. Accordingly, \nthe Small Business Works Act increases the limitation on the \ndeductibility of business meals from the current 50 percent to 80 \npercent beginning in 2001.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I spent considerable \ntime in the last Congress examining the paperwork and filing burdens on \nsmall enterprises. According to research completed by the General \nAccounting Office at my request, there are more than 200 forms and \nschedules that a small business owner could have to file. That's a \ndaunting universe of forms, which boils down to more than 8,000 lines, \nboxes, and data requirements. These forms are also accompanied by more \nthan 700 pages of instructions--not including the countless pages of \nthe tax code, regulations, rulings, and other IRS guidance.\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\n  Since entrepreneurs usually open their own businesses to work for \nthemselves, not to waste valuable time and resources on government \nfiling and recordkeeping requirements, the Small Business Works Act \nincludes several provisions to simplify the tax code and let small \nbusiness owners get on with their work.\n  First, in continuation of my effort in the last Congress, the bill \nincludes my Small Business Tax Accounting Simplification Act, with some \nimprovements. This provision allows a small business to use the cash \nmethod of accounting, rather than the more onerous accrual method, if \nthe business' average annual gross receipts are less than $5 million. \nThis proposal has been strongly endorsed by small business \nassociations, including the National Federation of Independent Business \nand the Associated Builders and Contractors, and most recently by the \nTaxpayer Advocate stressing the need for simplifying the tax accounting \nrules.\n  More critically, the bill allows businesses that require merchandise \nin the performance of their services to use the cash method of \naccounting for all purposes. This provision responds to the pleas for \nhelp from small service providers, such as painters and contractors, \nwho have recently become the focus of the IRS' attention, to the tune \nof thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties, not to mention \naccounting fees. And for what? A difference in timing, when the small \nbusiness will ultimately pay the same amount of taxes? This change in \nthe tax code is long overdue and will dramatically simplify the tax \nrules for countless small businesses.\n  At the National Women's Small Business Summit last summer, the \nparticipants raised another area of complexity for America's \nentrepreneurs--depreciation. The Small Business Works Act addresses \nthis issue, in large part, by increasing the amount of equipment that \nsmall firms can expense each year to $50,000 and thereby avoid the \ncomplex depreciation rules. This bill also adjusts the phase-out \nlimitation on expensing to permit more small businesses to purchase \nbasic equipment without losing the benefit of immediate expensing. This \nlimitation has not been increased since 1986, and as a result it is \nsorely out of step with the cost of new technology, which has risen \ndramatically over the past decade.\n  In addition, the bill responds to another recommendation of the \nTaxpayer Advocate by permitting computer software to be expensed. For \ncomputers and software purchased over the new $50,000 expensing limit, \nthe bill modifies the present law to allow this technology to be \ndepreciated over two years. Currently, computer equipment is generally \ndepreciated over a five- year period and software is usually \ndepreciated over three years. Any small business owner will tell you \nthat a computer is largely obsolete well before three years of use, let \nalone five years. And computer software becomes outdated even faster. \nAs a result, small business owners are left with thousands of dollars \nof depreciation on their books well after the equipment or software is \nobsolete. The bill makes the tax code in this area more consistent with \nthe technological reality of the business world.\n  The Small Business Works Act also amends the limitations on the \namount of depreciation that business owners may claim for vehicles used \nfor business purposes. Under current law, a business loses a portion of \nits depreciation deduction if the vehicle placed in service in 2000 \ncosts more than $14,400. Although these limitations have been subject \nto inflation adjustments, they have not kept pace with the actual cost \nof new cars and vans in most cases. For many small businesses, the use \nof a car or van is an essential asset for transporting personnel to \nsales and service appointments and for delivering their products. \nAccordingly, the bill adjusts the thresholds so that a business will \nnot lose any of its depreciation deduction for vehicles costing less \nthan $25,000, which will continue to be indexed for inflation.\n  Mr. President, another source of complexity for many small business \nowners are the estimated tax rules and the differing thresholds \ndepending on the owner's income level. In fact, this issue was the \nnumber three legislative recommendation of the Taxpayer Advocate this \nyear. The Small Business Works Act restores the simple two-option rule \nto avoid the interest penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes, \nwhich has been repeatedly altered in recent years primarily to raise \nrevenues. To end that headache for the self-employed, the bill allows \nan individual to satisfy the requirements of the code if his estimated \ntaxes are equal to 90 percent of the current year's tax bill or 100% of \nlast year's tax bill--a simple and straightforward rule so small \nbusiness owners can stop wasting time on tax preparation and get back \nto work.\n  The Small Business Works Act also addresses a complexity issue raised \nby the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate concerning small businesses \njointly owned by a husband and wife. As noted by the Advocate in his \n2001 Report to Congress: ``A married couple operating a small business \nmust comply with the complex partnership reporting requirements. Even \nthough the married couple files a joint tax return, the law requires \nthem to treat the business as a partnership rather than a sole \nproprietorship. . . . [the] IRS estimates it takes over 200 hours \nlonger to complete a partnership return than a Sole Proprietorship \nSchedule C.'' In light of this situation, the bill amends the tax code \nto permit married couples who jointly own a small business to opt out \nof the partnership rules and file as a sole proprietorship.\n  Mr. President, in the 105th Congress, we took bold steps to \nrestructure the IRS and improve the quality of service that taxpayers \nreceive. Since the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act was enacted in \n1998, the IRS made great strides to redirect the agency and balance its \ndual mission of collecting tax revenues and serving taxpayers in a fair \nand respectful manner.\n  With the growing complexity of our tax code, however, opportunities \nabound for small businesses to make honest mistakes. The IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act provided important protections for all \ntaxpayers, but work remains to ensure that small businesses are treated \njustly under the tax laws. The Small Business Works Act addresses \nseveral issues that small businesses continue to report as major \nproblems.\n  A top concern is the excessive nature of penalties and interest \nimposed on taxpayers who make mistakes. Far too often, a minor tax bill \ngrows into an unmanageable liability because of the interest on the tax \nowed, the penalties for negligence and late payment, and the interest \non the penalties. Frequently, these penalties can prevent a small \nbusiness owner from settling his account and getting back into good \nstanding.\n\n  Penalties were included in the tax code to encourage taxpayers to \ncomply with our voluntary assessment system, and interest was intended \nto compensate the government for the lost use of tax dollars. But the \nmultiplicity of penalties and hidden punishments disguised as interest \non those penalties seriously undermines Americans' confidence that our \nsystem is fair.\n  The Small Business Works Act stops the runaway freight train of \nexcessive penalties and interest in two ways. First, the bill \neliminates the failure-to-pay penalty, which is part of the multiple \npenalties often applied to the same error. Penalties should punish bad \nbehavior, not honest errors that even well-intentioned people are bound \nto make now and then. Second, the bill stops the practice of charging \ninterest on penalties. Instead, interest will only be applied to the \ntaxes due, just like interest is charged on a credit card for unpaid \nbalances. Both of these changes implement recommendations of the \nTaxpayer Advocate. Again, it's simply a matter of fairness.\n  The bill also addresses the issue of electronic filing of tax \nreturns. In the 1998 IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, we set a goal \nfor the IRS to make electronic filing the most practical and preferred \nmethod of filing so that 80 percent of taxpayers would choose to file \nelectronically by 2007. While I continue to support that goal, I am \nconcerned that the temptation for ensuring that the goal is reached \nwill lead to mandatory electronic filing. At a time when small firms \nare already faced with daunting government mandates just in completing \ntheir tax returns, the last thing they need is a new mandate for filing \nthem. To prevent that\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nresult, my bill makes clear that expanded electronic filing of tax and \ninformation returns will be a voluntary option for small businesses, \nnot another government mandate.\n  The taxpayer protections included in the bill are intended to strike \na balance for small business taxpayers. On the one hand, the bill eases \nthe excessive punishment imposed for honest errors and reduces the \nburdens faced by taxpayers subject to an audit by the IRS. On the \nother, it preserves the agency's authority to enforce the tax laws and \nprevent individuals from cheating the tax system, which in the end \nincreases the tax burden on all Americans.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today is a commonsense \npackage of tax relief, simplification, and protections for America's \nsmall businesses who work so hard. As we strive in the coming weeks to \nenact tax-relief legislation, I urge my colleagues to remember that \nsmall business works in America, the jobs they provide in our local \ncommunities are too important, and they simply cannot be left behind.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following the \ntext of my statement a description of the bill's provisions, and \nletters I have received from small business organizations supporting \nthe Small Business Works Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Self Business Works Act of 2001\n\n\n                   title I--small business tax relief\n\n     Self-Employed Health Insurance Deductibility\n       The bill amends section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code to increase the deduction for health-insurance costs for \n     self-employed individuals to 100 percent beginning on January \n     1, 2001. Currently the self-employed can only deduct 60 \n     percent of these costs. The deduction is not scheduled to \n     reach 100 percent until 2003, under the provisions signed \n     into law in October 1998. The bill is designed to place self-\n     employed individuals on an equal footing with large \n     businesses, which can currently deduct 100 percent of the \n     health-insurance costs for all of their employees.\n       In addition, the bill corrects a disparity under current \n     law that bars a self-employed individual from deducting any \n     of his or her health-insurance costs if the individual is \n     eligible to participate in another health-insurance plan. \n     This provision affects self-employed individuals who are \n     eligible for, but do not participate in, a health-insurance \n     plan offered through a second job or through a spouse's \n     employer. That insurance plan may not be adequate for the \n     self-employed business owner, and this provision prevents the \n     self-employed from deducting the costs of insurance policies \n     that do meet the specific needs of their families. In \n     addition, this provision provides a significant disincentive \n     for self-employed business owners to provide group health \n     insurance for their employees. The bill ends this disparity \n     by clarifying that a self-employed person loses the deduction \n     only if he or she actually participates in another health-\n     insurance plan.\n       The bill also levels the playing field by permitting self-\n     employed individuals to deduct the cost of their health \n     insurance against their self-employment taxes. This change \n     will put the self-employed on an equal footing with owners \n     and employees of corporations whose health-insurance benefits \n     are not subject to employment taxes.\n     Alternative Minimum Tax Relief\n       The bill repeals the individual Alternative Minimum Tax \n     (AMT) by 2006. For individual taxpayers, the individual AMT \n     has become an increasingly burdensome tax. For the sole \n     proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, the \n     individual AMT increases their tax liability by, among other \n     things, limiting depreciation and depletion deductions, net \n     operating loss treatment, the deductibility of state and \n     local taxes, and expensing of research and experimentation \n     costs. In addition, because of its complexity, this tax \n     forces small business owners to waste precious funds on tax \n     professionals to determine whether the AMT even applies.\n       The bill addresses these issues by eliminating 20 percent \n     of the individual AMT each year until complete repeal is \n     achieved in 2006. During the phase-out period, the bill \n     extends the current exclusion of personal tax credits from \n     the AMT, and it coordinates the farm income-averaging rules \n     with the AMT to ensure that farmers and ranchers do not lose \n     the benefits of income averaging.\n       For small corporate taxpayers, the bill increases the \n     current exemption from the corporate AMT, under section 55(e) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the bill, a small \n     corporation will initially qualify for the exemption if its \n     average gross receipts are $7.5 million or less (up from the \n     current $5 million) during its first three taxable years. \n     Thereafter, a small corporation will continue to qualify for \n     the AMT exemption for so long as its average gross receipts \n     for the prior three-year period do not exceed $10 million (up \n     from the current $7.5 million). The increased limits for the \n     small-corporation exemption from the corporate AMT will be \n     effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n     Repeal of Federal Unemployment Surtax\n       In 1976, a surtax of 0.2 percent was added to the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax to repay loans from the Federal unemployment \n     fund made during the 1974 recession. Those loans were fully \n     repaid in 1987. Accordingly, the bill repeals the 0.2 percent \n     surtax beginning in taxable year 2001.\n     Extend Research and Experimentation Tax Credit Permanently\n       The bill permanently extends the research and \n     experimentation (R) tax credit, which has been a valuable \n     resource for businesses developing new products. Under \n     current law, the R tax credit is set to expire on June 30, \n     2004.\n     Increased Deduction for Business Meal Expenses\n       The bill increases the limitation on the deductibility of \n     business meals from the current 50 percent to 80 percent \n     beginning in 2001. Unlike their large competitors, small \n     enterprises often sell their products and services by word of \n     mouth and close many business transactions on the road or in \n     a local diner. In addition, individuals who are subject to \n     the Federal hours-of-service limitations of the Department of \n     Transportation (such as truck drivers) are currently able to \n     deduct 60 percent of their business meals and are on schedule \n     to deduct up to 80 percent in coming years. Accordingly, the \n     bill corrects this significant lack of parity for small-\n     business owners by putting them on par with individuals \n     subject to hours-of-service limitations and their large \n     competitors.\n\n\n              title II--small business tax simplification\n\n     Clarification of Cash Accounting Rules for Small Businesses\n       The bill amends section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     provide a clear threshold for small businesses to use the \n     cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, instead \n     of accrual accounting. To qualify, the business must have $5 \n     million or less in average annual gross receipts based on the \n     preceding three years. Thus, even if the production, \n     purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing \n     factor in the taxpayer's business, the taxpayer will not \n     be required to use an accrual method of accounting if the \n     taxpayer meets the average annual gross receipts test.\n       In addition, the bill provides that a taxpayer meeting the \n     average annual gross receipts test is not required to account \n     for inventories under section 471. The taxpayer will be \n     required to treat such inventory in the same manner as \n     materials or supplies that are not incidental. Accordingly, \n     the taxpayer may deduct the expenses for such inventory that \n     are actually consumed and used in the operation of the \n     business during that particular taxable year.\n       The bill indexes the $5 million average annual gross \n     receipts threshold for inflation. The cash-accounting safe \n     harbor will be effective for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n     Increase in Expense Treatment for Small Businesses\n       The bill amends section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     increase the amount of equipment purchases that small \n     businesses may expense each year from the current $24,000 to \n     $50,000. This change will eliminate the burdensome \n     recordkeeping involved in depreciating such equipment and \n     free up capital for small businesses to grow and create jobs.\n       The bill also increases the phase-out limitation for \n     equipment expensing from the current $200,000 to $400,000, \n     thereby expanding the type of equipment that can qualify for \n     expensing treatment. This limitation along with the annual \n     expensing amount will be indexed for inflation under the \n     bill.\n       Following the recommendation of the National Taxpayer \n     Advocate, the bill also amends section 179 to permit \n     expensing in the year that the property is purchased or the \n     year that the property is placed in service, whichever is \n     earlier. This will eliminate the difficulty that many small \n     firms have encountered when investing in new equipment in one \n     tax year (e.g., 2000) that cannot be placed in service until \n     the following year (e.g., 2001). The bill also expands \n     section 179 to permit the expensing of computer software up \n     to the new $50,000 limit.\n       The equipment-expensing provisions will be effective for \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000.\n     Modification of Depreciation Rules\n       The bill modifies the outdated depreciation rules to permit \n     taxpayers to depreciate computer equipment and software over \n     a two-year period. Under present law, computer equipment is \n     generally depreciated over a five-year period and software is \n     usually depreciated over three years. With the rapid \n     advancements in technology, these depreciation periods are \n     sorely out of date and can result in small businesses having \n     to exhaust their depreciation deductions well after the \n     equipment or software is obsolete. The bill makes the tax \n     code in this area more consistent with the technological \n     reality of the business world.\n       The bill also amends section 280F of the Internal Revenue \n     Code, which limits the amount of depreciation that a business \n     may claim with respect to a vehicle used for business \n     purposes. Under the current thresholds, a business loses a \n     portion of its depreciation deduction if the vehicle placed \n     in service in 2000 costs more than $14,400. Although these \n     limitations have been subject to inflation\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n     adjustments, they have not kept pace with the actual cost of \n     new cars and vans in most cases. For many small businesses, \n     the use of a car or van is an essential asset for \n     transporting personnel to sales and service appointments and \n     for delivering their products. Accordingly, the bill adjusts \n     the thresholds so that a business will not lose any of its \n     depreciation deduction for automobiles costing less than \n     $25,000, which will continue to be indexed for inflation.\n     Simplification of Estimated Tax Rules\n       The bill simplifies the current rules for calculating the \n     level of estimated taxes necessary to avoid the interest \n     penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. Currently, small \n     business owners can avoid the interest penalty if they pay \n     estimated taxes equal to at least 90 percent of their tax \n     liability for the current year. Alternatively, for taxable \n     year 2001, small business owners who earned more than \n     $150,000 in taxable year 2000 can avoid the interest penalty \n     if they pay estimated taxes equal to 112 percent of their \n     2000 tax liability. For taxable years 2002 and beyond, the \n     threshold will be 110 percent. In contrast, taxpayers earning \n     $150,000 or less, can avoid the penalty by paying estimated \n     taxes equal to 100 percent of their prior year's tax \n     liability.\n       The bill simplifies the estimated-tax rules by providing a \n     consistent test for avoiding the interest penalty: taxpayers \n     must deposit estimated taxes equal to 90 percent of the \n     current year's or 100 percent of the prior year's tax \n     liability. This change will eliminate complex calculations \n     currently required of small business owners and ease strains \n     on the business' cashflow. These changes will be effective \n     for tax years beginning after the date of enactment.\n     Exemption from Partnership Rules for Sole Proprietorships \n         Jointly Owned by Spouses\n       The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) National Taxpayer \n     Advocate's Annual Report to Congress for 2001 identified a \n     problem facing married couples operating a small business. \n     Although these couples file a joint tax return, they are \n     currently required to comply with the onerous partnership \n     rules instead of being permitted to treat the business as a \n     sole proprietorship. According to IRS estimates, the \n     additional burden of the partnership rules can add more than \n     200 hours to the time required to prepare the business' tax \n     return than would be necessary if it were treated as a sole \n     proprietorship.\n       The bill amends section 761 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     permit married couples who file joint tax returns to opt out \n     of the partnership rules and treat their jointly owned \n     business as a sole proprietorship. It also amends the self-\n     employment tax rules to allow such married couples to receive \n     Social Security credits on an individual basis, which they \n     currently receive when filing a partnership return.\n\n\n             Title III--Small Business Taxpayer Protections\n\n     Taxpayer's right to have an IRS examination take place at \n         another site\n       The bill provides that the IRS must accept a taxpayer's \n     request that an audit be moved away from his or her home or \n     business premises if the off-site location (e.g., an \n     accountant's office) is accessible to the auditor and the \n     taxpayer's books and records are available at such a \n     location. This provision will enable the IRS to conduct an \n     audit but without the fear and disruption resulting from the \n     auditor being present in a family home and among a business' \n     employees and customers for days or weeks.\n     Clarification that Electronic Filing is a Goal, not a Mandate\n       The bill amends the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998 (Public Law 105-206) to clarify that the IRS should set \n     as a goal, but not a mandate, that paperless filing should be \n     the preferred and most convenient means of filing tax and \n     information returns in 80 percent of cases by the year 2007. \n     Concerns have been raised that in order to reach this goal, \n     the IRS may have to require certain taxpayers to file \n     electronically. The bill makes clear that electronic filing \n     should be a voluntary option for taxpayers, not a new \n     government mandate.\n     Taxpayer's election with respect to recovery of costs and \n         certain fees\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code, a taxpayer may recover \n     costs and fees, including attorney's fees, against the IRS if \n     he or she prevails and the IRS' litigation position was not \n     substantially justified. The Equal Access to Justice Act \n     (EAJA) permits a small business to recover such costs when an \n     unreasonable agency demand for fines or civil penalties is \n     not sustained in court or in an administrative proceeding. In \n     addition, a small business may also recover such costs and \n     fees under the EAJA when it is the prevailing party and the \n     agency enforcement action is not substantially justified. \n     Currently, the EAJA prohibits a taxpayer seeking to recover \n     costs and fees in an IRS enforcement action from doing so \n     under the EAJA if the fees and costs can be recovered under \n     the Internal Revenue Code.\n       The bill permits taxpayers to elect whether to pursue \n     recovery of attorney's fees and expenses under the EAJA or \n     the Internal Revenue Code.\n     Repeal of the failure-to-pay penalty\n       The failure-to-pay penalty was originally enacted in the \n     1960s to compensate for the low rate of interest applied to \n     an individual's tax liability, and for the fact that such \n     interest was not compounded. Today, with interest compounded \n     daily and adjusted for changes in the interest rate, this \n     penalty is no longer needed and serves only as another \n     hidden, second penalty. In addition, this penalty is often \n     applied on top of accuracy-related penalties, resulting in \n     total punishment of as much as 45 percent in non-criminal \n     cases. To simplify the tax rules and reduce the multiplicity \n     of punishment on taxpayers, the bill repeals the failure-to-\n     pay penalty.\n     Limit Compounded Interest to Underlying Tax\n       Under current law, when a taxpayer fails to pay the correct \n     amount of taxes, interest is applied and compounded not only \n     on the underlying tax liability, but also on any penalties \n     assessed. As a result, compound interest becomes an \n     additional penalty. In many cases the interest on penalties \n     can substantially increase the total amount of tax due and \n     jeopardize the small business taxpayer's ability to pay its \n     tax debt. In addition, calculating the interest on penalties \n     adds an additional layer of complexity and compliance costs \n     for small businesses. The bill alleviates this situation by \n     limiting the application of interest to only the underlying \n     tax assessment.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                          Legislative Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: First, let me take the opportunity on \n     behalf of SBLC, to thank you for your tireless efforts on \n     behalf of small business. I have no doubt that in future \n     Congresses we will be holding up your stewardship of the \n     Small Business Committee as the model for future chairs.\n       My primary reason in writing is to offer our unqualified \n     support for your initiative to bring fairness and \n     simplification to the current tax system. As you know, \n     perhaps better than anyone in Congress, the current tax code \n     remains a minefield of problems for small business. Your \n     legislation is a comprehensive blueprint for how to sweep it \n     clean.\n       While we endorse all of your initiatives, I do want to take \n     the opportunity to single out four items.\n       We are absolutely convinced settling the issue of whether \n     small businesses can use cash accounting is not only a matter \n     of fairness, but that it will also significantly simplify \n     small business compliance. We have had a hard time \n     understanding why the IRS has been so intent on chasing the \n     opportunity to collect a few tax dollars just a little \n     sooner. Using cash accounting is not about tax avoidance. The \n     costs to small business productivity must surely outweigh the \n     time value of revenue to the government.\n       SBLC was one of the original champions of the concept of \n     direct expensing. We wholeheartedly endorse your efforts to \n     ``modernize'' the concept. The amount needs to be increased. \n     The other important reason to address cost recovery is that \n     our depreciation system is no longer in sync with the pace of \n     technology obsolescence.\n       One of the ticking time bombs of the tax code is the \n     personal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). We believe in the \n     near future it may do more harm to small business than any \n     other provision of the tax code. It swallows up any profits \n     that can be reinvested in the business.\n       Finally, Section 280F of the tax code and regulations \n     thereunder, reflect a different time and different philosophy \n     with respect to business vehicles. It is time to move the \n     clock ahead two decades and simplify the process of dealing \n     with this provision.\n       We look forward, as always, to working with you on behalf \n     of small business.\n       As you know, the SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition \n     of 80 trade and professional associations that share a common \n     commitment to the future of small business. Our members \n     represent the interests of small businesses in such diverse \n     economic sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, tourism and agriculture. Our policies are \n     developed through a consensus among our membership. \n     Individual associations may express their own views. For your \n     information, a list of our members is enclosed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John S.

Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Senate Small Business Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I want to \n     express our strong support for the ``Small Business Works Act \n     of 2001'' which would provide badly needed tax relief to \n     America's small business. NFIB urges the Senate to quickly \n     support its adoption.\n       While economic conditions for small business remain \n     relatively strong, economic activity has cooled over the past \n     few months. According to NFIB's monthly Small Business \n     Economic Trends (SBET) index, confidence in the economy is \n     approximately half as strong as it was a year ago. Over the \n     coming months, it appears likely that the problem of the \n     slowing economy will only continue.\n       Small businesses are forced by Washington to spend an \n     overwhelming amount of time, money, and energy complying with \n     the tax and regulatory burdens. With the economy showing \n     signs of slowing, tax relief will significantly help spur \n     immediate economic recovery for America's small businesses.\n       Your bill goes a long way towards providing America's small \n     business owners valuable tax relief.\n       Cash vs. Accrual Accounting--Clarifying the IRS code to \n     state clearly that small business owners with gross revenues \n     below $5 million are eligible to use cash accounting methods \n     would save small business owners from spending valuable \n     resources on high-priced tax accountants and lawyers.\n       Accelerate 100% Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction--\n     Currently, self-employed workers can only deduct 60% of their \n     health-insurance costs from their taxable income. Raising \n     that threshold to 100% in 2001 would cut health-care costs \n     for the typical small-business owner by hundreds of dollars \n     per year.\n       Increase Section 179 Expensing--A majority of NFIB members \n     exceed the current small-business expensing limits in only \n     three months. The limit for 2001 is only $24,000. Raising the \n     threshold to $50,000 and indexing it with inflation will \n     allow additional investments in the business to be expensed \n     thus helping small businesses expand and create new jobs. \n     This provision lowers the cost of capital for tangible \n     property and eliminates depreciation record-keeping \n     requirements. Updating our tax code to reflect the reality of \n     today's technology-based workplace is critical to the \n     continued success of our economy and to the daily advancement \n     of small business in America. Allowing small business to \n     depreciate software assets while they are still useful and \n     efficient technologies is critical to future technological \n     development in the job producing engines of our economy. This \n     change would provide small business owners the opportunity to \n     compete in today's high technology markets.\n       Increase Deduction for Business Meals--For many self-\n     employed and small business owners, discussing business over \n     lunch is an efficient use of time and an absolute necessity \n     when courting new clients. Increasing the deductibility \n     reduces a large and disproportionate tax on small-business \n     owners who rely on mealtime to conduct business.\n       Federal Unemployment Insurance Surtax Repeal--The .2% \n     surtax was adopted in 1976 to repay loans to the federal \n     unemployment fund during the 1974 recession. This debt was \n     fully repaid in 1987. This so-called temporary surtax has \n     long outlived its original purpose and is now used to pay for \n     government programs totally unrelated to the unemployment \n     compensation system.\n       AMT Relief and Repeal--According to the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation, fewer than 1 in 150 taxpayers is subjected to the \n     AMT today. By 2007, however, that number if expected to grow \n     to 1 in 14, with the largest increase coming from taxpayers \n     earning between $50,000 and $100,000. The individual AMT is a \n     remarkably complex and obtuse provision in a tax code not \n     known for its clarity. It literally requires taxpayers to \n     calculate their taxes twice, and then pay the larger amount. \n     While originally designed to ensure that wealthy Americans \n     pay a reasonable level of their income in taxes, the AMT has \n     the side effect of hitting taxpayers--increasingly middle-\n     class taxpayers--when they can least afford the bill. The AMT \n     literally kicks taxpayers when they are down. NFIB supports \n     abolishing the individual Alternative Minimum Tax. NFIB also \n     supports your efforts to increase the exemption for small \n     businesses from the heavily burdensome corporate AMT.\n       Mr. Chairman, we applaud your proactive efforts to reduce \n     the tax burden on small business. We thank you for your \n     continued support of small businesses, and we look forward to \n     working with you to see the ``Small Business Works Act of \n     2001'' enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                            Federal Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 191. A bill to abolish the death penalty under Federal Law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nDeath Penalty Abolition Act of 2001. This bill will abolish the death \npenalty at the Federal level. It will put an immediate halt to \nexecutions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence \nfor violations of Federal law.\n  The most recent Gallup poll shows that, while a majority of Americans \ncontinue to support capital punishment, this support has reached a \nnearly 20-year low. This diminished support comes amid rising concern \nthat the system by which we impose the sentence of death is seriously \nflawed. In the last year or so since I first introduced this bill, the \nAmerican people have learned about the risk of executing innocent \npeople and other fairness and reliability concerns with the \nadministration of the death penalty. I am confident that in the weeks \nand months to come, the American people will continue to learn and \ncontinue to question the fairness of our death penalty system.\n  In recent years, this Chamber has echoed with debate on violence in \nAmerica. We've heard about violence in our schools and neighborhoods. \nSome say it's because of the availability of guns to minors. Some say \nHollywood has contributed to a culture of violence. Others argue that \nthe roots of the problem are far deeper and more complex. Whatever the \ncauses, a culture of violence has certainly infected our nation. As \nschoolhouse killings have shown, our children are now reached by that \nculture of violence, not merely as casual observers, but as \nparticipants and victims.\n  But, I'm not so sure that we in government don't contribute to this \ncasual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and death. With each \nnew death penalty statute enacted and each execution carried out, our \nexecutive, judicial and legislative branches, at both the state and \nfederal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. With each \nperson executed, we're teaching\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\nour children that the way to settle scores is through violence, even to \nthe point of taking a human life. Sadly, total executions in the last \ntwo years--98 in 1999 and 85 in 2000--mark the highest number of total \nannual executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.\n  At the same time, I am pleased that the public debate on the death \npenalty, which was an intense national debate not very long ago, \nappears to have been revived. In the wake of recent controversies \ninvolving DNA technology and the discovery of condemned innocents, we \nare once again having a national debate on this important issue of \njustice. Those who favor the death penalty should be pressed to explain \nwhy fallible human beings should presume to use the power of the state \nto extinguished the life of a fellow human being on our collective \nbehalf. Those who oppose the death penalty should demand that \nexplanation adamantly, and at every turn. But only a zealous few try.\n  Our Nation is a great Nation. We have the strongest democracy in the \nworld. We have expended blood and treasure to protect so many \nfundamental human rights at home and abroad and not always for only our \nown interests. But we can do better. We should do better. Courtesy of \nthe Internet and CNN International, the world observes, perplexed and \nsometimes horrified, the violence in our nation. Across the globe, with \nevery American who is executed, the entire world watches and asks how \ncan the Americans, the champions of human rights, compromise their own \nprofessed beliefs in this way.\n  Religious groups and leaders express their revulsion at the continued \npractice of capital punishment. Pope John Paul II frequently appeals to \nAmerican governors when a death row inmate is about to die. I am \npleased that in one case in January 1999, involving an inmate on death \nrow in Missouri, the late Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan heeded the \ngood advice of the pontiff and commuted the killer's sentence to life \nwithout parole. That case generated a lot of press--but only as a \npolitical issue, rather than a moral question or a human rights \nchallenge.\n  But the Pope is not standing alone against the death penalty. He is \njoined by the chorus of voices of various people of faith who abhor the \ndeath penalty. Religious groups from the National Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, \nthe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Mennonites, the Central \nConference of American Rabbis, and so many more people of faith have \nproclaimed their opposition to capital punishment. And, I might add, \neven conservative Pat Robertson protested the execution in 1998 of \nKarla Faye Tucker, a born-again Christian on Texas death row. Mr. \nPresident, I would like to see the commutation of sentences to life \nwithout parole for all death row inmates--whether they are Christians, \nMuslims, Jews, Buddhists, or some other faith, or no faith at all.\n  The United States' imposition of capital punishment is abhorrent not \nonly to people of faith. Our use of the death penalty also stands in \nstark contrast to the majority of nations that have abolished the death \npenalty in law or practice. Even South Africa and Russia--nations that \nfor years were violators of basic human rights and liberties--have \nabolished the death penalty or are moving toward abolition of the death \npenalty, respectively. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights \nhas called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the death penalty. \nThe European Union denies membership in the alliance to those nations \nthat use the death penalty. In fact, it passed a resolution calling for \nthe immediate and unconditional global abolition of the death penalty, \nand it specifically called on all states within the United States to \nabolish the death penalty. This is significant because it reflects the \nunanimous view of the nations with which the United States enjoys its \ncloset relationships--nations that so often follow our lead.\n\n  What is even more troubling in the international context is that the \nUnited States is now one of only six countries that imposes the death \npenalty for crimes committed by children. I'll repeat that because it \nis remarkable. We are one of only six nations on this earth that puts \nto death people who were under 18 years of age when they committed \ntheir crimes. The others are Iran, Pakistan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and \nYemen. These are countries that are often criticized for human rights \nabuses. When will we rectify this clear human rights violation--the \nexecution of people who were not even adults when they committed the \ncrimes for which they were sentenced to die?\n  Let's look at the numbers. Since 1990, the United States has executed \n14 child offenders. That's more than all of the five aforementioned \nnations combined. In 2000, the rest of the world watched as the United \nStates not only executed four juvenile offenders, but was the only \nnation to engage in such an egregious practice at all. Even China--the \ncountry that many members of Congress, including myself, have \ncriticized for its human rights abuses--apparently has the decency not \nto execute its children. This is embarrassing. Is this the kind of \ncompany we want to keep? Is this the kind of world leader we want to \nbe? But these are the facts, from the last decade of the 20th century \nto the present. No one, Mr. President, no one can reasonably argue that \nbased on this data, executing child offenders is a normal or acceptable \npractice in the world community. And I don't think we should be proud \nof the fact that the United States is the world leader in the execution \nof child offenders.\n  Is the death penalty a deterrent for our children's conduct, as well \nas that of adult Americans? The numbers prove that those who believe \nthat capital punishment is an effective deterrent are sadly, sadly \nmistaken. The Federal Government and most States in the U.S. have a \ndeath penalty, while our European counterparts do not. Following the \nlogic of death penalty supporters who believe it is a deterrent, you \nwould think that our European allies, who don't use the death penalty, \nwould have a higher murder rate than the United States. Yet, they don't \nand it's not even close. In fact, the murder rate in the U.S. is six \ntimes higher than the murder rate in Britain, seven times higher than \nin France, and five times higher than in Sweden.\n  But we don't even need to look across the Atlantic to see that \ncapital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. The geographical \ndisparities within the United States lead to the same conclusion. Let's \ncompare Wisconsin and Texas. I'm proud of the fact that in 1853, my \nhome state of Wisconsin became the first state in the nation to abolish \nthe death penalty completely. Wisconsin has been death penalty-free for \nnearly 150 years. In contrast, Texas is the most prodigious user of the \ndeath penalty, having executed 241 people since 1976. Let's look at the \nmurder rate in Wisconsin and Texas. During the period 1995 to 1998, \nTexas has had a murder rate that is nearly double the murder rate in \nWisconsin. The same trend can also be detected on a regional scale. The \nSouthern region of the United States has a higher murder rate than any \nother region. Yet, executions taking place in that region constituted \nalmost 90 percent of executions in the nation as a whole. These and \ncountless other data continue to call into question the argument that \nthe death penalty is a deterrent to murder.\n  In fact, according to a 1995 Hart Research poll, the majority of our \nnation's police chiefs do not believe the death penalty is a \nparticularly effective law enforcement tool. When asked to rank the \nvarious factors in reducing crime, police chiefs rank the death penalty \nlast. Rather, the police chiefs--the people who deal with hardened \ncriminals day in and day out--cite reducing drug abuse as the primary \nfactor in reducing crime, along with a better economy and jobs, \nsimplifying court rules, longer prison sentences, more police officers, \nand reducing guns. It looks like most police chiefs recognize what our \nEuropean allies and a few states like Wisconsin have known all along; \nthe death penalty is not an effective deterrent.\n  Let me be clear. I believe murderers and other violent offenders \nshould be severely punished. I'm not seeking to open the prison doors \nand let murderers come rushing out into our communities. I don't want \nto free them. The question is: should the death penalty be a means of \npunishment in our\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nsociety? One of the most frequent refrains from death penalty \nsupporters is the claim that the majority of Americans support the \ndeath penalty. But Mr. President, an August 2000 Gallup poll shows that \nwhile 67 percent of Americans support the death penalty, only 28 \npercent do so without reservations. In contrast, 37 percent support the \ndeath penalty with reservations and 26 percent of Americans do not \nsupport the death penalty at all.\n\n  Furthermore, surveys show that when sentencing alternatives are \noffered, support for the death penalty drops to below 50 percent. And a \nplurality of Americans prefer life without parole plus restitution for \nthe victim's family to the death penalty. According to a 1993 national \npoll, 44 percent of Americans supported the alternative of life without \nparole plus restitution. Only 41 percent preferred the death penalty \nand 15 percent were unsure. This is remarkable. Sure, if you ask \nAmericans the simple, isolated question of whether they support the \ndeath penalty, a majority of Americans will agree. But if you ask them \nwhether they support the death penalty or a realistic, practical \nalternative sentence like life without parole plus restitution, support \nfor the death penalty falls dramatically to below 50 percent. More \nAmericans support the alternative sentence than the death penalty.\n  The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is \ndisturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the \nStates' and federal use of the death penalty is often not consistent \nwith principles of due process, fairness and justice. These principles \nare the foundation of our criminal justice system and, in a broader \nsense, the stability of our nation. It is clearer than ever before that \nwe have put innocent people on death row. In addition, statistics show \nthat those States that have the death penalty are more likely to put \npeople to death for killing white victims than for killing black \nvictims.\n  Are we certain that innocent persons are not being executed? \nObviously not. Are we certain that racial bias is not infecting the \ncriminal justice system and the administration of the death penalty? I \ndoubt it.\n  It simply cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to \ndeath. Since the modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we \nhave released 93 men and women in 22 states from death row. Why? \nBecause they were innocent. Ninety-three men and women sitting on death \nrow, awaiting a firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, but \nlater found innocent. That's one death row inmate found innocent for \nevery seven executed. One in seven! That's a pretty poor performance \nfor American justice. A wrongful conviction means that the real killer \nmay have gotten away. What an injustice that the victims' loved ones \ncannot rest because the killer is still not caught. What an injustice \nthat an innocent man or woman has to spend even one day in jail. What a \nstaggering injustice that innocent people are sentenced to death for \ncrimes they did not commit. What a disgrace when we carry out those \nsentences, actually taking the lives of innocent people in the name of \njustice.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to the recent example of an Illinois \ndeath row inmate, Anthony Porter, who was freed in 1999 after 16 years \nof his life were wasted awaiting execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. Mr. Porter came within two days of execution when his life was \nspared only because of questions regarding his mental competency. Mr. \nPorter owes his freedom, as some previous Illinois death row inmates \ndo, to investigation by Northwestern University journalism students. \nThey persuaded the true killer to confess on videotape. A statement by \nthe true killer's estranged wife that Chicago police pressured her into \ntestifying against Porter further represents the level of unreliability \nand failures in the administration of the death penalty surrounding \nthis case. College students were able to successfully spare the lives \nof innocent men. Men were freed from death row not because of \ntechnicalities, but because they were truly innocent. Mr. President, it \nis clear that our criminal justice system is sometimes far from just \nand sometimes just plain wrong.\n  One is left with the inescapable conclusion that even if it is not \nabsolutely certain, it is very possible that innocent people have been \nexecuted. Why? We can all agree that it is profoundly wrong to convict \nand condemn innocent people to death. But sadly, that's what's \nhappening. With the greater accuracy and sophistication of DNA testing \navailable today compared to even a couple of years ago, states like \nIllinois are finding that people sitting on death row did not commit \nthe crimes to which earlier, less accurate DNA tests appeared to link \nthem. This DNA technology should be further reviewed and compared to \nother tests. We should make sure that the most sophisticated, modern \nDNA tests are made available to those on death row.\n  Some argue that the discovery of the innocence of a death row inmate \nproves that the system works. This is absurd. How can you say the \ncriminal justice system works when a group of students--not lawyers or \ninvestigators but students with no special powers, who were very much \noutside the system--discover that a man about to be executed was, in \nfact, innocent? A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll shows that \n63 percent of Americans favor suspending capital punishment until \nfairness questions can be adequately studied. Americans recognize the \nfailures of our justice system and are demanding answers.\n  A primary reason why our justice system has sometimes been less than \njust is a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that seem to fail to \ngrasp the significance and responsibility of their task when a human \nlife is at stake. The Supreme Court has been narrowly focused on \nprocedural technicalities, ignoring the fact that the death penalty is \na unique punishment that cannot be undone to correct mistakes. In Jones \nv. United States, which involved an inmate on death row in Texas and \nthe interpretation of the 1994 Federal Death Penalty Act, the judge \nrefused to tell the jury that if they deadlocked on the sentence, the \nlaw required the judge to impose a sentence of life without possibility \nof parole. As a result, some jurors were under the grave \nmisunderstanding that lack of unanimity would mean the judge could give \na sentence where the defendant might one day go free. The jurors \ntherefore returned a sentence of death. The Supreme Court upheld the \nlower court's imposition of the death penalty. And one more person will \nlose a life, when a simple correction of a misunderstanding could have \nresulted in a severe, yet morally correct, sentence of life without \nparole.\n\n  As legal scholar Ronald Dworkin recently observed, ``[t]he Supreme \nCourt has become impatient, and super due process has turned into due \nprocess-lite. Its impatience is understandable, but is also \nunacceptable.'' Mr. President, America's impatience with the protracted \nappeals of death row inmates is understandable. But this impatience is \nunacceptable. The ruse to judgment is unacceptable. And the rush to \nexecute men, women and children who might well be innocent is \nhorrifying.\n  The discovery of the innocence of death row inmates and misguided \nSupreme Court decisions disallowing potentially dispositive and/or \nexculpatory evidence, however, aren't the only reasons we need to \nabolish the death penalty. Another reason we need to abolish the death \npenalty is the continuing evidence of racial bias in our criminal \njustice system. Our nation is facing a crucial test. A test of moral \nand political will. We have come a long way through this nation's \nhistory, and especially in this century, to dismantle state-sponsored \nand societal racism. Brown v. Board of Education, ensuring the right to \nequal educational opportunities for whites and blacks, was decided \nalmost half a century ago. Unfortunately, however, we are still living \nwith vestiges of institutional racism. In some cases, racism can be \nfound at every stage of a capital trial--in the selection of jurors, \nduring the presentation of evidence, when the prosecutor contrasts the \nrace of the victim and defendant to appeal to the prejudice of the \njury, and sometimes during jury deliberations.\n  After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the \ndeath penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the \nfederal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since \nthat time, numerous additional Federal crimes have become\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\ndeath penalty-eligible, bringing the total to about 60 federal crimes \ntoday. At the federal level, 20 people currently sit on death row. \nAnother seven men sit on the military's death row. Of those 2 \ndefendants on the federal government's death row, 14 are black and only \n4 are white. One defendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 \nof the 20 people on federal death row are members of a racial or ethnic \nminority. That's 80 percent. And the numbers are worse on the \nmilitary's death row. Six of the seven, or 86 percent, on military \ndeath row are minorities.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember the debates of the late 1980's and \nearly 1990's, when Congress considered the Racial Justice Act and other \nattempts to eradicate racial bias in the administration of capital \npunishment. A noted study evaluating the role of race in death penalty \ncases was frequently discussed. This was the study by David Baldus, a \nprofessor at the University of Iowa College of Law. The Baldus study \nfound that defendants who kill white victims are more than four times \nmore likely to be sent to death row than defendants who kill black \nvictims. An argument against the Baldus study was made by some \nopponents of the Racial Justice Act. They argued that we just needed to \n``level up'' the playing field. In other words, send all the defendants \nwho killed black victims to death row, too. They argued that \nlegislative remedies were not needed, just tell prosecutors and judges \nto go after perpetrators of black homicide as strong as against \nperpetrators of white homicide. I believe such arguments displayed a \nshocking insensitivity to racial bias in our criminal justice system.\n  Problems with bias and arbitrariness have not escaped the federal \ndeath penalty system. In September 2000, the Department of Justice \nreleased a report on the federal death penalty system. That report that \nwhether one will live or die in the federal system appears to be \nrelated to the color of one's skin or the federal district in which the \nprosecution takes place. I think we can all agree that the report is \ndeeply disturbing. There is a glaring lack of uniformity in the \napplication of the federal death penalty. Why do these disparities \nexist? How can they be addressed? The Justice Department report doesn't \nhave answers to these and other questions. I am pleased that Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno initiated additional, internal reviews, and it is my \nfervent hope that the next Attorney General will follow through on this \nimportant further study and analysis.\n  One thing is clear: no matter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the \ninevitable fallibility of being human. That fallibility means that we \nwill be unable to apply the death penalty in a fair and just manner. \nThe risk that we will condemn innocent people to death will always \nlurk. Mr. President, let's restore some certainty, fairness, and \njustice to our criminal justice system. Let's have the courage to \nrecognize human fallibility.\n\n  The American Bar Association has also raised fairness and due process \nconcerns. In 1997, the American Bar Association became the first \norganization to call for a moratorium on the death penalty. Several \nstates are finally beginning to recognize the great injustice when the \nultimate punishment is carried out in a biased and unfair way. In \nJanuary 2000, Governor George Ryan became the first chief executive to \nplace a moratorium on executions. Moratorium bills have been considered \nby the legislatures of at least ten states over the last two years.\n  I am glad to see that some states are finally taking steps to correct \nthe practice of legalized killing that was again unleashed by the \nSupreme Court's Gregg decision in 1976. The first post-Gregg execution \ntook place in 1977 in Utah, when Gary Gilmore did not challenge and \ninstead aggressively sought his execution by a firing squad. The first \npost-Gregg involuntary execution took place on May 25, 1979. I vividly \nremember that day. I had just finished my last law school exam that \nmorning. Later that day, I recall turning on the television and \nwatching the news report that Florida had just executed John \nSpenkelink. I was overcome with a sickening feeling. Here I was, fresh \nout of law school and firm in my belief that our legal system was \nadvancing through the latter quarter of the twentieth century. Instead, \nto my great dismay, I was witnessing a throwback to the electric chair, \nthe gallows, and the routine executions of our Nation's earlier \nhistory.\n  I haven't forgotten that experience or what I thought and felt on \nthat day. At the beginning of 2001, at the end of a remarkable century \nand millennium of progress and at the beginning of a new century and \nmillennium with hopes for even greater progress, I cannot help but \nbelieve that our progress has been tarnished by our Nation's not only \ncontinuing, but increasing use of the death penalty. As of today, the \nUnited States has executed 690 people since the reinstatement of the \ndeath penalty in 1976. This is astounding and it is embarrassing. We \nare a Nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of \njustice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a Nation that \nscrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We are one of \nthe first nations to speak out against torture and killings by foreign \ngovernments. It is time for us to look in the mirror.\n  Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. Justice Harry \nBlackmun penned the following eloquent dissent in 1994:\n\n       From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the \n     machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have \n     endeavored--indeed, I have struggled--along with a majority \n     of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules \n     that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to \n     the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle \n     the Court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has \n     been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel \n     morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that \n     the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually \n     self-evident to me now that no combination of procedural \n     rules or substantive regulations ever can save the death \n     penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies. The \n     basic question--does the system accurately and consistently \n     determine which defendants ``deserve'' to die?--cannot be \n     answered in the affirmative. . . . The problem is that the \n     inevitability of factual, legal, and moral error gives us a \n     system that we know must wrongly kill some defendants, a \n     system that fails to deliver the fair, consistent, and \n     reliable sentences of death required by the Constitution.\n\n  Justice Lewis Powell also had a similar change of mind. Justice \nPowell dissented from the Furman decision in 1972, which struck down \nthe death penalty as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. He also \nwrote the decision in McCleskey v. Kemp in 1987, which denied a \nchallenge to the death penalty on the grounds that it was applied in a \ndiscriminatory manner against African Americans. In 1991, however, \nJustice Powell told his biographer that he had decided that capital \npunishment should be abolished.\n  After sitting on our Nation's highest court for over 20 years, \nJustices Blackmun and Powell came to understand the randomness and \nunfairness of the death penalty. Mr. President, it is time for our \nNation to follow the lead of these two distinguished jurists and re-\nvisit its support for this form of punishment.\n  At the beginning of 2001, as we enter a new millennium, our society \nis still far from fully just. The continued use of the death demenas \nus. The penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it \nis immoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' could not be \nmore appropriate here. Our Nation has long ago done away with other \nbarbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of \nsuspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these punishments \nas contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death \npenalty as we enter the next century. And it's not just a matter of \nmorality. The continued viability of our justice system as a truly just \nsystem requires that we do so. And in the world's eyes, the ability of \nour nation to say truthfully that we are the leader and defender of \nfreedom, liberty and equality demands that we do so.\n\n  I close with the following remarks from Aundre Herron, an attorney \nwho was recently honored in California for her outstanding service in \ndefense of those charged with capital crimes:\n\n       .  .  . [T]he death penalty is America's dark underbelly--\n     the worst of America--the part we seek desperately to hide \n     from public view. . . . It is here--in the worst of America--\n     that the death penalty finds its truest and most sinister \n     meaning--the death penalty is where all the contradictions \n     converge. It is this country's way of destroying the evidence \n     of its failures, its hypocrisy, its shame. It is the last \n     relic of America's worst\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\n     legacies--slavery, segregation, lynching, racism, classism \n     and violence.\n\n  Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take \npatience, persistence and courage. As we head to a new millennium, let \nus leave this archaic practice behind.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great nation. I also call on each state that \nauthorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice.

A bill to amend title 9, United States Code, with respect to \nconsumer credit transactions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer \nCredit Fair Dispute Resolution Act of 2001, a bill that will protect \nand preserve American consumers' right to take their disputes with \ncreditors to court. I first introduced this legislation last year, both \nas a bill and as an amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill. I am \npleased that my distinguished colleague from Vermont, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has joined me again \nas an original cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly \nrequiring their customers to use binding arbitration when a dispute \narises. Consumers are barred by contract from taking a dispute to \ncourt, even small claims court. While arbitration can be an efficient \ntool to settle claims, it is credible and effective only when consumers \nenter into it knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. Unfortunately, \nthat's not happening in the credit card and consumer credit lending \narenas.\n  One of the most fundamental principles of our justice system is the \nconstitutional right to take a dispute to court. Indeed, all Americans \nhave the right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by jury. The \nright to a jury trial in civil cases in Federal court is contained in \nthe Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. Many States provide a \nsimilar right to a jury trial in civil matters filed in state court.\n  Some argue that Americans are over-using the courts. Court dockets \nacross the country are congested with civil cases. In part as a \nresponse to these concerns, various ways to resolve disputes, short of \ngoing to court, have been developed. Alternatives to court litigation \nare collectively known as alternative dispute resolution, or ADR. ADR \nincludes mediation and arbitration. Mediation and arbitration are often \nefficient ways to resolve disputes because the parties can have their \ncase heard well before they would have received a trial date in court.\n  Arbitration, like a court proceeding, involves a third party--an \narbitrator or arbitration panel. The arbitrator issues a decision after \nreviewing the arguments by all parties. Arbitration uses rules of \nevidence and procedure, although it may use rules that are simpler or \nmore flexible than the evidentiary and procedural rules that the \nparties would follow in a court proceeding.\n  Arbitration can be either binding or non-binding. Non-binding \narbitration means that the decision issued by the arbitrator or \narbitration panel takes effect only if the parties agree to it after \nthey know what the decision is. In binding arbitration, parties agree \nin advance to accept and abide by the decision, whatever it is.\n  Some contracts contain clauses that require arbitration to be used to \nresolve disputes that arise after the contract is signed. This is \ncalled ``mandatory arbitration.'' This means that if there is a \ndispute, the complaining party cannot file suit in court and instead is \nrequired to pursue arbitration. ``Mandatory, binding arbitration'' \ntherefore means that under the contract, the parties must use \narbitration to resolve a future disagreement and the decision of the \narbitrator or arbitration panel is final. The parties have no ability \nto seek relief in court or through mediation. In fact, if they are not \nsatisfied with the arbitration outcome, they are probably stuck with \nthe decision.\n  Under mandatory, binding arbitration, even if a party believes that \nthe arbitrator did not consider all the facts or follow the law, the \nparty cannot file a suit in court. The only basis for challenging a \nbinding arbitration decision is fairly narrow: if there is reason to \nbelieve that the arbitrator committed actual fraud, or was partial, \ncorrupt or guilty of misconduct, or exceeded his or her powers. In \ncontrast, if a dispute is resolved by a court, the parties can have \nbroader grounds upon which to pursue an appeal of the lower court's \ndecision.\n  Because mandatory, binding arbitration is so conclusive, it is a \ncredible means of dispute resolution only when all parties understand \nthe full ramifications of agreeing to it. But that's not what's \nhappening in a variety of contexts--from motor vehicle franchise \nagreements, to employment agreements, to credit card agreements. I'm \nproud to have sponsored legislation addressing employment agreements \nand motor vehicle franchise agreements. Many of my colleagues have \njoined as cosponsor of one or both bills. And just last spring, my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, chaired a hearing \nin the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts on contractual mandatory, binding arbitration. That hearing \nincluded a discussion of mandatory arbitration in the consumer credit \nagreement context.\n  There is a growing, menacing trend of credit card companies and \nconsumer credit lenders inserting mandatory, binding arbitration \nclauses in agreements with consumers. Companies like First USA Bank, \nAmerican Express, and Green Tree Discount Company unilaterally insert \nmandatory, binding arbitration clauses in their agreements with \nconsumers, often without the consumer's knowledge or consent.\n  The most common way credit card companies have done this is through \nthe use of a ``bill stuffer.'' Bill stuffers are the advertisements and \nother materials that credit card companies insert into envelopes with \nthe customers' monthly statements. Some credit card issuers like \nAmerican Express have placed mandatory arbitration clauses in bill \nstuffers. The arbitration provision is usually buried in fine print in \na mailing that includes a bill and various advertising materials. It is \noften described in a lengthy legal document that most consumers \nprobably don't even skim, much less read carefully.\n\n  American Express's mandatory arbitration provision took effect on \nJune 1, 1999. So, if you're an American Express cardholder and you have \na dispute with American Express, as of June 1999, you can't take your \nclaim to court, even small claims court. You are bound to use \narbitration, and you are bound to the final arbitration decision. In \nthis case, you are also bound to use an arbitration organization \nselected by American Express, the National Arbitration Forum.\n  American Express is not the only credit card company imposing \nmandatory arbitration on its customers. First USA Bank, the largest \nissuer of Visa cards, with 58 million customers, has been doing the \nsame thing since 1997. First USA also alerted its cardholders with a \nbill stuffer, containing a condensed set of terms and conditions in \nfine print. The cardholder, by virtue of continuing to use the First \nUSA card, gave up the right to go to court, even small claims court, to \nresolve a dispute.\n  This growing practice extends beyond credit cards into the consumer \nloan industry. Consumer credit lenders like Green Tree Consumer \nDiscount Company are inserting mandatory, binding arbitration clauses \nin their loan agreements. The problem is that these loan agreements are \nusually adhesion contracts, which means that consumers must either sign \nthe agreement as is, or forego a loan. In other words, consumers lack \nthe bargaining power to have the clause removed.\n  More importantly, when signing on the dotted line of the loan \nagreement, consumers may not even understand what mandatory arbitration \nmeans. In all likelihood, they do not understand that they have just \nsigned away a right to go to court to resolve a dispute with the \nlender. It might be argued that if consumers are not pleased with being \nsubjected to a mandatory arbitration clause, they can cancel their \ncredit card, or not execute on their loan agreement, and take their \nbusiness elsewhere. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done. As I \nmentioned, First USA Bank, the nation's largest Visa card issuer, is \npart of this questionable practice. In fact, the practice is becoming \nso pervasive that consumers may soon no longer have an alternative, \nunless they forego use of a credit card or a consumer loan entirely. \nConsumers should not be forced to make that choice.\n  Companies like First USA, American Express and Green Tree argue that \nthey rely on mandatory arbitration to resolve disputes faster and \ncheaper than in court litigation. The claim may be resolved faster but \nis it really cheaper? Is it as fair as a court of law? I don't think \nso. Arbitration organizations often charge exorbitant fees to\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\nthe consumer who brings a dispute. These costs can be much higher than \nbringing the matter to small claims court and paying a court filing \nfee. Or, the fees could very well be greater than the consumer's claim. \nSo as a result, a consumer's claim is not necessarily resolved more \nefficiently with arbitration. It is resolved either at greater cost to \nthe consumer or not at all, if the consumer cannot afford the costs, or \nthe costs outweigh the amount in dispute.\n  In December 2000, in Green Tree Financial Corp. Alabama et. al. v. \nRandolph, the U.S. Supreme Court found that an arbitration clause that \nis silent as to the costs and fees of arbitration is enforceable. It, \nhowever, left unanswered the question of whether large arbitration \ncosts, which effectively preclude a litigant from vindicating federal \nstatutory rights in the arbitral forum, render the arbitration clause \nunenforceable.\n  Another significant problem with mandatory, binding arbitration is \nthat the lender gets to decide in advance who the arbitrator will be. \nIn the case of American Express and First USA, they have chosen the \nNational Arbitration Forum. All credit card disputes with consumers \ninvolving American Express or First USA are handled by that entity. \nThere would seem to be a significant danger that this would result in \nan advantage for the lenders who are ``repeat players.'' After all, if \nthe National Arbitration Forum develops a pattern of reaching decisions \nthat favor cardholders, American Express or First USA may very well \ndecide to take their arbitration business elsewhere. A system where the \narbitrator has a financial interest in reaching an outcome that favors \nthe credit card company is not a fair alternative dispute resolution \nsystem.\n  At least one state court has found that mandatory arbitration \nprovisions in credit card bill stuffers are unenforceable. A suit filed \nin California state court arose out of a mandatory arbitration \nprovision announced in mailings by Bank of America to its credit card \nand deposit account holders. In 1998, the California Court of Appeals \nruled that the mandatory arbitration clauses unilaterally imposed on \nthe Bank's customers were invalid and unenforceable. The California \nSupreme Court refused to review the decision of the lower court. As a \nresult, credit card companies in California cannot invoke mandatory \narbitration in their disputes with customers. In fact, the American \nExpress bill stuffer notes that the mandatory, binding arbitration \nprovision will not apply to California residents until further notice \nfrom the company. The California appellate court decision was wise and \nwell-reasoned, but consumers in other states cannot be sure that all \ncourts will reach the same conclusion.\n  My bill extends the wisdom of the California appellate decision to \nevery credit cardholder and consumer loan borrower. It amends the \nFederal Arbitration Act to invalidate mandatory, binding arbitration \nprovisions in consumer credit agreements. Now, let me be clear. I \nbelieve that arbitration can be a fair and efficient way to settle \ndisputes. I agree we ought to encourage alternative dispute resolution. \nBut I also believe that arbitration is a fair way to settle disputes \nbetween consumers and lenders only when it is entered into knowingly \nand voluntarily by both parties to the dispute after the dispute has \narisen. Pre-dispute agreements to take disputes to arbitration cannot \nbe voluntary and knowing in the consumer lending context because the \nbargaining power of the parties is so unequal. My bill does not \nprohibit arbitration of consumer credit transactions. It merely \nprohibits mandatory, binding arbitration provisions in consumer credit \nagreements.\n  Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly \nslamming the courthouse doors shut on consumers, often unbeknownst to \nthem. This is grossly unjust. We need to restore fairness to the \nresolution of consumer credit disputes. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Consumer Credit Fair Dispute Resolution Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, last weekend the nation inaugurated a new \nPresident, President George W. Bush. With the change of power now \ncomplete, the President and Congress must now get down to the hard \nbusiness of governing.\n  After eight years of Democratic leadership, it is obvious that a Bush \nAdministration will propose policy changes on several fronts. One of \nthe most important and complex issues for President Bush will be how to \nimplement his national missile defense policy in a manner that \ncontributes to our national security, rather than putting it at risk.\n  For six solid years, Republicans have used national missile defense \nas a ``big stick''--a stick employed not against America's enemies, but \nagainst those who thought we did not need a national missile defense. \nRepublicans repeatedly criticized the Clinton administration for its \napproach to national missile defense, and in the last two presidential \ncampaigns, the promise of a ``robust'' national missile defense figured \nprominently in the Republican Party's platform and foreign policy \nspeeches.\n  Although it is always difficult to get into the minds of the American \npeople, it does appear that, for the most part, the public has ignored \nthis debate. The missile defense issue has commanded the attention of \nonly a tiny minority of the American people. In a recent survey by the \nPew Charitable Trust of priorities for the new administration, \nAmericans rated missile defense in eighteenth place among twenty \nissues.\n  Whether missile defense was on voters' minds or not, however, George \nW. Bush is now our President. He and his team are committed to a \nnational missile defense that will be, in the President's words, \n``effective,'' ``based on the best available options,'' deployed ``at \nthe earliest possible date'' and ``designed to protect all 50 states \nand our friends and allies and deployed forces overseas from missile \nattacks by rogue nations, or accidental launches.''\n  That mantra will suffice for a campaign, but not for policy. \nPresidential campaigns bear little relation to actually being \nPresident, and campaign slogans are but the shadows of flesh and blood \npolicy somewhat related to it, but lacking in both detail and \nsubstance.\n  In short, the real test of President Bush on national missile defense \nis just beginning. It is to take those campaign slogans and turn them \ninto coherent policies and strategies.\n  The challenge for the President and his team is this: to pursue their \ndream of a ``robust'' national missile defense with:\n  Full attention to the technological challenges;\n  Full attention to the potential consequences for arms control;\n  Full attention to the potential impact on strategic stability; and\n  Full attention to its possible effect on America's relations with our \nallies.\n  As our former colleague and Armed Services Committee chairman Sam \nNunn said recently, ``I would hope the new administration would \napproach this subject as a technology, not a theology.''\n  Let me outline some of the key questions that I believe the \nAdministration must consider.\n  A national missile defense policy for the new administration will \nspecify system objectives. Whom shall the system protect, against what \nlevel of attack, and with what level of success--or, on the other hand, \nallowing what rate of failure?\n  As I noted earlier, then-Governor Bush set his initial objectives \nlast May: ``to protect all 50 states and our friends and allies and \ndeployed forces overseas from missile attacks by rogue nations, or \naccidental launches.''\n  That's a very tall order, Mr. President. Can current technology \nsupport its achievement any time soon, or at an affordable cost? I have \nmy doubts.\n  Taken literally, protection ``from . . . accidental launches'' \nrequires an ability to intercept at least a small number of advanced \nRussian warheads, rather than just simple warheads from the so-called \n``rogue states'' of North Korea, Iran or Iraq. And protecting ``our \nfriends and allies and deployed forces overseas'' would require either \nmultiple defenses against ICBM's or else a world-wide system like the \nspace-based laser of Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars.''\n  A serious national missile defense policy will give careful attention \nto possible Russian reactions to our actions. It is not enough to say, \nas President Bush did during the campaign, that ``I will offer Russia \nthe necessary amendments to the ABM Treaty'' and that, ``if Russia \nrefuses the changes we propose, I will give prompt notice'' of our \nintent to withdraw from the Treaty.\n  What will happen if the President does what he proposed during the \ncampaign? Will Russia suspend its compliance with other arms control \nagreements, such as the START Treaty and the Intermediate Nuclear \nForces Treaty? Will future arms reductions occur without agreed means \nof verification? Indeed, will Russia try to rebuild its nuclear forces, \ninstead of reducing them?\n  Will Russia ally itself more closely with China or--worse yet--with \nanti-American ``rogue states'' that seek weapons of mass destruction? \nWill our allies question America's leadership? Will our allies lose \nfaith in the nuclear non-proliferation regime that we put in place?\n  A serious national missile defense policy cannot wish away these \nrisks. Rather, it must consider them and include a strategy for dealing \nwith them.\n  Let us suppose, however, that Russia agrees to work out an \naccommodation with the United States--which is another possible \noutcome. What sort of agreement should the President propose?\n  Is there an agreement that would permit the sort of defense that the \nPresident seeks, while still being reliably limited? Would it be \nverifiable by Russia? How would it safeguard Russia against a U.S. \n``breakout'' from its limitations?\n  How shall a ``robust'' national missile defense be fielded at the \nsame time that Russia and the United States are substantially reducing \ntheir nuclear forces, which is another stated goal of the new \nadministration? Missile defense advocates argue that Russia has nothing \nto fear from a limited defense, because it has so many strategic \nwarheads.\n  But what happens as those numbers go down? How can mutual deterrence \nof full-scale war be maintained? How can Russia accept a system that \nundermines that deterrence?\n  Does it make sense to establish a combined limit on offensive and \ndefensive systems, as some experts have proposed both here and in \nRussia? Is it possible, at very low numbers of strategic forces or by \nadopting sweeping ``de-alerting'' measures as well, to deny either side \nthe ability to mount a disabling first strike? If so, would each side \nthen have to target its remaining missiles on the other side's cities--\nas China does today--in order to maintain a residual capability to \ncause unacceptable damage to a country?\n  How would a U.S.-Russian agreement allowing a ``robust'' national \nmissile defense affect U.S.-Russian strategic stability across the \nwhole range of possible conflicts? If a system were good enough to \nguard against accidental Russian launches, then it could also\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\ncombat such purposeful acts as a so-called ``demonstration'' attack \nusing a small number of warheads. In effect, it would ``raise the bar'' \nfor initiating a strategic nuclear war; that's why it would frustrate \n``rogue states'' with very small strategic forces.\n\n  Would this extra ``firebreak'' against strategic nuclear war make \ntactical nuclear weapons more usable? If so, is that a problem? Would \nit also set a ``floor'' on strategic arms reductions, so that the \nUnited States (and Russia) could still deter ``the old-fashioned way'' \nany third-country attack that would overcome the missile defense?\n  What about the START II ban on MIRV'ed ICBM's? Would an agreement \nwith Russia require relaxation of that ban?\n  What would the consequences be of allowing a given number of MIRV's? \nWould they be small if the number of MIRV's per missile were limited to \n2 or 3, or if MIRV's were restricted to mobile launchers? How \nverifiable would such limitations be, if the MIRV's were on a missile \nthat had both mobile and silo-based variants?\n  Were all these issues solved, and if a U.S.-Russian agreement were to \nbe reached, how would a U.S. national missile defense affect China's \nstrategic force structure and its relations with the United States? \nWould a geographically limited national missile defense--such as a \nboost-phase intercept system deployed only near ``countries of \nconcern''--permit China to maintain its nuclear deterrence at low force \nlevels?\n  With a numerically limited defense, could we accept China increasing \nits strategic forces from 18 warheads to 200 or more? Would that prompt \nan arms race between China and India (and then Pakistan), or even with \nRussia?\n  Or would a ``robust'' national missile defense--whether deployed with \nRussian assent or without it--be so large as to simply strip away \nChina's deterrent capability? If that were the case, what risk would we \nrun of China deciding to attack Taiwan before that date arrived? How \nwould we prepare for that possibility?\n  These are serious and complex questions that I have not heard debated \nor sufficiently discussed. That does not mean that they cannot be \nsolved. It does underlie my own feeling, however, that the world may \nnot be ready yet for the missile defense system that President Bush \nwould like to build, even if the technology were available.\n  If the President seeks substantial world agreement on this course, \nthen the ground must be prepared--not only in Alaska, but in world \ncapitals from London and Paris to Tokyo, and from Moscow to Beijing. If \nhe seriously intends to proceed in the face of world objection, then \nwe--and, whether they like it or not, the rest of the world--must \nprepare for all the complications that may result.\n  It would be unfair to expect President Bush and his team to have \nanswered all these questions already. They have argued the case for a \n``robust'' national missile defense only as a political issue, not as \nthe carefully crafted policy of a government in power. That is \nunderstandable.\n  But now they are the Executive Branch of government. They are in \npower. Now theirs is the burden of putting real flesh on the mere bones \nof a policy that sufficed while they were the opposition.\n  What shall we say to those who take on that burden? On the one hand, \nwe must wish them well. Nobody doubts the sincerity or morality of a \nbelief in a national missile defense, only its practicality.\n  On the other hand, we must also say: Do not go blindly crashing into \nthis new venture.\n  Remember Alexander Pope's line that ``fools rush in, where angels \nfear to tread.'' Remember also that the system you may wish to build \ndoes not yet exist. Neither has its feasibility or cost-effectiveness \nyet been adequately demonstrated.\n  The complexity of the issues raised by a national missile defense--\nand the lack of a proven design for even a limited missile defense, let \nalone a ``robust'' one--lead me to the following respectful suggestions \nto the President and his national security team:\n  (1) fold these issues into the ``Nuclear Posture Review'' mandated by \nthe Congress last year;\n  (2) instruct our military experts to examine in that review the full \nrange of interrelated offensive and defensive issues;\n  (3) give them time to analyze those issues fully and thoughtfully; \nand\n  (4) delay your decisions regarding missile defense architecture and \ndeployment until that review has been completed and absorbed.\n  If President Bush and his team proceed with caution and with fully \narticulated policies and strategies, perhaps they will transform the \nworld. For that is, indeed, their goal, and it is a laudable goal.\n  If they proceed rashly, however, the world is likely to be an \nunforgiving master. If they cannot develop a fully articulated policy, \nthen perhaps a ``robust'' national missile defense is really an \nexpression of the desire to be done with worldly cares, and not a truly \nrational approach to world leadership in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/25/senate-section/article/S589-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 29, 2001\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.
