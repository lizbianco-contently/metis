Give us humble mindedness in \nplace of humanistic materialism.\n  Now on this day, O Lord, we come to You on behalf of our Nation \nasking for divine wisdom for every person in this Senate Chamber. Grant \nthem wisdom and courage to face the challenges of this hour. Even \nthough You have given us incredible intelligence, we cannot hope to \nfind the way without Your help, O Lord.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, we have 3 minutes; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to reserve 30 seconds of the time and have \n2 and a half minutes for the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Each side has 1 and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to then give 1 minute of my time to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 3 minutes of explanation prior to the vote on or in \nrelation to the Dayton amendment No. 622.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts who long before I came to this \nbody was championing the cause of American schoolchildren, and also his \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Vermont, and \nthe Senators from Iowa and Nebraska, who coauthored the earlier IDEA \namendment. I just want to take their excellent idea and make it even \nbetter.\n  My amendment would accelerate their timetable and mandate 40-percent \nFederal funding for the cost of special education in 2 years instead of \nwaiting for 6 years. Why? Because this promise was made 25 years ago \nwhen the Federal mandates under IDEA were enacted.\n  Congress then promised the State and local school districts that the \nFederal Government would pay for 40 percent of their costs. A quarter \ncentury later, Federal funding for special education costs average 12 \npercent nationwide, only 9 percent in my home state of Minnesota. That \nbroken promise affects every schoolchild and every school in Minnesota \nand, I expect, our entire country. Since every school must provide \nspecial education services to every child who needs them, those missing \ndollars must, in Minnesota, be taken away from other funding for \nregular education programs. Every student in Minnesota gets \nshortchanged because the Federal Government has not kept its promise.\n  Now, I'm told that I may be asked: Where will this money come from? \nWell, Mr. President, I'm a brand new Senator, and this is my very first \namendment to come up for a vote on the Senate floor. So, I'll admit my \nignorance. But, I cannot for the life of me, figure out how, in a \nbudget which projects a $5.6 trillion surplus during the next ten \nyears--$2.1 trillion for so-called discretionary spending--there isn't \nenough money for special education.\n  Later today, I'm told, we'll be voting on a $1.35 trillion tax cut. \nWhere will that money come from? From the American taxpayers, \nobviously. So, I'm willing to ask the American Taxpayer, are you \nwilling to share this surplus with American's neediest children? I'm \nconfident that, in Minnesota, the answer would be an overwhelming \n``Yes.'' Yes, there is enough money available to us for tax reduction \nand funding for special education.\n  To the Members of the Senate today, and to the House and Senate \nconferees: Can't you find room in your hearts and in your budget to \nfulfill a twenty-five year broken promise to the children of America \nwith disabilities and with special needs. And to the dedicated teachers \nwho devote their lives to reaching and teaching them.\n  We have the money to fund this commitment. This is not a budget \ndecision. This is a values decision. This is a priorities decision.\n  If we aren't willing to finally fulfill a twenty-five year broken \npromise to America's school children with a small part of a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus, then we have no one to blame, but ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret that I will have to oppose the \namendment by Senator Dayton. I agree with the intent--to fully fund \nIDEA as quickly as possible--but it does it too quickly and undermines \nthe Hagel-Harkin amendment that was already passed on this bill. The \nHagel-Harkin amendment provides the full funding in 6 years. That is a \nreasonable yet ambitious timeframe, and it has bipartisan support.\n  I commend Senator Dayton for his dedication to provide full funding, \nbut I don't think it can be done in 2 years, so I will oppose the \namendment in order to preserve the bipartisan commitment to fully fund \nIDEA in 6 years as passed in the Hagel-Harkin amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota returns us to \na very important issue that we discussed at some length at the outset \nof the bill before us. Like the Hagel-Harkin amendment which was \nadopted and incorporated as part of the pending substitute, the \namendment would convert the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nto a mandatory spending program.\n  Unlike the amendment we adopted 2 weeks ago, the Dayton amendment \nwould provide for full funding of IDEA in 2 years. While I fully \nsupport that goal, I believe it is too ambitious a timetable.\n  As we have seen in vote after vote over the past 2 weeks, the Senate \nbelieves there are several important funding priorities in education \nahead. Neither the budget we adopted nor any budget we are likely to \nadopt in the future can accommodate the increase the Senator seeks. Yet \nat the same time we need to fulfill our commitment to fully fund IDEA, \nwe also need to meet our obligation under title I for teacher training, \nrecruitment, and retention, for afterschool care, early education, and \na host of other priorities.\n  So while I support the goal, I think the path taken by the Hagel-\nHarkin amendment is more reasonable and still very ambitious. I believe \nwe can keep it, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the Dayton \namendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Cleland) is \nnecessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Could we have order, Mr. President? We have another \namendment now that we intend to vote on. There is a brief moment or two \nof explanation, and I think the Members should have the opportunity to \nlisten to the proponents of it. Could we have order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order. \nSenators please take their conversations off the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 443\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 3 minutes for explanation prior to a vote on or in relation \nto the Voinovich amendment No. 443.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, according to the experts, focusing on \nthe earliest years of a child's life can make the greatest difference \nin that child's development and learning. One program we all know that \nmakes a difference is Head Start.\n  In my State, we think so much of Head Start, that when I left office \nas Governor, Ohio was the only State in the Nation where every eligible \nchild whose parents wanted them to be in the program had a slot open to \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, Head Start programs typically have a hard time \nrecruiting teachers with a bachelor's or a master's degree generally \nbecause of the pay differential between Head Start teachers and \nelementary and secondary school teachers.\n  For example, in Ohio today, only 11.3 percent of Head Start teachers \nhave a bachelor's degree. Nationally, it is 22 percent. That needs to \nchange.\n  The amendment Senator Feinstein and I have offered is designed to \nencourage college students working on a bachelor's or a master's degree \nto become a Head Start teacher.\n  In exchange for a 5-year teaching commitment in a qualified Head \nStart program, a college graduate with a bachelor's degree or a \nmaster's degree could have up to $5,000 of their Federal student loan \nwaived.\n  President Bush has pledged to improve the cognitive components of \nHead Start, and to do that, we have to have better teachers.\n  Hopefully, the $5,000 incentive in our amendment will help us reach \nthe President's goal of no child left behind.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this \namendment with Senators Voinovich, Baucus, Cochran, Landrieu, Murray, \nand Corzine.\n  This amendment is simple. We are merely trying to expand the current \nFederal loan forgiveness program to include Head Start teachers. \nElementary and secondary school teachers currently benefit under the \nFederal loan forgiveness program. We think that Head Start teachers \nshould be afforded the same opportunity.\n  In exchange for 5 years of teaching, Head Start teachers could have \nup to $5,000 of their Federal student loans forgiven. By offering Head \nStart teachers the same loan forgiveness benefit, I believe, we will \nencourage more college graduates to enter the field.\n  New educational requirements were included in the 1998 \nreauthorization of the Head Start Program. By 2003, 50 percent of Head \nStart teachers will be required to have an associate or 2-year degree, \na bachelor's, or an advanced degree.\n  How can we ask low-paid Head Start teachers to go back to school to \nfinish their bachelor's degree or college students to enter the field \nif we cannot even offer them the same loan forgiveness already afforded \nto elementary and secondary school teachers?\n  Head Start is one of the most important Federal programs because it \nhas the potential to reach children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing.\n  I believe we must continue to improve the cognitive learning aspects \nof the Head Start program so that children leave the program able to \ncount to ten, to recognize sizes and colors, and to recite the \nalphabet. To ensure cognitive learning, we must continue to raise the \nstandards for Head Start teachers.\n  Offering Head Start teachers similar compensation for their \neducational achievements and expenses afforded to other teachers is one \nstep to encouraging collage graduates to become Head Start teachers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the Senator from \nOhio for his recognition of the need to provide incentives to attract \nindividuals to the worthy cause of teaching in the critical early years \nof learning. As Senator Kennedy has already noted, we have over 100 \namendments filed to this legislation which are not germane. While I \nsupport many of these amendments, including the Voinovich amendment on \nloan forgiveness for Head Start teachers, I think that it is important \nthat the Senate stay focused on the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. I look forward to debating and supporting \nthe Senator from Ohio during the debate on the reauthorization of the \nHead Start Program. However, today I will lend my support to Senator \nKennedy's efforts to keep this education bill from languishing under \nthe load of nongermane amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to support this amendment as \nan amendment on the reauthorization of the Head Start bill. Currently, \nwe are providing loan forgiveness now for elementary and secondary \nteachers when they go into underserved areas. We also had an offset on \nthat. This amendment does not have an offset. We ought to have an \noffset. It ought to be on the Head Start bill.\n  Also, we are trying to keep only germane amendments in this bill. \nThis is not germane.

Mr. President, I agree with the statement just made by \nmy friend from Massachusetts.\n  Senator Voinovich has been a leader--both as Governor and as a \nSenator--in recognizing the critical need to improve the quality of the \ncare and education we provide to our youngest children. The amendment \nhe offers with Senator Feinstein would address this vital issue.\n  My colleagues are absolutely correct that the key to a child's \nachievement in elementary school is found in the years prior to going \nto school, especially at ages 3 and 4.\n  But as I mentioned 2 days ago during the debate on another amendment, \nI have agreed to oppose amendments to this bill that are not directly \nrelevant, and, therefore, I must reluctantly oppose Senator Voinovich's \namendment.\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1836, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1836) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 104 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2002.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd, is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes, \nwith the time not being charged to the reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have order so the Senator from \nWest Virginia can be heard. This is an enormously important issue and \nthe Senator has thought long and hard about it. The Senator is entitled \nto be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \ntake their conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his thoughtfulness, his consideration. I thank the \nChair. I also thank those Senators who are listening, even though they \nmay not be in this Chamber. I thank the majority leader for arranging \nfor me to have this time without its being charged against the time on \nthe reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, the day before yesterday, Americans turned on their \ntelevision sets to see live coverage of a runaway freight train \ntraveling through northwestern Ohio. I saw it. Many of you saw it. \nNobody was at the controls and officials were failing in their attempts \nto stop the train. To make matters worse, the train was carrying toxic \nchemicals. News stations were bracing for disaster. The safety \nmechanisms put into place to prevent such a scenario were not working. \nLocal and emergency personnel were left simply to block highway \nintersections, to issue warnings, and to let the runaway train rumble \nthrough, endangering the environment, endangering the infrastructure of \nwhatever cities or small towns happened to be in the way, and \nendangering the lives of citizens.\n  Mr. President, the Senate, today, faces its own runaway train. These \ntax cuts have been on the fast track since they were first proposed in \nthe snows of New Hampshire during last year's campaign. A budget \nresolution was rushed through this body to authorize this tax cut bill, \nbypassing the Budget Committee, and without the benefit of the \nPresident's detailed budget, or any analysis from the Joint Tax \nCommittee, or the Congressional Budget Office. Senate Democrats were \nthen excluded from the conference committee to further expedite the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I was talking with one of our new Members about the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, and about the fact that the \nmembers of the Budget Committee representing the minority were \nexcluded. This was a relatively new Member in this Senate. He said, ``I \nwas disturbed by that.'' But he said, ``The Democrats did it when they \nwere in power. That is what they tell me.''\n  Mr. President, not a word by those who say that was done by the \nDemocrats when they were in control--not a word--is true. The \nDemocrats, when they were in control, never excluded the then minority \nfrom the conferences or from the committees with respect to the budget. \nI was majority leader and it was not in my makeup; it would be totally \nalien to me to exclude the minority, when I stand up so many times, as \nI have over the years, to say that the Senate is the protector of \nminorities, the Senate protects the minority's rights.\n  I have read about those tales told by some Senators--often, the aides \nof the minority--who are presently in the minority who said: Well, Byrd \ndid this; Byrd did this. Those Members were not even in the Senate when \nByrd was majority leader. They were not here. Three-fifths of the \nSenate makeup today were not here when Byrd was majority leader, were \nnot here when Senator Mansfield was majority leader, were not here when \nLyndon Johnson was majority leader. So much for that.\n  The safety mechanisms that the Senate put into place to prevent such \na reconciliation disaster have been disabled, and there seems little \nanyone can do but issue warnings, and watch the train rumble through, \nendangering our Nation's infrastructure investments and our Nation's \nfiscal soundness.\n  The tax cuts that are involved here--and let me say parenthetically \nthat I like to vote for tax cuts. Over the 55 years I have been in \npublic office, I have voted for a several tax cuts, and it is always a \ngreat pleasure to do that.\n  Let me say this. I respect every Senator in this body, no matter if \nhe disagrees with me, no matter if he votes for this tax cut. I respect \nhis or her decision on that matter. I found when I was majority leader, \nthat the Senator who hurt me today by his vote saved me tomorrow. I say \nwhat I say today with great respect.\n  I am not against all tax cuts, but I am against this one, this \ncolossal tax cut that is based on projections over 10 years away when \nwe cannot even project the economy 1 year away or 6 months away. It is \nlike the weather. These things are really unpredictable.\n  This is a tax cut that threatens to ignite an explosion in the \nnational debt and blow up the economy as resources are squandered and \nlong-term problems are ignored.\n  Mr. President, a few days ago, the Senate passed the FY 2002 budget \nresolution, and even before Senators had voted, there was little reason \nto believe that this body would abide by the revenue levels set forth \nin that budget resolution. Senators were openly talking about how tax \ncuts would exceed those authorized in the budget resolution.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, that budget resolution was a sham. Its \nprimary purpose was to authorize a reconciliation bill by which this \nbody would pass a massive tax cut bill that could not be passed as a \nfree standing bill. This $1.35 trillion tax cut could not be passed in \nthis Senate as a freestanding bill.\n  Section 103 of the FY 2002 budget resolution allows the Republican \nleadership to bring this massive $1.35 trillion tax cut bill to the \nfloor as a reconciliation bill. And why is it so important to that \nleadership? Because section 103 permits the Republican leadership to \nbring the tax cut bill to the floor with, at most, 20 hours of debate. \nAnd reconciliation allows time to be yielded back on a nondebatable \nmotion. Section 103 makes sure that the bill cannot be filibustered. So \nsection 103 makes sure that 51 votes will be enough to pass the tax cut \nbill.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the most important feature of the \nbudget\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nresolution for the Republican leadership was the provision that allows \nthe leadership to muzzle debate on a bill that will change the fiscal \nlandscape of this Nation for a generation and by so doing, to thwart \nthe will of the minority in this Senate.\n  Under our Constitution, under our Senate rules and precedents, under \nour laws, it is the Senate that is supposed to ensure that complex \nbills have a thorough debate. The people are entitled to that. Yet, \nthis tax bill will not get the debate that it so richly deserves. In \nall likelihood, it will be passed before midnight of this black day.\n  Under the Congressional Budget Act, reconciliation bills are limited \nto 20 hours of debate. The 20 hours can be reduced by a nondebatable \nmotion. We have a $5.6 trillion gross debt, $20,062 for every man, \nwoman, boy, and girl in this country; to put it another way, it \nrepresents $929 for every man, woman, boy, and girl in the world; $929 \nfor every man, woman, boy, and girl in the world! The budget resolution \nand this $1.35 trillion tax bill will result in an increase in that \ngross debt to $6.7 trillion in 2011, or over $22,000 per person in this \ncountry.\n  Was that budget resolution a disciplined plan for tax policy? No. It \nsquandered potential surpluses on a $1.35 trillion tax cut that is \nconveniently drafted to have exploding costs in the outyears.\n  I probably will not be here. Many of us will not be here when that \ntime comes in the outyears. Some Senators will be defeated--mark my \nword--because of the votes they will cast on this bill.\n  Over 61 percent of the revenue losses contained in the tax cut bill \nwill come in the second 5 years of the 10-year plan. Tax reductions \ngrow from $10 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $186 billion in fiscal \nyear 2011. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that in \nthe second 10 years--get this--in the second 10 years, from 2012 to \n2021, the key years when Social Security will be in jeopardy--hear me \nnow, you elderly citizens; hear me, you young people whose parents will \nbecome elderly, who may be already elderly and when you, too, will \nbecome elderly, if God blesses you to live long enough--the key years \nwhen Social Security and Medicare will be in jeopardy, the revenue \nlosses will total $4.1 trillion.\n  How long does it take to count a trillion dollars at the rate of $1 \nper second? Thirty-two thousand years!\n  This is a bear trap. This bill could just get 10 hours of debate. If \nthe majority wishes to yield back its time, the minority will have 10 \nhours. It is that plain and simple. So why do we have a reconciliation \nbill process that limits debate? What was the common good that \nwarranted our sacrificing our tradition of full debate in this Senate?\n  I helped to craft the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. I can assure \nSenators that the authors of that act did not intend the reconciliation \nprocess to be used for a large tax cut. That was called the Budget \nReform Act of 1974. Well, if it was called, as it was, the Budget \nReform Act, surely it did not intend to be used to pass colossal tax \ncuts.\n  The intent in creating the House and Senate Budget Committees, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the budget and reconciliation process \nwas to assert Congress' prerogatives in the budget process. The \nConstitution vests in the Congress the power over the purse. That is a \npower for which our English forbears fought and spilled their blood at \nthe point of the sword, to wrest from tyrannical monarchies the power \nof the purse and place it in the hands of the people's elected \nrepresentatives in the House of Commons.\n\n  Yet, in the recent years before the passage of this Budget Act--I was \nhere. I was here. I didn't just read about it; I was here; Senator \nKennedy was here; a few other Senators were here--in the recent years \nbefore the passage of the Budget Act, the power of the purse was being \nusurped more and more by the executive branch. There were deferrals of \nappropriations; there were rescissions of appropriations. Made by whom? \nThe Chief Executive. And so Congress got its belly full of that and \npassed the reconciliation process. The Budget Reform Act was \nestablished.\n  The reconciliation process was established as a mechanism to make \nsure that the goals set out in the budget resolution were implemented \nthrough the spending and tax bills that followed. It allowed the \nCongress to establish enforceable reconciliation instructions on the \nauthorizing committees so that both spending and revenue targets would \nbe achieved. The reconciliation bill was intended to be a tool to \nreconcile any differences between those goals and the final bill. Most \nimportantly, reconciliation provided a tool to deal with persistent \nbudget deficits.\n  As a deficit-fighting tool, reconciliation has proved to be quite \neffective. Since 1980, reconciliation bills have been passed and signed \ninto law 14 times, resulting in trillions of dollars of savings.\n  Regrettably, in recent years the Senate Republican leadership has \nchosen to take a course that has fostered political polarization. In \n1999, a reconciliation bill was used to consider a $792 billion omnibus \ntax cut, targeted to the wealthy, that would have slowed the progress \non reducing the debt. It was vetoed. In 2000, the reconciliation \nprocess was again used for huge tax cuts and, again, the bill was \nvetoed.\n  The desire to limit the rights of Senators--and when we limit the \nrights of a Senator in the chair or the Senator from Massachusetts or \nthe Senator from Georgia or the Senator from New Jersey or the Senator \nfrom Nevada or other Senators--we limit the rights of the people they \nrepresent. Limit my rights in this body and you limit 1.8 million West \nVirginians' rights in this body.\n  In both 1999 and 2000, the appropriations process ended with large \nomnibus appropriations conference reports that were unamendable and \ncontained bills and issues that had never been before the Senate.\n  What are we doing to the Senate process? What are we doing to the \nlegislative process? What are we doing to the rules and precedents of \nthe Senate? We are ignoring them. We are making them irrelevant.\n  In the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2000, five \nappropriations bills were included, along with numerous non-\nappropriations bills such as a State Department Authorization bill, \narms control compliance legislation, and Superfund recycling rules. \nLast year, three bills were included in the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct for Fiscal Year 2001 along with Medicare and Medicaid reforms and \nnew tax legislation establishing new tax expenditures. One of those \nAppropriations bills, the Treasury/General Government Appropriations \nBill had never been taken up in this Senate.\n  Now this is no way for the Senate to take care of the Nation's \nbusiness. We should do better. All of us, majority and minority alike, \nshould seek to protect the institution of the Senate. This Senate is \ngoing to be here long after the Presiding Officer has served his tenure \nhere. The Senate will be here long after the Senator from West Virginia \nhas been forgotten. This Senate will be here, it will stand. We should \nremember that the Senate is for the people, all the people, the people \nwho are yet unborn. We hold their rights in our hand. We should not \nbend our rules to promote the partisan political goals of the moment.\n  In the 107th Congress, this Congress, we should insist on our rights \nas Senators for a full debate. Last year we took direct action to \naddress the issue of omnibus appropriations containing matters that had \nnot been before the Senate by reasserting rule XXVIII. I thank the \nmajority leader and the minority leader and Senator Stevens for joining \nwith me in reasserting, reinstituting, rule XXVIII last year.\n  This year the Senate approved my amendment to the budget resolution \nto extend debate on the reconciliation bill to 50 hours and to limit \nthe so-called vote-aramas by ensuring that amendments were printed in \nthe Congressional Record for all Senators to see. Sadly, my amendment \nwas dropped during the closed-door conference between the two Houses. \nSenators should have an opportunity at length to debate and to amend \nthe tax cut legislation.\n  Why is the Republican leadership insisting on using the \nreconciliation process for tax cut legislation? What are they afraid \nof? The Republican leadership did not hide behind a reconciliation bill \nfor President Reagan's tax cut. Senator Howard Baker was the\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nmajority leader at that time. They didn't hide behind a reconciliation. \nThey brought it up as a freestanding bill.\n  In 1981, President Reagan sent to Congress a large tax cut proposal \nand numerous proposals to cut spending. The Congress used the \nreconciliation process, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, \nto debate the spending cuts. The tax cuts, however, were fully debated \nas a freestanding bill, the Economic Recovery Tax Act, without \ndepending on reconciliation. There were 118 amendments debated over 12 \ndays. What a difference.\n  The American people elect their representatives to come to Washington \nto debate the issues that affect their daily lives. They did not elect \nSenators to be rubberstamped. That is why I say to every Senator, every \nnew Senator: Remember one thing. You don't serve under any President. \nYou serve with the President.\n  I have served with 11 of them, counting the current one. The Senate \nis not a quivering body of humble subjects who must obey. They only \nmust obey the people who send them here. We should not short circuit \ndebate on a bill that will hit home in the pocketbook for decades to \ncome.\n  In the Federalist No. 10--there were 85 Federalist Papers, I urge \nSenators to read these Federalist Papers again. Let me read from the \nFederalist No. 10 by Madison. Listen to what he said and apply it to \ntoday's Senate:\n\n       Complaints are every where heard from our most considerate \n     and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and \n     private faith, and of public and personal liberty; that our \n     governments are too unstable; that the public good is \n     disregarded in the conflicts of the rival parties; and that \n     measures are too often decided, not according to the rule of \n     justice, and the rights of the minor party; but by the \n     superior force of an interested and over-bearing majority.\n\n  That was James Madison speaking, and it sounds as if it were written \nonly yesterday.\n  After 6 years of divided government, President Bush promised that he \nwould be a unifier. The President has said that he wants \nbipartisanship. He has said that he has faith in his plan. If those \nstatements are true there is no need to hide behind the iron wall of \nreconciliation. Webster defines reconciliation as a restoration of \nfriendship or harmony. Let us not use the reconciliation process to \ndivide and polarize this Congress. Now is the time to hear all the \nvoices and build consensus among ourselves and among our people. The \nAmerican people expect and deserve a full debate.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if this tax cut is such a good idea, why \ndon't we take the time to debate it? Why don't we debate these tax cuts \nat length, if this is such a good idea?\n  I say to you, Senators, your votes are going to have consequences. We \ndon't even know yet what the review of the military services and the \nDefense Department will cost. We don't yet know the cost. That is still \nout there to be heard from. We don't have an energy policy in this \ncountry. We haven't done anything to shore up Social Security. We have \ncrumbling schools. We have dangerous highways. We have unsafe airports. \nOur people don't have pure drinking water in many of the rural areas.\n  Now is the opportunity for us to do something about those things. \nWhat are we going to tell our old people, our senior citizens?\n  This is a red letter day for the American people. Here is the \ncalendar. I will say it is a black day. I remember Black Tuesday, \nOctober 29, 1929, which marked the beginning of the Great Depression--\nBlack Tuesday.\n  This is Black Thursday, May 17, 2001. Remember it--Black Thursday. \nThis is a Black Thursday for the American people, a day on which we \nwill have squandered the unalienable right of our elderly citizens to \nthe pursuit of happiness mentioned in our Declaration of Independence.\n  We will have squandered the unalienable right of our elderly citizens \nto the pursuit of happiness by bartering it for a mess of tax pottage.\n  Mr. President, when Aaron Burr in 1805 addressed the Senate before \nhis departure through the Senate doors of the old Chamber for the last \ntime, he uttered these prophetic words:\n\n       This House is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and \n     of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \n     refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the \n     storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.\n\n  Mr. President, we are witnessing the demise of the U.S. Senate as our \nforefathers knew it and as I knew it when I came to this body. We are \nwitnessing the demise on this day--Black Thursday--and in these times. \nBurr's prophetic words are being borne out before our very eyes. \nHistory will not be kind to us, nor will our children and grandchildren \nrise up to call us blessed.\n  Remember, my colleagues, May 17, 2001--Black Thursday!\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. Who \nyields time on the pending bill? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is, at the desk, a committee \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that it be adopted, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, it be considered original text for \nthe purpose of further amendments, and all points of order be \nconsidered preserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 650), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we will start consideration right now, \nand there will be up to 20 hours of debate and action on the bill that \nis before us under the reconciliation provisions of the Budget Act on \nwhat will be the largest tax cut that has been given to the American \npeople in the past 20 years. In this process, we are going to take a \nconsiderable and substantial sting out of the Federal tax bite. This is \nthe third-largest tax reduction in the last 50 years, to put it in some \nother perspective as well.\n  Before I get to the issues that are before us, I will say a little \nbit about the process of putting this legislation together.\n  I know we are all going to be thinking about what kind of tax bill we \nhave, how much taxes are going to be reduced, the fairness of it all, \nand the equity of it all. But I would like to have my colleagues spend \na little bit of time thinking in terms of how we got here.\n  First of all, almost 12 months ago, the President of the United \nStates gave a speech saying that one of the foundations of his campaign \nwas going to be a very substantial tax reduction because taxes have \nreached the highest point they have ever been in the peacetime history \nof the United States.\n  He campaigned on that and did not back off one iota when pundits made \nfun of it, when economists maybe took exception to it. It was very well \nthought out and intellectually honest. He pursued full steam ahead \nthrough the highs and lows of the campaign--through times when you \nmight be depressed with the campaign going against you, through times \nwhen you were on a high in the campaign, and right through that \ncampaign--through the election, through the period of time when there \nwas some sort of question as to who might be the next President because \nof what was going on in Florida and the counting of ballots, and from \nthe time he was announced the winner to the time he gave his inaugural \naddress on the day of swearing in.\n  So we are here today because we have a President who wants to make a \ndifference, a difference for the taxpayers in this country, a \ndifference for the economic advancement of our people, the creation of \njobs, and the encouragement of investment.\n  Without this Presidential leadership, we would have tax bills before \nthe Congress this year but they would not be\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nas substantial as what we now have before us. For the President of the \nUnited States, it is not substantial enough because, as we know, he \nproposed almost 20, 25 percent more than we are dealing with. Here \nagain, the President must accept the will of the people expressed \nthrough the Congress. There was a compromise, a necessary bipartisan \ncompromise on a level somewhat less than what the President proposed, \nbut the $1.35 trillion we are dealing with in this bill.\n  The bill we have before us is a product of the process: The \nPresidential election, the extremely important leadership of a \nPresident who is committed to principle and performing in office what \nhe said he would do during the campaign--and that is a rarity in \npolitics, but this President is doing it--and the legislative process \nin the Congress.\n  Compromise is always necessary in any Congress, whether it is \noverwhelmingly controlled by one party or the other party or whether it \nis evenly divided, as it is now in the Senate--absolutely evenly \ndivided, 50 Democrats/50 Republicans--or in an almost evenly divided \nHouse of Representatives with the Republicans being the clear majority.\n  Process is pretty important. I want people to think of this process \nas we debate very controversial amendments over the next 2 days. The \nSenate Finance Committee is kind of a microcosm of the entire Senate, \nand perhaps people will think of the hard work Senator Baucus and I, \nand my colleagues on the Republican side and almost half of the \nDemocrats, have put into crafting this legislation. It didn't happen in \none 10-hour meeting on Tuesday, when we considered all the amendments \nthat were in dispute, about the product Senator Baucus and I put \ntogether. It didn't happen in 10 hours. It happened over a long period, \nstarting about mid-January. I will refer to some of the substantial \nthings that happened to get us where we are today from where we were \nlast January.\n  That is not to detract from what I said about the President of the \nUnited States contributing greatly to where we are today as well, maybe \nnot in the specifics of the bill but the overall questions--are taxes \ntoo high, and should they be reduced--the President winning on the \nprocess that they should be reduced, and now going through the process \nof actually giving the American working men and women the tax relief \nthey deserve.\n  People will get tired of my saying it, but this is a bipartisan tax \nbill. My friend Senator Max Baucus, ranking Democrat on the Finance \nCommittee, worked with me to put together a package of tax cuts that \nwould receive solid support on both sides of the aisle. We knew this \nwould not be easy, getting the people's business done, unless it was a \nbipartisan product. That, again, is a reality of a 50/50 Senate.\n  This bill came together after the Senator from Montana and I heard \nfrom our respective caucus members about their priorities. You don't \nput together the biggest tax cut in two decades without considering all \npoints of view. As we start this debate now, it is not just Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley who are at the table--where maybe that was \nthe situation from time to time over the last several months--every \nSenator, all 100, is at the table as we now consider the product of the \nFinance Committee and its bipartisan cooperation. That is the nature of \nthe Senate.\n  We talked to our members about their priorities, and then we put this \nproduct together. Two days ago, our efforts yielded the results we \nhoped for when we started out 4 months. ago. This bill was approved by \nthe Senate Finance Committee by a 14-6 margin, a clear demonstration of \nsolid bipartisan support.\n\n  I hope the work that has gone into this product over the last 4 \nmonths is respected. Even though Members might not agree with it, could \nthey do better? Each time people are down here casting a vote--and they \nare going to vote yes or no--I ask my colleagues, particularly on the \nRepublican side, to think in terms not that they like everything that \nis in here but could they have done better. If they can't do better, I \nhope they will show respect for the bipartisan approach we used.\n  More importantly, I hope they will respect the transparency that has \nbeen the hallmark of the Finance Committee's work throughout the first \n4 months and the communication that has gone into this by individual \nMembers communicating with others to say, ``What do you think about tax \nlegislation,'' to get specific points of view from specific Members \nand, most importantly, the people on this committee as well as others \noutside the committee.\n  It was not easy to arrive at a final agreement. Among the Finance \nCommittee's 20 members, there were many opinions on what is important. \nIn the end, no one got everything he or she wanted, including this \nchairman. Most of us got something we can support. We got a bill that \nwill reduce taxes, will bring about tax relief for American working men \nand women in a meaningful way, in a way that taxpayers are going to \nnotice and notice soon--by this summer--and they then will see it in \nfatter wallets.\n  I am very pleased Senator Baucus and I and other members of the \nSenate Finance Committee have been able to put together this truly \nbipartisan package. It is a testament to the Finance Committee that \nwithin 1 week after the budget resolution was passed, we now are on the \nSenate floor to vote on comprehensive tax relief for everyone who pays \nincome taxes in America. I hope the Senate will express--not to me, not \nto Senator Baucus, but to other members of the committee--the \ncooperativeness and the spirit of cooperation that was evident \nthroughout that process Tuesday. I want Members to know that I am proud \nof the Finance Committee in this process as well as the substance of \nthis legislation.\n  Now I will turn to what is in the bill. The heart of the bill is \nacross-the-board tax cuts in individual income tax rates.\n  Again, a little bit about the process: Senator Baucus and I have met \nat least weekly for a long period of time since January. I met with \nindividual members of the committee in their office--not in my office, \nin their offices--throughout the month of January and February, both \nRepublicans and Democrats. I have had my staff meet with other staff on \nan ongoing basis, but very intensively, during and since the Easter \nbreak.\n  I have also had an opportunity to visit with Members outside of my \ncaucus and also Democrat Members outside of the committee as well. And \nyou always wonder when you go down this process--it takes over 3 or 4 \nmonths--whether it is time well spent. I wondered, as I would go to the \nnext meeting, whether it was really worth my time.\n  Let me say, in looking back to all the time I have put in on this, \nand I think of my background as a farmer; you put the seed in the \nground, as we are doing in Iowa, to grow the biggest corn crop that any \nState produces--because we are No. 1--and for the first period of time \nbefore it emerges above the ground, three-fourths of that growth that \nfirst month is below the ground. You don't see it unless you dig in \nthere with your fingers and inspect it.\n  And so Senator Baucus and I sowed that seed in January and that seed \nsprouted. I know now it sprouted; I didn't know then that it would \nsprout. It sprouted for those days between the middle of January and \nlast Friday at 1:30, when we finally had an agreement.\n  So I conclude that whatever time I spent on this--and I am going to \nconclude for Senator Baucus, and maybe I should not do that--and \nwhatever time he spent on that process was time well spent. Even though \nwe are going to have honest disagreements, I hope we can be cordial and \npolite in this process of debate. I will have to remind myself of that \nfrom time to time as well.\n  Now to the process. The heart of this bill, as I said, is across-the-\nboard tax cuts of individual income tax rates. This bill creates a new \n10-percent rate that will apply retroactively to the beginning of this \nyear. This new low rate will apply to income that is currently taxed at \na 15-percent rate. So people who are hit first by the 15-percent rate \nnow can already count going back to January 1 this year, that on their \nfirst dollars made they are not going to pay 15 percent; they are going \nto pay 10 percent. It will give immediate tax cuts to millions of \nAmerican taxpayers and provide an immediate stimulus to the economy.\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\n  For married persons, the upper end of the 15-percent rate bracket \nwill be expanded to include income currently taxed at the 28-percent \nrate. So for those people being taxed at 28 percent, they are going to \nsee more of their income taxed at the 15-percent rate. The current 28-\npercent rate will drop to 25 percent. The current 31-percent rate will \nfall to 28 percent. The existing 36-percent and 39.6-percent rates will \nbe lowered to 33 and 36, respectively.\n  This legislation also includes immediate death tax relief and its \neventual repeal.\n  This bill expands the child credit and earned-income credit, enhances \npension protection and incentives to save, and creates over $30 billion \nin educational incentives--full deductibility of interest on student \nloans, deductibility on college tuition, and on educational savings \naccounts. It provides marriage penalty relief and relief from the \nindividual alternative minimum tax.\n  Everyone in America will share in this tax cut. It is across-the-\nboard relief for those who pay income taxes. That means that this tax \ncut will flow to every wallet on every Main Street in America. Over 100 \nmillion individuals and families will have their tax relief; 14 million \nelderly individuals will receive tax reduction, resulting in 12 million \npaying less tax on Social Security benefits; over 40 million couples \nwill benefit from the marriage penalty relief; 3 million couples will \nno longer itemize deductions as a result of the standard deduction \nincrease; 9 million individuals and families will benefit from the \nincreased individual retirement account contribution limits from $2,000 \nto $5,000; 30 million families will benefit from the increased child \ncredit.\n\n  This is a tax bill for everyone, regardless of income level, size of \nfamily, your age, your marital status. I will give you a few examples \nof what we expect next year.\n  A married couple with two children and $15,000 in income will pay no \nincome tax because we expanded the earned-income credit and per-child \ncredit. This family will receive an additional $1,000 from the \nGovernment. A married couple with two children and a $90,000 income \nwill receive an additional tax reduction of $1,050. A couple, age 65, \nmarried and filing jointly, with a $30,000 income, will have a $600 \nreduction. A single mom with one child and a $25,000 income will \nreceive a tax cut of $400.\n  Keep in mind, these examples are for the year 2002, which is just the \nbeginning of these tax savings. The tax rate cuts, child credits, and \nother benefits will greatly increase as they are phased in over the \nnext several years.\n  I know most of us in this Senate also have personal stories about \nwhat this tax relief for working men and women will do for those same \npeople back home. I will tell you about some of the people in Iowa and \nwhat this tax cut will mean for them.\n  Maurice Colby, Vinton, IA, retired after processing waste water for \nthe Navy for 28 years. He works part time for his neighbor, a family \nfarmer, during planting season. I will bet he works there during \nharvesting season as well. He does that to earn extra money.\n  As retirees, Mr. Colby and his wife worry about expenses. Their total \ntax bite is tough, especially when heating fuel and high gasoline \nprices are considered. The Colbys usually take a driving vacation most \nsummers but not this year. Mr. Colby said this to me: ``It's time for \nrelief. It has been a long time.''\n  Ronald Harless, 76, and his wife Jean, 72, of West Des Moines, are \nretirees on a fixed income. Mr. Harless worked as a printer making \ntelephone books. Mrs. Harless was an office worker. Mr. Harless says he \nlived frugally and saved his money for retirement. Despite a series of \nheart surgeries, he has never used the Veterans' Administration's \nhealth services, even though he is a Navy veteran who landed at \nNormandy during World War II.\n  Mr. Harless says he paid taxes all of his life, has never been a \ndrain on the taxpayers and wants to keep it that way. Mr. Harless of \nWest Des Moines, IA, wants to support himself and stay out of the \ntaxpayer-funded nursing homes as long as he can. However, he says he \nand his wife are, in their words, ``barely getting along'' on their \nretirement income and, hence, would welcome the tax provisions of this \nbill to give them some needed relief.\n  Joseph McBride, Jr., of Fort Dodge, IA, works in sales and marketing \nfor a food service company. His wife is a registered nurse. They have \nfour children, ages 14, 12, 10, and 8. Mr. McBride says he would \nwelcome a tax cut because he would like to have more money in his \npocket to secure his children's future.\n  He is very interested in saving money for his children's college \ntuition and will see that increase from $500 up to $2,000. The tax cut \nwill be very beneficial.\n  He also wants to put a little extra money in the local economy. Fort \nDodge's economy is not as good as he would like, and he wants to do his \npart to help it get better.\n  Another concern is energy costs. Mr. McBride in Fort Dodge says he \nremembers the recession and gas shortages during the Presidency of Mr. \nCarter. Mr. McBride said he paid more money in taxes last year than he \never has. Mr. McBride is right; he did pay more taxes last year than he \never has. That is because the Federal Government's collection of \nindividual income taxes is now at its highest level in history.\n  As I have said many times, today's tax surplus in our Federal \nTreasury is caused by excess collections of individual taxes.\n  During the height of World War II, the tax collection from \nindividuals was 9.4 percent of gross domestic product. Today income tax \ncollection from individuals is an astounding 10.2 percent of GDP, \nnearly a full percentage point above World War II. More importantly, \nnot just a little bit above World War II, but we have seen a 50-percent \nincrease in individual tax collections in the last 6 years, from about \njust a little over 7 percent of gross national product to 10.2 percent \nnow.\n  I might have a chart during the debate, but I can show where the \nrevenues into the Treasury from the estate tax have been about level \nfor the last decade. Corporate taxes have been level for the last \ndecade. Taxes from fees and services have been about level. But we see \na great spike in the individual income taxes coming into the Federal \nTreasury in the last 6 or 7 years.\n  It is beyond belief in a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity \nthat individual tax collections exceed the level required to defend the \nentire world, which is what the United States did 56 years ago. That is \nwhy we must move decisively to give working men and women this tax \nrelief. We must not keep the money in Washington where there is a \ntendency for it to burn a hole in the pockets of Members of Congress to \na point where they have to spend it.\n  This will help in several ways. It will not build up Government \nspending to a level that is unsustainable so that if we ever go into a \nrecession, income goes down but spending does not go down, and then we \nagain have a deficit.\n  Also, since the Federal Government does not create wealth--it only \nprovides an environment for working men and women of America to create \nwealth--we move the money from Washington back to the individual \ntaxpayers of America, and there it is going to turn over many more \ntimes, because of the freedom of the marketplace, than it will if it is \nleft in the Federal Treasury. There is a political decision of what \nought to be done with it. There is a lot of efficiency with a political \ndecision, but it does not have the potential for economic growth that \nit will have if my constituents in Iowa spend it and/or invest it.\n  Too often Members of Congress think this is not the people's money; \nthis is the Government's money. It is the taxpayers' money, and \nWashington has simply collected too much of it, particularly too much \nfrom the income tax. There has been a 50-percent increase of gross \nnational product over the last 6 years. So we are going to return this \nmoney. It is even wrong for me to say that because there is some \nimplication that it is my money. We are going to let the American \npeople keep more of the money they earn by passing this tax bill.\n\n  Over the next few days, we are going to hear a lot of talk about \npopulation demographics and about how this tax relief for American men \nand women is going to compromise our national priorities.\n  Let me set the record straight at the very beginning. This tax relief \nfor American working men and women in no way endangers our national \npriorities. The President has said that. I\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nhave said it. It is a fact. A majority of the Congress said that when \nthey adopted our budget last week. We are here because a majority of \nthe Congress, and a bipartisan majority of the Congress, said we ought \nto put more money in the pockets of working men and women than into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  The budget resolution did that. It did it through a blueprint for how \nthe Government will fund its priorities. That blueprint provides record \nlevels of funding for education, prescription drugs, and defense. I \nwant to make very clear that we pay down every dollar that is possible \nto pay down on the national debt over the 10 years of this budget \nresolution.\n  That blueprint also says we have more than enough surplus to enact \nthe tax relief for working men and women that is before us in this bill \ntoday. In fact, the bill before us refunds only 24 cents of each dollar \nof projected surplus.\n  How many people who are listening now or who will read this in the \npaper are going to say: How come you can't do better than that? The \nonly answer I can give them is, it is part of the process of compromise \nby which we work in a bipartisan way to do the people's business.\n  Twenty-four cents out of each dollar is hardly what I would call a \nrisky tax measure. We are going to hear this from a lot of our \ncolleagues: Risky, risky. We are going to hear people say that the \nprojections in the budget for the next 10 years are so uncertain that \nwe should not be giving a tax cut. This caution by my colleagues is \nperfectly legitimate. We ought to always be cautious on almost every \npublic policy decision we make. But check with those same Members to \nsee that when they want to spend more money, do they worry about \nwhether the budget projections are accurate for the next 10 years? No, \nit is only when we want to let the American people keep their hard-\nearned money that this issue arises.\n  For those who want to use the word ``risky,'' those who want to say \nthe projections could change and want us to be cautious, the only thing \nI ask--it is perfectly legitimate for them to say that, but as they are \ntalking about a new spending program that is going to spend out over \nthe next 10 years, I encourage that same caution before people vote on \nthat issue.\n  This is a responsible tax cut. We are at the highest level of \nindividual taxation in history. It is a time to end that.\n  Let's also get another thing straight. This bill in no way touches \nthe Social Security or Medicare trust fund. This is a bipartisan tax \nbill that represents the best thinking from both sides of the aisle. It \nis a victory for the process of the Senate. The problem we now face is \nthat some people around here preach bipartisanship but then turn around \nand attack the bipartisan compromise reflected in this bill. They will \nwork to obstruct this bill's enactment, and they will demean the great \nefforts and political risks that Republicans and Democrats alike take \nto reach this bipartisan agreement.\n  I imagine we are going to see plenty of this sort of thing on the \nSenate floor over the next few days. I don't think it will work because \ntoday we are about doing the President's business. This bill only \ncontains tax relief for individuals. It is not larded with favors for \nspecial interests. You cannot draft bipartisan legislation such as that \nvery easily. I think there is some purity of cause and purity, \nconsequently, of content.\n  This bill before the Senate is a historic opportunity to prove we can \njoin together, on a bipartisan basis, as common Senators, with a common \npurpose, to relieve a heavy burden from the people who sent us here. \nThe Finance Committee has shown this can be done. Our committee has \ndone what the Constitution and the rules of the Senate require. We have \nled the way. I am very proud of our Members and their efforts.\n  I urge all Senators to be vigilant in our deliberations, circumspect \nin rhetoric. The relief ordered by this bill is too needed by too many \nto be demagogued by the few. America is watching. America is waiting. \nWhat America is going to see over the next 3 or 4 days in this Senate \nis a product of a process that started about the second or third week \nof January when the Senator from Montana, then for a short period of \ntime chairman of this committee, as the Democrats controlled this body \nfor 17 days back then, said: I would like to meet with you and talk \nwith you about the functioning of the committee.\n  That was an hour and a half discussion. But some important few words \nwere said by Senator Baucus on that day, which were that we could have \na bipartisan tax bill if we worked at it. I thank Senator Baucus for \nthat suggestion. I thank Senator Baucus for spending so many hours with \nme since then to make it happen. Most importantly, I thank him for his \nhandshake at 1:30 last Friday when we had an agreement.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Montana has graciously agreed to let me \nmake a short statement, and I ask for recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the clerks at \nthe desk, with legislative counsel's assistance if needed, be \nauthorized to correct the drafting of any Members' amendment that may \nbe affected by changes in the committee amendment which the Senate just \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to enthusiastically support the \ncommittee bill. This has not been an easy bill to write. These have \nbeen tough negotiations, a lot of give and take, as almost always is \nthe case in any matter of significant consequence. The same is \ncertainly true now.\n  I might say the Senator from Iowa and I, along with other members of \nthe committee, had many meetings. We took a lot of time to get \ncomfortable with the various provisions of the bill, just to understand \nwhat they are. There was a lot of to and fro, but I might say it was \nall done in good faith.\n  This is not easy. When there are so many moving parts and it is so \ncomplicated, by definition, people have to act professionally in order \nto get something accomplished and that is what happened. I have the \nhighest respect for the chairman of the committee, who has done a \nyeoman's job, as well as the other members of the committee who worked \nhard to make this a workable bill.\n  As we all know, when all is said and done, we must have a balanced \ncompromise. We have to reach some agreement because we all cannot have \nour way in the constitutional way we as a country organize ourselves. \nWe have to have some organization. That is basically majority rule.\n  Let me explain why I think this is a good bill. In the first place, I \nbelieve this is a significant improvement, from my perspective, over \nthe bills that were proposed by the President and passed by the \nCongress. Most significantly, the committee bill provides a much better \ndistribution of tax cuts. That is a matter that I think is lost upon a \nlot of people. The committee mark has a better, more progressive \ndistribution of the tax cut than either the bill suggested by the \nPresident or by the House. In fact, this might raise some eyebrows. \nAccording to the Joint Tax Committee analysis, the committee we all \nlook to as the best independent analysis, the bill before us today will \nmake the tax system more progressive than under current law--not only \ncompared with the President's proposal, not only compared with the bill \nthat passed the House, all the various bills that passed the House, but \nalso compared to current law; that is, this bill is more fair in the \ndistribution of tax cuts to payers of income taxes than current law.\n  That is not to say this bill is better than the President's. I would \nnot ask Senators to vote for a bill just because it is better than it \ncould have been. Instead, I believe the standard we should apply on a \ntax bill is whether on its merits, taking everything into \nconsideration, the bill makes positive changes that improve our tax \nsystem and are better for most Americans. By that standard, I suggest \nthis bill passes with flying colors.\n  Let me explain why. First, we create a new 10-percent bracket. This \nis the\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\nsingle biggest piece of the bill--$438 billion over 10 years, by far \nthe single largest component. There is a new 10-percent tax bracket \nwhich has the effect of benefitting every single American who pays \nincome taxes. Most of the benefit goes to low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers. In fact, about 75 percent of the benefit goes to people who \nearn less than $75,000 a year. Let me repeat that statement. Seventy-\nfive percent of the benefit under the 10-percent bracket, the new \nbracket, goes to people who earn less than $75,000 a year.\n  One other thing. Unlike most of the other tax cuts in the bill, this \none takes effect immediately--better yet, retroactively to the first of \nthe year. This will not only help average taxpayers but it also \nprovides an economic stimulus because it puts more money in the hands \nof consumers.\n\n  We also expand the tax credit for families with children from $500 to \n$1,000 per child. And we do more. We increase the amount of the credit \nthat is partly refundable so lower income families can benefit from the \ncredit as well. We do this along the lines suggested by Senators Snowe, \nLincoln, Kerry, Jeffords, and Breaux. It is a very important new \ncontribution that they have authored. It is a good idea of theirs. I \ncommend particularly Senator Snowe, who is the lead sponsor of the \ngroup to get more refundability under the child tax credit.\n  This is a big improvement over the current law. Why? Because it means \nwe will increase the tax credit for 16 million more children, I might \nsay, compared with the President's bill; that is, this bill provides a \nbenefit to 16 million more American children than the proposal of the \nPresident and the House.\n  But that is not all we do for lower income working families. We make \nimportant reforms that expand and simplify the earned-income tax credit \nso it is available to many more low-income working families than it is \ntoday. In fact, the bill contains the most significant expansion of the \nEITC, earned-income tax credit, in many years. We also simplify the \nEITC--make it much easier for eligible families to qualify. These are \nhuge simplification provisions.\n  And there is more. We create new incentives for education. For \nexample, we help parents set money aside for their children's future \neducation. We encourage employers to help their employees attend \nclasses and earn degrees, and we help college students pay off their \nstudent loans--a big improvement.\n  Because of the leadership of Senator Torricelli and Senator Schumer, \nwe create a new provision in the Tax Code that allows a deduction for \ncollege tuition payments. Many American families have a hard time \nmeeting their children's higher education expenses. This provision is \nof significant help. It is not a total solution, but it goes a long way \ntoward helping families provide for their children's higher education. \nAll in all, I think it is an education tax incentive package of which \nwe can all be proud.\n  There is more. We include a pension tax incentive package that has \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. We all know the problem. Our \npersonal savings rate is at rock bottom, having gone from 11 percent of \nGDP 30 years ago to zero or even negative savings today, meaning, among \nother things, that people are not putting enough money away for their \nretirement, thereby increasing the potential burden on Social Security.\n  The pension provisions of the bill will help address this problem, \ntaking another step forward to addressing the baby boomer problem that \nwe know is coming in about 10 years.\n  We make it easier for workers to take their pension plans with them \nwhen they change jobs. We strengthen pension security and enforcement. \nWe enhance pension fairness for women. We increase the contribution \nlimits for IRAs and 401(k)s so people can put more money into them.\n  On top of that, we create two new incentives that will dramatically \nexpand pension coverage for lower income workers. One helps small \nbusinesses establish pensions for their employees. It is very hard \ntoday for small businesses to set up pension plans for their employees, \nmuch more difficult than it is for big business. In this bill, we help \nthem do that.\n  The other incentive is a new matching plan to help employees save \ntheir own money for retirement--again, an incentive to help employers \nmatch their contribution.\n  We reduce the marriage penalty. We address the estate tax. These are \nnot Republican priorities; they are not Democratic priorities. They are \nbipartisan priorities, important to virtually every single Member of \nthe Senate.\n  Those are the main provisions of the bill. Putting them all together, \nI believe the bill represents a very significant improvement over \ncurrent law. That is the standard I think we should use. Is it perfect? \nNo. Of course, it is not. Is it the bill that I would write, that any \nSenator would write? Of course not.\n  That is not really the question. That is not the basic point. Rather, \ntaken as a whole, does this bill represent a significant improvement \nover current law? I think it clearly does.\n  At this point, I will address some of the key arguments that have \nbeen made against the bill. First, the process.\n  Some will say that we should not be railroading this bill through the \nSenate on a reconciliation fast track which limits debate and \namendment. I agree. To my mind, it is unnecessary, it is inappropriate, \nto use reconciliation instructions for a tax cut.\n  I very much agree with the statements made earlier today by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I believe he is right. He \nargued for a process that is much more open, that is more expansive, so \nthat tax bills have a lot more time in this Chamber, and many more \nopportunities for amendment.\n  I remind my colleagues, President Reagan's tax cut in 1981 was not \nunder reconciliation, it was not under this constrained process; \nrather, it was outside reconciliation. The bill was considered here for \n2 weeks. There were hundreds of amendments. That is democracy.\n  I might say--it is a bit of a stretch here, but I think it is an \nimportant point--Thomas Jefferson once said: A country is only as \nstrong as that bond and that nexus between the people and the people's \nrepresentatives. Representatives cannot do it alone. People cannot do \nit alone. But it is that bond between the people and the people's \nrepresentatives which, by and large, determines the strength of a \ncountry.\n  If we rush a tax bill through too quickly--one of the most important \nbills that is going to be before this body perhaps in several years--\nclearly, we need that process, that bond to work. And for it to work, \nwe have to have the opportunity to offer many amendments, to debate \nthem very thoroughly, to get the people engaged in what we are doing.\n  By rushing this through, people do not know what is in this bill. \nThere are problems as a consequence of that, but the deeper problem is \npeople become disconnected from the process, and they care less about \nwhat we are doing because they do not know what we are doing, and they \ndo not know how we got to where we are. They are going to start to \nbecome more cynical, less engaged. That is not good.\n  And just as we all know in running for office, you cannot satisfy--I \nthink as President Lincoln said--all the people all the time, but we do \nthe very best we can. We want to fully engage people so they are more \ninvolved in getting a better product, but also because in engaging \npeople, they understand the reasons for what we are doing much more \nclearly.\n  That is fundamentally why I think this tax bill should not be in \nreconciliation but, rather, should be in an expanded process. That is \nwhy I voted and spoke against, I might add, the amendment of the good \nSenator from New Mexico some while ago to add reconciliation \ninstructions to the budget resolution. It is really not good \nGovernment.\n  Despite our best efforts, I must say, though, that dye has been cast. \nThat decision has been made. So we have to work within the process that \nthe Senate has chosen to employ. We have to work with what is given to \nus. We have to play the hand that is dealt. And that hand, \nunfortunately, means reconciliation for the tax bill.\n  In any event, I might say, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, has provided, I think, the best process possible \nunder these\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\ncircumstances. He has been totally open. He has been totally \nbipartisan. He has been equally fair. In light of the fact that I \noppose the process, it should not compel us to oppose the bill.\n\n  Let me turn to the substantive criticism of the bill. One criticism \nis the tax cuts are back-loaded. The bill does, in fact, cut taxes more \nin later years than in earlier years. That is true. In large part, this \nis because of the constraints of the budget resolution. But there are \nseveral points to keep in mind.\n  First, the bill is significantly less back-loaded than the \nPresident's plan. I do not have the chart here. I think I will ask to \nhave that chart put up. But the point is, the bill is significantly \nless back-loaded than the President's plan. That means these tax cuts \ncome earlier, and the bill costs 36 percent less in the last year, in \n2011, than in the President's plan.\n  That is significant. Yes, there is still some back-loading. Yes, \nback-loading is a problem we should address. But the point is, we \ncannot let perfection be the enemy of the good. This is better than the \nPresident's proposal.\n  As the chart shows--this is in the last year of the bill we are now \nconsidering, the last year being 2011--the administration's bill, which \nis similar to the House-passed bills, would cut taxes close to $300 \nbillion in that last year. The bill before the Senate, which is shown \nin the blue on the right, indicates it is about half, a little more \nthan half, about $186 billion, cut in the last year. So it is an \nexample of less back-loading than the President's.\n  I will show you another chart as well. This chart shows over the 10-\nyear period of the bill--it is hard to see; I apologize; I am not the \nbest color-contrast guy in the world in putting this chart together--\nthe red line going up is the administration's proposal, which shows \nthat each year the tax cuts in the President's bill are greater. That \nis the red line that slopes upwards.\n  It is hard to see, but the blue line that is underneath it shows, \nparticularly beginning in the year 2004, the cuts in later years are \nmuch less.\n  You will also notice that the blue line, though it is not really \nhorizontal, is much more horizontal than the red line, again, showing \nthat although there is some back-loading, there is much less back-\nloading in this bill.\n  In addition, the most significant back-loading problem comes from \nrepealing the estate tax in the year 2011. For that, and other reasons, \nI hope we can replace repeal of the estate tax with reform of estate \ntax.\n  Third--and this is in explaining why there is this back-loading \nproblem--under the Byrd rule, provisions that lose revenue during the \nsecond 10 years must be sunset; that is, they must be terminated.\n  So if we do that--and this bill does do that--we can assure that the \nchanges that are scheduled to be made in later years can be \nreexamined--and must be reexamined--down the road, in light of future \nbudgets and future priorities.\n  Another argument that has been made against the bill is that it is \nunfair. Critics say that too much of the tax cut goes to people at the \nupper end of the income scale.\n  I might say, both sides bring passion to this argument. Critics of \nthe bill rail against cutting taxes for millionaires. On the other \nhand, there are those for whom the top rate of 33 percent, down from \n39.6, is a holy grail.\n  Let's step back for a minute and just look at the facts.\n  First, our Nation does have a progressive Federal income tax system. \nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the top 10 percent of \ntaxpayers today pay about 70 percent of all Federal income taxes. The \ntop 1 percent pay about 36 percent of all Federal income taxes. Our tax \nsystem is, therefore, very progressive today. In fact, essentially in \neach of the years since 1993 up through today it has consistently been \nmore and more progressive.\n  Given this progressive system, a tax cut that applies across all \nincome classes is, by definition, going to result in a larger tax cut \nfor upper income Americans because they pay more taxes. That is just \nsimple mathematics. That, in part, is what happens under this bill. We \ncut taxes across all income groups, so everyone who pays income tax \ntoday benefits, and those who pay a large amount of income taxes do, in \nfact, receive a larger benefit--larger, I might add, than I would \nprefer.\n  But remember, the bill does more than just cut income taxes. On that \ndistribution point, let's take taxpayers with incomes of $25,000 or \nless, taxpayers with incomes of $50,000 or less, taxpayers with incomes \nof $75,000 or less, and taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or less. In \neach of those categories, the percentage of tax reductions under the \ncommittee bill is much greater than under the administration's bill. \nAnd they vary; on average it is about 12 to 10 percent greater. \nContrast that with taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000, and \ntaxpayers over $200,000. In both of those categories, the proportion of \nbenefits under the committee bill is less for those taxpayers than \nunder the President's plan.\n  Again, to make the basic point: This bill is more progressive because \nit shifts tax cuts in a greater proportion to those Americans with \nincomes under $100,000. What it does is slightly decrease the \nproportion of tax cuts for higher income Americans compared with the \nPresident's and/or the House bill. This bill makes the tax system more \nprogressive.\n  We have also tried to cut taxes for people whose primary tax burden \nis not income taxes but payroll taxes. After all, about 80 percent of \nAmericans pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Our bill doesn't \nleave these people out; it brings them in.\n  These are the provisions that accomplish this: We expand and simplify \nthe earned-income credit which may be the best program ever created to \nhelp low-income working families. We double the child credit and make \nit partly refundable, covering 16 million more children. We create new \nincentives to help low-income savers save for retirement.\n  I have mentioned a lot of the provisions. So what is the practical \neffect? Take a married couple with two children earning $15,000. Under \nthe President's proposal, they wouldn't get any tax cut at all. Once \nour bill is fully in effect, they will get a tax cut of $1,152, very \nsignificant for lower income Americans with kids.\n  Putting it all together, I believe the bill we are considering today \nis one of the best bills ever written for lower and middle income \nfamilies. I will say it again: This bill is one of the best ever \nwritten for lower and middle income families. So when we talk about \nfairness, let's keep our eye on the ball.\n  Does this bill give wealthy people a tax cut? Yes, it does. But that \nis not the only question we should ask. There are other questions that \nmight be more important. For example, does the bill help those who are \nstruggling to feed their families and to pay their bills? Yes, it does. \nDoes it help the single mom, the construction worker, the two-earner \ncouple trying to put money away for their children's education? Yes, it \ndoes, and it helps them a lot.\n  So with respect, I suggest to those who say the bill is unfair, just \nstep back a bit, take a look at the whole picture. If they do, I am \nconfident that many, not all, will conclude that the bill deserves \ntheir strong support.\n  As I said at the beginning, this is not a perfect bill, but it is \nbalanced. It is bipartisan. It is good for taxpayers. It is good for \nworking families. It is good for the economy, and it is good for the \ncountry.\n  I urge Senators to support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for the way they have conducted the business of the Finance \nCommittee. It has been, within the Finance Committee, a fair process. I \npublicly commend them for it. The chairman and the ranking member have \nboth reached out to Members. They have visited us. They have asked us \nfor our opinions. We didn't necessarily agree, but they certainly \nlistened.\n  The markup itself was a model of fairness. I salute the chairman for \nthe way he conducted the markup. I was saying to my wife I don't \nremember a more fair markup in terms of the way it was handled. I thank \nthe chairman for that as well.\n  With that said, I strongly disagree with this proposal. It is a \nprofound\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nmistake for the country. It is a profound mistake because it is part of \na larger budget package that threatens our economic security.\n  This tax cut is part of a budget proposal that has concealed more \nthan it has revealed. This is part of a budget proposal that is not the \nreal budget. As a result, it misleads Members and it misleads the \nAmerican people. Ultimately, it leads us into a fiscal trap that will \nbe a trap for all of us.\n  When I say this budget--of which this tax cut is one part--conceals \nmore than it reveals, I mean by that, whole chunks of Federal spending \nthat we all know are going to occur have been left out. The President \nis about to propose a major defense buildup. It is not in this budget. \nThe President has said education is the No. 1 priority, but there is no \nnew money for education in the budget. The President has said we must \nstrengthen Social Security for the future, but there is no money in \nthis budget for that purpose.\n\n  The reason those things have been left out is quite clear: If they \nwere included, what one finds is that the budget, with this size tax \ncut, would not add up. What one finds is that when you put in the \nfunding for education, if we really believe that is the top priority \nand we fund it as we have voted if we follow the President's proposal \nfor a major defense buildup and put that money in the budget, if we \nfollow the President's suggestion to strengthen Social Security and put \nthat money in the budget, and we put it all in one place where people \ncan see whether it adds up or it does not, what one sees is that it \nsimply does not.\n  The result is a massive raid on the Medicare trust fund and the \nSocial Security trust fund, and that will create serious problems for \nthis country going forward.\n  The New York Times said it well in an editorial on May 12. They \ncommended the chairman and ranking member for improvements they have \nmade in the bill over what the President proposed, but their conclusion \nwas:\n\n       But over all it amounts to another gross abdication of \n     fiscal responsibility.\n\n  I believe that is true. This bill, in the larger budget context, is a \ngross abdication of fiscal responsibility.\n  Part of the problem is that all of this is based on a forecast that \neven the forecasters warn us is uncertain. Those who did the forecast, \nthe Congressional Budget Office, have said to us: You have to \nunderstand, this is a 10-year projection. Looking back at our previous \nforecasts, we can tell you there is enormous variance. In fact, over \nthe last 10 years they have been off by an average of 100 percent a \nyear. That is how far off they have been in their previous forecasts.\n  Some people want to believe this projection is cast in concrete. It \nis not. It is built on quicksand. That threatens the economic security \nof our country.\n  Those who made the forecast prepared this chart. It shows in the \nfifth year we could have anywhere from a $50-billion deficit to more \nthan a trillion-dollar surplus. That is the variance they project, \nlooking back at their previous forecasts and seeing how far off they \nwere. Then they projected those variances to this projection. They \nwarned us in an entire chapter of their forecast how uncertain any 10-\nyear projection is. That is the backdrop for what we do here over the \nnext several days.\n  To me, it counsels caution. It counsels caution on spending, on tax \ncuts. Let's not bet the farm that any 10-year forecast is going to come \ntrue. No company would do it; no private concern would do it; no \nAmerican family would do it; but we are about to do it here in the \nCongress.\n  The second critical fact people need to know: The Senator from Iowa \nsaid we are paying down all the debt there is to pay down. That is just \none part of debt. He is talking about the publicly held debt. The \npublicly held debt, as we meet here today, is $3.4 trillion. \nUnfortunately, that is not the total debt of our country because in \naddition to that publicly held debt--that is debt held by the public--\nwe also have debt that the general fund of the United States owes to \nthe trust funds of the United States. That debt is every bit as much \ndebt as the debt held by the public. That has the same legal claim on \nthe assets of our country as the publicly held debt.\n\n  What has been missing from this debate is that the debt held in \nGovernment accounts, the debt owed by the general fund of the United \nStates to the trust funds, is going to increase. It is going to \nincrease from about $2 trillion in 2000 to nearly $6 trillion during \nthis same period. In fact, when one puts the two together--the publicly \nheld debt and the debt to the trust funds of the United States--what \none learns is the overall debt, the gross debt of our country, is not \ngoing down; it is going up. The gross debt of our country is going from \n$5.6 trillion today--that is a combination of the publicly held debt \nand the debt owed to the trust funds of our country, which is $5.6 \ntrillion today--to $6.7 trillion at the end of this 10-year period of \nthis tax cut. That is the hard reality. The debt of our country is not \ngoing down; the debt of our country is going up.\n  When they described this as fiscally irresponsible, the New York \nTimes made the case that this tax bill is badly backloaded. That means \nthe true cost is hidden in the first 10 years. The cost explodes in the \nsecond 10 years because many of the provisions don't take effect until \nlate in the decade, so their full cost is masked. The cost in the first \n10 years is $1.35 trillion, as advertised. But that is the tip of the \niceberg because the cost in the second 10 years goes up to nearly $4 \ntrillion, right at the time the baby boomers are retiring, at the time \nthe number of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare will \ndouble. This ticking timebomb is put right in the middle of that \ndemographic timebomb.\n  As the Comptroller General has warned us, we are headed for a \ncircumstance we have never seen in our Nation's history, a circumstance \nin which the number of people eligible for Medicare and Social Security \nwill double, and double in very short order. That changes the budget \ncircumstance of our country very dramatically: In this decade, we enjoy \nsubstantial surpluses; in the next decade, we face massive deficits.\n  What I proposed, what colleagues on this side of the aisle favored, \nwas to take a substantial part of these surpluses now, reduce the size \nof the tax cut, cut it about in half, and use that money to prepare for \nwhat is to come, to reduce this long-term debt. That would be a wiser \ncourse, a more fiscally responsible course, a more conservative course.\n  The back loading is in page after page of the tax bill before us. The \nmarriage penalty and standard deduction provisions don't take effect \nuntil 2006 to 2011. The marriage penalty, 15-percent bracket, doesn't \ntake effect--I am told that may have been changed overnight. There are \nso many changes, and that is one reason some of us thought we ought to \nat least wait a couple of days to know what we are amending. I am a \nmember of the Finance Committee, and I just learned this morning that \napparently this is being moved up a year. It doesn't take away the \npoint that it is backloaded.\n  The indexation of the 10-percent bracket doesn't take effect until \n2007. The final rate cut in the upper brackets takes effect in 2007. \nThe pushback on the Pease limit on itemized deductions doesn't take \neffect until 2009. Repealing the phaseout of personal exemptions takes \neffect in 2009. The full phase-in of IRA contribution limits doesn't \ntake effect until 2011. The full phase-in of the child credit doesn't \ntake effect until 2011. The repeal of the estate tax doesn't take \neffect until 2011. This is totally backloaded. That means the total \ncost is hidden from view in this 10-year period.\n\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer looked at this plan and wrote this \neditorial entitled ``Tax Slashers At Work. Once started, they can't \nseem to stop.'' They made this observation about the Finance Committee:\n\n       Like 20 frat brothers trying to cram themselves into a \n     Volkswagen, U.S. Senators are overstuffing their tax bill.\n\n  They pointed out:\n\n       Remember the outrage over the marriage penalty that affects \n     many two-income couples? The Senate bill would only start to \n     address this problem five years from now. By that time, the \n     Bush Presidency--and a lot of marriages--may be over.\n\n  Mr. President, I am told this may have been moved up and it may not \ntake effect for 4 years instead of 5. I have not seen the details. It \ndoesn't take away from the point that it is backloaded. The \nPhiladelphia Inquirer said:\n\n       With other tax breaks, the bill does the opposite trick: \n     providing tax relief right away,\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\n     then supposedly ending it a few years down the road. A tax \n     break for college tuition is slated to die after 2005. Relief \n     for some of those hit by the alternative minimum tax would \n     end after 2006.\n\n  Their commentary was:\n\n       Sure, Congress is really going to let a popular tax break \n     for the upper middle class die in an election.\n\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer says:\n\n       That is dishonest and cynical.\n\n  They go on to point out:\n\n       Another slow phase-in is the repeal of the estate tax over \n     10 years. If Congress weren't so intent on being generous to \n     billionaires, it could afford to get more relief sooner to \n     the parties sometimes genuinely injured by the inheritance \n     tax: family farms and small businesses.\n\n  Unfortunately, much of what the Philadelphia Inquirer says is exactly \nright. Here is the marriage penalty relief delayed under the bill that \ncame out of the committee until 2006. No relief for those married \ncouples who suffer the penalty of the Tax Code that is imposed on some \nwho are married. There was no relief--nothing--for the first 5 years. \nThen it is phased in. That is the kind of back loading the Philadelphia \nInquirer was talking about.\n  Then they talked about sunsetting some provisions. Alternative \nminimum tax relief is one of them. The alternative minimum tax is \nsomething that will affect a dramatically increased number of taxpayers \nunder this proposal. Currently in this country, only 1 and a half \nmillion taxpayers are affected by the alternative minimum tax. But \nunder this bill, by the end of the period, nearly 40 million people \nwill be caught up in the alternative minimum tax.\n  Boy, are they in for a surprise. They thought they were getting a tax \ncut. Nearly one in every four taxpayers in America is going to be \ncaught up in the alternative minimum tax--a complex calculation \ndesigned to keep the super-rich from getting by without paying any \ntaxes, because they used excess depreciation, excess deductions, excess \nexclusions. They were getting, in cumulative total, unfair benefits. \nThat only applies to 1.5 million people today.\n\n  Under the tax bill that is before us, that is going to mushroom to \nnearly 40 million people. Does anybody really believe we are going to \nallow this to happen? I do not. It should not happen. It does happen \nunder this bill, and it is another reason I believe it is misleading.\n  What does this bill do in terms of addressing that issue? It offers \nsome help initially, but then it ends it later in this decade. It is \ngoing to stop providing that additional assistance for the alternative \nminimum tax right at the time the number of people affected by it \nexplodes.\n  This does not pass any kind of test. It does not pass a credibility \ntest. It does not pass a fiscal responsibility test. It does not pass a \nfairness test. It does not pass any kind of test. But that is what is \nright in the guts of this bill before us.\n  It does not stop there because with the estate tax, it is the same \nthing. They hide the true cost because they put off its elimination \nuntil the 10th year. That is when they eliminate the estate tax, and \nthen the cost explodes, but they do not capture that explosion because \nthey do not put it in this bill. That is why the New York Times says \nthis is fiscally irresponsible. And they are right. It does not pass \nthe fiscal responsibility test.\n  That is what happens to the estate tax. Under the bill from 2002 to \n2011, it costs $145 billion. But what happens in the second decade that \nis right beyond what is captured in this bill? The cost explodes to \n$790 billion, right at the time the baby boomers start to retire, right \nat the time the Federal Government has new responsibilities and \nobligations that are going to be very costly to meet. And we are going \nto give a $790 billion cut to the wealthiest 2 percent? Is that fair? \nWe are going to shift that obligation on to all the American people and \noff the wealthiest 2 percent? It does not strike me as very fair.\n  That is not the only thing that is unfair about this bill. This bill \nsays to the bottom 20 percent of the American people: You get 1 percent \nof the benefits. Those who have the lowest income in this country, the \nlowest 20 percent, we say to you: You get 1 percent of the benefits. \nThe top 20 percent, the wealthiest 20 percent, we say: You get 70 \npercent of the benefits. That does not strike me as fair.\n  I know our Republican friends will say the wealthy people pay more in \ntaxes. They do. That is certainly true. But this bill gives 33 percent \nof the benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent, the wealthiest 1 percent \nwho, on average, in this country earn $1.1 million a year. I am glad \nthey do. I hope very much that every American has the chance at some \npoint in their life to receive $1.1 million a year in income. That is \nterrific.\n  That is one of the great things about the American dream. You can \nstart with nothing in this country and you can become a person of means \nand do great things. You can help people through your own private \nresources. You can help your family. I am all for that.\n  When it comes to the people's money--we have heard a lot about this, \nthe people's money, let's give it back to the people. To which people \nare we giving it back? We are giving 70 percent to the wealthiest 20 \npercent. We are giving 33 percent to the wealthiest 1 percent. Is that \nreally fair? I do not think so. I can tell you, the wealthiest 1 \npercent do not pay 33 percent of the taxes; they pay about 20 percent \nof the taxes.\n\n  Our friends on the other side want to talk about only income taxes, \nbut people do not pay just income taxes. They also pay payroll taxes. \nAnd the truth is, the fact is, 80 percent of the people in this country \npay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Yet this is \njust an income tax cut, and it is heavily weighted to the wealthiest \namong us, and it is not fair.\n  There has been a lot of talk that it is more fair than what President \nBush proposed, and that is true; it is modestly better than what the \nPresident proposed. The President gave 72 percent of the benefits to \nthe top 20 percent. This bill gives 70 percent of the benefits to the \ntop 20 percent. I guess we can say it is better than what the President \nproposed, but the larger truth is, it is not much better, and it is \nstill not fair.\n  I do not think there is anything that shows the unfairness of this \nproposal better than what happens to rate reduction at the various tax \nbrackets.\n  In our country, we currently have a 15-percent bracket. Those are \ncouples who earn up to $45,000 in taxable income. That means they are \nearning $60,000 or $65,000 a year in gross income. Then we have a 28-\npercent bracket, a 31-percent bracket, a 33-percent bracket, and we \nhave a 39.6-percent bracket.\n  All of these brackets will be benefited by a new 10-percent rate. The \nnew 10-percent rate simply says that a couple on their first $12,000 of \nincome will be taxed at a rate of 10 percent. That is on their first \n$12,000. So everybody's first $12,000--everybody's--will be taxed at a \nrate of 10 percent instead of 15 percent, as current law provides. That \nis a benefit to every single tax bracket because everybody's first \n$12,000 will be taxed at a lower level.\n  Interestingly enough, this bill also provides rate relief to the \nvarious brackets. It gives a 3.6 percentage rate reduction to those who \nare in the 39.6-percent bracket. In other words, the biggest percentage \nreduction goes to the wealthiest group, and each of the other brackets \ngets 3 percentage points of rate relief. Those in the 33-percent \nbracket, 31-percent bracket, 28-percent bracket, they get 3 percentage \npoints of rate relief, or about 10 percent of their overall tax burden.\n  What happens to those in the 15-percent rate bracket? They get no \nrate relief. They get none. Everybody else, every other bracket gets \nrate relief, but not the people in the 15-percent bracket. Is that \nfair? I do not think so.\n  How many people are in that 15-percent rate bracket? This is where \nthe real unfairness of this bill is revealed because that is where 70 \npercent of the American taxpayers are. They get no rate relief. That is \nwhere 69 percent of the small businesses are. They get no rate relief. \nAll of the talk that we are going to give marginal rate relief because \nit is the key to encourage savings and investment, but it only applies \nto the top rates. It does not apply to the 15-percent rate because this \nbill does not give them rate relief. It does not give the 70 percent of \nthe American taxpayers rate relief. It does not give the 67 percent of \nsmall businesses rate relief. It reserves rate relief for those in the \nhighest brackets.\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\n  There is something wrong with this bill, and what is wrong is it is \nnot fair.\n  This bill has been sold repeatedly as an economic stimulus bill, one \nthat can provide some lift to our economy in this period of weakness. \nThat is an interesting theory and one I support. I believe we ought to \ngive economic stimulus in this year, and we passed it in the Senate. We \nvoted for $85 billion in tax relief in the year 2001. What is in this \nbill is not the $85 billion for which we voted. Oh, no, the stimulus in \nthis package, this $1.350 trillion tax cut, is $10 billion. There is \nalmost no stimulus out of this big package for this year.\n\n  For those who told people we are going to stimulate the economy by \ngiving people money back in their pocket this year, this bill doesn't \ndo it. We voted for $85 billion of stimulus this year in the Senate by \nan overwhelming vote. That is not what is in this bill. They cut that \nback down to $10 billion in relief this year.\n  I go back in history and look at the record. We had the same theory \nat work in the 1980s. That theory was we could have massive tax cuts, \nwe could have massive buildup in the defense spending, and it would all \nadd up. It did not add up. The result was an explosion in debt and \ndeficits. We quadrupled the national debt, saw a dramatic increase in \nbudget deficits, and under President Bush it got totally out of hand. \nWe had a budget deficit of $290 billion the last year of his \nadministration, and in 1993 we passed a package that raised income \ntaxes on the wealthiest 1 percent and cut spending.\n  That package brought us back to balance. That brought us back to \nfiscal sanity. That brought us back to getting our fiscal house in \norder. That kicked off the longest economic expansion in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  We are about to go back to this theory. We could have a massive tax \ncut, coupled with a massive buildup in defense expenditure, and somehow \nit will add up.\n  History tells a great deal. This chart shows the trends in spending \nand revenues from 1980 to the year 2000, a 20-year snapshot. The red \nline is the total outlays, the blue line is the total revenues. We can \nsee what happened the last time we had this theory at work. In 1981, a \nmassive tax cut was passed, massive increase in defense expenditure, as \nthis President is proposing. That is what happened to the expenditure \nline. It went up. Here is what happened to the revenue line with the \nmassive tax cut: It went down. The deficits that were already too large \nexploded; the national debt exploded. It was only in 1993 when we \npassed a plan to reverse these lines, to reduce outlays, to increase \nrevenues, that we were able to balance the budget and start reducing \nthe national debt, that we were able to get our fiscal house in order \nand to put our country on a course to strong economic growth--the \ngreatest, strongest, economic growth in our Nation's history.\n  And now we are going to retest the theory that was tried in 1981: a \nmassive tax cut combined with massive increase in defense expenditure.\n  I pray we don't have the same result. Back in the 1980s, we had time \nto recover. But now we don't. We had time to recover in the 1980s \nbecause the baby boom generation was still relatively young. But now \nthe baby boom generation is aging and they will retire in this next \ndecade. Then everything changes. These surpluses turn to deficits. That \nis what, to me, counsels caution, that counsels a smaller tax cut, one \nthat is more fairly distributed, one that passes the fiscal \nresponsibility test, one that passes the fairness test, one that does \nnot put America in jeopardy of exploding this debt.\n  Here is where we are on the growth of Federal debt. In 1980, we had a \ngross Federal debt of $909 billion. Today, as I said earlier, we are up \nto $5.6 trillion. Under this plan, the debt is going to continue to go \nup. It will go up to $6.7 trillion. I believe that is a mistake. At \nthis time of surplus we ought to devote more of these resources to debt \nreduction. We ought to have a tax plan that is smaller, that takes the \ndifference and puts it into strengthening our future economic position \nby reducing debt now when we have the opportunity, when we have the \nchance.\n\n  I believe the tax bill before the Senate flunks every test. It flunks \nthe fiscal responsibility test because it is badly backloaded and \nbecause the national debt will grow. It flunks the fairness test \nbecause it gives the overwhelming part of the benefit to the wealthiest \namong us. I can't justify it. I don't think it is fair.\n  We are going to vote on this, perhaps on Monday, maybe as late as \nTuesday. This is going to be a defining vote. It is an important vote. \nIt will make a real difference to the future of this country. I regret \nvery much the budget resolution passed by a slim vote in the Senate, \n53-47, that put this scenario in place. But it did pass. That is where \nwe are.\n  The great thing about our country is we are a democracy. We decide by \nvotes. The votes of the elected Representatives of the people have \ndecided this will be the course we pursue. I believe this bill is a \nprofound mistake, that it would be far wiser to reduce the size of the \ntax cut initially, by about half as much as what is proposed, maybe a \nlittle more than half, and then wait to see how events unfold.\n  This is an uncertain time. We can see it in the markets; we can see \nit in unemployment; we can see it in productivity growth not being as \nstrong as we have previously seen. All of that, to me, counsels \ncaution.\n  I hope my colleagues seriously consider opposing this plan. I think \nit is a risky plan, that it is a dangerous plan. Does that mean it \nwouldn't work out under any circumstances? No. I think we have to be \nvery direct and very clear. It may work out just fine. It may. Things \nmay turn around. Things may improve. We may have more revenue than we \nare anticipating and that this tax cut is fully justified--not the \nfairness of it, but the amount of it.\n  No one can know that. No one can know what the next 10 years hold. We \nought to be more cautious. We ought to be more conservative. We ought \nto reserve more of this forecasted surplus for debt reduction. We ought \nto reserve more of it to strengthen Social Security for the future. We \nought to prepare for the baby boom generation. Then if things work out \nas forecasted, or if they are better than forecasted, which we all hope \nwill be the case, we can have a tax cut of this size, maybe even \nbigger. But we shouldn't lock it in now based on an uncertain forecast \nat a time when the economy is shaky. And we ought not to put in place a \ntax cut that doesn't give a lift to this economy when it is weak.\n  We ought to provide stimulus now. We can afford to provide a $85 \nbillion tax cut this year and get that money into the pockets of the \nAmerican people now to strengthen the economy. That is not what this \nbill does. That is what we voted for in the Senate, but that is not \nwhat this bill does. Only $10 billion of this tax cut is effective this \nyear, the year we are in, the time when we know we have economic \nweakness.\n  I thank my colleagues for this time. I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, thank you for the fairness with which you have conducted the \ndebate. That is the strength of America. We have different points of \nview. That doesn't mean we don't respect each other. I have great \nrespect for the Senator from Iowa. I work with him frequently. I have \ngreat respect for the Senator from Montana. We work together \nfrequently. But on this question we have a principled and profound \ndifference. The great thing about America is we have a chance to \nexpress those differences and to vote on them. When we are done, when \nthat is finished, we will go on and again work together on measures \nthat are important to our country and to our individual States.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will take the opportunity to address \nsome of the issues the Senator from North Dakota addressed. I accept \nhis graciousness about how we have run this process, and also confirm \nthat on many things we work together--and I think of two: agriculture \nand rural health care. Those are two very important issues for our \nconstituents.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has heard me speak on this point, and I \nmentioned it in my opening remarks. We did hear him say, as one Member \nwho will probably say this several times today and throughout this \ndebate, that this is a very risky road we are going down. There again, \nI think that caution is the responsibility of every Member of this \nSenate. I do not regret that he makes that caution.\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\n  On the other hand, we also appropriate a lot of money. We pass a lot \nof programs that obligate this Congress and the taxpayers of this \ncountry to pay a lot of money several years down the road based on the \nsame Congressional Budget Office projections of what the future income \nof this Treasury is going to be.\n  All I would say is, if it is risky to consider this when we have tax \ncuts, then we ought to use the same adjectives and implore the Senate \nof the United States to use the same caution as we are adopting other \nprograms down the road.\n  We never hear that. It is OK to pass spending bills and not worry \nabout what the future holds; can we meet those obligations? But if we \nincur obligations letting the people of the country keep their tax \nmoney and decisions relating to them, then obviously that is an \nentirely different story and we hear the word ``risky'' used.\n  Another point of contention with the Senator from North Dakota deals \nnot with the statistic he used, or not with the point he is trying to \nmake, but when he says 2 percent of the wealthiest Americans are going \nto benefit by the repeal of the death tax--this is such a complicated \nissue to deal with, who benefits from the death tax. Our own \nnonpartisan Joint Tax Committee does not even figure estate tax and who \nbenefits and who loses in the distribution tables they put out. That is \nbecause, for the death tax, the person who benefits has died. So it is \nridiculous to talk about the death tax benefiting 2 percent of the most \nwealthy in America, because the people who made the money are gone from \nthe face of this Earth.\n  There is an assumption here that may be partly correct--but I bet you \nwould never prove if it were correct--that the people who inherit from \nthe person who died happen to be wealthy. There is some effort by some \nthink tanks in this town to figure that equation into the distribution \ntables of whether we are benefiting the wealthy or the not so well off. \nI think it is intellectually dishonest--the Senator is not \nintellectually dishonest, but the people who do this figuring. If our \nown professional people who are nonpolitical can't do it, why should we \nlisten to some think tank that is politically oriented to make that \njudgment for us? It is wrong. You cannot trace the money.\n  One other thing I ask the Senator from North Dakota to consider is \nthat his picture of America, of the rich and the poor, just does not \nexist. Dividing America into the rich and the poor, as if somehow you \nare born poor and you stay poor all your life; you are born rich and \nyou stay rich all your life--that America does not exist. It is a \nnever-never land.\n  Mr. President, 150 years ago the French nobleman, De Tocqueville, who \ncame to our country to study democracy--he was here about 3 years and \nwrote a lot about it--wrote:\n\n       The rich are constantly becoming poor. The rich daily rise \n     out of the crowd and constantly returneth thither.\n\n  That was 150 years ago, and it has not changed now. All you have to \ndo is look at the University of Michigan studies on this point and you \nwill find economic status in this country is always transient. We do \nnot have two distinct, unchanging groups in America, the rich and the \npoor. These are generally, as was in these graphs divided here--you \nknow, the lowest income one-fifth, the next highest income one-fifth, \nthe middle income one-fifth, and then the next highest income fifth, \nand then the very wealthy fifth, 20 percent.\n  Only one-half of 1 percent of the American people--year after year--\nare in the lowest one-fifth. So when he talks over here on the lowest \n20 percent benefiting in so minuscule a fashion from this tax bill, he \ncould be talking about one-half of 1 percent of the people. The people \nwho are in that bottom one-fifth today, most of them in 1 year are \ngoing to be in other levels of income, who are going to benefit from \nour tax bill. Only one-half of 1 percent, I want to repeat, are in the \nlowest one-fifth year after year.\n  One-third of the lowest one-fifth rise to the second, third, fourth, \nor fifth quintile by next year--just 1 year away from being in that \nlowest 20 percent. Mr. President, 80 percent move out of the bottom \none-fifth--80 percent of the bottom one-fifth move to the middle class \nand above, and 30 percent of those people who were in that lowest one-\nfifth rise to the highest one-fifth; in other words, the wealthiest \none-fifth in America.\n  This is America. That is what America is all about, the ability to \nmove up as you use your talents.\n  The other end of the scale is probably even more surprising. If you \ntake the very wealthiest one-fifth of America at any one time, the rich \ndo not always stay rich.\n  That is another way of saying what De Tocqueville said 150 years ago: \nIf you take the top 1 percent of Americans, 10 years later more than \none-half had dropped out of the top 1 percent and also dropped out of \neven the top one-fifth.\n  So what we have here is an America that has always existed, never an \nAmerica of people who were always poor, and never an America of people \nwho were always rich, but people who were moving up the economic \nladder, and some who had the misfortune of moving down the economic \nladder even if they were at one time in the top 1 percent of the most \nwealthy.\n  So when you see a chart that says the lowest one-fifth and the top \none-fifth, remember, that is today; tomorrow, that picture will not be \nthe same. As people move up that ladder, they are going to benefit from \nthe tax reduction regardless of the fact that there is a lot in this \nbill for the lowest income people.\n  We have a very dynamic society, an America that is ever-changing, an \nAmerica where the poor, except for one-half of 1 percent, are much \nbetter off at various times in their life. Then, for those who are very \nfortunate to be born in wealth or to grow wealthy, very few of them \nalways stay wealthy.\n  So I hope these things are taken into consideration as we hear about \nthe ``winners'' and the ``losers'' because with this tax bill there are \nnot any losers. Everybody is a winner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oklahoma whatever time he \nwants to consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I compliment my friend and colleague from Iowa \nfor the comments he just made, but also for his management of the bill, \nas well as Senator Baucus from Montana.\n  They have worked well together to produce a good product.\n  I was disappointed to hear the comments made by my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota criticizing the bill. I happen to disagree \nwith many of the statements he made about this bill benefiting the rich \nand wealthy, and so on. I just disagree with it. He is entitled to his \nown opinion; he is not entitled to his own facts.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the facts and talk a little bit \nabout what is in this bill because I think it has been mischaracterized \nin this Chamber. I think it is important that we know what is in the \nbill.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for bringing \nus this bill today. I think this bill is a giant step in the right \ndirection. It is not perfect. Maybe it can be made better. But I think \nit is important that we look a little bit at the facts. I believe the \nfacts will show that this bill does not just benefit the wealthy. I \nthink it is a fair tax cut and weighted very much toward low-income \npeople.\n  I want to speak a little bit about the statement that this is a \nrepetition of the Reagan tax cut, and are we going to see deficits as a \nresult of this because that is what we saw when Ronald Reagan cut taxes \nin 1980?\n  I came to this body on January 3, 1981, but I looked at the record. \nIn 1980, total revenues to the Federal Government were $517 billion. \nTen years later, total revenues to the Federal Government were double \nthat amount: $1.032 trillion--almost exactly double. So if Ronald \nReagan had these massive tax cuts, revenues to the Federal Government \ndoubled in that 10-year period of time. He was President 8 years of \nthat time. Certainly, you could say he was responsible for that.\n\n  The fact is, spending grew fast, so revenues grew, and grew rather \nsubstantially, doubling in that 10-year period of time. The problem \nwas, spending grew faster. Maybe we should blame Ronald Reagan; maybe \nwe should blame the Democrats and the\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\nRepublicans who were running Congress; there is plenty of fault to go \naround. My point is: Revenues grew.\n  What Ronald Reagan did was, he made a significant reduction in rates, \nbut revenues continued to grow. He reduced the maximum rate from 70 \npercent to 28 percent. He had broad bipartisan support for those tax \nbills, I might mention. The first bill brought it down from 70 to 50 \npercent, and a couple years later we passed another bill that brought \nthe rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. I remember Senator Bradley was \nsupportive of that bill. My point is: we brought rates down but \nrevenues continued to grow.\n  I think that is also evidenced by the fact that when we reduced rates \nin 1997, when we reduced the capital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 \npercent, revenues grew.\n  So some people react: Wait a minute, you can't cut rates when you \nreduce revenues. I disagree with that. We reduced the capital gains \nrate and revenues have grown substantially.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the bill before us. Does it benefit \nprimarily the wealthy? I think not. I think it is weighted way toward \nthe low-income groups. I will just give you a couple facts. The facts \nare that we take the 15-percent bracket, the people who make $12,000 or \nless adjusted gross income, and they pay 10 percent. That is a \nreduction of 33 percent. That is not stretched out over 7 years but \nretroactive to January 1. That is today. That is real. That is $600 per \nfamily for every family who pays taxes. That will make a difference. \nThat is weighted toward the low income. People who make $12,000 or less \nget the full $600.\n  People who make $1 million, they get the same $600. Percentagewise, \nthat is going to eliminate a lot of people's tax liability, period. \nMillions of people will pay no income tax as a result of that change. \nThat change is made immediately, retroactive.\n  I heard my colleague say there are only $10 billion of outlays or \nscoring for this fiscal year and that we only have a few months left in \nthis fiscal year. But as a result of the changes we are making, a lot \nof people will get refunds that will have smaller withholding for the \nlast couple months of this fiscal year; they will get a refund in April \nof next year. They are going to get a tax cut. It will be a tax cut for \ntaxpayers.\n  What about the rest of the brackets? The rest of the brackets do not \nget anything as far as a rate change. All the brackets get a 1-point \nreduction in the rate change effective January of next year. If you \nfigure percentagewise, that is a much greater percentage reduction in \ntaxes for the lower income brackets than it is for the higher income \nbrackets. Again, I think some people are trying to score points and \nhave political class warfare, but that is ridiculous. And that does not \neven count the other changes that are made in the tax bill.\n  We have the $500 tax credit per child which is made refundable, \nagainst my advice. I do not think that is good tax policy, but it is in \nthis bill. So if anyone is saying we are benefiting the wealthy, there \nis a $500 tax credit that is refundable. Under this bill, we are giving \npeople money back who did not even pay taxes. That certainly is \nweighted toward the low-income people.\n\n  How can someone say we are not even benefiting this one group? That \nis just not right. Or that this tax bill benefits the wealthy? That is \njust not right. I was one of the principal sponsors of the $500 tax \ncredit per child that we passed in 1997. That did give people tax \ncredits. It reduced their tax liability when having kids. If they have \nfour kids, that is $2,000 more they get to keep this year as a result \nof what we passed in 1997. We expand that now to make that $1,000 per \nchild. We phase that in. The first $100 is effective immediately. So if \na family has four kids, that would be four times $600. That would be \n$2,400 they would get to keep this year, that they would have reduced \nin their taxes. Most of it would show up in a large refund for next \nyear. But that is a tax cut benefiting primarily low-income people. \nHigher income people do not get that. So I just wish people would be \nfactual.\n  Let's take, again, the upper income group. All the upper income rates \nget a 1-point reduction effective January of 2002--next year. When do \nthey get another reduction under this bill? Not until 2005. So the low-\nincome people who make $12,000 or less adjusted gross income get a 33-\npercent reduction effective immediately, but those in the higher income \nare going to have to wait another 3 years--until the year 2005--for \nanother reduction. They get 1 point in 2002--next year, in January--and \nthen they have to wait another 3 years to get another point. I think \nthat is way too slow. Then they have to wait until the year 2007 to get \n1 more point for all the rates. I think we are way too timid in getting \nthe rates effective.\n  Then some people still criticize the bill, saying the upper income is \nreally benefiting. That is hogwash. How does that compare to the tax \nincrease that passed in 1993? Did we phase in the tax increase that \npassed in 1993 and President Clinton signed? We had a tie vote. Vice \nPresident Gore broke the tie twice in the Senate. Did we phase that in \nwhen we took the maximum rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent? No. It \nwas not phased in. It was made retroactive to January 1, 1993.\n  Was that the only increase we did on upper income people? No. In \naddition to that, we said there won't be a cap on Medicare taxes, so an \nindividual pays 1.45 percent of payroll on all payroll now. It used to \nbe capped at the Social Security base. At that time it was--last year \nit was $75,000. Now that goes up.\n  So you pay 1.45 percent of Medicare on all income and actually your \nemployer does it, too, so in effect that was a 2.9-percent increase on \ntop of the 39.6. So President Clinton increased the maximum tax rate \nfrom 31 percent to 39.6 to actually 42.5 percent. The package we have \nbefore us today will reduce that by one point next year. President \nClinton raised the rate from 31 percent to 42.5 percent. This bill is \ngoing to reduce it from 42.5 percent to 41.5 percent, still over 33 \npercent higher than it was in 1993.\n  When it is all said and done, it is still 20-some-odd percent higher \nthan it was in 1993. The bill we have before us phases it down over 6 \nyears to 36 percent. Maybe it must be higher for some individuals. I \ndon't know. How much do you want the Government to pay? How big a \npercent should the top 1 percent pay? They now pay 35.9 percent of all \nincome taxes, and evidently some people think it should be 50 percent \nor more. Is that good policy? I don't think so.\n  Then they say: You had a tax cut. If they pay 100 percent of the \ntaxes, and you give a tax cut, I guess they get 100 percent of the tax \ncut, and that would be wrong.\n  That same rhetoric is employed on the death tax. We have increased \nthe exemptions over the years and, therefore, only the top 2 percent \npay the death tax. Therefore, if you cut the death tax, you are really \nbenefiting the wealthy. What is right about the Federal Government \ntaking over half of what somebody has worked their entire life for and \nthey want to pass on to their kids? What is right about the Government \nsaying, we want 60 percent of it; we want 55 percent of it? That is \npresent law. Only the top 1 percent does or only the top 5 percent. So \nwho cares? Our job in the tax policy is to redistribute wealth. We want \nto rob Peter to pay Paul. We have a lot more Pauls. We are going to \nmake them happy. We are going to take Peter's money and give it to lots \nof people.\n  Some people think the primary purpose of the Tax Code is to \nredistribute income so we have all these distributional charts. We have \nto make sure this percentile gets their fair share of the money. They \ndidn't pay their fair share of the taxes, but we want to make sure they \nget their fair share of the money. We don't do that with spending \nprograms. Some people are trying to turn the Tax Code into aid for \nfamilies with dependent children. I disagree. We should not use the Tax \nCode for spending purposes.\n  The Tax Code should be fair and equitable. There is nothing right \nabout somebody working their entire life and building up a business, a \nfarm, a ranch, or a company of some kind and they die and all of a \nsudden the Government says: Hey, we want half. Move over. We don't care \nif you have to sell the company. We don't care if it bankrupts the \ncompany. We want half. The Government is entitled to take half.\n  I think that is absolutely, fundamentally wrong.\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\n  What we are trying to do eventually in this bill is repeal the \ntaxable event on death and say the taxable event would be when somebody \nsells the property. If they inherit the property and they don't sell, \nthey continue operating the farm, the business, whatever, as long as \nthey are operating it, fine. If they sell it, then they pay tax, and \nthe tax will be at the capital gains rate. It won't be at 55 percent. \nIt won't be at 60 percent.\n  Somebody said, we don't have the death tax rate at 60 percent. Yes, \nwe do. If you have a taxable estate on death between 10 million and 17 \nmillion, the taxable rate is 60 percent. We get rid of that 5 percent \nkicker right off the bat. That is one of the things we should do in \nthis bill. We ought to get the death tax down. We ought to get marginal \nrates down. Marginal rates are too high. So we have gradually reduced \nthem. I think we are way too gradual in reducing them. But for some \npeople to say, wait a minute, we are doing too much for this group \nbecause we are really benefiting them, when all they get under this \nbill, all they get if this bill was law, and this is all we passed for \nthe next 3 years, all the wealthy would get would be basically a 1 \npercentage point reduction next January in their rate, from 39.6 to \n38.6, or correspondingly the other rates, 28 to 27, and that would be \nit until the year 2005. I think that is pretty pathetic. We can do \nbetter. I hope we will do better.\n\n  For some people to say that really benefits the wealthy just because \na few years ago we raised your rate from 31 percent to 42.5 percent, \nforget about that. To reduce it by 1 percentage point, when you \nincreased it 11.5 percent--11\\1/2\\ points, not percent, 11\\1/2\\ \npoints--now we are going to give you a great big 1 point reduction, \ngive you one-tenth of that back in 4 years, that is a massive tax cut? \nI beg to differ with you.\n  If we passed the Bush tax plan as it is, it is still much higher than \nit was under President Clinton.\n  I make these points. I think people need to look at the tax \nlegislation in total. They need to look at the tax credit, the \nrefundability of the tax credit, maybe the wisdom of that. I think that \nshould be considered. We finally start making some real inroads on \nmarriage penalty relief. I wish we did more, and I wish we did it \nearlier. But, unfortunately, some people reduce the size of this tax \nbill.\n  Some people say: Wait a minute, why can't you do marriage penalty \nmore immediately? Because some people voted on the budget resolution to \nreduce the size of this package from 1.6 trillion to 1.35. OK, they \nwon. So now we have the budget resolution, and we are doing the best \njob we can with 1.35. We should work to pass the best bill we can with \n1.35. If we had the 1.6, maybe we could do more with the marriage \npenalty. Maybe we could do more with the rates; we could accelerate \nmore the rates. But we didn't win on the budget.\n  A lot of rhetoric I have heard says: I want to redo the budget, \nfighting the budget battle. The budget battle, you lost that one. Now \nwe are fighting the tax battle: Should we have a tax cut or not? Should \nwe eliminate the death tax or not? Should we cut rates any? Is a 1 \npoint reduction in the next 4 years too much for all income brackets? I \ndon't think so.\n  Let me refer a little bit on this. We didn't cut the 15-percent rate. \nI mentioned in the Finance Committee, I would be happy to consider \nalternatives. Right now, we have weighted a lot of the tax cut. You \nhave different rates. You have a zero rate which we are expanding \nsubstantially. We have the 15-percent rate, the 28-percent rate, 31-\npercent rate, 33, 39.6. We have reduced all those rates. Somebody said: \nYou didn't reduce the 15-percent rate. What you did is you took a chunk \nof it out and made it 10 percent.\n  There is another way of doing it. We could reduce the 15-percent \nrate, take that same amount of money, we took half the tax cut. By \nadjusting that, putting in the new 10-percent rate, we could reduce the \n15-percent rate to 13.5. That would be a 10-percent reduction in the \n15-percent rate and probably do that for the same amount of money we \ndid by creating the 10 percent.\n  We would cut rates for everybody in the 15-percent bracket. That \nmight be a better tax policy than going to 10 percent. I am willing to \nconsider that.\n  In other words, there are different ways of doing this. It might come \nout the same dollarwise for the total bill, and it is more equitable. \nThere are some things we can do.\n  This bill is not perfect. But to slam it and say we are not doing \nanything over here and ignoring the child credit, to ignore the fact \nthat we are expanding the 15-percent bracket substantially for married \ncouples, which means a lot of married couples will be paying 15 percent \ninstead of 28 percent, almost a reduction of one-half on a lot of their \nincome--that is a big change--to ignore those kinds of things would be \na mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this package. I hope we don't have a \nlot of amendments. It has been pretty well balanced, if you want to \nlook at it like that, from a political perspective. I hope we can \nimprove the bill as we go forward. I hope we don't engage in a lot of \nclass warfare rhetoric nonsense. It seems that that has been coming out \nlately. I don't think it is justified. It is not becoming to the \nSenate.\n  Taxpayers are entitled to tax relief. They haven't had it for the \nlast couple years. Congress passed, in 1999, tax relief. President \nClinton vetoed it. Congress passed a couple bills last year to \neliminate the death tax and eliminate the marriage penalty. President \nClinton vetoed them. Taxpayers are overdue in getting relief. It is \ntime we give them some relief. This bill is the first good news the \ntaxpayers have had, certainly since 1997, and the first significant, \nreal relief they have had in decades.\n  I am very hopeful and pleased that we will put this on the \nPresident's desk, hopefully, by next Friday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the great thing about our country is we \ncan have honest differences of opinion, and we do. The Senator from \nOklahoma says he is against redistributing income through the Tax Code. \nThat is exactly what this bill does. Only this redistributes it up.\n  We have a circumstance in which the wealthiest 1 percent are getting \na greater share of the tax reduction provided in this bill than they \npay in Federal taxes. Now the Senator wants to talk just about income \ntaxes. People don't only pay income taxes; they pay income taxes, \npayroll taxes, and other taxes. The wealthiest 1 percent don't pay 33 \npercent of Federal taxes--they don't. They pay 23 percent to 26 percent \nin Federal taxes, but they get 33 percent of the benefit in this plan. \nThat is not fair. It is not fair.\n  The Senator talks about the estate tax. The fact is, the estate tax \nis paid by the wealthiest 2 percent of the estates in America. We agree \nthere is a problem with the current estate tax because it bites at much \ntoo low a level--$675,000 for an individual, $1.3 million for a \ncouple--before you start paying any tax. That is too low given what has \nhappened to the value of financial assets, real estate and other \nassets.\n  I have supported increasing the estate tax to $5 million for an \nindividual, $10 million for a couple, but eliminating the estate tax is \nfiscally irresponsible given the cost the Federal Government is going \nto face when the baby boomers retire. It costs $750 billion the second \n10 years. From where is the money going to come? The Senator from \nOklahoma is going to shift that burden on to everybody else.\n  The tax policy is fundamentally a question of, what is the fairest \nway of distributing the burden in society? What is the fairest way? The \nSenator from Oklahoma apparently has a difference with this Senator, at \nleast on what is fair. I don't think it is fair to take the people's \nmoney and give 33 percent of the benefit of this tax cut to the \nwealthiest 1 percent. I don't think that is fair. I don't think it \ndemeans the Senate one bit to have that debate. I think it is exactly \nthe debate the people of this country, who sent us here, expect us to \nhave. What is the fiscally responsible thing to do? What is the fair \nthing to do? That is exactly what we ought to be debating.\n  We also have a difference on what the historical record is. The \nSenator goes back to the 1980s and talks about a doubling of tax \nreceipts. But I think that is misleading because it doesn't take \naccount of inflation. The way to best compare what happened to revenue \nand expenditure in different historical periods is by looking at \nrevenue\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nas a percentage of gross domestic product and outlays as a percentage \nof gross domestic product. When you do that, it is very clear what \nhappened in the 1980s. The spending went up with the big defense \nbuildup the President proposed and Congress enacted. The spending went \nup as a percentage of GDP. The revenue went down sharply as a \npercentage of GDP. That opened up this massive chasm, which was \ndeficit. The yearly difference between what we took in and what we \nspent multiplied the debt. The debt quadrupled, putting this country in \na deep hole. And the same folks who designed that package are coming \nback with the one we see today.\n  The question is, what is the fiscally responsible thing to do? I \ndon't believe it is responsible to pass this package. I don't think it \nis a fair thing to do, either.\n  I rise to offer an amendment to deal with one of the issues that I \nthink is most unfair in terms of the bill that is before us. Every \nSenator has talked about the need to fix the marriage penalty. Indeed, \nwe should fix it because some couples pay more taxes simply because \nthey are married. That is not right. That is not fair. I think we all \nagree with those propositions. But this bill doesn't do anything about \nit for 4 years. There is no marriage penalty relief in this bill for \nthis year. There is no marriage penalty relief in this bill for next \nyear. There is no marriage penalty relief in this bill for the year \nthereafter. There is no marriage penalty relief for 4 years. I don't \nthink we can leave this legislation without addressing the marriage \npenalty now.\n\n  The amendment I am offering would simply say, let's put in place \nthose elements of this legislation that address the marriage penalty \nnow. Let's do it this year. Let's put it in place immediately. I \nbelieve marriage penalty relief should begin as soon as possible--not 4 \nyears from now, not 5 years from now, but now.\n  Under my amendment, the two key components of this legislation \ndealing with the marriage penalty would be put into place immediately: \nOne, the standard deduction for married couples would double the \ndeduction for single individuals; two, the top income limit in the 15-\npercent bracket for married couples would be double the limit for \nsingle individuals. This does not solve the marriage penalty, but they \nare the provisions that are in this bill. These are the provisions in \nthis bill that do not take effect for 4 years. I am simply saying let's \nmove them up and have them take effect immediately.\n  By providing marriage penalty relief more quickly, we are helping \nmiddle-class Americans, strengthening families, and removing tax \ndisadvantages to marriage. I think we can all agree on that. We also \nhelp simplify tax filing for the many families who will no longer have \nto itemize their deductions. We are improving the fairness of the \npackage.\n  The bottom line is, without this fix, a couple who got married last \nyear will have to wait until their eighth wedding anniversary to get \nfull marriage penalty relief. I don't believe that is right or fair. We \ncan do better. This amendment is an attempt to do that.\n  My amendment is paid for by delaying the rate reductions for the top \ntwo brackets, so that the rates will drop to 35 percent and 38 percent \nin 2009, and to 33 and 36 percent in 2010. In essence, we are saying, \nput marriage penalty relief as a top priority.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 654\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I say to the managers I have no desire to \ntake an hour on this amendment, considering the other amendments \nSenators desire to offer. I am prepared to go to a vote very quickly on \nthis amendment. Perhaps others want to speak. I understand that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Johnson be shown as an original \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps others would like to speak. I am \nhappy to work with the manager in whatever way he thinks is most \nappropriate in order to move things along. If the manager on our side \nwants to delay consideration and have other amendments considered or \nhave others speak on other subjects, that is fine with me.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as the Senator from North Dakota knows, we \nare trying to negotiate out a sequence and order of amendments. I very \nmuch appreciate the graciousness of the Senator from North Dakota. At \nthis point, since I do not know what the Senator from Texas, who has an \namendment on the subject, desires, I suggest that the Senator proceed \nwith his amendment, and that after a reasonable period of time we will \nbe in a much better position to know about how to sequence this. I urge \nthe Senator to proceed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator very much. I have made my initial \nremarks. I see the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, now in the \nChamber. He is an original cosponsor of the amendment. I think he would \nlike time to speak on the amendment as well.\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I \nwill be very brief.\n  I applaud the work Senator Conrad has done on the marriage penalty \namendment by accelerating the marriage penalty relief to begin \nimmediately. One of the great disappointments of the pending \nlegislation is that the marriage penalty is not phased out until \nbeginning the year 2005.\n  There are many of us who thought this was going to be one of the \nhigh-priority items we would be taking up in a tax cut bill, and yet we \nfind nothing happens relative to getting rid of the marriage penalty \nfor half a decade.\n  The offset Senator Conrad has proposed is a delay in the phase-in of \nthe marginal tax rates for the top two brackets, the 39.6 and 36-\npercent brackets. Those are families who are making roughly $300,000 a \nyear for the 39.6-percent bracket and about $161,000 for the 36-percent \nbracket. This would be delayed. They would ultimately get the bracket \nreduction, the same as was initially proposed.\n  The question is, who has to wait? The people with the marriage \npenalty or the highest tax bracket? Somebody has to wait to fit into \nthe tax plan, and it seems to me we ought to accelerate the marriage \npenalty, which benefits everyone who is married, regardless of what \ntheir income might be, and move forward with that.\n  Again, under this amendment, we will allow the phased-down reductions \nof those two top tax brackets just as was in the original bill. It is \nnot a matter of eliminating bracket reduction, but it is a matter of \nhaving to choose, having to make a decision. We have to decide right \nhere and now whose tax relief ought to come first. Should it be people \nwho are, under Federal policy, being penalized for their marital \nstatus, or should the highest income people in America get their relief \nfirst and people who are being penalized for being married have to \nwait? To me, that is an easy decision. To me, public policy ought to \nencourage family stability. Public policy ought to encourage marriage, \nnot discourage it, and in the course of trying to come up with a more \nequitable Tax Code, it ought to be among the very first items we \naddress.\n  To delay tax relief on the marriage penalty in order to continue to \nquickly reduce the tax brackets on the wealthiest upper percentiles of \nthe American public does not make a lot of sense to me.\n  This change would be a great benefit to married families all across \nSouth Dakota. It would affect, by slowing down the phase-in, fewer than \n3 percent of the citizens of my State, but in exchange for that, they \nwould get their marriage penalty relieved as well regardless of income \nlevels.\n  This is a sensible, commonsense amendment being offered by Senator \nConrad. It does nothing to the overall scope of the tax cut. It does \nnothing to eliminate the reductions in brackets for the top income tax \nbrackets, but it does say, with an exclamation point, right here and \nnow that we will make elimination of the marriage tax penalty \nimmediately one of our priorities. We should not be phasing it in over \nthe course of 5 years simply to allow the immediate reduction of tax \npayments by the wealthiest upper percentiles in America. That is the \ntradeoff. That is the balance and choice we have to make.\n  I applaud Senator Conrad for his work on this amendment and hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the immediate \nelimination of the marriage penalty. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Colorado \nwhat time he might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If I may have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first I commend Chairman Grassley for his \nhard work in putting this tax bill together. He has done a great job as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and we all appreciate how quickly he \nwas able to get this tax cut out of his committee. He has provided \ncritical leadership in the battle to provide tax relief to the American \npeople.\n  I reiterate, as I have time and again, the budget surplus is the \npeople's surplus, it is not the Government's surplus, and it is time to \nrefund a portion of this surplus to the people who pay the bills. They \nare being overtaxed, and they deserve a refund.\n  This bill provides that refund in the form of lower income tax rates. \nIt repeals the death tax. There is an increase in the child tax credit. \nThere is relief on the marriage penalty provisions and tax relief for \neducation expenses. That is a good start. I am one of those Senators \nwho thinks there could be more done and should be more done as far as \nthe size of the tax cut, but this is a good start.\n  My hope is that we can continue to improve this bill in the Senate \nand in conference, and that we can work for more tax cuts in a second \ntax bill later this year.\n  I have two concerns with this bill. First, the bill does not cut the \nincome tax rates far enough. There should be no higher rate, in my \nview, than 33 percent. All of the tax brackets should be lowered so \nthat we have only four rates: 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, and \nthen the final level would be the 33 percent.\n  In my view, no one should pay more than a third of their income in \nFederal income taxes. This is what the President and the House have \nproposed, and I am hopeful we can move to that in the conference.\n\n  The second concern I have is that this bill contains no reduction in \nthe capital gains tax rate. I will, therefore, be offering an amendment \nto add this tax cut to the bill. My amendment will reduce the top \ncapital gains rate from 20 percent to 15 percent with those in the \nlower brackets paying only a 7-percent rate on capital gains.\n  I have two versions of this amendment. One is a permanent rate cut. \nThe other is a 2-year rate cut that should clearly raise revenue even \nunder the Joint Tax Committee scoring.\n  I cannot understand why we do not have a capital gains cut in this \nbill. Both parties have come together in support of immediate tax \nrelief to stimulate the economy, and, in my view, there is no tax that \ncould do more to stimulate the economy than a further reduction in the \ncapital gains rate if we could cut that further. If we want to pull the \neconomy out of its slump, if we want to revive the stock market, if we \nwant to return to full economic growth, we should cut the capital gains \ntax.\n  The greatest irony is we could cut this tax with no loss of revenue. \nIn fact, a capital gains tax cut will actually raise revenue. This \noccurs for three reasons. First, a reduction in the tax on capital \ngains will, purely and simply, increase economic growth. Second, it \nwill increase the value of capital assets held by taxpayers. Three, \nwhen the tax is cut, people will sell more capital assets. We open up \nthe gates of commerce.\n  Remember, the capital gains tax is a voluntary tax. It is only paid \nwhen the assets are sold and investors are much more willing to sell \ncapital assets when the tax rate is lower. This is not a theory. It has \nbeen proven time and again by history. Let me reflect on a few of those \nhistorical moments.\n  In 1997, we reduced the capital gains tax from 28 percent to 20 \npercent, and many of you, I think, in this Chamber will recall the \ndebate over whether this would raise or lower revenues. We now have the \nanswer. Revenue from capital gains increased dramatically after the tax \nrate cut. In fact, in just the 4 years since the rate cut, 1997 through \n2000, the Government has received $200 billion more capital gains \nrevenue than forecast before the tax rate. I repeat, $200 million in \nadded revenue in just 4 years.\n\n  I call my colleagues' attention to this chart. I have placed a copy \non each Member's desk. The chart shows for the years 1997, 1998, 1999, \nand 2000 the orange-yellow bars, what would have been the projected \nrevenue from capital gains if we had not reduced the capital gains \nrate. The amount of growth that has occurred during this same period is \nphenomenal. This reflects the increase in capital gains revenue, and \nthis projected what it would have been if we had not cut capital gains. \nIt is substantial. It is $200 billion in added revenue in 4 years.\n  Each time we have cut the capital gains tax rate, revenues have gone \nup.\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n  This happened after the 1978 cut from 40 percent to 28 percent. It \nhappened again in 1981 when the rate was cut from 28 percent to 20 \npercent.\n  By contrast, after the 1986 tax increase, revenues actually declined.\n  Then finally in 1997, after the most recent reduction in the tax \nrate, we experienced a huge capital gains revenue increase.\n  This added revenue has been a big factor in the budget surpluses of \nrecent years. In fact, this $200 billion of added revenue exceeds the \nentire non-Social Security surplus since 1997.\n  I refer my colleagues specifically to the four years since the 1997 \nrate cut from 28 percent to 20 percent. In each year you can see the \nrevenue that was forecast before the rate cut, and then next to it the \nrevenue that we actually received.\n  The revenues are virtually double the forecast after the rate cut--as \nI noted, $200 billion in new money in just 4 years.\n  The increase in revenues should make this tax cut an easy sell, but \nthat is not the main reason that we should cut the tax.\n  The main reason is that this tax cut immediately increase savings, \ncapital investment, and stock values.\n  All of this is pointed out in Monday's Wall Street Journal op-ed by \nArthur Laffer, Lawrence Kudlow, and Stephen Moore.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that this Journal article be \nprinted in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. Let me just quote from the final paragraph of this \narticle:\n\n       The last capital-gains cut in Washington led to higher \n     productivity and capital investment, a spectacular surge in \n     stock values, and a new age of federal surpluses. Isn't that \n     exactly what is meant by a fiscal stimulus?\n\n  That is what is meant by fiscal stimulus. We should add this \nprovision to our tax bill for the simple reason that it will get this \neconomy moving again.\n  The American people are overtaxed.\n  Tax Freedom Day was May 3, this year. This is the latest it has ever \nbeen.\n  This means that average American families will work the first 123 \ndays of the year to pay the combined tax bill from all levels of \ngovernment--Federal, State, and local.\n  It is time for a tax cut.\n  We frequently discuss the budget surplus, but I believe that it is \nmore accurate to refer to it as the tax surplus. The tax surplus \nrepresents an overpayment by taxpayers and should be refunded to those \nwho overpaid.\n  Tax cuts will benefit all Americans by making the economy stronger. \nLow taxes reward work, saving, and investment. Low taxes provide the \nfuel for our economy to create new jobs and raise our standard of \nliving.\n  Allowing people to keep their own money simply makes the most sense. \nPeople are in a better position than the government to know what they \nneed. I believe in the people's priorities, not Washington's \npriorities.\n  This tax cut is real money that can be used for the downpayment on a \nhome, college tuition, or a family vacation.\n  While I want to add a capital gains tax cut, I know that this tax \nbill contains many important provisions.\n  All taxpayers will get immediate relief when the 15 percent rate is \nlowered to 10 percent on a significant portion of income.\n  The tax bill also increases the child tax credit, provides tax relief \nfor education expenses, and eliminates the death tax.\n  I am particularly pleased to support repeal of the death tax. It is \nthe one tax cut issue that comes up consistently.\n  The United States retains among the highest estate taxes in the \nworld, and top estate tax rates can reach over 55 percent. This is \nmoney that was already taxed when it was earned.\n  The estate tax can destroy a family business. This is the most \ndisturbing aspect of the tax. No American family should lose its \nbusiness because of the estate tax or death tax.\n  Similarly, more and more large ranches and farms are facing the \nprospect of break-up and sale to developers in order to pay the estate \ntax.\n  Americans are spending more than ever on taxes. In fact, we now pay \nmore in taxes than we do for food, shelter, and clothing combined. \nSince when did the Federal Government become more important than life's \nessentials?\n  It is time to reverse this trend by cutting taxes across the board. \nLow taxes will help our economy and will also help America's families.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to reduce the capital \ngains rate to 15 percent.\n  This addition will make the bill even stronger than it is now.\n  Adding this will stimulate the economy, increase saving and \ninvestment, and boost Federal revenues.\n  We should not let this opportunity pass without adding the tax cut \nthat will do the most to restore the prosperous 4 percent to 5 percent \neconomic growth that we experienced in the late 1990's.\n  There is no reason why our economy cannot sustain high levels of \neconomic growth.\n  This is in fact the best way to ensure that we can continue tax \nrelief, pay off the national debt, improve education opportunities, and \nfinance the Social Security and Medicare commitments that have been \nmade to the baby boom generation.\n  We need a strong and vibrant economy to fully achieve our goals and \nrealize our dreams for all Americans.\n  A capital gains tax cut will help us to quickly restore that strong \neconomy.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues as we move to cut the capital \ngains tax rate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From The Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2001]\n\n                  Real Relief: A Capital-Gains Tax Cut\n\n         (By Arthur Laffer, Lawrence Kudlow, and Stephen Moore)\n\n       The budget deal reached last week between the White House \n     and Congress calls for a $100 billion tax-cut stimulus in \n     2001-02. Yet to be decided is the nature of those cuts. \n     Congress, increasingly jittery about the sagging economy, \n     will likely seek rate cuts that offer growth-enhancing tax \n     relief quickly.\n       That makes a lot of sense. What doesn't is the tax-rebate \n     plan that many in Congress wish to enact. The tax rebate is \n     intended to send checks out to American workers to stimulate \n     consumer spending. But more spending is not what the economy \n     needs most now.\n\n\n                            personal savings\n\n       This has always been an investment-led downturn, not a \n     consumer slump. The huge federal tax overpayments have badly \n     drained personal savings and undermined capital investment \n     and risk-taking. The one tax cut that would immediately boost \n     savings, capital investment and stock values is a reduction \n     in the capital-gains tax.\n       Consider what has happened to Americans' wealth over the \n     past several months. The Federal Reserve Board reported that \n     Americans lost nearly $2 trillion in wealth in just the last \n     quarter of 2000 as a result of the stock-market decline. This \n     is the equivalent of a $20,000 evisceration in wealth and \n     capital for each household in America. It is the lack of \n     capital formation that poses such a tall barrier to resuming \n     the prosperous 4% to 5% growth of the late 1990s.\n       Oddly enough, a capital-gains cut is not now part of the \n     Bush tax plan or the congressional agenda. It should be. The \n     capital-gains cut has the added political attraction that it \n     is self-financing and, properly scored, would actually \n     increase revenues.\n       The best course would be a permanent reduction in the \n     capital-gains tax from 20% to about 15%. But if the rules of \n     the budget agreement only allow a stimulus tax cut through \n     2002, Congress should still cut the capital-gains tax for the \n     next two years. (We doubt any Congress would be foolhardy \n     enough to raise the rate again, mortally wounding the economy \n     just before the next elections.)\n       Any capital-gains cut would instantly be capitalized into \n     the value of stocks. Stock values are determined by the \n     discounted present value of the after-tax rate of return \n     on the asset. So, capital-gains tax relief would \n     immediately raise investment return and lower capital \n     costs. This isn't just speculation. The past two capital-\n     gains tax rate cuts--in 1981 and in 1987--were both \n     followed by riptide gains in the stock market and the \n     economy.\n       Reducing this tax will encourage investors to unlock \n     cumulative gains of the past, liberating capital and freeing \n     these funds to be reinvested in more future-oriented, \n     entrepreneurial, growth-generating enterprises. In \n     particular, it would spur venture-capital investment, which \n     rocketed upward after the 1997 rate cut but has recently \n     sagged badly. This pool of high-risk investment capital is \n     essential to finance technological innovation, itself vital \n     to productivity advances that will increase real wages and \n     expand the economy's growth potential.\n       Moreover, this growth effect would be multiplied if the \n     arbitrary one-year holding period for the long-term capital-\n     gains tax rate were eliminated entirely.\n       Skeptics will accuse us of ``voodoo economics'' when we say \n     that a capital-gains tax cut will raise revenue. But those \n     skeptics--Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, in\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\n     particular--are just as wrong now as they were back in 1997 \n     when the capital-gains rate was chopped to 20% from 28%. \n     Congressional Budget Office data confirms a stunning gain in \n     tax revenues from the lower capital-gains tax rate. Receipts \n     more than doubled to $118 billion in 2000 from $54 billion in \n     1996.\n       In fact, revenues generated after the 1997 cut, compared \n     with revenues predicted at the time, tell an amazing story. \n     Before the tax rate was cut to 20% from 28%, the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation predicted that we would collect $209 \n     billion from 1997 to 2000 from capital-gains payments. \n     Instead, the capital-gains tax raised $372 billion over this \n     period. In other words, the lower tax rate yielded 80% more \n     revenue over the four-year period than was projected if the \n     rate had remained at 28%--a $166 billion windfall. In fact, \n     the capital-gains tax cut was a contributor to the big and \n     unexpected budget surpluses that emerged in the late 1990s.\n       We aren't suggesting this capital-gains cut as a substitute \n     for the George W. Bush's tax-cut plan. It's imperative that \n     the White House stick to its guns on its planned reduction of \n     the top tax rate to 33%, down from 39.6% today. The income-\n     tax rate cuts are desirable because they will increase \n     individual and small-business incentives that will raise the \n     long-term growth potential and investment attractiveness of \n     the U.S. economy.\n\n\n                               Rate Cuts\n\n       But the income-tax rate cuts in the president's plan are \n     far too backloaded (the top rate would only fall to 38% in \n     2002) to provide much juice for the economy right now. In \n     fact, if the capital-gains cut raises more revenues, as \n     expected, then it will help finance the Bush income-tax rate \n     reduction plan.\n       The last capital-gains cut in Washington led to higher \n     productivity and capital investment, a spectacular surge in \n     stock values, and a new age of federal surpluses. Isn't that \n     exactly what is meant by a fiscal stimulus?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My purpose for rising is to discuss the amendment before the Senate, \nan amendment from the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Just so the managers of the bill understand, Senator \nRockefeller indicated a willingness to speak on the bill itself. He \nwill be over in 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We will do everything we can to accommodate Members of \nboth parties. That is perfectly legitimate, particularly considering \nthe fact that Senator Rockefeller has many amendments to the bill and \nhas strong feelings about the bill, and we have a responsibility to let \nthe American people hear that point of view.\n  I think, in visiting about the marriage penalty, it is good to talk \nabout tax relief for married families in the mark that goes beyond just \nthe marriage penalty. The bill provides specific relief for married \nfamilies. This is at all income levels. First, we expand the earned-\nincome credit. That is a program for married families with children. \nThe phasing in of the earned-income credit, which targets assistance to \nlow-income families, is expanded in our legislation by $3,000.\n  I want to give Senator Jeffords from Vermont the credit for working \nso hard on this provision. He believes very strongly in a tax bill \nbeing equitable between different income levels. He tailored it so this \nrelief happens immediately. This is not one of the portions of the bill \nthat phases in. The next tax year, this provision of $3,000 earned-\nincome credit will take effect. So we are providing, in this section, \nsomething that is of immediate impact. In addition to Senator Jeffords, \nI should give appropriate credit to Senator Snowe from Maine and \nSenator Lincoln from Arkansas for this provision as well.\n  We are providing part of our relief for married families right away. \nI might add, it is a hallmark of this bill that the benefits provided \nto low-income families are immediate, while benefits to other income \nlevels are phased in, as you have been told so many times over the \ncourse of this debate thus far. The income tax relief for married \nfamilies is phased in over 4 years and completed in the year 2008. It \nprovides for doubling of the standard deduction for those married \nfiling jointly, and it makes the 15-percent rate bracket for married \nfiling jointly two times that of someone filing single.\n  Income tax relief is provided for both one-earner and two-earner \nfamilies. For those who want to start providing targeted income tax \nrelief for married families earlier, where were these folks a few weeks \nago when we were debating the size of the tax cut, particularly during \nthe period on the budget? What happened when we went from $1.6 trillion \ndown to $1.35 trillion--that was a desire more from the other side of \nthe aisle than just a few on this side of the aisle. That is what makes \nit difficult to squeeze all these different, very important tax equity \nprovisions into this bill. So anybody who complains about having to \nphase some of these things in more slowly, they could have taken hold \nmuch more quickly if we were dealing with a $1.6 trillion package \nrather than a $1.35 trillion package. The phase-in of the marriage \nrelief reflects the realities of a budget resolution, then, that is \ndown about $300 billion.\n  I think, also, there is a certain amount of intellectual questioning \nthat is legitimate in this process of a well-tailored bipartisan bill \nout of the Senate Finance Committee, that the Senate Finance Committee \nhad to fit into a $1.35 trillion package, and then complaining about \nthe phase-in being so slow.\n  Somehow, I doubt my colleagues who mention these things would join me \nin offering an amendment that would increase the tax reduction by the \namount necessary to provide immediate tax relief on the marriage \npenalty.\n  So we get back to something that is a familiar part of this debate \ntoday, and will be until we get done on Monday, and that is this bill \nis balanced. It is balanced in fairness and equity. It is also balanced \nin a political way. This is a bipartisan bill.\n  I hope when this amendment comes up, we have strong bipartisan \nopposition to changing a very carefully crafted portion of the bill, \nthe marriage penalty.\n\n  The bill also provides immediate tax reduction for all marginal tax \nrates as a means of helping to strengthen our economy and balances that \nwith good tax policy of supporting the institution of marriage. If the \neconomy is not strong, everyone, whether it is families, children, the \nelderly, or other groups of Americans, suffers.\n  The economy comes first, although I will say again, we do provide \nbenefits for low-income married people with children right now. This is \na figleaf amendment to cover up the fact that many people did not \nanswer the call when the Senate was considering marriage penalty relief \nlast year. This amendment harms our efforts to strengthen the economy. \nThat is why I am urging its defeat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to hear an explanation of how it harms the \neconomy of the country to address the marriage penalty this year rather \nthan wait 4 years. How is that? How does that hurt the country? How \ndoes it hurt the country to address the marriage penalty now instead of \nwaiting 4 years?\n  Just the opposite is true. It strengthens the country to address the \nmarriage penalty now and not wait 4 years. The fact is, on this side I \noffered a budget plan that had half as big a tax cut, but it dealt with \nthe marriage penalty. In fact, it had more money to address marriage \npenalty than is in this bill. So it is not a question of since you \nsupported a smaller tax cut that you were then preventing addressing \nthe marriage penalty. There are other choices to be made.\n  How much you provide at the top end of the income spectrum is a key \nissue. Here is the problem with this bill. The top 1 percent get twice \nas much of the benefits as the bottom 60 percent. That is the problem \nwith this bill. If you didn't design the tax proposal in this way, you \nwould have no problem doing what I am doing with this amendment, which \nis to provide marriage penalty relief starting now, not waiting, as the \nlegislation before us does, for 4 years to do anything. The problem \nthey have is summed up very well in this chart. The top 1 percent get \n33.5 percent of the benefit of this bill. The bottom 60 percent get 15 \npercent of the benefit. So the top 1 percent, people on average who \nearn in this country $1.1 million a year--and that is great; I am all \nfor them. I am pleased they are successful. It is a great thing about \nAmerica. But when we are talking about taking the people's money and \ngiving it back to\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\npeople, I am not for taking the people's money and giving a third of it \nto people who are on average earning $1.1 million. That doesn't strike \nme as fair. That doesn't strike me as equitable. That doesn't strike me \nas balanced. That doesn't strike me as the way to strengthen the \neconomy.\n  In this amendment I say let's address the marriage penalty beginning \nnow. We do not have to wait 4 years to begin to address the marriage \npenalty. The marriage penalty is not right. It is hurting those who are \nin a circumstance in which the Tax Code penalizes them for being \nmarried. That is not right. Nobody supports that. I do not suggest \nanybody does.\n  The Senator from Iowa said some of us on the other side last year did \nnot support a proposal on marriage penalty. You bet we did not support \nthat because it did not solve the marriage penalty. It dealt with three \nof the provisions in the code that create marriage penalty, that impose \na marriage penalty. There are over 60 provisions in the code that \nimpose marriage penalty. On our side, we proposed giving taxpayers a \nchoice. They could file as individuals, they could file as a couple, \nwhichever benefited them the most. That is the only way to solve all of \nthe 60 places in the Tax Code that impose a marriage penalty. That was \nnot accepted. It was not passed.\n\n  In this bill, we have a different approach. It is a useful approach. \nIt helps. But it is delayed. It is deferred. It is drawn out. What we \nare saying is: Look, let's address the marriage penalty now. Let's not \nwait 4 years before we start. And let's not wait until 2008 to fully \nphase it in. Let's start dealing with the marriage penalty now. I think \nthat is fair and it does no harm to the country. It strengthens the \ncountry to do so.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This legislation is a commonsense approach. \nPolitically, it is bipartisan. In order to get anything through the \nSenate, you have to have that commonsense approach, something where we \nproduce legislation that will get at least 51 votes. We have \nlegislation here that will get a lot more than 51 votes. So the common \nsense is that there is a balance here: One, politically it is \nbipartisan. The other one is that it is balanced between short-term \nstimulus, immediate help for lower income tax rates, and helping those \nat the outer income. In the outer years, that is phased in to lower the \ntop marginal tax rate.\n  The Senator's marriage penalty amendment upsets the balance that we \nhave in this bill between short-term, immediate help and the long-term \nstimulus to the economy. This bill is balanced between a short-term \nstimulus of $100 billion and then the changes in the higher marginal \ntax rates which will have a long-term impact on the economy. He pays \nfor his amendment by damaging the balance we have in this bill between \nshort-term stimulus and long-term stimulus because, even though these \nrates are phased in over the next few years, by reducing the marginal \ntax rates, we have economic studies that show people will change their \ninvestment habits based upon the prospects and known changes of tax \nlaw. Even though the money is not in the pockets of the taxpayers, we \nknow there is going to be changes of investment and spending habits, \nbased upon the prospects of the marginal tax rates coming down that are \ngoing to be a long-term benefit to this economy--creating jobs, keeping \ninflation down, and strengthening the economy.\n  I plead with my colleagues, as they consider this legislation--it is \nfair to look at the equity of the bill, but the equity is between long-\nterm stimulus, short-term stimulus, between partisanship or bipartisan. \nWe have a balance through bipartisanship, and we have a balance between \nlong-term stimulus and short-term stimulus.\n  So what is wrong with the amendment by the Senator from North Dakota? \nIt isn't that he wants to do more about the marriage penalty. We all \nwould. But this is a carefully crafted compromise, both for the \npolitical need to get a bill through and for the good of the economy. \nAnd we try to be fair in the process. That is why it upsets this very \ndelicate balance.\n  We should keep our eye on the ball, and keeping your eye on the ball \nmeans: Where do we want to go? We want to be fair and equitable. We \nwant short-term stimulus. We want long-term improvement to the economy. \nThis bill does all that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when my colleague, who I respect and \nadmire and like and work with frequently, makes these points, I just \nprofoundly disagree. I do not think this is a balanced package. I \nshowed the chart as to why I do not think this is balanced. He is \ntalking about upsetting the balance. This is not my idea of balance. \nThe top 1 percent get 33 percent of the benefits, and the bottom 60 \npercent get 15 percent of the benefits. Half as much for the bottom 60 \npercent as the top 1 percent? And this is called a carefully crafted \nbalance?\n  Looking at it a different way, the bottom 20 percent get 1 percent of \nthe benefits, the top 20 percent get 70 percent of the benefits. And \nthis is a carefully crafted balance? There is no balance. The top 1 \npercent get 33 percent of the benefits, twice as much as the bottom 60 \npercent.\n  When we look at rate reduction, it is very interesting. These are the \nrates that are in the current code: For the 15-percent rate, they do \nnot get any rate reduction, none, zip. Interestingly enough, that is \nwhere the vast majority of the American taxpayers are. That is where 70 \npercent of the American taxpayers are. They get no rate reduction.\n  For the 28 percent, they get 3 points, about a 10 percent on rate \nreduction; the same is true at 31 percent; the same is true at 36 \npercent.\n  The very top, the very wealthiest who pay a rate of 39.6 percent, get \nthe biggest rate reduction of all, but the bottom rate, where 70 \npercent of the American taxpayers are, gets nothing.\n  They call this balanced? I do not see any balance. They call this \nfair, carefully calibrated? Carefully calibrated if you are at the top. \nBut if you are one of the 70 percent of the American people who are \ndown here in the 15-percent bracket, you get no rate relief.\n  It does not seem carefully calibrated to me. It does not seem fair to \nme. It does not seem balanced to me. When there are five rates in the \ncurrent Tax Code and only one rate gets no rate relief, and it just \nhappens to be the rate where 70 percent of the American taxpayers are, \nthat does not strike me as balanced. And the biggest rate reduction \ngoing to the very top bracket does not seem balanced to me.\n  I do not think it is going to seem balanced to the American people \nwhen they have a chance to review it. I do not think it is going to \nseem balanced to them when they have a chance to find out the details.\n  I do not think the 70 percent of the American people who find out \nthey get no rate relief are going to think they have been treated very \nfairly. This thing is weighted to the very top, the very wealthiest \namong us. That is what this is. It is not balanced. It is not fair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have two charts as well. I am not sure I enjoy this \nbattle of the charts.\n  Mr. REID. I say to Senator Grassley----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder if the Senator would like to enter into this \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nConrad amendment be temporarily set aside following the remarks of the \nSenator from West Virginia, and that Senator Hutchison be recognized in \norder to offer an amendment relating to the marriage tax penalty. I \nfurther ask consent that there be a total of 2 hours equally divided in \nthe usual form for debate on both amendments concurrently. I further \nask consent that following the use or yielding back of time the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Conrad amendment, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Hutchison amendment, with no amendments in \norder to the amendments prior to the votes.\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n  I would say that the Senator from West Virginia has asked for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  As a Senator from the State of Kentucky, I object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The charts behind me contradict what the President----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to ask about the process. I am able to do \nwhatever I need to do, but I am not sure what the previous objection \nwas regarding. So I do not know if it was to the offering of my \namendment after Senator Conrad's amendment, and then the votes, or if \nit was to the 10 minutes for the Senator from West Virginia. But if we \ncould clarify it, then I would be able to plan, if the Senator from \nIowa would help me clarify this situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we could resolve this very quickly if the \nSenator from Iowa would allow us to go into a very brief quorum call.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request that I \npropounded before the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there may be honest differences of \nopinion between the Senator from North Dakota and I, but when he makes \nthe claim that this tax bill is not fair, I refer to the chart behind \nme.\n  When our legislation is passed, this bill will make the income tax \nsystem more progressive. We have heard the other side say that the \nupper income gets more out of the tax cuts. First, the people paying \nthe taxes will get more tax reductions. But after this bill is enacted, \nthe wealthy will be paying more of the taxes than they are paying now.\n  As we can see specifically, where the Senator from North Dakota said \nthat the top group would be getting 33 percent of the benefit, take \ninto consideration that they are paying 35.9 percent of the total taxes \ntoday.\n  I have a second chart. This chart shows that the tax relief share is \ngreatest in families earning less than $50,000. It is all because of \nour bill. More than half of the $750 billion that we have in rate cuts \nin this bill go to the new 10-percent rate. We can see here that we \nhave very carefully tried to craft a bill that is progressive and \nretains the progressiveness of the present tax system.\n  About the President's proposal, we are not dealing with the \nPresident's proposal on the floor today, as the President would like to \nhave it. With the reality of the makeup of the Congress, it never will \nbe. But let's just say that we were debating today the President's \nproposal that he announced in the campaign and behind which he still \nstands as his policy. If it were carried out, the top income people in \nAmerica would be paying a higher percentage of the total income tax \ntake of the Federal Treasury than they do today. So I don't want to \nhear anybody talk about the progressiveness of our tax system being \ndiluted at all because of either this bill or the President's bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa put up some very \ninteresting charts.\n  The one he has there now says: Tax Relief Act Makes Tax Code More \nProgressive. Then under that it says: First Year Tax Relief.\n  This isn't a 1-year bill. This is a 10-year bill. That is the \nproblem.\n  I displayed a chart earlier about all the measures that are phased \nin, all the things that come in later on, that benefit the wealthiest \npeople in our country. He puts up a chart that talks about the first-\nyear tax relief. That is not a fair measurement of what this bill does. \nThat is what is wrong with the analysis.\n  This is what the bill does over the 10 years. It gives 70 percent of \nthe benefits to the top 20 percent, and gives 1 percent of the benefits \nto the bottom 20 percent. It gives 33 percent of the benefits to the \ntop 1 percent, twice as much as the bottom 60 percent receive. There is \nno way of disputing this. This is what the bill does. That is exactly \nwhat it does. I am not putting up a chart that just has the first year. \nThis is not a 1-year bill.\n  The fact is, this bill is heavily weighted to the highest income \npeople in the country. That is a fact. The chairman of the committee \nshowed a previous chart that talked about how much people pay in income \ntaxes. There is something missing from that chart, too. What is missing \nis payroll taxes.\n  The fact is, 80 percent of the taxpayers of this country pay more in \npayroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Our friends on the other \nside just want to talk about income taxes. They want to forget about \nthe fact that 80 percent of the people pay more in payroll taxes. It is \nwhen you put the full picture in front of people that you see the \nresults and the unfairness of this proposal. That is what reveals the \ntop 1 percent get 33 percent of the benefit but only pay 20 percent of \nFederal taxes. That is when you include the estate taxes, the payroll \ntaxes, the income taxes. But they don't want to talk about all the \ntaxes people pay. They just want to talk about income taxes because \nthat is the only thing that is being cut here--income taxes.\n  If we were going to be fair, we would be talking about all the taxes \npeople pay. When we look at all the taxes people pay, we find this tax \ncut measure: 33 percent of the benefit goes to the wealthiest 1 percent \nand the bottom 60 percent only get 15 percent of the benefit. They \njustify it saying, the top 1 percent pay more income taxes. Yes, they \ndo. Absolutely, I will stipulate to that. They do pay more income \ntaxes. But they don't pay 33 percent or 35 percent of all Federal \ntaxes. No. They pay about 20 percent of all Federal taxes. Yet they are \ngetting 33 percent of the benefit here. It is not fair.\n  That is why it flunks the fairness test. That is why it ought to be \nopposed. That is why we ought to defeat this, make it go back to \ncommittee and come out with something that is more fair to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  I represent a State where half the people make less than $20,000 a \nyear. They aren't going to get any benefit. They are not going to get \nany rate reduction--none, zero. Are they going to be surprised. The \nalternative minimum tax that currently affects 1.5 million people, when \nthis gets in place, it will affect nearly 40 million people. Boy, are \nthey going to be in for a big surprise.\n  I don't think this passes the fairness test.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the State this Senator represents, \nwe are of moderate means. We can't afford a lot of charts. So when \nSenator Byrd and this Senator come to the floor, we don't usually use \ncharts. We use whatever words we have.\n  I don't mean to make any big point of that. But sometimes I think \ncharts are helpful; sometimes I think they are not. I will say this. I \nagree with the Senator from North Dakota that the bill is not fair. I \nvoted for all the amendments which were defeated, but I do think the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley from the State of \nIowa, was very fair in the way he conducted the hearing. I didn't agree \nwith the result, but I thought his personal demeanor and the way he \nhandled himself in the general disposition of the tax bill--that the \nSenator himself was personally very fair, and I respect that. I wanted \nto so say.\n  I am baffled, also, by what the fairness concept is. One of the \nthings that amazes me--and I am here to talk for the marriage penalty, \nand I will--but when they talk about the rich, this is\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\nsort of a mantra: If the rich make a lot of money, then they should get \na tax credit because they did make a lot of money, which goes somehow \non the idea that they really struggled their way through life and stock \noptions and other things didn't help them.\n  The point, of course, is that during these last years, the pretax \nincome of the very wealthy has been so enormous that, obviously, they \nhave paid more taxes. But the reason is that their pretax income was so \nmuch higher. Even after they did pay their taxes, their resulting net \nincome was much higher than it had been previously. I think that is a \nvery important point.\n  I think another important point to be made, before I get to Senator \nConrad's amendment, is that one of the things that, it seems to me, \npeople have not focused on either in the press or, as I find it, in \ngeneral conversation, is that once the Senate and the Congress, with \nthe encouragement of the President, cut taxes to the extent that I \nbelieve we may, that is revenue forgone, not for a period of 10 years \nbut probably 10, 15, or 20 years.\n  There was a time when you could come in and say, well, we are at a \ncertain crisis and, for a certain reason, we have to raise taxes. I \nthink those times have passed. The American people are not going to \nstand for it if we lower their taxes and then come back in 3 years, as \nwe did after a year and a half with the balanced budget amendment with \nthe hospitals and other health care facilities, and say we made a \nmistake; we want to change the rules. The American people won't stand \nfor that, nor should they.\n  If we want to take a stand, now is the time we need to do that. The \nstand should be for fairness, and this bill doesn't meet any of those \ntests that I can find. I look upon the future of the country and upon \nthe future of my State, West Virginia, and I worry about whether or not \nwe are all going to make this. I think we are going to be back in very \nsubstantial double-digit deficits--triple digit, quadruple digit, \nmultiple digit. I also think that the markets are going to take a very \nbad signal from this. They are going to think Congress has acted, as we \nare acting, in a very hasty manner. The Joint Tax Committee hasn't even \nscored a lot of the costs of this bill, even as we discuss this matter.\n  The 20 hours is running, and we are going to vote on Monday, I \npresume. We really don't know what we are voting on. Very few Senators \noutside of the Finance Committee, and maybe not many on that committee, \nare enable to tell you that. So we have our votes and we think we are \nmaking substantial points, but most of this is flowing underneath the \nradar screen, under our feet, and the cost of it is going to be \nenormous.\n\n  I fear for that because eviscerating the Federal budget may be \nattractive if one wants to diminish the size and role of Government in \nAmerica, but there are, after all, some things the private sector \ncannot do and there are things the public sector does have to do--in \nMedicare, health care, FAA, FBI, and border control; all kinds of \nprograms are a part of that.\n  The Presiding Officer wants to see a third airport built in the State \nof Illinois. I happen to share his view. I also happen to share the \nview that there should be another runway built at O'Hare. Neither the \nPresiding Officer nor I are going to see that happen, unless there is \nmoney to make it happen.\n  So having divested myself of those particular thoughts, I want to say \nthat I strongly support the Conrad amendment and I think we need \nmarriage penalty relief now.\n  The proposal the Senator is making would make the marriage penalty \navailable to couples in 2002. The way we did it in the Finance \nCommittee was to make it available in 2006 and then, because of certain \nproblems of scoring, et cetera, it was brought back to 2005. The point \nis, we are playing a budget gimmick and we are withholding something \nwhich people all over this country--couples--think they absolutely are \ngoing to have as soon as this bill passes, if indeed it does.\n  So, in a sense, we are misleading them. We are grossly distorting \nwhat we have said to them, and they don't know it. It is only on \noccasions such as this when one has a chance to say it, but it is not \nusually reported because it is not considered newsworthy. But it will \nbe very newsworthy to the American people when they discover they do \nnot get marriage penalty tax relief until the year 2005. That is wrong.\n  On the other hand, we can change it by simply saying we will take the \ntwo top tax brackets and put those off a little bit and make it \navailable in the year 2002. That is what we promised we would do. That \nis what we campaigned on. That is what we discussed we would do, and we \nought to do that. That is what the Conrad amendment, in fact, does--\ncharts or no charts. It does that. I think that is right and fair.\n  I think the amendment is fiscally responsible because it is paid for; \nit is offset by delaying the reductions in the two top tax brackets. So \nwe are leveling with the American people, but we are also doing \nsomething that they expect to happen. They know gasoline prices are \ngoing up and we are not doing anything about that. We told them we were \ngoing to give them marriage penalty relief, and we are not going to do \nthat. Through this amendment, we can do that. I think it is something \nwe should proceed to expeditiously, so that if we take our word to the \nAmerican people about 2002 and marriage penalty tax relief, and doing \nit in a very good manner, then it would seem to me one would vote yes. \nIf one values that less than the so-called sanctity of the two top tax \nbrackets, then I suppose one would vote no. I intend to vote yes. I \nthink it is a rather easy decision.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nWest Virginia for his insight and tell him that apparently there is a \nlot of similarity in the thinking of the people of West Virginia and \nthe thinking of the people of Florida. Indeed, they take for granted \nthat if we are saying we are going to eliminate the marriage penalty so \nthat it doesn't penalize married people, so that it promotes family--\nthat if they take for granted that we are going to do that, they expect \nto have that tax benefit immediately instead of having to wait 5 years \ninto the future.\n  It is common sense to me, if we have made this promise to the people \nof America, and I have made this promise to the people of Florida, that \nwe should have that tax benefit--in other words, that you are not \npenalized in the Tax Code if you are married--instituted immediately.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is clearly a very important debate, \nand we very much want to reduce taxes for the American people. We want \nto do it fairly. Different Senators have a different perception of what \nfair is. It generally reflects their States. States are different. For \nsome, it reflects different ideological points of view. It is America. \nWe all have different points of view, and we are all trying to do the \nbest we can.\n  There is an old saying about statistics: Anybody can do what they \nwant with statistics. When Senators are arguing their points, they are \ngoing to find facts and figures and use statistics that make their case \nbetter, the basic problem being in most cases Senators do not give the \nfull picture because, correctly, they are advocating their point of \nview.\n  That must be very frustrating to the American public. Who is right? \nSomebody makes one set of claims; somebody else makes another set of \nclaims. The tax legislation is confusing enough as it is, but when \npeople hear different sets of numbers, they seem to be juxtaposed to \none another. Who is right?\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nIt is basically, for the reasons I indicated, because Senators tend to \nchoose statistics that make their case, but are not broad brush and do \nnot give a fair picture.\n  I begin with complimenting the Senator from North Dakota. I do not \nknow anybody in this body who has a greater command of the budget, the \neffects the different proposals in the budget have on the American \neconomy, tax distribution, and all the components that go into a \nbudget. He has charted us out in many respects, particularly in our \nconference luncheons on Tuesdays. We saw a lot of good charts. They are \nvery informative. It pretty much helps the debate. It is very hard for \npeople to hear statistics, and it is a little easier if they see \ncharts, particularly if they can see not just a bunch of numbers but a \ngraph which shows trends. The Senator from North Dakota has done a \nsuper job in helping to educate this body, and particularly the \nAmerican public.\n\n  I want to point out a little broader picture of the lay of the land. \nBasically, the statistics presented by the Senator from North Dakota \nabout the distributional effect of the bill before us, particularly the \ntop 1 percent--and his argument that the bill gives a greater \nproportion of benefits to the most wealthy compared with current law--\nis accurate if you include estate tax provisions. But there are lots of \nanalyses that show it is not accurate if you do not those provisions.\n  Most Senators do want to include Federal estate tax reform and/or \nrepeal. That is a fact. I know the Senator from North Dakota does.\n  Let me talk about the Joint Tax Committee analysis. They are the \ngroup we look to for honesty and integrity in this process. \nUnfortunately, they only do analyses for 5 years. They rank income \ncategories according to groups. Their analysis is a little different \nthan the so-called Citizens for Tax Justice, a privately funded \norganization, which tends to do analyses in quintiles, rather than \nincome brackets, like the Joint Tax Committee.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, taxpayers with incomes of \n$200,000 or more--that is the top 4 or 5 percent of taxpayers--do not \nreceive 33.5 percent of the benefits of this bill, as my good friend \nfrom North Dakota says. Instead, they will receive 22.5 percent of the \nbenefits of the bill. Those are taxpayers who pay about 32 percent of \nall Federal taxes, not just income taxes.\n  In fact, if you use the same analysis used by my good friend from \nNorth Dakota, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay 26 percent of all \nFederal taxes and would receive 19 percent of the tax cuts in the bill \nif you take out the estate tax provisions.\n  We have to be honest with ourselves: Are we or are we not going to \ninclude estate tax provisions? Those making the case that the \ndistributional effect helps upper income Americans more, are not saying \nthey prefer that because they favor Federal estate tax reform and/or \nrepeal.\n  I am pointing out that when you include Federal estate tax, the \nanalysis is more accurate, but almost every Senator wants to include \nestate tax reform and/or repeal. The results work out that way because \nclearly the most wealthy Americans get the benefit of estate tax reform \nand/or repeal.\n  In summation, the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to the \nanalysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice, are those with incomes of \n$373,000 or greater, and the argument is these taxpayers receive 33 \npercent of the benefits of the bill.\n  If you look again, more deeply at the argument, the analysis \npresented includes estimates of the distribution of the estate tax \nprovisions of the bill. Again, both parties, and nearly every Member of \nthis body, support estate tax reform and/or repeal, and no matter how \nyou do estate tax reform, nearly all the benefits go to the wealthiest \nAmericans, and that is why there is that result.\n  If I were writing this bill, it would be different. But I wanted to \nmake it clear that the statistics--if we are honest with ourselves, we \nhave to indicate whether or not we are for estate tax reform and/or \nrepeal, and if we are--and most Senators are--then the statistics tend \nto have the result that people who also want estate tax reform complain \nabout.\n  I hope that clarifies things a bit, so we at least know what we are \ndoing. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 659\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, first, I respect the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Grassley, and his ranking member, Senator Baucus, for \ncrafting the tax reduction bill. I know and understand in order to get \na complicated and very important bill through a committee that is \nevenly divided, many compromises must be made. I know Senator Grassley \nwould not have written the bill exactly this way, nor would Senator \nBaucus, had they been able to write it by themselves.\n  It is with great respect I offer my amendment that somewhat changes \nthe order of the bill, although it is not a huge deviation.\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\n  Looking at their timetable, I realize how difficult it was for them \nto say which tax relief comes in the early years and which comes in the \nlater years. When I decided I wanted to try to move the marriage \npenalty up, it was hard to find something to trade. It was hard to find \nthe offset. Everything in the early years is a very important tax cut \nand it represents very important tax relief for every American family.\n  I agree with Senator Conrad, we should bring the marriage penalty up \nearlier, but I disagree with his offset. I think the cut in the tax \nrates for every working American is the very highest priority. I am \ngoing to offer an amendment that would bring the marriage penalty \nrelief up to 2002, rather than beginning in 2006 as in the underlying \nbill. My offsets are the deductions for some of the education expenses \nbeing streamlined over a longer period of time.\n  In the bill before the Senate, the marriage penalty relief starts in \n2006 and ends in 2010; my marriage penalty standard deduction doubling \nstarts in 2002 and ends in 2008. It is fully effective in 2008. We have \nthe full doubling of the standard deduction by 2008, starting in 2002. \nIn order to achieve that, it was necessary to streamline the phasing in \nperiod of the education IRA and the education expenses that have the \nadded deduction. The deduction maximum for the education expenses under \nmy bill in 2002, would be $1,500; 2003, $2,000; 2004, $3,000; and in \n2005, $5,000. Under the underlying bill, all of the deductions end in \n2005. My amendment does the same.\n  There would be a phasing in difference and it does chip away at the \nphase-in of the deduction for education expenses. The tradeoff is we \ndouble the standard deduction, starting immediately in the 2002 year.\n  These are tough choices. There is no doubt about it. I understand \nthat. I have been working on marriage penalty relief for the last 4 \nyears. We have passed it in the Senate twice, but it was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. Today we have a chance to finally begin the process \nof relieving the marriage penalty.\n  The marriage penalty came about as an accident. Congress doesn't mean \nto tax married people more than two single people living together \nindividually would be taxed. But it did happen that the Tax Code has \nevolved so that there is not a doubling of the standard deduction when \ntwo people who are single get married; there is not a doubling of the \n15-percent bracket or the 28-percent bracket or the 33-percent bracket \nor the 39.6-percent bracket or any other bracket. There is no doubling.\n  In the underlying bill, the relief for the 15-percent bracket, the \nfull doubling, which gives every working American that doubling \ncapability, is there. The doubling of the standard deduction is there. \nBut it doesn't start until 2006.\n  I am trying to double the standard deduction beginning in 2002, to at \nleast start the relief from the marriage penalty tax.\n\n  Fifty million couples in this country are affected by the marriage \npenalty. We received a census report in the last 10 years, and we see a \ndramatic 77-percent rise in the number of single people who are living \ntogether, unmarried. I am not trying to tell anybody how to live. But I \nthink the marriage penalty has something to do with that. I have had \npeople tell me they are delaying getting married until we fix the \nmarriage penalty. Whether or not that should be a factor is not for us \nto judge, but nevertheless we should not have a Tax Code that penalizes \npeople who get married.\n  Generally, people who get married need more help, not less, because \ntheir expenses are more. They may have to have a house on which they \nwant to make a downpayment, whereas before they lived in an apartment. \nThey may need another car. There are any number of added expenses. Of \ncourse, if the couple starts having children, we know there are more \nexpenses.\n  We want to encourage the family. It is the stability in this country \nthat gives people the infrastructure they need to get through life. We \nwant to encourage that. We certainly don't want to do something in \ngovernment policy that discourages families.\n  I understand how hard it was for the committee to make the tough \nchoices, but I address the marriage penalty relief earlier in the bill. \nAlthough I like all of the education deductions, I phase them in at a \nslower rate in order to move the doubling of the standard deduction up \nto the front.\n  I think the significant tax relief that the American people are going \nto get from this bill is a tribute to those who wrote it and to the \nPresident of the United States, who made it his priority. I think it is \nvery important we give tax relief. I am so pleased we are giving tax \nrelief in the form of a tax bracket reduction for every single working \nAmerican. That is why I could not go along with Senator Conrad's \napproach to doubling the standard deduction and relieving the marriage \npenalty in lieu of the rate cuts. Single people get the rate cut and \nmarried people get the rate cut and that is the way it should \nbe. Everyone should get the biggest tax relief, and that will come from \nthe rate cuts. So I would not put the marriage penalty in front of the \nrate cuts. But I do put it right after the rate cuts, which is why I \nhave chosen to go a different route from Senator Conrad.\n\n  I am very proud that we will be giving a rate reduction to every \nsingle working American. I am proud that we are going to take away the \nonerous burden of the death tax so a family-owned business or a family-\nowned farm or family-owned ranch will not have to be sold, putting all \nthe people who work for that family-owned business out of work, because \npassing our family businesses from generation to generation will keep \nsmall business strong.\n  It is small business that is the economic engine of America. It is \nnot big international conglomerates that are the economic engine of \nAmerica. I want to preserve our family-owned businesses and farms and \nranches as much as we can. The elimination of the death tax is the best \nway to preserve family-owned businesses and farms and ranches. All the \npeople who work for those family-owned businesses should have job \nstability and not worry about being taken over by some big \ninternational conglomerate that is going to eliminate their jobs. I \ncertainly favor the elimination of the death tax.\n  Doubling the child tax credit is another facet of this bill that I \nsupport fully. Everyone who has children knows how expensive it is to \ndo for them all the things that you want to do, that would give them a \nbetter chance: The music lessons, the dancing lessons, the clothes, the \nsoccer uniforms, the baseball uniforms--all the things you want to give \nthem so they learn team spirit and sportsmanship, seeing what talent \nthey might have and nurturing that. All those things cost money. We \nknow that. We want to give relief through the child tax credit.\n  The bottom line is this is really a good bill. It is a good bill \nbecause it gives tax relief to every working American: Single, married, \nparents, not. It gives relief to every working American, and it \npromotes job stability. That is important.\n  My amendment is not meant to in any way say the committee did not do \nits job. The committee did a great job. I just want to make it a little \nbetter. I hope we can bring the marriage penalty up and streamline the \neducation deductions and thereby add more relief from the marriage \npenalty and try to increase the capability for those in our country who \nhave chosen not to get married because they really need that extra \n$1,400 a year that they get.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all I thank the Senator from \nTexas for supporting the fundamental idea of moving up marriage penalty \nrelief. I would just differentiate our proposals in this way.\n  The proposal I am offering would give the full marriage penalty \nrelief starting immediately. The Senator from Texas would provide the \nrelief starting immediately but phase it in over an extended period of \ntime; we would not get the full phase-in until 2008. That would just be \non one of the provisions dealing with marriage penalty. As I understand \nit, she does not deal with the other provisions at all.\n  In addition, there is a difference in the pay-for. The pay-for on our \nside is to ask those at the highest income levels, the highest tax \nbrackets, to simply\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\nhave their tax cut deferred for a number of years. We get to the same \nlevel over the period of the 10 years in tax rates, tax brackets. We \nask the fewer than 1 percent of the people who are in the very top tax \nbracket and the approximately 2 percent of the people who are in the \nnext tax bracket to defer additional reductions so we can provide \nmarriage penalty relief starting immediately.\n  The Senator from Texas has a totally different pay-for. She goes \nafter student loan money; she goes after the education IRA money; she \ngoes after the alternative minimum tax money. I do not think that is \nthe way we want to pay for this. I don't think we want to pay for \nmoving up marriage penalty relief by going after the student loan \ninterest money. I don't think we want to pay for marriage penalty \nrelief by going after the education IRA money that allows people to \nsave for the education of their children. I don't think we want to go \nafter the alternative minimum tax money that we already know is totally \ninadequate in this bill, and under this bill we are going to go from \n1.5 million people being affected by the alternative minimum tax to \nnearly 40 million people, nearly 1 in every 4 taxpayers who think they \nare going to get a tax cut and are in for a big surprise: They are \ngoing to get a tax increase under this bill.\n  I hope Members will look very carefully at the fundamental \ndifferences between what I am offering to speed up marriage penalty \nrelief--do it immediately, do it now--versus what the Senator from \nTexas is proposing, which is to start now but to dribble it out until \nthe year 2008.\n  Is the Senator from Michigan seeking time?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan. Then I announce my \nintention to yield 10 minutes or whatever he will consume to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend our Democratic leader from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad, for his outstanding advocacy for fairness \nin this tax bill, for fiscal responsibility, for really coming to the \nheart of the issue before us, and that is: How do we make sure the bulk \nof the tax relief in this bill goes to hard-working middle-class \nfamilies, goes to the people who are working hard every day and need \nthe relief in order to be able to translate that into more \nopportunities to put money into those items that are important for \ntheir families? How do we make this more fair for the majority of \nAmericans?\n  I rise as someone who was a Member of the House of Representatives \nfor 4 years, who supported the elimination of what is called the \nmarriage tax penalty. I was a cosponsor of the Republican bill in the \nHouse of Representatives and voted consistently to eliminate this \npenalty for reasons that have been raised by colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. It makes no sense whatsoever for us to tell a married \ncouple that they will somehow be penalized under the Tax Code for being \nmarried. That makes no sense. It affects over 25 million couples in \nthis country.\n  At a time when we are saying an important value for our country is to \nbe supporting marriage and family, and to make sure we are giving every \nopportunity for couples to succeed and families to succeed, it is \ncrazy, in my opinion, and makes no sense whatsoever, to have this \nprovision in place. It should have been done away with a long time ago.\n  My colleague from North Dakota is saying it is time to do it right \naway. By 2002 we need to fully provide relief for couples. We ought to \nsay it is time to end it. It is past time to end it. We ought not say \nto them we are going to phase it in over several years, but we are \ngoing to place families and couples as a top priority and end this \npenalty now.\n  I think it is fair to say to the fewer than 3 percent of the \ntaxpayers at the highest levels, we are going to ask you to delay full \ntax relief for yourself, those who have done extremely well. We want \nthem to do well, but certainly those who are best able to wait awhile \nfor a delay in their full tax relief, we are going to ask them, the \nfewer than 3 percent: Delay, in order for over 25 million couples in \nthis country to receive the relief that is long overdue. It is an issue \nof fairness.\n\n  I believe that when we look at what we are talking about in terms of \nthe number of people who would benefit by this amendment, and those who \nare asking for a small delay, it is a question of fairness.\n  I also say to my colleague from Texas on the other side of the aisle, \nwho spoke so eloquently, while I share her desire to eliminate the \nmarriage tax penalty, I am very concerned about the tradeoff that she \nis suggesting we make because another important value for all of us, \nand for our families, is the ability to educate our children, to be \nable to send them to college. I am very concerned about trading off the \nmarriage tax penalty and paying for it through a lessening of student \nloan interest deductions or the education IRA because, again, this is \nabout how do we best support families who are having to make tough \nchoices every day.\n  Let's not penalize them for being married. Let's make sure they have \nevery opportunity under the Tax Code to be able to send their children \nto college, to job training, to be able to give their children every \nopportunity to succeed, and to be educated adults.\n  So that tradeoff does not make sense. What does make sense is \neliminating the marriage tax penalty now. We can do that this next \nyear. We need to do that now. Families have waited long enough. Couples \nhave waited long enough. It seems reasonable to ask for a small delay \nfor less than 3 percent of the taxpayers in order to allow the majority \nof couples in this country to be able to get the relief that is long \noverdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the time.\n  This issue, as it has been described, is about the marriage tax \npenalty. There cannot be anyone left in the Senate who does not \nunderstand this issue. We have debated it and debated it and debated \nit. Everyone stands up, almost automatically, in the Senate, and says: \nI am for getting rid of the marriage tax penalty. Count me in. I want \nto vote for getting rid of the marriage tax penalty.\n  We have a tax bill that has now been brought to the floor of the \nSenate, and it says: Do you know what. We have written a bill that gets \nrid of the marriage tax penalty. It is similar to an employee being \ncalled into an office and the employer says: Good news. Do you know \nwhat. We are giving you a raise.\n  Then the employee says: When does this raise start?\n  The employer says: 5 years from now. But we aren't going to give it \nto you all at once. We'll phase it in. It starts in 5 years, and it \ntakes 8 years to get the full amount.\n  Look, if we want to get rid of the marriage tax penalty as we have \nadvertised for so many years, why would we not decide that as a part of \nthis tax bill we are going to give real tax relief right now to middle-\nincome taxpayers who are paying a marriage tax penalty? Why would we \nwait some 5 years?\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, in his proposal in \nwhich he says, let's make the marriage tax relief available now--and, \nincidentally, that is tax relief that principally affects middle-income \ntaxpayers who have a penalty under the marriage tax--let me ask him how \nhe would pay for moving up that tax relief so it becomes effective next \nyear, almost immediately.\n\n  How does the Senator pay for his amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The pay-for in my amendment is to delay the rate cuts for \nthe top two rates, the 39.6-percent rate and the 36-percent rate.\n  As the Senator knows, there are about 3 percent of the American \npeople who are in those very top rates. We still give them the full \nrate reduction included in this legislation; we just delay it so that \nwe can affect a significant number of people who are in the marriage \npenalty situation. As you know, there are 50 million couples who\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nhave filed a joint return for the most recent year for which the full \ndetails are available, and 25 million of them experienced the marriage \npenalty. That is 25 million couples. That is 50 million people.\n  The legislation I am offering says: Let's allow those people to have \nrelief from the marriage penalty and do so immediately, and have the \nfull benefits of this legislation that addresses the marriage penalty \neffective in the next year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask an additional question, Mr. President, my \nunderstanding is that the beginning of tax relief for the top 1 percent \nof the income earners in this country starts immediately, but the \nbeginning of trying to deal with the marriage tax penalty starts about \n5 years from now. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. Actually, overnight they changed it. It was not \ngoing to take affect for 5 years. In other words, this chart says, \nmarriage penalty relief for middle-income taxpayers was going to be \ndelayed until 2006; it did not do anything for 5 years. Now it has been \nchanged and moved up 1 year. So it does not do anything for 4 years in \nterms of marriage penalty relief.\n  What we are saying is, let's do it next year. Let's make it a \npriority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One additional question.\n  When will the marriage tax relief be fully effective?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Under the bill that is before us, not until 2008. Under \nmy proposal, there would not be any phase-in. We would do it all the \nfirst year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know my colleague has studied economics. I have studied \neconomics and actually taught a little economics but was able to \novercome that experience.\n  When you study economics, you will learn about John Maynard Keynes' \nsaying: In the long run, we're all dead. Right. So it is interesting \nthis tax bill says: Look, here is what we are going to do. We are going \nto get rid of the marriage tax penalty, and we are going to do this and \nthat and the other thing; and then you look at the fine print and find \nout that for the marriage tax penalty, they do not start getting rid of \nit until 2004 or 2005. I guess you say now it has been altered. It does \nnot complete until 2008.\n  So we are really talking about the long run, aren't we? But, yes, if \nyou happen to be earning $10 million a year in income, you are going to \nget immediate tax relief by a rate reduction right at the start. Right \nat the get-go, right at the starting line, you at the top are going to \nget a rate reduction. But there is not enough money to provide relief \nfor the marriage tax penalty right away, so that is deferred 4 years, 6 \nyears, 8 years, or, as Keynes would say, in the long run.\n  One wonders if there is not a short run and a priority that allows us \nto say, look, the hard working families who are paying a marriage tax \npenalty, shouldn't they be moved right to the front of the line.\n\n  Almost everyone jumps up instantly around here the minute you mention \nthe marriage tax penalty and say: I am for getting rid of it. Count me \nin. I want to vote right now--except this tax bill does not do that.\n  Remember, John Mitchell once said: Don't listen to what we say. Just \nwatch what we do. That might be good advice for this marriage tax issue \nas well. People say: We are going to get rid of the marriage tax \npenalty. Not now we aren't, not unless we adopt this amendment offered \nby Senator Conrad.\n  Of course we ought to adopt this amendment. Of course this is the \nright priority. Senator Conrad is not saying everyone should not get a \ntax cut. He is not saying the top rates should not get a tax cut. That \nis not what he is saying at all. He is saying, the priority ought to be \nto provide marriage tax penalty relief now--not in 2004 or 2005, not in \n2008, but now, for the American people.\n  That makes eminent good sense to me. He is not suggesting that \nfurther rate reductions should not occur at the top level. He is not \nsuggesting we defer tax relief for anyone else up or down the chain. He \nis simply saying, use, as a priority, the money that he has in his \namendment to provide marriage tax penalty relief now.\n  If everyone in the Senate is true to the votes they have cast in the \nlast 3 or 4 years on this subject, Senator Conrad will receive 100 \nvotes for this amendment. If so, I will congratulate him and say: Well \ndone. I hope when the vote is cast, we will have people voting the way \nthey have voted in the past 3 or 4 years on this issue to say: Let's \nprovide marriage tax penalty rate relief right now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think it is important to point out the differences \nbetween my amendment and the amendment of the Senator from Texas. As \nyou know, in terms of marriage penalty relief, there are two \nprovisions. One is to double the standard deduction for a married \ncouple from what is provided single taxpayers. The second is to deal \nwith the fix on the 15-percent bracket so that we also are providing \nrelief that way.\n  The Senator from Texas would start the standard deduction relief in \n2002, which is more quickly than what is provided for in the underlying \nlegislation, but she would then string it out to 2008. Her amendment \ndoes nothing to speed up the fix on the 15-percent bracket. There is no \nimprovement there.\n  My amendment takes both provisions that are designed to deal with the \nmarriage penalty and puts them into place next year and pays for it by \ndeferring the reductions for the very top brackets, the top 3 percent \nof earners in the country. They get their full relief, but it is \ndelayed so that we can give relief to 25 million couples--50 million \npeople--who are affected by the marriage penalty.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the reason I mentioned that everyone in \nthe Senate supports this, no one stands up in the Senate these days and \nsays: I think it is perfectly appropriate for us to have a penalty in \nthe Tax Code for married couples. I don't know of anyone who supports \nthat. The question remaining for the Senate is, Shall we fix that now \nor shall we wait until later? Senator Conrad says: Let's fix it now. \nLet's make adjustments to this proposal that is on the floor. If we all \nagree that the marriage tax penalty should be fixed, the Senator says, \nlet's fix it now rather than much later.\n  That makes sense to me. I am pleased he offered the amendment. I will \nbe pleased to vote for it. I hope every one of my colleagues will do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I find it a little bit interesting. I \nwill be very brief.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \ndoes my side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-three minutes, 19 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I find it very interesting that a couple of the \nproponents on the Democrat side are saying, let's repeal the marriage \npenalty relief, when they had a chance to do that last year on July 21 \nand they voted no. The Senate passed, by a vote of 60-34, a bill to \neliminate the marriage penalty. We did basically the proposal that my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Conrad, is promoting. We passed it. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton vetoed it.\n  It is interesting to note--and I will insert in the Record the vote \non that--but the Senator from North Dakota voted no last year on July \n21.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from North Dakota voted against that proposal \nbecause it didn't fix the marriage penalty. We had an alternative \nproposal that gave couples the choice. The only way to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have control of the time. The Senator \ncan make a point, not a speech.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I may conclude, the only way to eliminate all of the \n60 places the Tax Code imposes the marriage penalty is to give couples \na choice. That is what I supported.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to correct my colleague, the amendment he \nhas proposed today doesn't fix it for every category. It does what we \ndid last year, in that we expanded the 15-percent bracket. We doubled \nthe deduction.\n  My point is, there is a real inconsistency between the arguments made \non the floor today and the amendment they propose on the floor today \nand the position they took last year.\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\n  Last year we had a chance to eliminate the marriage penalty and my \ncolleagues voted no. Now they are proposing basically the same \namendment we passed and sent to the President. They are trying to put \nit on this bill. They had a chance to pass it last year and have it \nbecome law. That is my point. I wish they would have had this position \nlast year.\n  One other final comment: I wish we could do more on the marriage \npenalty in this bill today. And we could have, if we had $1.6 trillion \nto work with. The same colleagues who say we want to do more on the \nmarriage penalty were the same ones saying we want less of a tax cut. \nNow they are saying, we want to get rid of the marriage penalty. But \nlast year, unfortunately, they voted in opposition to repeal the \nmarriage penalty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the material to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Rollcall Vote No. 226, July 21, 2000\n\n                     (H.R. 4810 Conference Report)\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Boxer\n     Inouye\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Murray\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will make some general comments to help \nput this debate in context.\n  First of all, under this bill, who are the winners and who don't win \nquite so much? Under this bill, the big winners are married couples \nwith kids. By far, they receive a greater share of the benefits of this \nbill, not only absolutely but proportionately.\n  Who does not do quite so well? Singles. Single taxpayers do not do \nnearly as well in receiving benefits under this bill. Who else does not \ndo quite so well under this bill? The elderly. The elderly do not do \nquite as well compared with married couples under this bill. Who else? \nStudents. Students do not do quite so well compared with married \ncouples under this bill.\n  In the broad brush of things, the bill already gives very significant \ntax relief, in fact, disproportionate tax relief, to married couples \nalready.\n  We on the floor can decide to do still more. But if we do, it is at \nthe expense of others. The others will necessarily be those nonmarried. \nWho are the nonmarrieds by definition? They are singles. And some of \nthem are elderly and some are students. So it will be a shift away from \npeople already not receiving nearly as many benefits absolutely and \nproportionately as married couples. That is a decision we can make \nhere. Life is full of decisions. But that is the effect of what these \namendments do.\n  I mention one group: students. The amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Texas will cut education to help married couples even more. These \nare important provisions. Let me mention what they are: expansion of \neducation savings accounts, increasing contributions from $500 to \n$2,000 and also permitting withdrawal of funds for K-12 expenses; that \nis, kindergarten through high school, elementary and secondary \nexpenses. That would be delayed under the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas.\n  What else? The bill already eliminates the 60-month limit on \ndeductibility of student loan interest. That is a big benefit for \nstudents. Students graduate from college, most have student loans. I \nhave forgotten the figure. The average student loan is in the \nneighborhood of $15,000. It is not right that we cut off interest \ndeductibility on those loans after 60 months. This bill says, OK, we \nare going to eliminate that 60 months. You can deduct the interest on \nstudent loans after 60 months. That is in the bill.\n  The Senator from Texas, in order to pay for more relief to married \ncouples, eliminates that 60-month deletion. It is still current law, up \nto 60 months.\n  In addition, the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas would \nreduce significantly the above-the-line deduction for college tuition \nexpenses of up to $3,000 in 2002 and 2003, and under the bill, above \nthe line. She would limit it also for 2004 and 2005.\n  I think for the purposes of the Senate, it is important to know that \nthe bill, as I said, doesn't give a lot of help to students. It is fair \nto married couples already. I don't think it is a good idea to take \neven more away from students in education expenses generally and shift \nit over to married couples.\n  I might also add, generally, there have been comments about this \nbill. People take potshots at the provisions of the bill dealing with \nsolving the marriage penalty. Let me remind all of us again that this \nis the context of what is going on here, so we don't get wrapped around \nthe axle and forget the bigger picture.\n  Currently, more taxpayers today receive a marriage bonus than are \ninflicted a marriage penalty. Many more American taxpayers get a \nbenefit under the tax law on account of being married than they receive \na penalty on account of being married. What am I saying? American \ntaxpayers, as couples, where the income of one spouse is, say, at least \n60 percent of the income of the other spouse, receive a bonus because \ntheir incomes are combined. That automatically gives them a bonus \ncompared to filing separately.\n  The couples who receive a penalty today--not always--tend to be \ncouples where one spouse earns approximately the same income, within \nabout 20 or 30 percent.\n  There is a marriage penalty, no doubt about it. We should do all we \ncan to fix it, and we will. We are moving in that direction. But as we \nmove in that direction, I remind my colleagues that we can't do \neverything at the same time. We know that is an impossibility. We have \na limit here of about $1.35 trillion over 11 years. That is a limit. We \nwould like to repeal the marriage penalty. We would like to give all \nthe money back to the taxpayers so taxpayers don't have to pay income \ntaxes. We want to have everything.\n  But life is choices. We in the committee, working together, have made \nchoices that are a tradeoff of different requests by Senators telling \nus what they want in this bill. If you put that together, we have tried \nto fashion a marriage penalty provision that is geared toward middle-\nincome taxpayers. That is why the provision is doubling the standard \ndeduction for married couples and also doubling the 15-percent bracket \namount for married couples. We could have done more. We could have gone \nto upper brackets, more wealthy Americans. We wanted the distribution \nto be fairer to low- and middle-income Americans. That is why this is \nin the bill.\n  I urge Senators to remember we can't just take these amendments in \nisolation. They are in context. They are in the context of the bill, of \nlarger issues and of choices we have to make today, knowing that \ntomorrow, next month, in future years, we will make other choices and \nwe will be able to make up for what we may not have done today. We will \ndo what the American people want on the basis of trying to put these \npieces together in a reasonable manner.\n  This provision also has been sharply criticized by Senators who say \nit takes effect later, not right away. It has been ridiculed by those \nsaying: ``Now you have it, now you don't have it''; it's a shell game. \nThose Senators conveniently don't point out other provisions in the \nbill that do take effect right away, which they support and which are \nexpensive. They make it more difficult for everything in this bill.\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\n  One is the creation of a 10-percent bracket, which is effective \nretroactively, I might add, to January 1 of this year. That in and of \nitself costs about $425 billion. That is not small change. That is \nimmediate tax relief. A large percentage of the taxpayers who are in \nthe 15-percent bracket will get that benefit. It is effective now and \nit helps the distribution for middle and lower income Americans. It is \na very positive provision, which I know the Senators who complained \nabout the delay of the marriage penalty really like--this 10 \npercent. They don't talk about it. You have to look at the whole bill \nand, I might add, too, the distributional effect of this bill is better \nsignificantly than the House-passed bill. It is better significantly \nthan the proposals offered by the President.\n\n  I believe when you add it all together, it is a bill that we can--a \nlot of us but not all--support. The marriage penalty provision is not \nperfect. I wish it were made effective earlier. I wish it could apply \nto all the marriage penalty provisions that are currently in the code, \nand they number about 65. This only deals with about 3 or 4 of them. \nThe EITC provision I know the Senator from North Dakota likes. That is \nreally good. But we don't deal with the other roughly 58 marriage \npenalties in the code, which have a little less effect because we don't \nhave the money to eliminate them. They are a little less politically \ndemanding than the ones with which we dealt with in this bill.\n  I respect my colleagues for their amendments. I remind them there is \nalready a disproportionate relief for married couples in this bill, \ncompared with singles, elderly, and students. I don't know if we want \nto make that worse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for those who made inquiries to both \nCloakrooms as to when we are going to vote, the Senator from Montana, \nthe manager of the bill, spoke on the time allotted. Senator Conrad has \n16 minutes left on his side and Senator Hutchison has 40 minutes left. \nIf all time is used without the managers using more time off the bill, \nwe would vote at approximately 4:50 or 4:55. Just so people know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico off \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley. First, I want \nto take a couple of minutes on history. Some Senators, clearly led by \nSenator Byrd, have spoken to the issue of should we be reducing taxes \nin a reconciliation bill. I want to remind everyone that Congress \npassed, in 1974, a new law which had to do with the congressional \nbudget process. I want to quote from it and tell you three historical \nevents which would indicate that we are doing what we have done on a \nnumber of occasions with reference to the Budget Act and reconciliation \ninstructions that apply to taxes.\n  First of all, 1 week ago today, exactly, this body of Senators \nadopted a fiscal year 2002 budget resolution. Now, as in many things, \nall Senators didn't agree. But that resolution, with an instruction to \nreduce taxes by a total of $1.25 trillion over 10 years, with $100 \nbillion available for the first 2 years to be spent by the Committee on \nTax Relief has to do with stimulating the economy for a total of $1.35 \ntrillion over 11 years. Within 1 week, the Committee on Finance--again \nin a bipartisan manner--I might say to the Senate, you might recall \nthat the budget resolution, with an instruction on the taxes, passed \nthe senate with 15 Democrats voting along with all Republicans, except \n2. So it was a very bipartisan instruction to reduce taxes.\n  Within 1 week, the Committee on Finance has complied with this \nreconciliation instruction and has presented to the full Senate a bill \nthat reduces revenues or increases outlays for a total of $1.347 \ntrillion over the next 11 years. Remarkably good work. Obviously, when \nyou set these kinds of annual and multiyear mandates with reference to \ntaxes, you can't do everything you want, and you can't do every one as \nclean as you would like. But the policies included in this bill will be \ndiscussed shortly.\n  Let me first talk about the criticism we should not be using \nreconciliation, that is, the fast-track procedures permitted under law, \nfor tax reductions.\n  First, I want to read the Budget Act of 1974:\n\n       Inclusion of Reconciliation Directives in Concurrent \n     Resolutions on the Budget.--A concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for any fiscal year, to the extent necessary to \n     effectuate the provisions and requirements of such resolution \n     shall--(1) specify the total amount by which revenues are to \n     be changed and direct that the committees having jurisdiction \n     do determine and recommend changes--\n\n  To accomplish that--\n  Continuing to read:\n\n     and resolutions to accomplish a change of such amount to \n     comply with the policies of the resolution.\n\n  I note this section of the act says ``changes.'' It does not say that \nthe only thing reconciliation can be used for is to raise taxes, nor \ndoes it say the only thing it can be used for is to cut taxes. It \nsimply says ``effectuate'' the policies of the underlying resolution.\n  Over time, yes, we were faced with deficits and used reconciliation \nfor tax increase instructions and for spending cut instructions, but \ntimes have changed, and since fiscal year 1997, budget resolutions have \npassed the Senate that have considered tax reconciliation bills on \nthree separate occasions. One was signed by President Clinton, one was \nvetoed by President Clinton, and one was never presented to him because \nhe said he would veto it. But the Senate and the Congress, after a \nconference, actually passed tax bills that were the result of an \ninstruction in a budget resolution that such be done to carry out the \npolicies of the budget resolution.\n  There are some who say they wish it were not so. I do not know if I \nam prepared to debate that today. All I am prepared to say is those who \ncriticize it should know it has its genesis in this Budget Act which \nwas passed by all Senators, except one, voting for it years ago. I have \nread the operative language, and I am absolutely comfortable with the \nfact that we have not in any way exceeded what the Senate of the United \nStates has heretofore indicated can be done in a budget resolution \nregarding reduction of taxes by an instruction.\n  In the FY 1997 budget debate, on a rollcall vote, the Senate \nestablished the precedent for including tax cut reconciliation \ninstructions in a budget resolution under expedited procedures of the \nBudget Act.\n  That year the Congress presented the President with a $122.5 billion \nsix-year tax cut reconciliation bill. The President vetoed that \nreconciliation bill.\n  In the FY 1998 budget debate, the Congress adopted instructions for a \ntax cut reconciliation bill for $85 billion over a 5-year period. The \nFinance Committee and the Congress complied with the instruction. The \nPresident signed that tax cut reconciliation bill.\n  In the FY 1999 budget debate there were no reconciliation \ninstructions.\n  In the FY 2000 budget debate, a 10-year reconciliation tax cut of \n$778 billion was included in the budget resolution. The Finance \nCommittee and the Congress once again complied with the instruction, \nand the President vetoed that tax cut reconciliation bill.\n  Finally in last year's budget debate the budget resolution permitted \ntwo separate tax cut reconciliation bills. The Senate considered and \npassed the first tax cut reconciliation bill, but it was never \npresented to the President. The second tax cut reconciliation bill was \nnever considered.\n  The bottom line--there is nothing untoward about a tax cut \nreconciliation bill. There is nothing unprecedented about a tax cut \nreconciliation bill. Indeed, I believe the Budget Act is working as it \nshould--it permits Congress to work its will and to implement its \nfiscal policy once it adopts a budget resolution.\n  What is unprecedented is a budget surplus estimate of $5.6 trillion \nover the next decade.\n  Even when with the tax reductions included in this bill, total taxes \nwill still grow annually nearly 4.3 percent over the next decade. Total \ntaxes will still increase from $2.135 trillion today to over $3.256 \ntrillion in FY 2011. We will collect over $26.6 trillion in taxes these \nnext 10 years even with the tax cuts included in this reconciliation \nbill.\n  Federal revenues as a percentage of the size of the economy, will \nonly modestly be reduced from its historic high\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\ntoday of 20.7 percent to 19.2 percent in 2011.\n  Finally, all tax provisions are fully phased in by 2011. Those who \ncome here to the floor and suggest somehow the tax cuts are going to \nexplode over the next 10 years after 2011, are misleading.\n  When fully phased in 2011--everything--the tax reductions in 2011 \nwill be about $185 billion in that year. Number games can be easily \nplayed.\n  Yes, extending the fully phased in tax cuts in this bill over the \nperiod 2011-2022--20 years from now--could mean $2 trillion in tax cuts \nbeyond the $1.350 trillion in this bill. That is not an explosion, that \nis simple arithmetic.\n  I want to quickly go through what is in this bill as I see it. I \ncompliment the Republicans and the Democrats who got it through \ncommittee and are in the Chamber defending it.\n  First, retroactive to January 1, 2001, it creates a new 10-percent \nbracket for the first $12,000 of adjusted gross income for couples.\n  It reduces all marginal rates effective January 2, 2002. The top rate \nis reduced to 36 percent by 2007. For those who think that is done \nquickly and costs an enormous amount in the early years, it is not so.\n  It doubles the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000 over 10 years and \nmakes the child credit generously refundable. I repeat, it makes the \nchild credit generously refundable.\n  There were many in our respective States who heard the first tax \nproposals, and they did not have any refundability for the tax credit \nand indicated that for poor States and populations in poor States, it \nmight be better if we had refundability. However that occurred, I thank \nthe committee in behalf of my State. It is important we have that.\n  We are debating marriage penalty relief, whether we should do more or \nchange it, but it sets a standard deduction for couples at two times \nthe single level. It sets the 15-percent bracket for couples at two \ntimes the single level.\n  Incidentally, it also increases the EITC, earned-income tax credit. \nSome thought over time that was not a good approach to tax law, but it \nhas been increased all the way up, in some instances, to as high as \n$35,000. It includes, with which everybody should be pleased, a $33 \nbillion educational tax relief that is spread throughout this bill, and \nit reduces the estate tax over time, not immediately but it increases \nthe exemptions rather quickly in increments of a million dollars, and \nover a full 2011 cycle it will eliminate the tax; it will impose a \ncapital gains tax of sorts on the beneficiaries of large estates.\n\n  I single out Senator Kyl of Arizona for his complete commitment and \ndedication to changing this estate tax. I can see as a member of the \ncommittee where Senator Kyl has had a very big impact on the committee.\n  The next item is IRA tax relief. Everybody has become familiar with \npensions and IRAs. It includes a $40 billion increase in the tax \nreductions that can occur by changes in pensions and IRA relief. It is \na pretty good law.\n  It changes the alternative minimum exemption by $2,000 single and \n$4,000 joint. It obviously does not do the entire alternative minimum \nadjustment necessary, but it does more than many people thought \nbecause, indeed, it does not affect any more people and starts changing \na little bit with reference to the alternative minimum as it applies to \nothers rather than those who would have been affected by this \nlegislation.\n  In essence, it makes the Tax Code more progressive. That is difficult \nfor some to believe in a tax package that also reduces marginal rates \nfrom top to bottom. Every marginal rate will be reduced. It makes the \nTax Code more progressive. Wealthy taxpayers will pay a larger share of \nthe income tax than they do now.\n  Whoever wants to argue about whether the top levels should have had a \nmarginal rate cut, the entire package is more progressive, and when you \nare finished and add up the income tax, the higher tax payers will pay \na bigger percentage now than they were paying before the marginal rates \nwere reduced.\n  I close by talking about my State. I have done my best, with the best \npeople I have, to give a rough estimate of what happens to people in \nNew Mexico with this bill.\n  First, every New Mexico taxpayer gets a tax cut. In our little State, \n539,000 families filed returns; 113,000 small businesses; 534,000 \nchildren will be eligible for the child tax credit. That has been \ndoubled and made refundable over time; 304,000 couples in New Mexico \nwho file jointly will benefit over time from the marriage penalty \nrelief, and 179,000 families claimed the earned-income credit. With the \nexpansion of the family earnings up to $35,100, they will be able to \nclaim this credit. It is a major help to the families in New Mexico who \nare not in the high brackets, and since we have so many in the middle- \nand low-income brackets, this bill, because of the bipartisan nature of \nit, as I see it, has taken a giant step to be helpful to them.\n  I close by saying it was not too long ago that a new President was \nsworn in and went to the White House. He said: I am going to try to \nkeep my campaign commitments. One of his commitments was he was going \nto reduce taxes. He was talking about a dollar number of $1.6 trillion. \nSome people think that was over 11 years, some over 10 years. Some \nthink it was really $1.3 trillion adjusted for something.\n  In any event, I say, Mr. President--not the Presiding Officer, but \nPresident Bush down the road on Pennsylvania Avenue--when this finally \nbecomes law, and it will not be too long when the House and Senate get \nthis bill and do their final work, you can look at the American people \nand say: Here is another commitment made, a commitment that I achieved. \nWith the help of Congress, and in this case bipartisan out of \ncommittee, hopefully bipartisan when we pass it, we have said to the \nPresident: We agree with you. The commitment to give back some of this \nenormous surplus to the American people so that it is not on the table \nto spend but, rather, it is committed back to their pockets, to their \npocketbooks, to their checking accounts, that will have been achieved.\n  I believe there will be plenty of money to pay down the debt in about \nas rapid a fashion as we can, and I believe there will be about a $500 \nbillion to $600 billion contingency fund over this decade that can \nstill be used in addition to what we plan for tax cuts and what we plan \nfor the appropriations process.\n  For those who had in mind large new programs for the Federal \nGovernment and had their eye on this surplus, what we are saying is we \nare not going to wait to deal tax relief at the bottom of the deck of \ncards.\n  We are going to deal, then, right upfront. We will say to people who \npay: This Government receives more than it needs; we will give it back \nto you over time. That means it won't be there on the table, as we look \nat budgets, to spend on just anything because we will have spent it on \na very good purpose; that is, we will have given it back to the \nAmerican people to spend, for them to plan, for them to use.\n  It is a pretty good conclusion to a very difficult budget process \nwhich took many hours and a lot of energy. For this Senator, as \nchairman, it was difficult. We had to do some difficult things that I \nwouldn't like to do every year.\n  I hope we get bipartisan support for this use of the surplus. I think \nit is an appropriate use. We come back down to reality, with a big \nsurplus plan expected. What should we do with it? Let it sit around to \nspend on making government bigger or should we first give some back? We \nhave adopted as a policy giving back some of it, yet leaving enough for \nthe realistic approach to government and growth in government that \nmight be needed.\n  I close by saying that the same President who made that proposal has \nhad the best people in the country work with our Vice President to \nproduce a real effort to place before the American people a practical, \nrealistic proposal with reference to our energy future--I should not \nsay of America, I should say to the people of America. A realistic \nenergy proposal is the next thing the President has on the table. I \npredict to all those who are critical upfront, realism will set in, in \nthe next couple of months, and something similar to what the President \nasked for in his realistic energy approach will be on the floor. \nMembers will be saying: Mr. President, you made a commitment to make \nAmerica energy sufficient with reference to electricity in the future, \nand also sought to conserve and make\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nus as independent as possible in the area of refined products from \ncrude oil. I believe we will be saying: Congratulations, Mr. President.\n  The second big commitment accomplished. Unless there is a real, \nrealistic, practical alternative that is not something like price \ncontrols on everything in the area of gasoline refined products and the \nlike, which will do nothing but share the shortages, we will be right \nback in the muddle. We will do something that will do credit to this \nnew leader and do credit to ourselves as Americans who have to get \nsomething done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Conrad is yielded 4 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from New \nMexico, I don't think the choices he has presented are the full choices \nbefore the American people and before the Congress.\n  The Senator from New Mexico refers to the choice of either giving the \ntax cut back to the American people or the money being spent here. I \ndon't think those are the choices. Those are two of the choices. There \nis a third choice. The third choice is to pay down more of the people's \ndebt. When we refer to the people's money, that is exactly right. This \nis the people's money. I think everybody here is acutely aware of that.\n  We have, fundamentally, three choices. One is tax cuts, and certainly \nthat ought to be part of what we do. The second choice is spending. I \nthink most people on both sides of the aisle say we need to increase \nspending on education and national defense. The third choice is how \nmuch do we use to pay down our debt.\n  The President says we should only pay down $3 trillion of the $3.4 \ntrillion publicly held debt we currently have. There is another debt \nthat the President is not dealing with and that we are not dealing \nwith. That is the gross debt of the United States. That is the \ncombination of the publicly held debt and the debt owed to the trust \nfunds of the United States. The gross debt of the United States is not \ngoing down; it is going up. As we sit here today facing a debt of $5.6 \ntrillion, at the end of the 10-year-period the gross debt of the United \nStates will be $6.7 trillion. We are not paying off the national debt \naround here, not by a long shot. The national debt is increasing. \nInterestingly, it is increasing by about the amount of the tax cut we \nare providing.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the very distinguished Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, who has a great commitment to the education issues that \nare in part addressed by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  First, I fully support his amendment. If we are going to expand the \nmarriage penalty and do it, we are going to have to take the money from \nsomewhere. The contrast between the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota and the amendment of the Senator from Texas is the philosophical \ndifference in this debate.\n  The bottom line is simple: The amendment of the Senator from Texas \nrobs Peter to pay Paul. It says: You want to expand the marriage \npenalty? Don't make it any easier to help middle-class people send \ntheir kid to college. Do the American people want us to make that \nchoice?\n  I later will have an amendment to increase the deductibility of \ntuition. There has been a good start in the bill from my colleague and \nfriend from New Jersey. We will seek to expand it. It has been a \npassion of mine for 2 years to get this done. As I go around my State \nand around our country, I find person after person saying: we can't \nafford to send our kid to college, or, more likely, we are sending him \nto a junior college rather than the college he or she deserves because \ntuition is so expensive. I will talk more about that later.\n  Make no mistake about it, the amendment of the Senator from Texas \nmakes it far harder for people to send their kids to college. In fact, \nafter she gets done with it, because she takes the money out of the \neducation portion of this bill, the tuition deductibility level is only \n$1,500. With all due respect, that is not worth the paper on which it \nis written. Already in the law is a tax credit, the lifetime learning \ncredit that adds a $2,000 tax credit by 2003. There is not a single \nperson in this country who prefers a $1,500 deduction to a $2,000 \ncredit. There is nothing left. In effect, the Senator from Texas \neviscerates tuition deductibility. We all know how important and how \nvital it is to the future of this country.\n  Why, when the top 1 percent are getting 33 percent of the benefits, \ndoes the Senator from Texas want to expand the marriage penalty? Why \ndoesn't she touch that, instead of taking the small amount we have in \nthis bill to help the middle class pay tuition? That is an example, in \nmy judgment, of what is wrong with the thinking of some in this body: \nFirst, give the rich their cut, and then let the middle class fight \nover the crumbs. It should be the opposite. Someone making $50,000 or \n$60,000 is in far more need of help than someone making $350,000 or \n$3.5 million. I don't believe in class warfare. To be people who make a \nlot of money, God bless them. But when you have a limited pie and you \nsay you want to expand the marriage deduction, help remove the marriage \npenalty, why in God's name do you take it from one of the few things \nthat benefits the middle class in this bill?\n\n  The President gets up and talks about the family making $50,000. I \nwould bet my bottom dollar, if you asked the family making $50,000 if \nthey would prefer a small rate decrease or would they prefer to make \nthe tuition deductible, 90 percent of them would choose the latter.\n  What is going on in this bill? We are talking about the middle class \nbut then we are not helping them. The amendment of the Senator from \nTexas is indicative of that malady which transcends this whole debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey. The \nSenator from New Jersey has been very active on these education issues. \nI think he has been critically interested in providing incentives for \nparents paying for college. I yield 5 minutes to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind \nremarks and join Senator Schumer in what is an important moment in this \ndebate. Indeed, I believe this moment defines whether or not there is a \nchance for this tax legislation to genuinely be bipartisan.\n  In the Finance Committee, Democrats joined with Republicans to \nattempt to moderate the tax reduction, to assure it was affordable, \nwould protect the surplus, but would also make a difference, having \nrevenue for prescription drugs and education.\n  Within the committee a balance was achieved that, while rates were \nbeing reduced for taxpayers, there were other objectives also being \nmet. The amendment offered by Senator Hutchison is a threat to that \nbalance. It raises the question about whether or not bipartisan tax \nreduction can survive in the Senate. Like Senator Hutchison, I would \nlike to see the marriage penalty eliminated. Indeed, in a variety of \nways, through considerable means, over a period of a decade this \nlegislation deals with the marriage penalty. It simply was not possible \nto eliminate the marriage penalty immediately any more than it was \npossible to lower rates immediately or deal with the inheritance tax \nimmediately. This is a decade-long process of reducing the tax burdens \non Americans.\n  We do that to married couples as we have done it in other means. But \npart of this plan was that, as we reduced taxation on many Americans, \nwe would look specifically at the issue of education. There isn't a \nMember of this Senate who has not come to this floor and argued that \nthe future of the Nation depends upon our investment in education, the \nquality of education. The simple truth is, a college education for \nmiddle-income Americans is increasingly out of reach. The average \nstudent graduating from an American university owes $20,000 on the day \nhe or she graduates. It is affecting the quality of their lives, their \ncareer choices.\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nMiddle-income parents, wanting to do the best for their children, are \ntaking second mortgages on their homes, postponing retirement, putting \nthemselves into financial jeopardy, anything to get their child a \ncollege education.\n\n  Among the many balances in this bill is a provision upon which I \ninsisted in the committee, a fight Senator Schumer has led for several \nyears on the floor, the deductibility of college tuition from income \ntaxes. Under this legislation, it will rise to $5,000 during the \ndecade. For many students, that makes all the difference. We will \neliminate the marriage penalty, but we can both eliminate the marriage \npenalty and get deductibility of college tuition under this plan.\n  Finally, there is the question of education savings accounts. Ever \nsince I came to the Senate, for many years, with Senator Coverdell, I \nled the fight for education savings accounts. More than two-thirds of \nthis Senate has voted for education savings accounts to allow parents \nto put aside their own money for their own child for public or private \neducation. In large measure, through the amendment of Senator \nHutchison--well intentioned though it may be--we lose the sum and \nsubstance of education savings accounts by the reductions of the \namounts available. I hope not only these education provisions can be \nretained but the bipartisan nature of the bill can be retained.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask to speak on the bill for 15 \nminutes, off the time of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Baucus-\nGrassley tax bill. I say to my colleagues from Iowa and Montana, thank \nyou for bringing the bill here on the floor. This is a great day. This \nis a great debate. I appreciate what you are doing putting this \nforward.\n  I also want to say thanks for including a great number of provisions \nthat work on the marriage penalty. We have been pushing for several \nyears now to get rid of this ridiculous marriage penalty, the tax you \npay for the privilege of being married. Marriage Penalty tax relief has \nbeen a long time coming, and with this bill, we can actually do \nsomething about it.\n  I am delighted to hear as well from my colleague from Iowa that last \nnight they added an additional year in which the marriage penalty \nrelief would be in effect. That is a very positive step. It is a good \nthing.\n  What we are seeking to do with this amendment, and I join my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison from Texas, in this amendment, \nis to speed up that marriage penalty relief, making it fuller because \nthe marriage penalty is at several places within the Tax Code. It still \nremains, even after this bill. We need to take care of those places, \nand this amendment is a positive step toward this.\n  Tax relief is long overdue for the American taxpayer. We are at \nrecord high levels of tax collection during one of the longest eras of \npeace ever known in America. Does that make sense? It is unreasonable \nfor the Federal Government to continue collecting taxes from hard-\nworking Americans at a rate that rivals wartime rates of tax \ncollection. Americans deserve relief.\n  However, I think some of the tax relief in this proposal is delayed \ntoo long, specifically that of the marriage penalty tax relief. Almost \nhalf of America's working families experience the ill-effects of the \nmarriage penalty tax. In my State alone, 260,000 married couples \nexperience this penalty. To put the burden of the marriage penalty tax \nin some perspective, every one of us knows somebody who is being forced \nto pay, on average--this is on average--about an additional $1,500 of \ntaxes every year simply for being married.\n  Requiring Americans to pay more in taxes for being married defies \ncommon sense. Families are the bedrock of a Civil society. Between \ncarpools to soccer games and putting food on the table, American \nfamilies do not need this added tax burden.\n  Marriage tax penalty relief needs to be one of the first priorities \nin this bill. Making Americans wait until the year 2005 to receive a \nbreak from this onerous burden of the marriage penalty is unnecessary. \nWe clearly have the resources to provide the American people with much \nneeded marriage penalty relief sooner rather than later.\n  At a minimum, we should eliminate the marriage penalty in the \nstandard deduction sooner rather than later. I believe with some \nadjustments in the tax bill we can provide marriage penalty relief next \nyear rather than making America's families wait until 2005 for the \nFederal Government to recognize the negative effects of the tax we \nplace on the institution of marriage and the people who are married. \nAmerica's families deserve a break from the marriage penalty.\n  Alleviation of the marriage penalty tax will allow married couples \ngreater freedom to raise the quality of life for their families. \nFreedom will mean different things for different couples, of course. \nFor some it may mean the ability to make a downpayment on a home. For \nothers it may mean an investment in their children's education. The \noptions are as numerous as the people of our great Nation. Married \nAmericans deserve to be free from this unjust penalty.\n  Make no mistake about it, however, those who will benefit the most \nfrom the correction of the marriage penalty are children. Study after \nstudy has shown that children do best when they grow up in a stable \nhome, raised by two parents who are committed to each other through \nmarriage. Newlyweds face enough challenges without paying punitive \ndamages in the form of a marriage tax. The last thing the Federal \nGovernment should do is penalize the institution that is the clear \nbedrock of a civil society.\n\n  The amendment I am cosponsing along with my good friend, colleague, \nand fellow warrior of the past 5 years, Senator Hutchison of Texas \nwould eliminate the marriage penalty in the standard deduction \neffective in the year 2002, rather than later in 2006 and would be \noffset by small modifications in other areas of the bill.\n  I am hopeful that this amendment will receive the full support of the \nSenate and be included in the conference report that we will hopefully \nsend to the President before the Memorial Day Recess.\n  Our amendment recognizes the need to provide American families with \nrelief from the marriage penalty and the need to do it now, rather than \n5 years from now. For our children, for strong marriages, for almost \nhalf of America's working families, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important provision.\n  I understand, along with everybody else, the number of tradeoffs \ninvolved to get this done. I think that if we were to ask the American \npublic to prioritize the tax cuts and the tax relief we are putting \nforward, they would clearly say, we need tax relief to stimulate the \neconomy, and we need tax fairness, particularly in the area of the \nmarriage penalty tax.\n  I point out to my colleagues a number of surveys that have been done \nshowing that 70 percent of the American public support eliminating the \nmarriage penalty tax. They are aware of this tax. I now have people who \ncome up to me and tell me, for example: My marriage penalty this year \nwas $1,478--that their accountants calculate their marriage penalty \nthey are going to be paying on a yearly basis. People are aware of it. \nThey know it is there. They know it is not fair.\n  We have been telling them for years we are going to do away with it, \nthat we are going to get it out of there. I think the Finance Committee \nhas done a good job on starting to address this, but it is phased in \nawfully late.\n  This amendment, I think, does something the American public would \nwidely support. In looking at the tax cuts, they would say this should \nbe one of the top ones that we need for fairness and for the future of \na civil society.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison amendment when the \nvote comes up in this Chamber.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the time \nto Senator Hutchison that may be remaining on the 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, maybe we are ready to vote. Have the \nSenators used their time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be brief and close on my \namendment, after which I understand we can go ahead and have the vote.\n  I understand what the committee did. I understand how the committee \nhad to accommodate so many interests. I do not eliminate the deductions \nfor the education expenses; I just draw them out over a longer period.\n  I had to find someplace to offset the cost of moving the marriage \npenalty to the top. Phasing in the deductions for the education \nexpenses was the only thing I could find that would be a viable \nalternative. Because I think the tax rate cuts are so important, I did \nnot want to upset that balance. That is why I cannot support Senator \nConrad's amendment. But I certainly intend to try to continue to look \nfor offsets.\n  Frankly, I am going to offer it without offsets if this is not \nadopted because I think moving the marriage penalty up is every bit as \nimportant as rate reduction and death tax relief and doubling the child \ntax credit.\n  We are trying to give relief to American families. How much more do \nwe need to be told than that the census shows us that 77 percent more \npeople are living together unmarried than there were 10 years ago? I \nthink we should value marriage, and I think we should encourage it. I \ncertainly do not think we should have policies that discourage it. So I \nam going to do everything I can to move it up and make it the top \npriority that I think it is. That is what my amendment does.\n  I ask the support of my colleagues. I think this is a warranted \npriority: Eliminating the marriage penalty in this country. It is \nessential that we do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator yield back her time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Which is the first amendment we vote on, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota still has 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will try to take the same amount of time the Senator \nfrom Texas just took to conclude. If the Presiding Officer could inform \nme when I have used the same amount of time that the Senator from Texas \njust used so it is fair, I will yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will have 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Texas, who is a respected colleague.\n  Let me just say we agree that the marriage penalty relief ought to be \nmoved up. We strongly agree on that proposition. Mine does it faster \nthan the offering of the Senator from Texas. Mine deals with both \nelements of marriage penalty relief that are in the bill, both the \nstandard deduction--doubling it for couples over what is provided a \nsingle individual--and also providing a fix on the 15-percent bracket.\n  The Senator from Texas starts hers earlier than the underlying bill \nbut does not complete the phase-in until the year 2008 on the standard \ndeduction. And she does not speed up the fix on the 15-percent bracket \nat all over what is in the current bill. My amendment would provide \nthat relief next year as well.\n  In addition, we have a different way of paying for it. I ask those in \nthe very top rates--the 3 percent who are in the top two rates--to \ndefer so that we can give this relief immediately.\n  That seems to me to be a fair way to proceed. It seems to me to be \nthe priority of the American people. We have 50 million people who are \naffected by the marriage penalty. Under the current bill, nothing is \ndone, nothing for 4 years. Then it is phased in, and it is not \ncompleted until 2008.\n  My amendment says, if we say it is a priority, let's make it a \npriority. Let's put in place marriage penalty relief next year. Let's \ndo the job.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will give close consideration. We do \nnot change where the rates ultimately wind up. We do delay the \nreduction for the top rates, the two top rates that affect only 3 \npercent of America's taxpayers, so that we can give 50 million people \nrelief from the marriage penalty now, something I think every Senator \nin this Chamber has spoken for at one time or another.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned with that anomaly in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\ntax code known as the ``marriage penalty.''\n  However, I opposed the Hutchison amendment No. 659 because it would \naccelerate the marriage penalty relief in this bill at the expense of \nthose education provisions that would benefit students who borrow money \nto attend college. In particular, the Hutchison amendment would \neliminate the provision that would allow student loan interest to be \ndeductible 60 months after graduation.\n  While I support marriage penalty relief, I do not believe that it \nshould be provided at the expense of these education tax benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

His time will begin charging \nagainst his amendment, which he will offer before he completes the \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One hour. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors: Senators Lieberman, Biden, Bayh, and \nClinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment I am about to offer is one of the most significant that \nwe can debate in this tax bill. As you know, Mr. President, since I \nhave come here, I have felt it extremely important that we help middle-\nclass people with the biggest financial nut they face, barring ill-\nhealth in their families, and that is paying tuition. The cost of \ntuition has skyrocketed. Family income has not kept up. Often in our \ntax proposals we help the very poor with their college tuition, as we \nshould. And the wealthy do not need much help in terms of paying \ntuition. If you are making a half million dollars, you can afford that \n$10,000, $20,000, $30,000. But if you are solidly into the middle \nclass, if you are make $40,000 or $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000, that \ntuition bill is almost impossible to pay.\n\n  As a result, three things happen: First, all families struggle. \nSecond, many students do not go to the college that their records would \nallow them to extend. Some do not go to college at all simply because \nfinancially it is so expensive. The number of New Yorkers who have told \nme that they are going to junior college because they can afford it, as \nopposed to a 4-year school in a specialty they very much want to \nachieve, is enormous. And, third, what happens is that America is \ngreatly deprived of our greatest resource: the minds of our young \npeople.\n  So it has been my contention, along with many of my colleagues, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Maine, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and the Senator from Georgia--the Senator from Delaware \nhas been our leader in this--that college tuition, or a large chunk of \nit, if not all of it, should be made tax deductible; that if a family \nis making a sacrifice to send their child to school, then Uncle Sam \nought not to take a cut; that it is every bit as important for \nGovernment to encourage that activity through a deduction as it is \nowning a home or other activities for which we give deductions.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years we have been pushing this. Now the opportunity is \nnigh to make it happen.\n  I thank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli. He and I \nhave talked about this issue at length. He has been able to get a first \nstart into the bill of up to $5,000. That $5,000, yes, is a start. It \ndoes not meet the bills of most people, but it is a good start. I am \nappreciative of his efforts and of him joining the crusade in which \nmany of us have been involved. But it simply is not enough.\n  So what we propose today is to make $12,000 deductible for each \nperson--for a single person $65,000, for a couple $130,000. It goes \nwell up into the middle class. The very people who come to us and say \nthe Government never gives them a break, the Government never cares \nabout what they need, are now going to get the best thing they could \nimagine.\n  We have not touched the rate cut in our offset because I know so many \nfeel strongly about it. But my guess is, if you ask the average family \nin America making $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, would they rather have the \nrate cut of a few percent or would they want to make college tuition \ntax deductible, 90 percent would say the latter. So the time is nigh to \ndo this.\n  This chart shows it all. Since 1980, college tuition has gone up over \n300 percent in its cost. Health care, which is always used as the area \nwhere prices have gone up so much, has only gone up a little more than \n250 percent. Of course the Consumer Price Index lags way behind.\n  So this vote presents us with the opportunity. This bipartisan idea, \nwhich I hope will stay a bipartisan amendment--because this issue \nshould not be a party issue; this issue should not deal with how much \nof a tax cut, but simply is, should we give it to the middle class in \nthe place where they need it most--is on the table.\n\n  I know there are a lot of considerations, but very simply this is \nvital to families. It is also vital to America. The bottom line is \nsimple: That is, here in America we need to educate our people as best \nwe can. If we continue to have young person after young person not go \nto college or not go to the college that they desire, we will be \nhurting our opportunity to stay the leading country in the world \nbecause our education system is more important than just about anything \nelse that we can do in this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I will have a lot more to say, but I know there \nare some of my colleagues who wish to speak.\n  I would like, if no one on the other side wishes time on this \namendment, to yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Indiana, who has been \na sponsor for a very long period of time and has worked diligently on \nthis effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I salute our colleague, Senator Schumer from \nNew York, for his tenacious support of this very worthy endeavor. I say \nto the Senator, I would particularly like to congratulate you for the \nbipartisan nature of the support you have gathered for this very worthy \nundertaking.\n  With Senator Smith, Senator Snowe, and others on the other side of \nthe aisle, it is a cause that every American, regardless of party, can \nsupport.\n  I rise in support of the Schumer amendment because it is good for the \ntaxpayers of America, it is good for the children of America and their \neducation, it is good for America's economy, and it is true to our \nvalues.\n  It is good for the taxpayers of America because, in my State and in \nyours and others, one of the most pressing needs that American families \nface, after paying the mortgage and saving for retirement, is putting \nmoney away for the cost of a college education. The cost of that \neducation has been rising faster than the rate of inflation now for \nmany years, far outstripping the ability of many Americans, \nparticularly those in the middle class, to afford it. So this tax cut \nwill be good for American taxpayers and families because it helps them \nin a very significant way--$12,000 when fully phased in--in alleviating \nthe tax burden each and every year.\n  It is good for America's students because a college education today \nis no longer a luxury. It is a necessity to have many of the good \npaying jobs in areas involving information technology, communication \ntechnology, biotechnology, and the other rapidly growing parts of our \neconomy. Those with a college degree earn substantially more than those \nwithout.\n  This is good for America's children and America's students. It is \nalso important for the long-term health of our\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\neconomy. America's competitive advantage lies in those areas that \nrequire greater degrees of knowledge, expertise, and learning. So as we \nenable our children to do better, we also empower our economy to do \nbetter.\n  Finally, this effort, thanks to Senator Schumer, is true to America's \nvalues. We are saying to the families of New York and Indiana and \nOregon, and the other 47 States, that if your children work hard, if \nthey dream the dream of a college education, we will stand by them. If \nyou want to work hard and be self-sufficient, get a good job, we will \nhelp to make that dream become a reality. There is no more important \nAmerican value than that.\n  In conclusion, I again salute my colleague, Senator Schumer. This tax \ncut is good for taxpayers. It is good for our children and their \neducation. It is good for America's economy, and it is true to our \nvalues.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this very worthy endeavor. I yield the \nremainder of my time back to my colleague and friend, the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Illinois? \nThe Senator from Illinois seeks recognition.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Montana, I \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I supported this effort from the \nbeginning. I believe that when you ask American families about tax \ncuts, their highest single priority is this amendment.\n  This is a rather substantial proposal in reference to cutting the \ntaxes of America's families. I am sure there are some very important \nand popular provisions in here, but when we literally ask families, if \nwe could do one thing in the Tax Code to help you and your family in \nthe future, what would it be, it is this amendment, this amendment \nwhich would allow families to deduct the expenses of a college \neducation.\n  We all know the problem. Some of the brightest young people in \nAmerica either have to delay their education or change their plans \nbecause they literally cannot afford the cost of higher education or \nthey find themselves in a position where they graduate from college \nwith an extraordinarily high debt. With that student loan debt, a lot \nof choices in life are already made for them. They may not be able to \nbecome a teacher, which could have been their life's dream, because \ninstead they have to make more money to pay off the college loan. They \nmay not be able to become a nurse or a doctor, or whatever, because of \nthe expense of education.\n  What the bipartisan Schumer amendment does, which I am happy to \nsupport, is address this problem and give to American families the \nability to deal with the cost of higher education.\n  Ask yourself: How important would it be? When a young child is born \ninto a family, a new baby, it is usually kind of a rite of passage that \nyou say to the new parent: How is mom? How is the baby? Is the baby \nsleeping at night? Have you thought about the cost of college \neducation? Those are natural questions because people seem to think, as \nthey should, this is a major obstacle to the success of my child. I \nbetter be thinking ahead. Is it reasonable to ask that question?\n  Let me give an example in my State of Illinois. In a 20-year period, \nthe rough period between the birth of a child and their heading to \ncollege, in Illinois, between 1980 and the year 2000, the average \ntuition and fees at college went up 395 percent at public universities, \n344 percent at private 4-year institutions, and 236 percent at \ncommunity colleges. So asking the new parents about how they are going \nto pay for their kid's college education is not an unreasonable \nquestion. It is going to be substantial. If they want their kids to \nhave a chance, they ought to think ahead.\n  The Schumer amendment thinks ahead. It says: We are going to give you \nthe opportunity to deduct up to $12,000 of the cost of a college \neducation. It also provides a tax credit, I believe, for the payment of \ninterest on student loans, so if you have a loan and you are paying on \nit, you can deduct up to $1,000, which doubles the amount in the bill.\n  What the Senator's amendment does is help families realize the \nAmerican dream. Could there be a better investment for the 21st century \nthan to help families pay for the cost of college education? We know \nthat kids who get a college education are going to make more money in \nlife, probably realize their dreams. We have census statistics that \nsuggest that the value of a college diploma means a 76-percent increase \nover a high school diploma in the amount of money one is likely to \nearn. So a young child who is thinking about where they want to go with \ntheir future understands it is important to go to college; it is \nexpensive to go to college; but it creates great opportunities as well.\n  We have done a lot at the Federal level over the last several years \nto provide a helping hand. We passed a proposal of President Clinton's \nwhich was enacted as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to \nestablish HOPE scholarships, lifetime learning tax credits, and these \nhelp to pay, but the Schumer amendment goes to the heart of it. It \nsays: You get to make the choice where your son or daughter goes to \ncollege, working with them, the best school they can get into, and we \nwill help you pay by making the tuition tax deductible.\n  It is targeted to working families. It starts to phase out for joint \nfilers with a taxable income of over $105,000. I don't think that is an \nunreasonable level to be speaking of because if you had, for example, \ntwo public schoolteachers in the city of Chicago or in the State of \nIllinois, their combined income as mother and father might be in that \nrange of $105,000. They are not wealthy people. If their son or \ndaughter is going to a university that costs $20- or $25,000 a year, it \nis a great sacrifice on them and certainly on the children, once they \nhave graduated. The value of this deduction, which can be up to $3,360, \ndepending on the taxpayer's tax bracket, is significant and meaningful. \nThis is available to taxpayers, their spouses, and their dependents.\n  I am going to yield back my time by urging my colleagues on the \nRepublican side of the aisle to join us, as some already have, to show \ngood, strong, bipartisan support. And if they value, as we do, \neducation in America, if they value the needs of American families to \npursue that education, supporting the Schumer amendment is a good vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nTorricelli and Stabenow as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York on \nbehalf of the families of Michigan for his leadership on this critical \nissue. This amendment goes to the heart of what is driving the economy \nand what is good for our families.\n  On the one hand, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I had \nthe opportunity in numerous hearings to hear over and over again from \nChairman Greenspan and our own Congressional Budget Office that what is \ndriving this economy is increased labor productivity. Increased labor \nproductivity is a combination of new innovations and technology and a \nskilled workforce that can work in this new economy, a skilled \nworkforce that allows the productivity to increase in our economy.\n  Everyone has told us that to keep the economy going, to keep our \njobs, to keep the improvements in the quality of life we have seen in \nrecent years, we have to maintain this increased labor productivity. \nThat means education. That is why this is such an important amendment.\n  I also speak as a parent. I have a son who recently graduated from \ncollege, and I am sure I own one of the buildings at that university. I \nhave a daughter in college now. I can speak as a parent, as one who \nunderstands the cost we go through --we want our children to have the \nvery best--and the challenges that face parents as we look at making \nsure our children are able to have the very best higher education.\n  This particular amendment, by allowing up to $12,000 in deductibility \nof college tuition, is very important to allow families to give their \nchildren\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\nthe American dream that we all have for our children.\n  We know that in today's world you have to go beyond high school to \nsome kind of higher education if you are going to be successful. We \nalso know that we will continue to learn throughout our lives and that \npart of what we are doing is encouraging young people to learn to love \nto learn, so that they can continue beyond not only 4 years but \npossibly at some other point coming back in life.\n  We have older workers who are now coming back and changing careers, \ndeveloping new skills, and going into new parts of the economy. The \nquestion of access to higher education is important to all of our \nfamilies, and it is particularly important to where we are as a country \nand how we need to move in terms of the challenges in a new world \neconomy.\n  I hope we will have the opportunity to give every child who is \nstarting kindergarten, every child in preschool, every child going into \nhigh school the ability to work hard and make the grades, and that we \nare going to make sure they have the opportunity to go on to college to \nbe the best they can be. This amendment gives the tools to parents to \nhelp make that happen. It is important, it is long overdue, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Schumer amendment. I am extremely pleased \nto be a cosponsor.\n  I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nIllinois want?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that our amendment, which was \ndebated, be reported before the Senator puts his amendment forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Fitzgerald], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n     Torricelli, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Allen, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 670.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that no Federal income tax shall be imposed on \n   amounts received by victims of the Nazi regime or their heirs or \n                    estates, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NO FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON RESTITUTION RECEIVED BY \n                   VICTIMS OF THE NAZI REGIME OR THEIR HEIRS OR \n                   ESTATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, any excludable restitution payments received by an \n     eligible individual (or the individual's heirs or estate)--\n       (1) shall not be included in gross income; and\n       (2) shall not be taken into account for purposes of \n     applying any provision of such Code which takes into account \n     excludable income in computing adjusted gross income, \n     including section 86 of such Code (relating to taxation of \n     Social Security benefits).\n\n     For purposes of such Code, the basis of any property received \n     by an eligible individual (or the individual's heirs or \n     estate) as part of an excludable restitution payment shall be \n     the fair market value of such property as of the time of the \n     receipt.\n       (b) Coordination With Federal Means-Tested Programs.--\n       (1) In general.--Any excludable restitution payment shall \n     be disregarded in determining eligibility for, and the amount \n     of benefits or services to be provided under, any Federal or \n     federally assisted program which provides benefits or service \n     based, in whole or in part, on need.\n       (2) Prohibition against recovery of value of excessive \n     benefits or services.--No officer, agency, or instrumentality \n     of any government may attempt to recover the value of \n     excessive benefits or services provided under a program \n     described in subsection (a) before January 1, 2000, by reason \n     of any failure to take account of excludable restitution \n     payments received before such date.\n       (3) Notice required.--Any agency of government that has \n     taken into account excludable restitution payments in \n     determining eligibility for a program described in subsection \n     (a) before January 1, 2000, shall make a good faith effort to \n     notify any individual who may have been denied eligibility \n     for benefits or services under the program of the potential \n     eligibility of the individual for such benefits or services.\n       (4) Coordination with 1994 act.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to override any right or requirement under ``An \n     Act to require certain payments made to victims of Nazi \n     persecution to be disregarded in determining eligibility for \n     and the amount of benefits or services based on need'', \n     approved August 1, 1994 (Public Law 103-286; 42 U.S.C. 1437a \n     note), and nothing in that Act shall be construed to override \n     any right or requirement under this Act.\n       (c) Eligible Individual.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``eligible individual'' means a person who was \n     persecuted for racial or religious reasons by Nazi Germany, \n     any other Axis regime, or any other Nazi-controlled or Nazi-\n     allied country.\n       (d) Excludable Restitution Payment.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``excludable restitution payment'' means \n     any payment or distribution to an individual (or the \n     individual's heirs or estate) which--\n       (1) is payable by reason of the individual's status as an \n     eligible individual, including any amount payable by any \n     foreign country, the United States of America, or any other \n     foreign or domestic entity, or a fund established by any such \n     country or entity, any amount payable as a result of a final \n     resolution of a legal action, and any amount payable under a \n     law providing for payments or restitution of property;\n       (2) constitutes the direct or indirect return of, or \n     compensation or reparation for, assets stolen or hidden from, \n     or otherwise lost to, the individual before, during, or \n     immediately after World War II by reason of the individual's \n     status as an eligible individual, including any proceeds of \n     insurance under policies issued on eligible individuals by \n     European insurance companies immediately before and during \n     World War II; or\n       (3) consists of interest which is payable as part of any \n     payment or distribution described in paragraph (1) or (2).\n       (e) Effective Date.--\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\n       (1) In general.--This section shall apply to any amount \n     received on or after January 1, 2000.\n       (2) No inference.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n     to create any inference with respect to the proper tax \n     treatment of any amount received before January 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Schumer \nand Senator Clinton, both of whom are here, and Senators Torricelli, \nBingaman, Domenici, Jeffords, McCain, and Allen, who are cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment simply seeks to ensure that any reparations received \nby victims of the Holocaust--reparations or settlement payments \nreceived by those victims not be subject to Federal income taxes.\n  Actually, our tax law provides that if money is stolen from somebody, \nor if property is stolen from somebody, and that is later recovered, \nthat person should not have to pay income tax on getting their own \nmoney back. However, there have been a number of conflicting revenue \nrulings in this area, and the victims of the Holocaust, which occurred \nat the hands of the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s, are concerned that \nthe reparations they are receiving from a variety of settlement funds, \nfrom banks and insurance companies in Germany, Switzerland, and \nelsewhere--that under the current revenue rulings of the IRS, there \nmight be some confusion as to whether those settlement payments are \ntaxable income.\n  This amendment simply seeks to ensure that the IRS would not treat as \ntaxable income any Holocaust reparations or payments. The Joint Tax \nCommittee scored this amendment as costing $31 million over the next 10 \nyears. It is a very small amount.\n  There are 100,000 survivors of the Holocaust in the United States, \napproximately 10,000 of them from my State of Illinois. The average age \nof Holocaust survivors is over 80 years. Recently--just a few weeks \nago--I had the opportunity to be at a Holocaust memorial service in \nSkokie, IL. Skokie is a village to which a large number of Holocaust \nrefugees and survivors of the Holocaust came after World War II, and \nthey kept coming well into the late 1950s. After appearing at that \nceremony, I had the opportunity to meet many individuals who were, in \nfact, Holocaust survivors. I heard from their own mouths the stories of \nthe horrors they endured at the hands of the Nazis. I saw several of \nthe survivors with the tattoos that the SS agents had put on their \narms.\n  One woman told me she went into one of those concentration camps--I \nbelieve it was at Auschwitz--with both her parents and also with her \nyounger brothers and sisters. As soon as she got into that camp, the \nNazis killed her parents and subsequently killed her younger brothers \nand sisters. They kept her alive because she was a teenager and they \nbelieved that they could put her to work. Obviously, all of the assets \nof her family and tens of thousands, millions of others like hers were \nconfiscated by the Nazis.\n  There are several settlement funds that have been created to finally, \n56 years after the end of World War II, pay some modest compensation to \nthese families and Holocaust survivors and their heirs for all the \nsufferings they endured. In fact, the compensation is really just the \nreturn of their own money or property that rightly belonged to them.\n  I hope we can adopt this amendment. It has the support of the \nadministration, I am told. The previous administration also supported \nthis measure. It was included in tax bills that were passed in the last \nsession of Congress. Unfortunately, those overall tax bills were vetoed \nfor other reasons. I would appreciate the support of all of my \ncolleagues, and I certainly appreciate the willingness of Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus to work with us as we try to find a \npossible means of replacing that slight $31 million in tax revenue that \nwould be lost over the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleagues. I am going to add, at \nthis point, Senator Gordon Smith as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Before the Senator yields, I would like to say a word on \nhis amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment. As the Senator \nknows, I had a similar amendment. There are slight differences, which I \nhope we work out when the time comes. This amendment is important, and \nI thank the Senator for his leadership in making this happen. As he \nsaid, to tax these payments which are but small compensation for the \nsuffering endured by the few survivors of the Holocaust would be \ninhumane. The Senator is exactly right to make sure that they are tax \nfree.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank my colleague in New York. I agree with him. I \nthink it would be beneath the dignity of this great country to actually \nassess a Federal income tax on those payments of compensation to the \nvictims of the Holocaust.\n  I thank the Senator. Both of my colleagues from New York have been \nvery helpful.\n  There is one other point I want to make.\n  This bill also would ensure that payments received by Holocaust \nsurvivors not be counted in any calculation for eligibility for any of \nour Federal programs such as Medicaid. We would not want someone tossed \nout of a nursing home because they were receiving one of these \npayments. That is one of the benefits of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I tell the Senator from Illinois that I \nappreciate his good efforts to address an injustice. This injustice is \nregarding the victims of the Holocaust. I pledge to work with him on \nthis amendment. I ask that he temporarily set aside the amendment to \ngive us time to consider exactly how to do this.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I will be happy to do that. I have \nbeen working with Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. I look forward \nto working with them into the evening. I appreciate their efforts to \naccommodate this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our long crusade to get \ncollege tuition made deductible took a giant step forward with his work \non the Finance Committee to get the first step, the $5,000, in the \nbill. That has made it possible for us to offer this amendment as well.\n  I salute him for the great work he has done, and I yield him 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis very gracious comments and for the place in which we find ourselves \nat this moment. The long fight to allow parents and students to deduct \nthe cost of college tuition is now at a critical moment.\n  It is not a usual moment in the life of the Senate when a Senator \narises with the intent of having his own work replaced by a \ncolleague's. That is exactly where I find myself.\n  The Finance Committee, with the considerable help of Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus, has brought to the Senate Chamber for the first \ntime the deductibility of college tuition from income taxes.\n  Senator Schumer has built upon this work by expanding our $5,000 \ndeduction to a full $12,000. It is, in my estimation, a more realistic \napproximation of the financial burden before American families. I \ntherefore support the Schumer amendment.\n  American families are mortgaging their futures. Parents are literally \ntaking second mortgages on their homes. Families are postponing \nretirement. They are using retirement savings. They are borrowing \nagainst inheritance. They are doing anything and everything to get a \ncollege education for their child. Students themselves are working \nnight jobs and borrowing endlessly to get themselves a college \neducation.\n  The average student graduating from an American university, on the \nday they graduate, owes $20,000. It is not uncommon for a business \nstudent, a law student, or a medical student to owe $50,000, $100,000, \nor $200,000. It is an enormous tragedy.\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n  The options in life that many of us enjoyed that allowed us to go \ninto public service are not available to American students. If you come \nout of college owing $20,000, $50,000, $100,000, your chance to be a \nschoolteacher, your chance to run for public office, your chance to go \ninto the Peace Corps, your chance to go into an American city or a \nsmall town and make a difference in American life is lost before your \ncareer begins. You begin life under a mountain of debt.\n\n  It may not be in our reach to eliminate that problem today, but we \nhave a chance to reduce it. Over the years, from Stafford loans to HOPE \nscholarships to student loans, again and again, every time there was a \nchance to reduce this financial burden and help American education, we \nhave risen to the occasion, and that is where we are again tonight. \nWith this amendment, we can make fully deductible $12,000 worth of \ncollege tuition.\n  I will concede this is a national problem, but in my State of New \nJersey, as in some other States, it is particularly acute. My State \nexports more students to colleges in other States than any other State \nin the Union per capita. We do not have a huge State university. The \nmiddle-class families of New Jersey are having to face, with no choice \nand through no fault of their own, massive private tuition costs.\n  It is the deciding point about whether or not these families can keep \ntheir families in the middle class, and they are holding on by their \nfingertips, knowing that if they cannot pay these tuitions, they may be \nthe first generation in American history whose kids will be less \neducated, have less of a financial future, less of a quality of life \nthan they have. And Americans do not give that up easily. That is why \nthis mountain of debt. That is why the frustration. But that is also \nwhy I stand here tonight.\n  We have a chance to fight back. In the last decade, the cost of a \ncollege education has risen by 40 percent. There is no end in sight. In \na free economy, with free institutions, there is no way to legislate to \ncontrol that cost or stop it, nor am I proposing we do so. We simply \nhave to allow families to fight back, and it has to be more than loans. \nWe have to offer more than debt. We have to let families help meet this \ncost.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. Without \ntheir support, we would not even be having this debate, Senator Schumer \nwould not be able to offer this amendment. The committee took a stand, \nand I am proud of every member of the Finance Committee for doing so. \nBut now we can take a good provision and we can make it better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I think it is a vote \nin which we can all take great pride. I thank the Senator from New York \nfor yielding me the time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Durbin and Dayton be added as \ncosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time has our side consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 28 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Iowa, do the \nopponents of this amendment intend to use all of their hour?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Probably not, but we are going to use some time; yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Maybe we can begin now. Does the Senator from New York, \nmy friend and colleague, wish to speak now?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I will be happy to speak now.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I call on my colleague, the Senator from New York, who \nhas been a leader on this issue and has worked with me side by side to \nmake college tuition deductibility a reality. I yield to her 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment which has been a \npassion of my senior Senator from New York. It arises out of the real-\nworld experiences he and I have every day in New York where we meet \nparent after parent who is troubled by the rising costs of college \ntuition and other expenses associated with going to college.\n  I wish we would all recognize that going to college has become not \njust a luxury, but in many respects a necessity. There are so many jobs \ntoday which are on the leading edge of the economy that require the \nadvanced education that can only come in a higher education setting.\n  The fastest growing occupations, all of them in the field of \ntechnology, require at least a bachelor's degree, and they pay much \nhigher than average for full-time workers. The Senator has recognized \nthat we have to do more to make college affordable for our families.\n\n  The saddest statistic I am aware of is as hard as it is to believe \nafter all the work this body has done over the last years to make \ncollege more affordable, with the HOPE scholarships, with increasing \nPell grants for worthy students, with the life-long learning tax \ncredit, with all of that work, there are still so many children whose \nfamilies cannot afford to send them to college or for whom the college \ntuition stretch is so great it requires mortgaging homes, it requires \ntremendous sacrifice from many working and middle-class families, and \nit often leads to a student having to drop out because the dollars just \ndon't keep coming and there is not enough financial support.\n  In New York, for example, more than 80 percent of New York students \ngo on to some form of higher education. Nearly 1 million students \nattend college in New York, yet not that many finish. And the No. 1 \nreason given is financial hardship. The combination of the debt load \nthat so many of our youngsters and their families have to carry, and \nthe fact that sometimes that credit is just not available, makes the \ndream of college just beyond the reach of too many of our children and \ntheir families.\n  As we debate this overall tax bill, which has many features that are \nnot, in my view, going to make us richer and stronger and smarter, I \nhope we will try to support this amendment which I think will do all of \nthose. I think this amendment, Senator Schumer's college opportunity \ntax credit, is the single most important amendment we could pass in \nthis entire debate. It not only will provide much needed financing, it \nwill send a clear message that we in this Chamber have heard the \nstudents, the parents, the families, the businesses, and the colleges \nof America, we have heard their requests and we try to help make \ncollege affordable for all Americans.\n  The college challenge now of paying has become absolutely out of \nreach because average tuition has doubled in the last 20 years. Family \nincomes and financial aid have not doubled in a comparable period. It \nis time to give families in New York, families across America, the kind \nof tax cut they can really count on and that will mean something for \neverybody--the people who are the bulk of the taxpayers in this \ncountry. This amendment, when fully phased in, will give families a tax \ndeduction of up to $12,000 in tuition costs, which will provide as much \nas $3,360 in tax relief.\n  I commend my colleague, my senior Senator, for his passion, his work, \nhis persistence. I hope that work will finally culminate in a positive \noutcome today and we will pass the college opportunity tax cut, the \nkind of sensible, affordable tax cut that makes sense for America's \nfamilies and especially for the young people for whom we, after all, \nhave to think most clearly about trying to create a better future. \nThere is no better investment we can make. I commend my colleague and \nthank him for his work on this critically important amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield whatever time the Senator wants.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am trying to get a copy of the amendment. Has the \namendment been sent to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from New York wants \nto help people who need it. We all understand the importance of \neducation. I go back to my opening statement and refer to the process \nby which this bill was brought about and the balance that is in it.\n  I know the Senator from New York doesn't mean to be selfish. And I \ndon't\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\nmean ``selfish'' for the college students he is trying to help, but the \nSenator is somewhat selfish in what we can do in one bill. For \ninstance, he wants me to consider his point of view in spending more \nfor college tuition. This may even be bipartisan; I don't know whether \nit will end up partisan or bipartisan. But either way, the Senator is \nasking us to consider his point of view being presented before the \nSenate while trying to undo a very carefully crafted, bipartisan \ncompromise that was worked out between people such as Senator Kyl on \nthe one hand and Senator Lincoln on the other dealing with the estate \ntax.\n  Maybe if you think the super rich in New York don't need anything \ndone about the estate tax, that is perfectly legitimate. Maybe that is \nnot being selfish, if you think about the small businesspeople of \nAmerica who live moderately throughout their entire working career \nbecause they have to pour everything back into the business and they \nwant to leave it to their kids, and we are raising the threshold, \nraising the unified credit so that doesn't have to happen, and this \nisn't even talking about doing away with the estate tax 10 years from \nnow. We are only talking about raising unified credit and preserving \nthe small businesses and the small farms, or you might say large \nbusinesses and large farms that are affected by it, but you are taking \naway from that to do what you want.\n  It is carefully crafted politically. It is crafted to look at as many \ninterests as we can.\n  What is ludicrous about the approach is that for the last 2 months \nduring the budget debate the Senator was one who was voting we should \nnot have a $1.6 trillion tax cut, should not have a $1.35 trillion tax \ncut. I don't know about the $950 billion bill that the Democrats put \nin, but 12 months ago people of the Senator's party didn't want any tax \ncuts at all. I hope Members are thanking President Bush that he ran on \na program to cut taxes and got elected and he is performing in office \nthe way he ran the campaign, keeping his campaign promise. We wouldn't \neven have a tax bill before us so that you could do what you want to do \nfor your college students.\n  I wonder if the Senator has thought this through? We have Senator \nLincoln on your side, working with Senator Kyl, for a very carefully \ncrafted provision that is in this bill that, quite frankly, was a major \nproblem for your ranking member, Senator Baucus. He didn't want to do \nas much as I wanted to do in this area or Senator Kyl or Senator \nLincoln. But, as a matter of compromise, he went along with this so we \ncould have a bill, a bipartisan bill, and make the process of \nbipartisanship work.\n  I am a little frustrated about the process. I am not even talking \nabout the merits of your bill. I want to deal with the merits. I wonder \nif the Senator has thought about the condition in which you put Senator \nLincoln and Senator Kyl, how you can intellectually approach this sort \nof a deal on a $1.3 trillion tax cut, and the Senator didn't even want \nany tax cuts.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield because I need some answers.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I would like to answer, since my \nname was used repeatedly.\n  First I want to say this. I have great respect for the Senator. I \neven share his frustration. It is not very easy to put together a tax \nbill. But I am sort of aghast at his implication, that because, however \ncarefully the 20 members of the Finance Committee put together a \ncompromise, which was supported--I would not call this bipartisan. As \ngreat respect as I have for Senator Baucus, it was not Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together and meeting in the middle.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How many Democrats do you have to have to be \nbipartisan?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would say it should be a lot more than four or five, \nto answer the Senator's question.\n  If you look at the reconciliation vote, it was four or five. That is \nnot bipartisan in my judgment.\n  I respect each Senator's right to make their decision. They come from \ndifferent States.\n  But what I am aghast at is the implication of my good friend from \nIowa that anyone who offers an amendment to the grand creation that he \nhas put together has either not thought it through or is derelict in \ntheir duty.\n  Just the opposite, good sir. I am doing my duty to the people of New \nYork by doing what they think is right. I daresay if they were asked \nshould the estate tax, only on estates of over $3 million, get a \nsmaller reduction so the families who are making $100,000 and $80,000 \nand $120,000 and $50,000 and $60,000 can get a break on tuition, my \nguess is, good sir, that 90 percent of the people of New York--and I \nwould guess, although I do not want to second-guess the Senator from \nIowa--but my guess is the people from his State would support this \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Do you mind if I reclaim my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You told me you feel very strongly about it and you \ntold me you thought this through and you are willing to present your \nview, regardless of the compromises on the other portions of the bill. \nYou have every right to do that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I accept that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield for a question. I am not sure I will \nanswer it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. My question is, Does he think his grand compromise \nis beyond improvement? Is it perfection itself?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not think it is perfect.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. All I can say to my good friend, Charles S. Grassley, \nfrom Charles S. Schumer, is I am trying to make your wonderful \ncompromise a little bit better.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I hope you respect my right, that we have worked hard \nto put this together and I want to protect it as much as I can.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I sure do.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Not because of the substance of the bill as much as the \nprocess by which this has come together and what that says about the \nSenate's workings and the bipartisanship that is necessary to getting \nit done around here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, and I am glad we are having a \ndebate, in all respect I think there are a lot of us in this Chamber \nwho are not enamored with this process.\n  Let me give you my little example. I received great help from the \nJoint Tax Committee. But they frenetically rushed in the last few hours \nto get me estimates and put together the bill.\n  We are trying to debate this most significant tax legislation in 2 \ndays, with 20 hours of debate. I was here, it was my first year, for \nGramm-Latta. There were heated debates, but there was no effort to cut \noff amendments. There was no effort to stretch--one of the reasons our \namendment is crafted as it is, good sir, is because the reconciliation \nprocess that was used does not allow many other amendments.\n  I am not enamored with this process. I respect bipartisan compromise. \nI think, in good faith, the Senator from Iowa has taken some flak from \nhis side. My friend, the Senator from Montana, for whom I have enormous \nrespect and do not begrudge him one iota for his views and what he has \ndone, has taken a good deal of flak from his side. I respect that. I \ntry to come up with bipartisan compromises whenever I can.\n  But I have to tell you I do not respect the process here. It is a \nrushed process. It is a hurried process. It is a process that does not \nallow deliberation. It is a process that is not the Senate at its \nfinest.\n  So, yes, it is nice to have a bipartisan compromise. But if that \nbipartisan compromise is worth much----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I can just finish?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we have had discussion enough on this.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Okay. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Does the Senator from Montana want me to yield for a \nminute?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield some time off my time to Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is not an easy matter, of course. We \nwant every child to have the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\nattend college, to get a higher education. That is a given. It is \nparticularly important in these days, as the economy gets more and more \ncomplex, the world economy more globalized. I think the major advantage \nwe have in the United States of America is our education system. When \nwe talk about value-added, it is knowledge-based, value-added America \nthrough education that is going to give us the competitive advantage \ncompared to other countries around the world. Education is key. It is \nHead Start. It is pre-head Start. It is all that goes into children, \nfrom the instant they are born, creating a family environment and \ncommunity environment to help kids be excited about life--not be put \ndown, but excited--Head Start, kindergarten, all the way through \nelementary, secondary and, of course, higher education. That is a \ngiven.\n  We are doing what we can to help make that happen. Rome was not built \nin a day, but we are doing all we can to help make that happen.\n  I might have a couple or three points here. One, I would like to \nremind Senators what we provide for in this bill that helps kids get a \nbetter education. There are the provisions which help elementary and \nsecondary students. The amendment offered by my good friend from New \nYork is directed more toward higher education.\n  Let me just go through what we have for education. Essentially, it is \nabout $35 billion in this bill, over 10 years, for education. About $11 \nbillion of that is for higher ed; it is to add something new in this \nlegislation which has not existed in prior law. What is that? That is \nto provide a deduction for college tuition. In the bill it starts at \nlower amounts, $2,000 or $3,000, and gets up to a $10,000 deduction for \ntuition for education. That is new. We have never done that before in \nthe U.S. Congress. That is new in America. That is in this bill. It is \na start.\n\n  Is it everything? No. It is clear tuition in some colleges is a lot \nmore than that, but it is a start. It will help students get a break \nwhen they go to college and other loans are available. In fact, this \nbill, I remind my good friend from New York, actually deletes the \nlimitation on interest deduction for student loans so students will \nalways have their interest deduction on student loans.\n  Does that solve all the problems? No. It is a help, it is a start. We \nknow in life there are no free lunches. There are none. We have to work \nsometimes in life for what we want to attain. We can't just give gifts \nto everybody. We want to help. We want to help kids go to college, do \nthe very best we can to create conditions to make that possible. In \naddition, private institutions have availability for prepaid tuition \nprograms. That has not been available in the past.\n  I mentioned the modification of the student interest deduction; that \nis, the limitation is eliminated. IRAs, for education IRAs, that is \nexpanded from a $500 contribution to $2,000. There are several other \nprovisions in here which will help education. They total, as I said, \nabout $35 billion over 10 years. It is $10 billion, the program \nsuggested by my good friend from New York.\n  I join in the frustration of my good friend from New York at the \ndifficulty in getting amendments scored by Joint Tax. Why do we face \nthat? It is because this bill is being rushed. There is no doubt about \nit. Because this bill is being rushed, we are bound to make mistakes. \nWe are bound to not have the information we should have. That is very \nunfortunate.\n  I personally believe we should not be working on a tax bill in the \ncontext of reconciliation which has very constricting limits on debate \nand amendments. But we are. I had hoped we would not be on this bill \nuntil Monday of this week. But others with so-called pay grades higher \nthan mine had a different view than mine and we are here now. We have \nto deal with what we have. That is unfortunate, but that is where we \nare.\n  I would like to have a lot more in here for education. I have a soft \nspot for education. I think most of us have a soft spot for \neducation. But we cannot do it all at once. I wish we could, but we \ncannot. But we have a terrific--just think of it--start with the \ndeduction of college tuition provided for in this Senate bill of up to \n$5,000. That is not small change. Mr. President, $5,000 toward tuition \nis a start. Students can make up the difference in various other ways, \neither through families or jobs or scholarships. There are ways to get \nthings done, and certainly $5,000 is going to help a lot.\n\n  But I want to make a point to my good friend from New York. He does \nhave a very good point: Gee, this so-called grand compromise, this \ngrand perfect bill, and so forth, can be made better. Of course it can. \nI would like it to be made better.\n  I know my good friend from New York and other Senators realize that \nall things are not equal. And what is a little bit different here is \nthat there happens to be a different body down thataway. That other \nbody down the hall has a different view on this tax proposal. They are \ngoing to want to change this dramatically in conference. This tax bill \nis going to change dramatically in a direction, I might suppose, that \nis contrary to the wishes of the Senator from New York.\n  So what I am trying to do, in getting a package together--and working \nwith the chairman of the committee, for whom, I might add, I have the \nutmost respect--is to get an agreement that is better than what would \notherwise pass in this Chamber, because if we did not have this \nbipartisan compromise, I guarantee you we would have a tax bill in this \nChamber which would be much less to the liking of the Senator from New \nYork and virtually every one of my colleagues on my side of the aisle.\n  But now we can go to conference in a better position and come back \nwith a result which is better than it otherwise might be. Were it not \nfor that context, I would probably be here arguing, yes, we should \nchange this; we should add more for tuition deduction; we should do \nthat. But there is no free lunch here. We have to deal with the deck we \nwere dealt. In that context, it is a better bill from the perspective \nof the Senator from New York, so we can go to conference and come back \nwith a result that is better than it otherwise would be for the Senator \nfrom New York and for other Senators. That is really where we are.\n  So for all those reasons--and basically it is the last reason--I have \nthe utmost respect, I must say, for my very good friend from New York. \nNew York has two super Senators, and one of them is Senator Schumer. \nThe other is Senator Clinton. I must say I don't know of a Senator \naround here for whom I have a higher regard than Senator Schumer; I \nmight say Senator Clinton, but certainly Senator Schumer from New York. \nHe is on the right track. I have the utmost respect for him, but I \ncannot support his amendment because I want and I believe, in the end, \nwhen the conference report comes back through this process, we can come \nup with a better product.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield such time as he might want to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  What time does the Senator wish to have?\n  Mr. KYL. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me first echo what the Senator from \nMontana has just been saying with respect to support for education. As \nhe noted, this bill already has substantial benefits for education.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from New York, in order \nto provide the money for those benefits, has to get money from \nsomeplace else in the bill. It is called an offset.\n  What I want to talk about is the offset here because in order to try \nto help education, he is pitting one group against the other. The group \nthat would be the big loser here is all the small businesses, all the \nentrepreneurs, the small family farmers, and the others who were \nlooking forward to some death tax relief, to a reduction in the rates \nof the estate tax. That would be gone under this amendment.\n  All of the rate relief that was provided for in this bill would be \neliminated. So instead of the rates going from 60 percent, which is the \neffective death tax relief rate, down to 45 percent under the bill \nhere--which is still far too high--this would take all of that and put \nit back up to the effective 60-percent rate.\n  It is morally wrong. I think everybody on the committee who voted for\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\nthe bill agrees that it is morally wrong for the U.S. Government to \ntake more than half in any tax. And I don't think we have another tax \nthat taxes people at the rate of 50 percent. This would be the highest \nrate in the world except, I believe, for the country of Japan.\n  Most Americans believe it is morally wrong to take more than half of \nall of the assets that somebody has saved in their life, assets that \ncould be passed on to their children. The American dream in this \ncountry has always been to leave the next generation better off than \nyour generation, to do a little bit to pass on for the next generation. \nEspecially that has been true of the small entrepreneurs, more than \nhalf of whom are women in the United States of America.\n  That is why in the committee we decided to use some of the tax relief \navailable for us to reduce the rate that estates were charged. What \nthis amendment by the Senator from New York would do is wipe out all of \nthat rate relief for which we provided. That is an unfair tradeoff. It \nis an improper tradeoff. Regardless of how much more someone might want \nto do for more education, it should not be paid for in this way.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator know or dispute the fact that the only \npeople who would be hurt by this amendment are those with estates worth \nover $3 million, where the rate will no longer be 55 percent but 53 \npercent?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator does dispute that because as the Senator from \nNew York should be aware, under the relief in the tax bill that is \nbefore us right now, the exemption he is speaking of, or the unified \ncredit, does not take full effect until the final year of the \nlegislation. So it is not true what the Senator from New York has just \nsaid. The rate relief provided in this bill currently before us takes \nthe rate from the current level down to 45 percent.\n  It does that over a period of time. We do not even do that \nimmediately, nor does the unified credit lock into effect immediately.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But does the Senator dispute the top rate is only paid \nby estates worth over $3 million?\n\n  Mr. KYL. The top rate----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We only change the top rate in our amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from New York has decided to pay for the benefit \nin his amendment by taking the top rate, which is an effective rate of \n60 percent, and leaving it right there.\n  Is the Senator from Arizona incorrect in what the Senator from New \nYork just said?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. We do not leave it there. We reduce it from 55 \npercent to 53 percent. But the only people affected are those with \nestates worth over $3 million.\n  Mr. KYL. I stand corrected--from 55 percent to 53 percent. So we are \nstill taking more than half. More than half of the value of the estate \nis going to be taken by the U.S. Government rather than passed on to \nthe heirs. I stand corrected. It is not 55 percent; it is 53 percent. \nBut because of the bubble effect, I am sure the Senator from New York \nwould agree that the effective rate is closer to 60 percent, the result \nof which is that the rate relief that we have provided people--which \ncaused a lot of people to vote for this bill--will be wiped out if this \namendment is adopted.\n  Death tax or estate tax relief is very popular in this country. In \none poll, it is supported by 89 percent of the people. A Gallup poll \nlast year had one of the lowest percentages of support I have seen: 60 \npercent. In that poll, over three-fourths of the people acknowledged \nthey would not even benefit from the relief but they understood it to \nbe fair. Anytime more than half of your assets are being taken by the \nGovernment, Americans understand that is unfair. Even if they are not \ngoing to benefit from the relief, they realize there should be some \nrelief from that.\n  Let me note a couple of the studies that demonstrate the pernicious \neffect of the rates as they exist today and why we decided to bring \nthem down in this bill.\n  A February 2000 study by the National Association of Women-Owned \nBusinesses, the Independent Women's Forum, and the Center for the Study \nof Taxation found that the death tax costs female entrepreneurs nearly \n$60,000 on death tax planning, money obviously they could be using in \ntheir own businesses. They report that 39 jobs were lost per business \ndue to the cost of death tax planning over the last 5 years and that \nthe cost of death tax planning will prevent the creation of 103 new \njobs per business in the next 5 years.\n  There is study after study after study that demonstrates the effect, \nnot only in the macroeconomic sense in terms of gross national product \nlost, capital formation reduced, and the like, and jobs lost, but the \neffect for the average small business which, as I pointed out, is a \nwoman-owned business in this country. That is why groups as diverse as \nthe National Federation for Independent Businesses, the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Women-Owned Businesses, and the National \nAssociation of Neighborhoods--and on and on and on--50-some \norganizations have all joined in urging the Congress to enact death tax \nrelief.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Arizona might need to ask for a little more \ntime.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield a couple minutes \nof my time.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator dispute that our amendment continues \nthe repeal of the estate tax in the exact time as the committee bill, \nin the year 2011, and that the only thing affected in our amendment--we \ncan read a long list of everyone who is for repeal of the estate tax; \nthat is not affected--the only thing that is affected is estates of \nover $3 million whose top rate goes down not from 55 to 45, but 55 to \n53? With that change alone, we make college tuition up to $12,000 tax \ndeductible.\n  Mr. KYL. I will not yield to the Senator to give a speech.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator dispute that?\n  Mr. KYL. I am fully aware of the effect of the Senator's amendment. \nLet me ask the Senator this question, if he would like to respond to my \nquestion. The Senator asked if I was aware that his amendment did not \naffect the repeal of the estate tax in the final year of this bill. I \nam aware of that. Does the Senator from New York agree with me that the \nestate tax repeal should be permanent and should not terminate at 9 \nmonths? Would the Senator from New York support the Senator from \nArizona in attempting to make permanent the repeal of the estate tax?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from Arizona is well aware of my record. I \nvoted against that. But that is not this amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I reclaim my time. The point the Senator from New York was \ntrying to make was that his amendment didn't affect the repeal of the \nestate tax. That is true. The repeal of the estate tax is only in \nexistence for 9 months because of Senators such as the Senator from New \nYork who won't agree to make it permanent. So the relief is very \ntenuous here for people, and that is why I am fighting very hard to \nretain the rate relief. The repeal of the estate tax is going to go \naway 9 months after it goes into effect, which is in the 10th year of \nthis bill. That is why we need the rate relief that is built into the \nbill, and that is what is taken away by the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will remind both Senators to address \neach other through the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  I will simply say to my good friend from Arizona, with whom I have \nworked on many issues and who is a fine man of great integrity, that my \nvote is not needed for repeal. Very simply, I say to the Senator, the \nreason they didn't put repeal in the bill had nothing to do with the \nSenator from New York or the 45 Senators who have not been part of this \nprocess. The reason they didn't put it in is it is so darned expensive \nthat they wouldn't have been able to do all the other things. So that \nis a bugaboo. That is not a fair characterization.\n  Again, whether you are for or against repeal of this estate tax has \nnothing to\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\ndo with this amendment. What has to do with this amendment is whether \nyou believe that estates of over $3 million should get less of a \nreduction, although still a reduction, so that families making $40,000, \n$50,000, $60,000, $70,000 can get some break in paying college tuition. \nThat is what the amendment does.\n  Does the Senator disagree about the amendment, regardless of my view \nor anyone else's view of whether the estate tax should be repealed?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, it is evident that the \nSenator from New York does not want to see a permanent repeal of the \nestate tax. He does not want to see a reduction in the rates except by \n2 points, from 55 to 53. He apparently agrees with me that because of \nthe bubble effect, the effective rate is closer to 60 percent. As a \nresult of his amendment, and as a result of his opposition to making \nthe repeal of the estate tax permanent, albeit with other Senators as \nwell--I am not suggesting that my friend from New York is the only one \nwho may oppose that--opposing that and then also wiping out the rate \nrelief that we are providing here leaves very thin any opportunity for \nus to go back to the American people and say we have done anything \nmeaningful with respect to death tax relief. Yet that, according to \npublic opinion surveys, is among the most popular of the features of \nthe bill which we passed out of committee and which is on the floor.\n  That is why I say to my good friend from New York, as laudable as it \nis for the Federal Government to assist families sending their kids for \neducation--Heaven knows, I could have used some of that assistance a \nfew years ago--as laudable as that is, we need to recognize, No. 1, \nthat the bill already has education relief in it, and, No. 2, if we \ntake out this rate relief, we are effectively gutting the bill's \neffective help for people with respect to the estate tax because of the \nfact that the 53-percent rate would still be in existence and that that \nrate, because of the bubble effect, is actually closer to 60 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from Arizona \nhas expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will yield to my friend from Delaware \nnext, but I just make one point to my friend from Arizona. This is on \nmy time.\n  This bill is about choices. No one wants anyone to pay any taxes on \nanything. The reason the estate tax repeal is lower on my list than \nhelping middle-class families with college tuition is, it is my \njudgment--and we will see the judgment of every Senator in this \nChamber--that a family making $50,000 and paying $10,000 or $15,000 in \ntuition deserves relief more quickly than an estate that is worth over \n$3 million. In an ideal world, we would do both.\n  But I don't think the Senator from Arizona is correct. The reason the \ncommittee did not put the estate tax in had nothing to do with \nopposition. They have the votes to pass this. They could have put it in \nthe bill and had the votes to pass it. But they made some choices. They \nwanted rate reduction and marriage penalty and other things before they \nwanted the estate tax, having nothing to do with the 45 of us or so who \nare against the estate tax. But they had to say they were repealing it, \nso they went through the sham of doing it in 2011.\n  I repeat to my friend: Choices, choices, choices. Do you believe the \nfamily making $50,000 deserves help with tuition before the estate over \n$3 million gets a rate drop bigger than the one I am proposing? That is \nwhat this is all about. This is not a debate on the estate tax. It is \nnot a debate on the estate tax because most of the folks on the side of \nthe Senator from Arizona didn't want to do it because it cost so much \nand went to so few people.\n\n  With that, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been standing here for a long while.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wanted to make a statement before I \nyield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has been yielded \ntime.\n  Mr. KYL. I have a question for the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. My understanding was the Senator from New York was willing \nto yield time to me for the time he took on my time. What I am asking \nis, is there a minute of time that my friend from New York took that \nwas in fact included in my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was charged to the Senator from New \nYork. So the Senator from Arizona did in fact have the full 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield, if he wants.\n  I find this the single most fascinating debate I have been involved \nin in 28 years. I sincerely do. It is not a joke. I am not being \nfacetious. I find this absolutely fascinating.\n  This isn't just about choices. This is about values. My friend from \nArizona says ``morality.'' Give me a break. Morality? This is about \nvalues. This is about what you value. Is it of a higher value to you to \nmake sure that the fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in \nAmerica, numbering literally in the thousands, who will have to pay an \nestate tax over $3 million--the first 3, no tax--will have their rate \ndropped from 55 to 53 instead of 55 to 50--is that of greater value and \nmoral content than paying for tens of thousands of Americans, sitting \nin this gallery, listening to this debate, being able to send their kid \nto school?\n  Talk about morals. Talk about morality. Talk about values. You have \njust summarized the fundamental difference between that side and this \nside. This is about values. I have never had it so starkly and honestly \nstated on this floor. This is about values: What do we value as \nAmericans? Given the fact we just received a beautiful speech from both \nthe managers of the bill about how we can't do everything; it has to be \ndone gradually, my Lord, values, values, values, values.\n  I will tell you what my values are. My values come from the middle-\nclass family in which I was raised. There are three things a parent can \ngive a child: They can give them faith, they can give the child an \neducation, and they can give the child character. We want to talk about \nvalues. Is it better that I see to it that if I am lucky enough to have \na $4 million estate left, that on $1 million of that, I leave to my \nheirs several thousands dollars less than they would otherwise get \nbecause they won the genetic pool or that somebody in the State of \nNevada, or in Delaware, or New York is busting their neck working two \njobs, both parents trying to send their kids to school and can't get \nthem to college.\n\n  Tell me about values. Where I come from, that is an easy call. That \nis not even close. It would be viewed by most where I come from as \nimmoral to give the kid who won the genetic pool $3,000 more than the \nmillion they already get and to allow the person who is working two or \nthree jobs in one family to not be able to send their kid to school.\n  I am glad my friend raised it in moral terms. I didn't quite think of \nit that way before.\n  Look, let's talk about the morality of what we are considering here--\nwhether it is immoral to charge someone over 50 percent after they are \ndead so their heirs will receive $10,920,000 instead of $14,110,000, or \nwhatever the numbers would come out to.\n  Everybody in this Chamber acknowledges what my friend from New York \nhas been saying. College tuition is skyrocketing beyond the means of \nmost of us. When we talk about the minimum wage and say that kids \nshould work their way through college--I worked; they flirted with me \nabout football scholarships, a grant in aid, and I got a job making a \ndollar an hour. Guess what. The tuition for the whole year was $800. A \ndollar an hour helped. It is true. The staff looks at me as if I am a \nfossil. We are paying now $5, $5.50. We can raise the minimum wage to \n$6. Tell me how many hours you would have to work to pay at a State \nuniversity such as mine, where room and board and tuition is somewhere \naround $17,000.\n  At the University of Iowa, it is $10,000 or more. Tell me how many \nhours you would work for that. Tell me how you can work your way \nthrough school today. You just work your way through school. How many \nfamilies do you men and women know--maybe I lived in a different \nneighborhood, came from a different place--who both work and some have \ntwo jobs? How many do you\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nknow? I know lots of such people. Lots of people. Talk about values. \nLook, everything is relevant. The question here is, What do you value \nthe most?\n  I would like to point out another thing, without going into all the \nstatistics. There are a couple of points I want to make to you. By the \ntime this kicks in--the Schumer-Biden amendment--it makes $3,000 of \ncollege tuition and fees tax deductible.\n  Let's talk about what this giant tax bill is going to do for middle-\nclass families, OK. When all is said and done, if we don't put anything \nin here at all, nothing at all about tuition--let's talk about what \nhelps the people making up to $120,000 in joint income--you are going \nto get $1,400 back when it kicks back. OK, that is great. I am all for \nthat. Guess how much you get back by the time ours kicks in for your \ntuition. It is $3,306. Our tuition tax proposal is bigger than the \nwhole tax cut you get. Come on.\n  We all stand here and say, because most of us come from middle-class \nroots, middle-class backgrounds, we care about the middle class. No \nmatter how you cut this, in terms of raw dollars, in terms of what you \nvalue, in terms of education, this is a bigger bump for the average \nmiddle-class family with a kid in school or somebody trying to put \nthemselves through school than the entire tax break you get.\n  I don't know where you guys live. I don't know where you live. Quite \nfrankly, I thought it was brilliant of my friend from New York. He and \nI have been doing this for over 2 years in our different capacities. He \nsaid, OK, we have to find an offset because of the stupid process we \nhave. He put in the least innocuous offset you could find. If this \nwould offend you, my Lord--this goes to permanent 11 years out. We are \nslowing up 3 percent to give tens of thousands of Americans a chance to \nsend their kids to school.\n\n  This is not the place I joined 28 years ago. Do we have our values \nupside down? Do we have our priorities backwards? It is similar to my \nsaying, you know, the guy who lives in that $4 million estate down \nthere, because the county has raised the sewer fees and because he has \nseven bathrooms, he is going to end up paying $120 a year more, so we \nshould give him relief. The guy living in the place where he has a two-\nbedroom bungalow, trying to figure out how to pay the electric costs \nand the heat because of the energy prices going up, we will rip our \nhair out to decide whether or not, my God, do we continue this relief \nwe have for people----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I have 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I can yield the Senator 1 more minute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that this is a vote about values. \nThis is a way to define, very simply, what you value most. If you value \ngiving 5-percent relief to people with estates over $3 million, instead \nof 3 percent, more than you value allowing tens of thousands of \nAmericans to get up to $3,300 in relief on their taxes, which can be to \ndo everything from paying tuition to paying the light bill, middle-\nclass families, then vote against us.\n  Make no mistake about it. My friend from Arizona is right. This is a \nmoral question. This is about value. I know where I stand. I am \ninterested to see where the Senate stands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while I am waiting to yield some time to \nSenator Nickles, there is a certain unfairness about the death tax that \nI will present to my colleagues for consideration. Based on the recent \nspeeches, though, I am not sure it is going to make much difference.\n  You can have two people who, throughout a lifetime, make the same \namount of money. They are all taxed when they make it at the income tax \nlevels. You can have this family over here living very conservatively, \nmoderately--you might even say miserly--and leave a big estate. You can \nalso have this family over here that spends their money as quickly as \nthey get it, buying a big boat, a big camper, partying every night, \nwomanizing every night, not leaving one penny to their heirs.\n  This family has been taxed once throughout their lifetime on that \nmoney. This family over here has been taxed exactly the same way when \nit was made, and then, just because they were very careful how they \nlived, they are going to be taxed again when they die. What is the \nfairness about that sort of taxation?\n  We ought to reward thrift. We ought to discourage this sort of \nactivity over here where people are living for today and forgetting \nabout tomorrow and reward the people who look to the future and are \nconcerned about their children and grandchildren. It seems to me there \nought to be some reward for that.\n\n  As long as I have been in Congress, my belief is that no American \nfamily should be forced to pay up to 60 percent of their savings, their \nbusiness, or their family farm in taxes when they die. No taxpayer \nshould be visited by the undertaker and the tax collector at the same \ntime. No tax should be greater than 50 percent.\n  I have heard from hundreds of American taxpayers saying that all \ntheir lives they had saved for their children and grandchildren's \ncollege education. They have worked overtime and saved all their money, \nand now the death tax is going to take over 50 percent of their savings \nthat was going to pay for other college tuition for relatives.\n  Remember that the 50-percent tax rate starts at $2 million. You can \npay a lot of college education on that kind of savings.\n  Let our American taxpayers keep their savings and pay their \ngrandchildren's tuition. Do not steal the American dream from these \nfamilies that have lived conservatively and worked just as hard as \nother people who leave nothing and pay taxes once.\n  Remember, a $3 million estate will pay the Government in death taxes \nover $1 million. That will pay a lot of tuition as well.\n  This amendment will control the lives of Americans by only reducing \nthe death tax to 53 percent. Let American parents and grandparents keep \ntheir savings. No tax should be greater than 50 percent.\n  Once again, how much tax is too much for people who want to tax \nincome and estates at a higher rate? It is obvious Senator Schumer \nthinks that 53 percent on the estate of these people who have not spent \nall their money and who save it is legitimate. I do not happen to think \nso.\n  I do not understand how a person who talks about fairness can say \nthat a family who has had good income throughout their lives and has \nnot saved one penny should only be taxed once, and another family that \nhas the same income and paid the same income tax on it as this other \nfamily, but because they wanted to live carefully, moderately, miserly, \nand save their money for whatever they wanted to save it for, they \nshould be taxed again. There ought to be some reward for not living \njust for today and forgetting about tomorrow. I will vote no on this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I need to tell my colleagues that I have received hundreds of phone \ncalls and letters from people who are particularly in the World War II \ngeneration. Only this morning we were reminded by Senator Stevens that \nthese World War II veterans are dying by the thousands every day, and \nthey cannot wait 10 years for death tax reform.\n  They tell me they have been morally responsible citizens, and they \nare angry that the last 40 or 50 years of their savings, having lived \ncarefully and having worked hard, will be stolen. They are angry that \nthe Federal Government will not let them educate their children and \ngrandchildren so they are not forced for yet another generation working \n60 hours a week. The World War II generation wants to help their \ngrandchildren stay in the middle class without mountains of debt.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. College education is a good goal, but let the American \ntaxpayers make their own decisions. No tax should be greater than 50 \npercent. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield myself 30 seconds. That was a very good speech, \nand\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nI believe it, too. The number of estates in the Senator's State of Iowa \nthat paid an estate tax of more than $5 million--we are debating $3 \nmillion, so this is probably a little low--is 23. That speech was given \nfor approximately 35 families a year in Iowa, the very wealthiest, \ninstead of the tens of thousands of grandparents of World War II \nveterans, such as my father, who have to struggle to put their kids and \ngrandkids through college. Thirty families in Iowa, estate tax \nreduction; tens of thousands, college tuition reduction. Choices.\n  We would all like to reduce every tax. Which do you choose?\n  I yield 4 minutes to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have every right to come to this \nChamber and change this tax bill. It was written in the Finance \nCommittee. We as Members of the Senate have a right to say we have \nbetter ideas.\n  I will talk about this so-called death tax. The term ``death tax'' \nwas created by a Republican pollster. It is a wonderful moniker for the \nestate tax. Mr. President, I am going to give my colleagues a chance to \nvote on something that solves all their problems.\n  Talk about family farms and small businesses, I am going to offer an \namendment that repeals the estate tax for all family farms and all \nfamily businesses regardless of size as long as they are passed along \nto descendants and continue to operate as an enterprise. Total repeal. \nMy amendment also would increase the general unified estate credit that \nis available to everyone to $8 million for a husband and wife; $4 \nmillion each.\n  The only estates we are talking about will be over $8 million. And if \none comes out and talks about family farms and family businesses. It \ndoes not apply. They are already repealed.\n  The question before my colleagues now is the amendment offered by \nSenator Schumer, and it is about choices. Regrettably, it is about \nselfish choices. It is about choosing to allow families to deduct \ntuition expenses for their children versus a choice that was made in \nthe Finance Committee to repeal the estate tax and reduce the rate. \nThey said, no, holding on to that repeal is more important than \nproviding the full tuition deduction.\n  Look, there are a lot of families in this country who scrape and \nstruggle trying to figure out how to send their kids to college. It may \nnot be true with some Members of the Senate, but it is true with almost \nevery family in this country. They are struggling to figure out how to \nsend their kid to college. What do they mortgage? Often they mortgage \neverything they have to find the money to send their kid to school \nbecause they are not going to say no to a kid who deserves the \nopportunity to get a higher education.\n\n  What Senator Schumer says, what I say, and what my colleagues say is \nthe value of deciding that we ought to allow the deduction for college \ntuition is something that enhances our children; it invests in our \nfuture. It is the right choice, not the selfish choice.\n  He is weighing it against the issue of a top rate reduction in the \nestate tax for only the wealthiest estates in the country.\n  Guess what. We have people who stand in this Chamber and say: If you \nwant to know whose side I am on, count me in on the side of the people \nwith the largest estates in America, and do not count me as standing \nwith the folks who are struggling to scrape money together to find a \nway to send their kids to school.\n  Yes, this is about choices. It is about for whom you stand. Whose \nside are you on? No, that is not class warfare. We have already chosen \nwhat class here. The Finance Committee chose the class way up here with \nassets where they do not have to worry about where they get the money. \nThat money was banked years ago to send their kids to the best colleges \nin the world. And God bless them, good for them.\n  Senator Schumer says--and I say, too--there are millions of families \nout there who do not have the resources. They worked hard, struggled \nhard, and they want a good education for their family, too. They want a \ngood education for their kids. They want an opportunity for their \nchildren.\n  One way to help them provide that opportunity is to allow them to \ndeduct the cost of their tuition expense of sending their children to \ncollege. Gosh, I do not understand sometimes, I guess, when people say: \nWe have written this bill. This is our choice. We do not appreciate you \ncoming up here requiring us to make votes on tough choices.\n  That is exactly what politics is. That is what this process is about.\n  I say to the Finance Committee: You made the wrong choice. We have a \nright to ask the Senate to make the right choice on behalf of America's \nfamilies and on behalf of America's children.\n  This is not going to stop. We have a lot of amendments. A number of \npeople have amendments. I have amendments that I think will \ndramatically improve this bill. This amendment is among the most \nimportant amendments on which we will vote. I hope we have a strong \nvote in support of the Schumer amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes for the sponsor, and the \nopponent has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will we be expecting a vote at the conclusion of the time \non this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be anticipated.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know. Perhaps the Senator from Nevada and others \nknow what the leadership's view is on the timing of the vote of the \nnext amendment. Perhaps the Senator from Nevada can shed some light.\n  Mr. REID. I was going to wait until the time expires to ask the same \nquestion. We would like to have a vote. Senator Byrd indicates he does \nnot want the votes stacked. We would like to vote and move on.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Further parliamentary inquiry: Have the yeas and nays \nbeen ordered on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that the yeas and nays be ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and urge strong \nopposition to this amendment. It guts the effort to reduce the so-\ncalled estate tax, the tax on death. Some people say let's see if we \ncannot do more for providing for interest deductibility on student \nloans. I am happy to do it. But this is not the way to pay for it. \nMaybe we can do it without an offset. Maybe we can find another offset. \nI am happy to try to find a different offset--or maybe no offset \naltogether.\n  Why do we do this? We are at $1.35 trillion. I guess the cost is $11 \nbillion or $12 billion. Maybe we can add to the cost of the bill--that \nis one way--or find an offset. I can think of things in the bill that \nare not quite as meritorious as an estate tax deduction. I believe it \nis unconscionable we will take over half of somebody's estate because \nthey die.\n  In many cases, in an estate there is a business or operation and \nsomeone wants to continue operations, and we will say: We don't care; \nwe want half of it. Somebody died but give the Federal Government half.\n  The bill we have is rather timid in what it does. I remember the \nformer Senator from Illinois, Carole Moseley-Braun, agreed we should \nnot have a death tax exceeding the maximum tax rate on personal income \ntax, which is 39.6. We didn't even do that in this bill. We didn't even \ndo that. President Clinton said maybe we shouldn't have death taxes \nexceeding the personal income tax rate. For all the talk about the \ngrand estate tax reduction and all the benefits, all we do is, the tax \npresently starts at 60 percent and we get it to 45 percent, and then \nfor a grand 9-month period we get it repealed.\n  But my colleague's amendment says let's stop and keep the tax at 53 \npercent. As soon as you have a taxable estate, it is taxed at 53 \npercent. There will be no tax once you reach that $2 million exemption; \nthe Federal Government gets half.\n  Let's just assume you have a restaurant in New York City and that \nrestaurant is worth $5 million and somebody passes it on, maybe to a \nthird generation, and the grandson wants to continue operating the \nrestaurant worth $5 million. Uncle Sam says, no, we want half.\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\n  I think that is wrong. I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment when and if we get to a vote on it. I urge Members to vote no \nbecause the pay-for is wrong. We can perhaps work together to find \nanother vehicle or another way to pay for it. It is not that expensive \nan amendment. The effect of the amendment is to gut the estate tax \nreform we have in this bill. It guts it. This is a whole lot of the \nbipartisanship we have, where we have Democrats and Republicans who \nhave come together to say let's reduce the estate tax.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will yield in a moment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Last year we passed a bipartisan bill, with 59 votes in \nthe Senate, to repeal the death tax. This amendment says let's not do \nthat; stop at 53 percent; the Government is entitled to take over half.\n  I think this is a terrible pay-for. It is a terrible offset. It is \nclass warfare rhetoric at its worst. It is not the way to do it or to \npay for it. My colleague from New York would work with us, like our \ncolleague from New Jersey. Let's work together, and maybe we can figure \nout a way to do this to expand the interest deduction for all \nAmericans. I am happy to work with our colleagues to do that. I think \nyou will find bipartisan support for doing it. But not at the expense \nof gutting the reduction we have in one of the most unfair taxes on the \nbooks, the so-called death tax.\n  It is absolutely unconscionable we will tell people who are farming \nthat their farm or ranch happens to be worth $3 or $4 or $5 million and \nthe Federal Government is entitled to take half. I think it is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues, because somebody asked for the yeas and nays on \nthe Schumer amendment, vote it down. Then we can come back. I will be \nhappy to support an amendment that will increase the interest deduction \nand have a different pay-for than what is in here. The way this \namendment is paid for is grossly unfair to millions of small businesses \nall across the country that are trying to build and pass on their \nbusiness to their kids. This amendment is unfair, and it should be \ndefeated. Let's find a different pay-for or offset it in a different \nway, in a different manner, not in the manner proposed by my colleague \nfrom New York.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I appreciate our difference of \nopinion.\n  My question to my friend from Oklahoma is this: Since the framers of \nthe bill who are largely from his side chose not to repeal the so-\ncalled death tax until 2011, how the heck--and his main speech was \naimed at repeal, the restaurant in New York City, et cetera. Whether we \ntax at 45 percent or at 55 percent, they are going to have to do \nsomething bad for their business when the estate occurs.\n  How the heck does reducing that top rate on estates over $3 million, \ninstead of from 55 to 45, but from 55 to 53, while we keep the same \ndate of repeal as the framers of this compromise chose--how the heck \ndoes it gut the estate tax?\n  One other question: In the State of Oklahoma, the number of estates \nthat would be affected on an annual basis--I don't know the exact \nnumber. I know the numbers that are valued over $5 million. This would \nbe over $3 million. Affected by this amendment for estates over $5 \nmillion, there are 28. That is it.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is the Senator on my time or your time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Your time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Then I will answer. My colleague could not be more \nwrong. The Senator does not understand the essence of estate if you \nthink there are only 28 Oklahomans who have estates over $5 million. \nThere are millions of estates, millions of estates in this country \nright now, that are effectively wasting a lot of time, energy, and \nresources to avoid paying this unfair, punitive tax. There are probably \nmillions in your home State, millions in your State alone.\n  Let me give an example. I used to own and operate a small business. \nIt wasn't in this valuation, but it comes out on occasion when someone \nsuffers a death and finds Uncle Sam wants a third or half. You don't \nwant to have that happen again. You go to great lengths to make sure it \ndoesn't happen again. So if you think this only applies to a few, you \nare sadly mistaken--absolutely mistaken.\n  There is more energy and effort used in spending to avoid this tax \nthan probably any other tax in America because it is unfair. I was \nthird generation in the company I managed, Nickles Machine Corporation. \nI managed it for several years and am proud of it. I had nephews \nmanaging until recently. It is difficult to pass on a business to \nsucceeding generations if Government comes in and takes half every time \none person in a generation passes away. It is next to impossible.\n  To think we have calculated that there are only so many taxable \nestates misses the whole point. There are millions of businesses, \nfarms, ranches, and so on, where people are working aggressively to \nbuild, maybe get in that category, maybe they are not. But they do not \nwant to be caught. They do not want to be stuck. They do not want their \nchildren to have to sell to pay taxes to the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I just asked a different hypothetical. The 28 is a \nnumber per year--obviously there would be some more; it is hard to \nbelieve it would be millions in the State of Oklahoma, when there are \nonly 28 a year. My question is a different question.\n  I sympathize with what the Senator says, in terms of people having to \nsell a business to pay for the tax. That is a different issue. That \ndeals with repeal.\n  Our amendment does not address repeal. It simply says, instead of \nlowering the rate from the top rate, which is for estates over $3 \nmillion, from 55 percent to 45 percent, we lower it from 55 percent to \n53 percent, still a lowering, because we have to make choices. We would \nrather help the family making $80,000 send their kids to college.\n  How does the tax change deal with that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will reclaim my time. I am not waiting for my \ncolleague to make a speech. I think it is absurd for someone to say: We \nare just going to reduce the rate to 53 percent; we are going to reduce \nthe tax 2 percent for the upper end estates and, oh, sure, at end of \nthat time we are going to repeal it. I don't think so. I don't think \nthat is credible.\n  For someone to suggest we are still really for repeal but we are \ngoing to keep the rate at 53 percent, I do not think is credible. It is \nnot going to happen.\n  Back to this idea of how many estates, you might say in 1 year there \nwere 28 taxable estates above $5 million, but I tell you there are \nthousands of estates that are subjected to this tax that are trying to \navoid this tax, trying to minimize this tax; thousands in my State, \nmillions in your State--millions? Surely a million. There are thousands \nin Northern Virginia. You don't have to go very far. You are talking \nabout taxable estates around this area, if you look at high priced \nneighborhoods where the Government comes in: Oh, the Government is \nentitled to take half of that house or half of that property or half of \nthat business because somebody passes away? What right does Government \nhave to get 53 percent of somebody's estate? It is just absurd. It \nshould be unconscionable.\n  I go back to our friend, who is not the most conservative Senator \nwith whom we had the pleasure of serving, the Senator from Illinois, \nCarol Moseley-Braun. We agreed we should not tax estates more than we \nhave on personal income tax. I believe President Clinton said the same \nthing. That rate is 39.6. The amendment of my colleague from New York \nsays, let's keep it at 53. And 53 is too high. I urge my colleagues, if \nyou think the amendment is laudable for the deduction of student loan \ninterest, I may well agree with you but not at this offset, not to gut \nthe estate tax, not when the estate tax is one of the pillars of this \nbill, both for this President and this Congress and the past Congress.\n  So let's not gut the bill. Let's find another way. Again, we are \ngoing to find out if people want to legislate or people want to try to \ndefeat the bill. I urge my colleagues, work with some of us who want to \nsee a bill enacted and signed into law. We will work to find a way to \nhave greater student loan deductibility. We can do that. We can do\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nit with 60 votes. And you will not have half the Senate going berserk.\n  But I tell you this amendment, to gut the estate tax reduction, will \nnot finally be successful. We are going to figure out a way to have a \nsignificant reduction in estate taxes. That is part of what a lot of us \nhave been working on for decades. It is what we passed last year. We \nare going to get it done this year.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's find another offset. If we have to, let's \ndefeat the Schumer amendment and then we can come back and do something \nmore on student loan deductions without gutting the estate tax \ndeduction we have in the present bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How much time is there on each side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine and a half minutes on this side and about \n7 minutes on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the proponent of the amendment have the right to \nconclude?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to conclude.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator can ask unanimous consent that he have the \nlast statement, whatever he wants to do.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent I have the last word on this \namendment, at least until the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, what was the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will restate his request.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I simply asked--there are 9 minutes left on the \nopponents' side, 7 minutes for the proponent--unanimous consent I have \nthe right to conclude.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Who yields time? Who \nyields to the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire whatever time \nhe might want right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to set aside this amendment, \nreserving the time in its present position, so I may call up my \namendment and speak to it for 5 minutes and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I want the time to run on \nthe amendment that is now here. We want to be able to vote now.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire wants to set this aside and offer \nhis amendment for 5 minutes and have the time count off those who \noppose the Schumer amendment, that is fine. But otherwise I object.\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw my request. I don't want to prejudice either \nside as to their time, 9 minutes and 7 minutes that I know is going to \nbe consumed with brilliance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment by Senator Schumer be laid aside and that a vote occur in \nrelation to the amendment at 7:45 p.m. with no second-degree amendment \nin order prior to the vote. I further ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside following the 5 minutes for Senator Schumer in \norder for Senator Gregg to offer an amendment and, following that time, \nthe Gregg amendment be laid aside and Senator Carnahan be recognized to \noffer her amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I think we have agreement, \nbut in speaking to my friend from Oklahoma, it is my understanding that \nSenator Schumer's 5 minutes would be at 7:40, 5 minutes before the \nvote, the same amount of time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would ask that both sides would have 5 minutes prior \nto the vote.\n  Mr. REID. No problem.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, may I ask: Is the Carnahan \namendment under any kind of time agreement at this point? I ask the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Under the rules, it would be 1 hour on each side on the \nCarnahan amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I didn't mean \nto interfere. Did the Senator from Massachusetts finish his \nreservation?\n  Mr. KERRY. The question has been answered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one thing that we want to accomplish, if \nSenator Gregg lays down his amendment, I hope we don't need his consent \nevery time someone wants to offer an amendment. I don't think that is \nthe intent of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as I understand it, reserving the right to \nobject, my amendment would then be the pending amendment. At some time \nI would have the right to return to my 2 hours of debate on the \namendment, but I would not ask for consent for people to set it aside.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I don't think that is a \ntenable position for the committee to be in because any time we want to \ngo to another amendment, the Senator from New Hampshire would have the \nright to object. I think it is all right, if we can agree to an \nagreement that the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire could be \nnext but not that it be laid aside in a manner where he could object to \nany subsequent amendment that might be offered.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would allow me to suggest, the way to \nresolve this would be to amend the unanimous consent request so that we \ncould return to my amendment at some point during the furtherance of \ndebate for a period of an hour equally divided, and then I would waive \nmy rights that the Senator wishes to have waived.\n  (Mr. ALLEN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, speaking for someone who is not managing the \nbill, and with the consent of Senator Baucus, if the Republicans want \nto make that as one of their amendments, that would be fine. We have no \nproblem with that. We believe the two managers should be managing the \nbill. If your side agrees you should be one of the next amendments, we \nhave no problem with that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if the \nSenator wants his amendment to be the next amendment under consent, \nthat would be fine but not to be laid aside, which puts the Senator in \nthe position to be able to object any time another amendment might \narise.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have no objection if the \nSenator wants a vote prior to the Carnahan amendment. The Republicans \nhave a right to be next.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to get it in the queue, and I would like to \nbe recognized for an hour at some point, and I don't have to have the \npreferential status in order to accomplish that. I\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\nwould be willing to work out a way to accomplish that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think we can agree to this and have the \nagreement be that the manager of the bill, Senator Grassley, will \ndetermine in which order the amendment will be considered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nobject if the effect of the consent is that an objection can be raised \nto laying aside the Senator's amendment whenever a subsequent amendment \nmight be offered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, might I suggest that the amendment be \nlaid aside subject to recall by the manager of the bill, Senator \nGrassley.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Subject to the discretion of the two managers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Subject to the discretion of the two managers.\n  Mr. GREGG. We will have an opportunity to debate the amendment at \nsome point?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At some point, yes. Mr. President, reserving the right to \nobject again, the Senator well knows the clock is ticking. He may not \nhave the time to debate his amendment if he is at the end when the \nclock has finally ticked down.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is, quite obviously, my concern.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not object, with the understanding \nthat if the Senator wishes to bring up his amendment, it is in \nconsultation with the Senator from Iowa as well as myself.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, I think it is the intention of \neveryone here that you would be one of the next Republican amendments \nin order.\n  Mr. GREGG. I take that representation from the Democratic leader that \nI would be the next Republican amendment in order, or one of them. \nRecognizing his credibility on that point, I will accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 656\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send up my amendment No. 656.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Ensign, Mr. Allard, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. \n     Allen, proposes an amendment numbered 656.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a temporary reduction in the maximum capital gains \n                  rate from 20 percent to 15 percent)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN CAPITAL GAINS RATE.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Maximum Rate.--The following sections are \n     each amended by striking ``20 percent'' and inserting ``15 \n     percent'':\n       (1) Section 1(h)(1)(C).\n       (2) Section 55(b)(3)(C).\n       (3) Section 1445(e)(1).\n       (4) The second sentence of section 7518(g)(6)(A).\n       (5) The second sentence of section 607(h)(6)(A) of the \n     Merchant Marine Act, 1936.\n       (b) Transition Rules for Taxable Years Which Include June \n     1, 2001.--For purposes of applying section 1(h) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the case of a taxable year \n     which includes June 1, 2001--\n       (1) The amount of tax determined under subparagraph (B) of \n     section 1(h)(1) of such Code shall be the sum of--\n       (A) 10 percent of the lesser of--\n       (i) the net capital gain taking into account only gain or \n     loss properly taken into account for the portion of the \n     taxable year on or after such date (determined without regard \n     to collectibles gain or loss, gain described in section \n     (1)(h)(6)(A)(i) of such Code, and section 1202 gain), or\n       (ii) the amount on which a tax is determined under such \n     subparagraph (without regard to this subsection), plus\n       (B) 10 percent of the excess (if any) of--\n       (i) the amount on which a tax is determined under such \n     subparagraph (without regard to this subsection), over\n       (ii) the amount on which a tax is determined under \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (2) The amount of tax determined under subparagraph (C) of \n     section (1)(h)(1) of such Code shall be the sum of--\n       (A) 15 percent of the lesser of--\n       (i) the excess (if any) of the amount of net capital gain \n     determined under subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection over the amount on which a tax is determined under \n     subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, or\n       (ii) the amount on which a tax is determined under such \n     subparagraph (C) (without regard to this subsection), plus\n       (B) 20 percent of the excess (if any) of--\n       (i) the amount on which a tax is determined under such \n     subparagraph (C) (without regard to this subsection), over\n       (ii) the amount on which a tax is determined under \n     subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n       (3) For purposes of applying section 55(b)(3) of such Code, \n     rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this \n     subsection shall apply.\n       (4) In applying this subsection with respect to any pass-\n     thru entity, the determination of when gains and loss are \n     properly taken into account shall be made at the entity \n     level.\n       (5) Terms used in this subsection which are also used in \n     section 1(h) of such Code shall have the respective meanings \n     that such terms have in such section.\n       (c) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     amendments made by this section shall apply to sales or \n     exchanges made--\n       (A) on or after June 1, 2001, and\n       (B) in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2004.\n       (2) Withholding.--The amendment made by subsection (a)(3) \n     shall apply to amounts paid on or after June 1, 2001.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenators Ensign, Allard, Kyl, and Bunning.\n  This amendment is a capital gains cut over a 2\\1/2\\-year period. I \nthink there has been a great deal of discussion about the stimulus \neffect of this tax cut and whether or not this economy, which is \nbeginning to slow, is going to be effectively boosted by the economic \nactivity that will be generated by this tax cut.\n  Clearly, the frontloading of the $85 billion in tax cut assistance \ninto this year is going to be a very positive event. But a capital \ngains cut has been shown historically to be the most positive unlocker \nof the economic vitality and energy of the American economy. A capital \ngains cut frees up the capital of the marketplace that is being locked \ndown because of people concerned about the cost of selling their \nassets--it frees up that capital to be reinvested in the marketplace \nand to multiply the economic activity of the country, and to create \nenergy and therefore prosperity in the markets and in our country.\n  This sunsets effective December 31, 2003. The reason this is a 2\\1/\n2\\-year capital gains rate cut, from 20 percent to 15 percent, is \nbecause a 2\\1/2\\-year rate cut actually generates positive income to \nthe Treasury. For those 2\\1/2\\ years, money will actually be flowing \ninto the Treasury in a positive way. It is not a tax loser. It is not a \nrevenue loser during that period.\n  In fact, historically, there is very strong evidence--specific \nevidence--that a capital gains cut is never a revenue loser for the \nTreasury and, in fact, always generates so much more economic activity \nthan it does in lost revenue that the additional economic activity has \nhistorically generated more tax revenues than the revenues that might \nhave been lost as a result of the rate cut.\n  So cutting the capital gains rate is a double winner. It will \nenergize significant economic activity in the marketplace. Therefore, \nby unlocking assets that have been held down because people have been \nconcerned about having to pay extraordinary taxes to free them up, it \nwill allow people to then take those moneys and reinvest them into the \neconomy, which means you will have more capital out there, more \nactivity, more jobs, and more prosperity.\n  Secondly, it is a winner because it energizes revenue into the \nFederal Treasury. Therefore, it is positive for us as a Government \nbecause we will have those revenues to be used in order to benefit the \ncitizenry through other activity of the Government, whether it happens \nto be other tax cuts which we can put in place, or ideas such as the \none the Senator from New York is trying to pass at this time.\n  So this concept of a capital gains cut makes a great deal of sense, \nand the reason we have put it under a short timeframe, under a \nsunsetted provision, is to accomplish it in a way that absolutely \nguarantees that people are going to take advantage of this opportunity \nquickly. And that will immediately generate economic activity within \nthe American economy.\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\n  So I appreciate the support of my fellow Senators, Senators Ensign, \nAllard, Kyl, and Bunning on this point. I understand we are going to be \nable to come back to this issue and debate it at some length.\n  At this time, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't see any Senators who want to \nspeak. We have an order that there will be a vote at 7:45.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Montana yield so I might add an \nadditional cosponsor?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allen be added as a \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is on her way. She \nwas just notified. She is in the order to offer the next amendment. In \nfairness and in an effort to move this along, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time during the quorum call run against her amendment, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nwill be so charged. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my fellow Senator from the State of Nevada \nwishes to speak on Senator Gregg's time, so the time is not running \nagainst Senator Carnahan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Gregg to cut the capital gains tax rate from 20 \npercent to 15 percent. I truly believe of all of the economic stimulus \nthat needs to happen through a tax cut, there is none more important \nthat we can do as a Senate than to cut the capital gains tax rate from \n20 percent to 15 percent and the lower rate from 10 percent to 8 \npercent.\n  If any of our colleagues had read the Wall Street Journal this \nMonday, not only was there an excellent op-ed by several authors that \nillustrated how much revenue would be produced if we cut the rates at \nwhich capital gains are taxed, but also on the front page of the Wall \nStreet Journal there was an article talking about the various States \nwhose revenues are going to have serious shortfalls, including the \nState of California, simply because of the problems in the stock \nmarket.\n  The State of California probably is going to suffer worse than any \nother State because many of the high-tech companies in these States are \npaying in stock options. When those stock options are exercised, their \nemployees actually pay ordinary income taxes. Those income taxes also \nusually have a State income tax, as is the case in California, and \nbecause the stock market has been depressed for the past 6 months, and \nit looks like for quite a bit of this year, none of these stock options \nis worth anything, so the employees cannot exercise the stock options. \nTherefore, States such as California are having serious budget \nshortfalls.\n  Not only to stimulate the economy is a capital gains tax rate \nreduction absolutely necessary, but it is also important to many of the \nStates' budgets, including the Presiding Officer's home State, the \nState of Virginia, which has a similar problem. We can help State \nbudgets not suffer serious shortfalls this year by cutting the rate on \nwhich capital gains are taxed.\n\n  I truly believe it is going to be an incredibly important tax cut for \nus to enact. Over 10 years it only scores, as far as what it will cost \nthe Federal Government, about $10 billion, and I believe, with all \ndeference to the Joint Tax Committee, the bean counters over there who \nactually score these various provisions, historically if one looks at \nthe economic activity that happens with a capital gains tax rate \nreduction, that $10 billion it says is going to cost the Treasury, it \nis going to actually produce more revenue over the next 10 years than \nit costs the Treasury.\n  Cutting the rate at which capital gains are taxed is one of the most \nimportant things in the short term and in the long term. It makes no \nsense at all to even have a capital gains tax, and the least we can do \nis to cut the rate. Most industrialized countries around the world do \nnot tax capital because they understand this simple formula, and I talk \nto high school students about this all the time. In order to have \nemployees, there first have to be employers. Most people in America \nunderstand that. I am not sure how many in Congress do but most of the \npeople in America get that.\n  In order to have employers, there first has to be capital. To tax the \nformation of capital hurts the ability to have employers, which hurts \nemployees, thus hurting jobs in America or wherever capital is taxed. \nThat is the reason we should someday eliminate the capital gains tax, \nbut for sure we should at least decrease the rate to incentivize people \nto invest.\n  Investing creates jobs, and that is really what it is all about. If \nwe want to stimulate the economy, this is the best thing to do.\n  I yield the floor and ask other Senators to support this critical \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Carnahan is now here and ready to proceed. Mr. \nPresident, I say to Senator Carnahan, at 7:35 p.m. the Parliamentarian \nwill, if the Senator is still speaking, interrupt her because pursuant \nto the order there are 10 minutes prior to the 7:45 p.m. vote. The \nSenator has her hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Americans have clearly expressed that they want a tax \ncut, and I favor a tax cut as do all Democrats but one that benefits \nall Americans.\n  The focus of this tax cut debate has been on marginal rates, which \nare the tax rates paid on the final dollar of an individual or family's \nincome.\n  One of the best provisions of the President's proposal and the tax \ncut constructed by the Finance Committee is the creation of a new 10-\npercent marginal rate that covers taxable income up to $12,000 for \ncouples. All income-tax payers receive a $600 tax cut from this change \nin the law, whether they make $50,000 or $500,000.\n  I come to the Senate Chamber this evening, however, to correct a \nserious inequity in the bill before us. This bill contains a marginal \nrate cut for each group of income taxpayers but one: couples who have \ntaxable income between $12,000 and $45,000. This omission is so glaring \nthat it is worth reviewing precisely what this bill would do.\n  Couples with taxable income between $45,000 and $109,000 would get a \nmarginal tax rate cut of 3 percent.\n  Couples with taxable income between $109,000 and $167,000 would get a \nmarginal tax rate cut of 3 percent.\n  Couples with a taxable income between $167,000 and $297,000 would get \na marginal tax rate cut of 3 percent.\n  Couples with a taxable income of over $297,000 would get a marginal \ntax rate cut of 3.6 percent.\n  But couples with a taxable income between $12,000 and $45,000 would \nget absolutely no rate cut for the final dollars of income earned.\n  Who are these families who are singled out for virtually no tax cut \nin this bill? They have gross incomes of between $30,000 and $65,000. \nThis is the heart of the American middle class. They are Americans who \nare working the late night shift at the factories, they are cops on the \nbeat, and they are American moms and dads working two jobs to send \ntheir kids to college. They are family farmers waking up early to tend \ntheir chores.\n  Mr. President, 72 million American taxpayers pay a 15-percent tax on \ntheir last dollar of income; 1.7 million Missouri taxpayers fall into \nthis category. This is 44 percent of all Missouri taxpayers. These are \nthe folks who work\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\nhard, play by the rules, struggle to make ends meet, but then get left \nout when it is time to get relief. They do not have high-priced \nlobbyists or groups running television commercials on their behalf. Why \nis it that they are passed over to give such large tax cuts to couples \nwith taxable income over $300,000? This is the forgotten American \nmiddle class.\n\n  The amendment I propose tonight on behalf of Senator Daschle and many \nof my colleagues would correct this oversight by cutting the 15 percent \nrate to 14 percent. This can be accomplished and still cut every other \nrate by 1 percent.\n  The top 1 percent of American taxpayers would still receive \nsubstantial tax relief under this amendment. On average, our wealthiest \ntaxpayers would still receive a rate cut of $9,000. But by adjusting \nthe 15 percent bracket, we would be providing middle-class families \n$332 in tax relief in addition to the $600 cut from the creation of the \n10-percent bracket.\n  Mr. President, Americans expect tax relief, but they also expect \nfundamental fairness. My amendment would make this bill fairer. I \ncommend it to the Senate.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mrs. Carnahan], for herself and \n     Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 674.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, strike lines 5 through 12 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Reductions in rates after 2001.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Each rate of tax (other than the 10 \n     percent rate) in the tables under subsections (a), (b), (c), \n     (d), and (e) shall be reduced by 1 percentage point for \n     taxable years beginning during a calendar year after the \n     trigger year.\n       ``(B) Trigger year.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     trigger year is--\n       ``(i) 2002, in the case of the 15 percent rate,\n       ``(ii) 2003, in the case of the 28 percent rate,\n       ``(iii) 2004, in the case of the 31 percent rate,\n       ``(iv) 2005, in the case of the 36 percent rate, and\n       ``(v) 2006, in the case of the 39.6 percent rate.\n       ``(3) Adjustment of tables.--The Secretary''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the main point I make is those who say \nthis bill does not give any relief to those in the 15-percent bracket \nhave not read the bill: That is, the argument that the 15-percent \nstatutory rate should be reduced to 14 percent; otherwise nobody in the \n15-percent bracket benefits. They say the taxpayers in the 15-percent \nrate bracket are shorted because the statutory rate itself is not \nreduced as in this amendment from 15 to 14 percent. This argument fails \nto take into consideration the benefits in this bill that are given to \nthe 15-percent taxpayers.\n  Simple math will show how wrong they are. This 1-percent decrease in \nthe 15-percent rate is less than a 7-percent reduction of the rate \nitself. It is simple. Just divide 1 percent by 15 percent and come up \nwith the 7-percent reduction I stated.\n  In contrast, and to show there is a reduction in taxes for people in \nthe 15-percent rate, the Joint Tax Committee of the Congress--remember, \nthese are the professionals who are nonpartisan; they are advising \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--say the bill before the Senate \nprovides between 9 percent for some in the 15-percent bracket and 33 \npercent of relief for the 15-percent bracket taxpayer.\n  It happens that taxpayers in the lower end of the 15-percent bracket \nreceived the greatest reduction. That would be 33 percent; those at the \nupper end received the 9-percent reduction.\n  Of course, this relief is created by the various benefits in the bill \ntargeted toward taxpayers falling within the 15-percent rate bracket. \nLook at the choice. The amendment on the other side provides a 7-\npercent decrease. Our bill provides 9 percent to 33 percent of relief.\n  This ought to seem like a very simple decision unless you take the \nposition that we can still do more. Their amendment provides a mere \nthimbleful of tax relief for 15-percent taxpayers. Their amendment \ncreates a smokescreen to try to fool these Americans into believing \nthey are getting substantial tax relief.\n  Under our across-the-board tax relief package, everyone gets \nsubstantial tax relief. No one is left behind. The average benefit is a \n9-percent reduction in tax burdens. Those at the lower end income \nlevels get far more than 9 percent. Senator Baucus has said 75 percent \nof the benefits go to taxpayers making less than $75,000. These are \nreasons why I hope Members will vote against this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be applied equally \nto both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfrom the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will address another matter while we are \nwaiting for Senator Schumer and Senator Nickles to speak with respect \nto the Schumer amendment. That will begin in about 8 minutes. I will \nmake remarks about another part of this bill, the provisions of the \nbill comprising title XI, the pension provisions.\n  First, some background. The American people, we all know, have many \nwonderful qualities but one of them, unfortunately, is not personal \nsavings. People in other countries save more personally than do \nAmericans. It is a concern many Members have. A lot of Members want to \nuse the Code to encourage personal savings, and many provisions do so. \nDuring the last 20 years, personal savings rates in our country have \nconsistently declined from a peak of under 11 percent of gross domestic \nproduct in the 1970s and the 1980s to zero or negative today.\n  Why does this matter? A low savings rate means people are not putting \ntheir own money away for retirement. Social Security is helpful. We \nhave other private savings provisions such as IRA accounts which are \nhelpful, but the third leg of the retirement stool is pensions. The \nmore people have in pensions that they can rely on for retirement, the \nmore it will help. That means, importantly, less dependency on Social \nSecurity, which many Americans are too dependent upon.\n  Sixteen percent of today's retirees rely exclusively on Social \nSecurity benefits for their retirement income. Two-thirds of all \nretirees today rely on Social Security for over one-half of their \nretirement income, yet Social Security only replaces an average of 40 \npercent of a worker's income because the program was never designed to \nbe a retiree's sole source of support. Retirees continue to rely so \nheavily on Social Security there will still be far too many Americans \nspending their retirement years one step away from poverty.\n  On top of that, a low savings rate means less capital is available \nfor new investment.\n  America will continue to grow more if we have capital available for \ninvestment. That is not only physical capital, it is human capital. \nIncreased capital for investment is an essential element to our \ninternational competitiveness. Particularly now, at a critical time, \nwhere economic growth is slowing down a bit, something we want \ndesperately to turn around, helping more Americans to save for their \nretirement would be a long-term economic stimulus for our country.\n  Mr. President, I will have further remarks. I understand the minority \nleader is on the floor now and would like to speak on the amendment \noffered by the good Senator from Missouri. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the ranking member for yielding. Let me inquire \nof the Chair how much time remains under the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 51 minutes \nremaining on her amendment. However, the amendment will be set aside at \n7:35 for the Schumer amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from South Dakota, the \nleader, wishes 10 minutes or so I am sure we can put the vote off for \nhowever much time the Senator needs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my dear friend for his willingness to \naccommodate. I think others have probably made decisions with regard to \nschedule. I do not want to adversely affect their schedules. I will \naccommodate the unanimous consent agreement and just take a couple of \nminutes now. We can come back to the debate following the vote on the \nSchumer amendment.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if this chart has been used so far in \nthe debate, but this chart really says it all. There are 72 million \nmiddle-class taxpayers who have been skipped over in this bill. Of all \nthe problems many of us have with regard to this particular bill other \nthan its overall size, I think it is this.\n  There is no rate cut for those who fall in the income brackets of \nmost Americans. I know in South Dakota this represents about 90 percent \nof the people in my State. From $12,000 to $45,000 net, $12,000 to \n$65,000 gross, there is no rate cut. There is a rate cut in the sense \nwe establish a new rate, cut from 15 percent to 10 percent, and that 10 \npercent goes into effect. But it is for all of these different \ncategories, the different rates that we have in our income tax schedule \ntoday.\n  Everybody gets the value of that new 10 percent rate. The only people \nwho do not get anything beyond that are those who fall in this income \ncategory, $12,000 to $45,000. That is the largest single group of \nincome taxpayers in the country.\n  I applaud the distinguished Senator from Missouri for her amendment \nand thank her for offering it because I think she provides the fix for \nwhat is one of the most glaring inequities in the entire tax bill that \nis before us. What she simply says is, let's give those who fall into \nthis rate a tax cut like everybody else. Let's reduce their taxes from \n15 percent to 14 percent. And to pay for it we will accommodate all of \nthe other cuts as well. But we will reduce all of those rates by 1 \npercent. We will reduce the top rate by 1 percent, we will reduce the \nsecond rate by 1 percent, the third and fourth rate by 1 percent, but \neverybody then gets a rate cut of 1 percent.\n  I think it was President Bush who said there ought to be no winners \nand losers here. You have real losers under this bill as it is \ncurrently written.\n\n  What we are trying to say is, if you really mean what you say about \nnot having winners and losers, why in the world would you leave out the \n15-percent rate taxpayers? The Senator from Missouri makes an excellent \npoint. I think, on a bipartisan basis, overwhelmingly, Republicans and \nDemocrats would want to fix this Achilles' heel in the bill.\n  There is a lot of fixing that needs to be done. But if you are going \nto start at the top, at least you would want to say we cannot accept \nthis. We cannot tell 72 million Americans they are not going to get a \nrate cut like everybody else. We are not going to say to 72 million \nAmericans, you get zero rate cut, but when you are up here you get a 3 \nor maybe even a 4 or 5 percent rate cut, if some of our colleagues have \ntheir way. How does that make sense?\n  That is really the essence of the whole approach to this amendment. I \nknow my time has expired. I yield the floor for now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I advise the Senate that under the previous \norder, there are 5 minutes reserved to each side for final remarks on \nthe Schumer amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Chair, under the consent agreement, is there \nany provision as to whether the Senator from New York or the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma go first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none, I say to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for what was an \nexcellent and spirited debate.\n  This amendment is simple. Let's reiterate just what it does. It \nallows all families whose incomes go up to $130,000 to deduct up to \n$12,000 of their tuition costs. It is revenue neutral because it takes \nan offset from the highest rate of the estate tax, which under the bill \ngoes down from 55 percent to 45 percent and instead makes it go from 55 \npercent to 53 percent.\n  My colleagues, I make two points here. First, this is desperately \nneeded by middle class families. American families who make $40,000 or \n$50,000 or $60,000 are up late at night, talking about how they are \ngoing to pay for their kid's college. They know college education is \nessential to their kid's future. Yet they do not know how they are \ngoing to pay for it.\n  As a result of the high cost of tuition, which is escalating quicker \nthan any cost in America, millions of young American men and women do \nnot go to college who could, or they go to the junior college instead \nof the 4-year college for which they are qualified. They downgrade. \nThat hurts them, that hurts their families, and that hurts America.\n  I haven't heard much debate on the other side about this being a bad \nidea. In fact, the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Arizona \nhad the good grace to say it is a good idea. But they say it destroys \nthe estate tax.\n  Hogwash. All it does is this: It keeps the same date for the repeal \nof the estate tax as in the bill, 2011. If the people on the other side \nwere so eager to get the estate tax taken down, they could have done it \nearlier. They did not. We leave that decision to them.\n  All it does, very simply, is lower the top rate, which is paid only \nby estates of $3 million. In every one of our States, with perhaps the \nexception of mine and California, there is no more than a handful of \npeople who are affected--in mine it is a little more than a handful \neach year--and it lowers their rate. We are not raising any rate. But \nit doesn't lower it as much as was done in the bill.\n\n  This is an issue of choice. It is not a choice whether or not to \nrepeal the estate tax. Anyone who says that is misstating this \namendment, probably by design. It is, rather, a choice of who needs \nmore help. The heir of an estate worth at least $3 million--and it has \nnothing to do with whether you can sell the business or not because \nwhether you tax it at 45 percent, 53 percent, or 55 percent, that is \nsuch a high rate that you will have to sell the business at one rate as \nwell as the other. But it says to that estate, only over $3 million, a \nhandful in each State, that your tax reduction is not going to be quite \nas great as in the proposal.\n  Choice. Who do you stand with, my colleagues? The middle class family \nwho gets very little relief on the rate, who has to pay $10,000 or \n$15,000 for their children's college education or the estate worth more \nthan $3 million in terms of getting a greater reduction rather than a \nlesser reduction?\n\n  It is a choice. With whom are you standing? It is not a debate on \neliminating the estate tax. That is the only argument we heard from the \nother side--with good reason. Because when they debate the amendment, \nthere is no good argument.\n  Repeal of the estate tax is popular. It is done in the bill. Making \ncollege tuition tax deductible is also popular. A portion of it is done \nin the bill but a rather small portion. This amendment makes college \ntuition deductible for middle-class families.\n  In conclusion, I say to my colleagues in this Chamber, we tend to do \na lot for the rich. They have influence, and they run businesses, and \nthose are important for America. We also do a lot for the poor, maybe \nnot enough in some of our opinions, but we do a lot because they need \nhelp.\n  The people we do virtually nothing for--or too little for--are the \npeople who make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000. They do not ask for \nmuch. But the one thing they are asking us for is not even a 3-percent \nor 4-percent reduction in their tax rate. They are asking us to help \nthem put their kids through college. The choice is every one of ours. \nWe can do that right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield myself such time as I consume, and the \nremainder of the time I will yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The Schumer amendment, as I said so many times, fractures the spirit \nof the bipartisan compromise that occurred in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, which is the reason we can be here doing things in the \ntradition of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan way.\n  Of course, Senator Schumer has no interest in this bipartisan \nagreement. It is curious that Senator Schumer would want to work so \nhard in offering an amendment to improve, in his mind, a bill he is \ngoing to end up voting against.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment guarantees that the Federal Government \ngets to take over 50 percent of the assets a parent wants to pass on to \na child. That does not sound like taxation; that sounds like \nconfiscation to me.\n  Senator Schumer claims that his amendment improves the education \ncomponents in this bill, but in fact the bill's underlying education \nprovisions are sound. Student loan interest deduction, prepaid tuition \nplans, employer-provided educational assistance, an increase in the \neducation IRA--these are all important measures that will improve \naccess to education.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment will undo a very delicate compromise upon \nwhich these provisions rest. It is unwise, it is destructive, and it \nalso should be defeated.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes, 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me correct a couple things the Senator from New York said \nearlier. To be accurate, the Senator from New York said his rate kicked \nin for estates of $3 million. The truth is that according to section \n2001 of the IRS Code, his amendment would affect the estates if they \nwere one penny over $2.5 million.\n  The committee had testimony from a variety of witnesses to talk about \nwhat $2.5 million was. A grocer from Duncan, OK, talked about why the \nindependent grocers support the rate relief in our bill--because it \ntakes over $3 million just to put together the average-size grocery \nstore. So when he dies, that estate is going to be denied relief \nbecause of the amendment of the Senator from New York.\n  There is already, as we said before, $33 billion in this bill. By the \nway, I was in error because I said it was $10 or $11 billion. There is \nalready $33 billion of relief for education in the bill. This amendment \nwould add an additional $37 billion.\n  We do not need to pit one group against the other. In fact, the bill \nis delicately balanced because we have relief for education and for \nthose small businessmen and farms that would benefit from the rate \nreduction we provide for in the estate tax.\n  The bottom line here is, we are not just talking about 32 such \nestates or some number such as that. In my own State of Arizona, \naccording to the Internal Revenue Service statistics for 1998, there \nare over 250 estates that would be adversely affected by this. In the \nState of New York, I counted up over 900. The number may be quite a bit \nhigher than that.\n  So we are talking about a significant number of estates that are over \n$2.5 million that would be denied the rate relief because of the \namendment of the Senator from New York.\n  The bottom line is this: We tried to put a bill together that was \nfair. Most Americans believe that nobody should have to pay more than \n50 percent in a tax rate. In fact, if you ask them, most of them say \nthe highest rate anybody should pay is 25 percent. We tried to bring \nthe estate tax--the highest rate of which, because of a bubble effect, \nis at about 60 percent--down to 45 percent. That is at least below 50 \npercent.\n  No, the Senator from New York says we can't give that kind of relief; \nwe are going to hold the rate at 53 percent.\n  It is all about fairness. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nSchumer amendment, to follow the advice of the committee, which gives \nrelief both for education and for these small businesses that would get \nmodest rate relief under our bill. If we do that, then I think we will \nbe fair to everybody. If we do not do that, we are hurting one group of \nAmericans in order to try to help a different group of Americans. That \nis not what this bill is all about. That is not what we should be all \nabout.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question now is on agreeing to the Schumer amendment No. 669. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 114 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bunning\n     Kohl  \n       \n  The amendment (No. 669) was rejected.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator \nNickles, the managers, and I have been working to try to come up with \nan agreed to process to complete action for tonight and complete action \non this legislation by the close of business on Monday. I think we have \ncome to an agreement on a very fair proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe reconciliation bill at 9:30 on Monday, there be 6 hours equally \ndivided for amendment debate and 2 hours equally divided between each \nleader or designee for general debate and closing remarks. I further \nask consent all remaining first-degree amendments be limited to 1 hour \ninstead of the 2 we had been having, and second-degree amendments be \nlimited to 30 minutes. I further ask consent that a vote occur in \nrelation to the Carnahan amendment beginning at 6 p.m. on Monday, that \nno second-degree amendments be in order, and there be 2 minutes for \nexplanation prior to the vote. I further ask consent when the Senate \nresumes consideration of the bill on Monday, the Senate immediately \nresume consideration of the Gregg amendment numbered 656.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that amendment and the rest of the\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\namendments will have 1 hour rather than the regular half hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is right, one; so there will be 30 minutes on each \nside. The 1 hour is equally divided. I also note that we will continue \ntonight--but with this agreement, the vote we just had would be the \nfinal vote--and we go to the following amendments: Collins for 30 \nminutes; Carnahan for 20 minutes; Rockefeller for 30 minutes; Bayh for \n30 minutes; and Harkin for 30 minutes, if they wish to come and offer \ntheir amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Senator Landrieu would \nlike to be added to those offering an amendment tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Hatch has an amendment to do tonight.\n  Mr. HATCH. Next, if I can, on tax credit. I will wait until Monday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, is it the understanding of the Chair the \namendments would be laid aside as they are offered, then, on Monday, \nand tonight, and that the votes happen in the sequence in which they \nwere offered, tonight and Monday?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe that is the intent; they would be \nlaid aside and voted in sequence in the order they are offered. And \nSenator Landrieu is added to the list for tonight, 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader could repeat the list.\n  Mr. LOTT. After we get this agreement, we can continue tonight. The \namendments we have arranged tonight are Collins, 30 minutes; Carnahan, \n20 minutes; Rockefeller for 30 minutes; Bayh for 30 minutes; Harkin for \n30 minutes; Landrieu for 30 minutes; and Senator Graham tonight also \nfor 30 minutes after Senator Landrieu.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Hatch be the next Republican \namendment on Monday after the Gregg amendment. So it is the Gregg \namendment, a Democrat amendment, and then Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if I could be \nlocked in.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was going to ask consent that Senator Wellstone follow \nthe Gregg amendment on Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. So I amend the agreement, and I am sure we will get all \nthis straight momentarily, that the Wellstone amendment comes after the \nGregg amendment, and that is followed by Hatch on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, if we are listing \namendments, I would like to be on the list for an amendment before we \ncomplete action on the bill, with 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask that we amend the request to include Senator Byrd \nand Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly amend the request to that extent. Let me say to \nall of our colleagues, we are not closing up shop. Members will have an \nopportunity to offer these amendments Monday at a time that hopefully \nwill be convenient. Senator Byrd will be added to the list, I believe, \nafter Senator Hatch, if that is what he is asking, but I don't think \nMembers will be excluded if they are not on the list now.\n  Are the managers around?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know we will not be excluded, but I want to make sure I \nhave 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. You have it.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I ask for 30 minutes on \nMonday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if we could get this agreement entered into, \nwe have additional time that Senators have, thankfully, agreed to for \ntonight.\n  Let's get the manager and look at the time and get with the Senators \nand get this order lined up. I know Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \nwill find a way to accommodate the Senators who want to offer \namendments. We need to have some flow in terms of getting amendments on \nthis side among the others. If we get this agreement, we will ask \nSenator Reid and Senator Nickles to work with these other Senators to \nmake sure Senators are on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I observe to the majority \nleader the reason for the anxiety is we are bringing this bill to the \nfloor under reconciliation. As the majority leader knows, \nreconciliation limits the amount of time for debate. So there are many \npeople on this side of the aisle who have amendments and want to have \nthe amendments offered and debated. I think that is why hands are being \nraised requesting time. If this were not brought under reconciliation \nwe would not have to do that. Every Senator would have the right to \noffer an amendment and the right to have it debated. I ask I be put in \nthe lineup for Monday for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to make sure we have this list lined \nup. I would like to have the managers work with us on this. I feel \nuncomfortable trying to arrange all the amendments. But a request has \nbeen made we put Senator Dorgan on that list for Monday. I think we \nneed to see if there is a Republican amendment to come after Senator \nByrd before Senator Dorgan. We will continue to alternate.\n  Senator Dodd, we will accept him now and be done with it. Senator \nDodd will be on the list.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I request 30 minutes on Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe your request was for tonight.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Tonight, and I also ask for 30 minutes on Monday.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, before colleagues get a \nsecond bite of the apple, some Members would like a first. I ask \nunanimous consent to be added to the order. I think it would be fair \nfor colleagues who have not had a first bite, before others get second \nbites of the apple.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. For the information of Democratic Senators the order \nMonday includes Senators Wellstone, Byrd, Dodd, Dorgan, and Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Parliamentarian has \nSenator Graham today and Monday.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I inquire, the list that was just \nread, are those 30-minute amendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is 30 unless you would like to have less.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Could the majority leader clarify the order for us \ntonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. Senators Collins, Carnahan, Rockefeller, Bayh, Harkin, \nLandrieu, and Graham if offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the order as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of that agreement, then, as enjoyable as it was--\n--\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Graham was kind enough not to demand that he be \nput into the list on Monday. He would like to have the opportunity to \noffer two tonight. I assume if he is willing to wait, he can offer both \nof them back to back. He is the last in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't see any problem with that. That will be fine. And I \nwould like the managers to come back and take it from here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes \nthis evening. There will be 8 hours remaining for debate on the \nreconciliation bill during Monday's session. A series of votes is \nanticipated at 6 p.m. on Monday. The last in the series will be final \npassage. Senators should make their plans accordingly.\n  I thank all for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is set aside and the Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 675\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Warner, I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] for herself and Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Allen, Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \n     Hutchinson, proposes an amendment numbered 675.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also take this opportunity to ask that \nthe yeas and nays be ordered on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, may I have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise this evening with my good friend, \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, to offer an \namendment providing tax relief to our Nation's teachers. We are very \npleased to be joined by several cosponsors including Senators Cochran, \nLandrieu, Allen, Harkin, Reed, Gordon Smith, Mikulski, Hutchinson, and \nDodd.\n  It would be difficult to script a more appropriate time for us to \noffer this important amendment. We stand now at the intersection of two \ndebates, one on a bill to modernize and reauthorize the law that will \ndefine the Federal Government's role over the next 7 years in educating \nour Nation's children, the other a landmark tax relief bill of which we \nare beginning consideration today.\n  Our amendment joins some of the best elements of each. It is good \nboth for tax policy and for education policy.\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\nIn the midst of the education and tax debates, we are asking our \ncolleagues in the Senate now to overlook the selfless efforts of \nteachers and the financial sacrifices they make to improve their \ninstructional skills and the classrooms in which they teach.\n  Senator Warner deserves enormous credit for focusing the Senate's \nattention, through a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the education \nbill, on the need to provide tax relief for our teachers.\n  Our teachers serve such a critical role in the education and the \ndevelopment of our children. This amendment, the amendment Senator \nWarner offered to the education bill, expressed the sense of the Senate \nthat the Congress should pass legislation providing teachers with tax \nrelief in recognition of the many out-of-pocket, unreimbursed expenses \nthey incur to improve the education of our children.\n  The amendment we offer tonight is the legislation Senator Warner's \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution contemplated, and which I was proud to \ncosponsor. It earlier passed by a vote of 95-3.\n  Our proposal is targeted to support the expenditures of teachers who \nstrive for excellence beyond the constraints of what their schools can \nprovide. Our amendment enjoys the bipartisan support of several of our \ncolleagues, as well as the endorsement of the National Education \nAssociation and the American Association of School Administrators.\n  Let me briefly describe the provisions of our amendment. First, it \nwould allow teachers, teacher's aides, principals, and counselors to \ntake an above-the-line tax deduction for their professional development \nexpenses.\n  Second, the bill would grant educators a tax credit of up to $250 for \nbooks, supplies, and equipment they purchase for their students. The \ntax credit would be established at 50 percent of such expenditures, so \nfor every dollar in supplies a teacher spent, the teacher would receive \n50 cents of tax relief.\n  According to a study by the National Education Association, the \naverage public school teacher spends more than $400 annually on \nclassroom materials. This sacrifice is typical of the dedication of so \nmany of our teachers to their students. Oftentimes, teachers in Maine \nand throughout the country spend their own money, even though they are \npaid very limited salaries, because they want to improve the classroom \nexperience for their students.\n\n  Recently I met with one such teacher, Idella Harter, the president of \nthe Maine Education Association. She told me of the many books, \nsupplies, rewards for student behavior, and other materials she just \nroutinely purchases for her classrooms. One year, Idella Harter decided \nto save all of her receipts for these purchases. She started adding up \nthe total, and she was startled to discover that it exceeded $1,000. At \nthat point, she decided to stop counting. But it is indicative of the \nkind of selfless financial sacrifice so many of our teachers make.\n  Idella Harter is not alone. Maureen Marshall, who serves in my office \nas my education policy adviser, taught public schools for 8 years in \nHawaii and Virginia. In her first year as a teacher, she spent well \nover $1,000 of her own money on educational software, books, pocket \ncharts, and other materials. Yet because of her tax situation, she \ncould not deduct these expenses from her taxable income.\n  When we help our Nation's teachers, the ultimate beneficiaries are \ntheir students. Other than an involved parent, a well-qualified teacher \nis the single most critical element to predict a student's success. \nEducational researchers have demonstrated time and again the close \nrelationship between highly qualified teachers and successful students.\n  Moreover, educators themselves understand just how important \nprofessional development is to maintaining and extending their levels \nof competence. When I meet with teachers from Maine, they repeatedly \ntell me of their need for more professional development. Yet there is a \nscarcity of financial support for this worthy pursuit.\n  I greatly admire the many educators who have voluntarily reached deep \ninto their pockets to pay for additional training and course work for \nthemselves, and also to finance additional supplies and materials for \ntheir students. By enacting these modest changes to our Tax Code, we \ncan encourage educators to continue to take the formal course work in \nthe subject matter which they teach and to avail themselves of other \nprofessional development opportunities.\n  The relief that our Tax Code now provides to teachers is simply not \nsufficient. By and large, most teachers do not benefit from the current \nprovisions that allow for limited deductibility of professional \ndevelopment and classroom expenses. A new report by the American \nFederation of Teachers places the average national teacher's salary at \nabout $42,000. In Maine, the average yearly starting salary for a \npublic school teacher is just a little over $23,000. Yet these \nteachers, out of their own generosity, are reaching deep into their \npockets to improve their teaching.\n  Now, under the current law, the problem is that teachers do not reach \na sufficient level to be able to deduct the costs of their professional \ndevelopment and classroom supplies.\n  By allowing teachers to take the above-the-line deduction for \nprofessional development expenses and a credit for classroom expenses \npaid out of pocket, our amendment takes a fair, progressive approach \nthat will provide a modicum of relief to our Nation's schoolteachers.\n  I should note that most of our colleagues have already voted for very \nsimilar legislation. Last year, Senator Kyl, Senator Coverdell, and I \noffered a similar amendment to the Affordable Education Act, which was \nadopted unanimously.\n  President Bush has eloquently stated:\n\n       Teachers sometimes lead with their hearts and pay with \n     their wallets.\n\n  Our amendment makes it a priority to reimburse educators for just a \nsmall part of what they invest in the futures of our children.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this important \nlegislation. The NEA says it well:\n\n       Teacher quality is the single most critical factor in \n     maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional \n     development is essential to assure that teachers stay up to \n     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare \n     students for the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to recognize the leadership of the senior Senator from \nVirginia whom, I believe, will be speaking next in favor of our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  The senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are moments in your Senate career \nyou shall not forget, and this is one, when I am privileged to join \nwith our distinguished junior Senator from Maine. She pioneered this \neffort. And let no one be mistaken about that fact. I think Senator \nJeffords and Senator Kyl and others have also been at the early stages \nof this issue, some years more ago.\n  I joined them last year. We recognized we had two bills, and the time \ncame for a consensus to elect a leader. The unanimous choice was the \njunior Senator from Maine. I am, as we say in the military, one step \nbehind her dutifully following. But together we have crafted an \namendment that every Senator in his or her heart and conscience can \naccept. I am optimistic that this will become law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the National Education Association. While addressed to \nme, it really is addressed to both of us.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2001.\n     Senator John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.6 million members, we would like to \n     express our support for your amendment to the Senate tax bill \n     to provide tax benefits for educators' professional \n     development and classroom supply expenses.\n       As you know, teacher quality is the single most critical \n     factor in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing \n     professional development is essential to ensure that teachers \n     stay up-to-date on the skills and knowledge necessary to \n     prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. Your \n     proposed tax\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\n     deduction for professional development expenses will make a \n     critical difference in helping educators access quality \n     training.\n       We are also very pleased that your amendment would provide \n     a tax credit for educators who reach into their own pockets \n     to pay for necessary classroom materials, including books, \n     pencils, paper, and art supplies. A 1996 NEA study found that \n     the average K-12 teacher spent over $400 a year out of \n     personal funds for classroom supplies. For teachers earning \n     modest salaries, the purchase of classroom supplies \n     represents a considerable expense for which they often must \n     sacrifice other personal needs.\n       We thank you for your leadership in introducing this \n     important amendment and look forward to continuing to work \n     with you to support our nation's educators.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n                                 Director of Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The letter, in part, states:\n\n       On behalf of the National Education Association's (NEA) 2.6 \n     million [teachers], we would like to express our support for \n     your amendment to the Senate tax bill to provide tax benefits \n     for educators' professional development and classroom supply \n     expenses.\n\n  Our great President sent to the Congress the message--which is the \ntitle of his education reform blueprint--``No Child is Left Behind.'' \nWe cannot hope to achieve the goals in this guide, and the goals across \nour Nation, which every town, village, and city wish to have to improve \neducation, leaving no child behind, if we leave our teachers behind. We \nwill not leave any child behind if we do not leave teachers behind. \nThat is the point. You cannot have one without the other. They go hand \nin hand.\n  I stopped to think how hard we work on our individual careers. Yes, \nwe work on our careers. But teachers work to create--to create--the \npossibilities for others, the younger generation, to develop those \ncareers.\n  My colleague from Maine has, in great detail, gone into the various \nparts of this bill, our President, on page 13 of his education reform \nblueprint, has a provision which says as follows:\n\n       . . . provides tax deductions for teachers. Teachers will \n     be able to make tax deductions of up to $400 to help defray \n     the costs associated with out-of-pocket classroom expenses \n     such as books, school supplies, professional enrichment \n     programs, and other training.\n\n  We accepted that challenge of our President in this bill. We not only \naccepted it; we listened carefully to the teachers association, and we \nhave enhanced it in a modest way. We have enhanced the goals set out by \nour President and the same goals that are really in the hearts and \nminds of our people all across America today.\n  So I am honored to join with my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, just last week, on May 8, 2001, the Senate \noverwhelmingly adopted amendment that I offered with Senator Collins to \nthe education bill. This amendment, which passed by a vote of 95-3, \nstated:\n\n       the Senate should pass legislation providing elementary and \n     secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \n     recognition of the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses \n     educators incur to improve the education of our Nation's \n     student.\n\n  I note that both the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee supported this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Senator Collins and I have pursued the goal of providing much needed \ntax relief for our teachers for sometime. However, despite sharing the \nsame goal, in the past, we each have had our own bill and each had our \nown approach towards achieving this shared goal.\n  Senator Collins has truly been a leader on the issue of tax relief \nfor teachers. I commend her for her work in highlighting this issue and \nfor her tireless efforts to improve education in this country.\n  I am so glad that Senator Collins and I had the opportunity to sit \ndown and discuss teacher tax relief legislation in greater detail. As a \nresult of these discussions, we have joined forces and agreed on an \napproach to achieve our shared goal.\n  Today, I am honored to be joining with Senator Collins in offering \nthe teacher tax relief amendment to the tax bill currently before the \nSenate.\n  This Collins-Warner amendment is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of \nSenators, including Senators Landrieu, Cochran, Allen, Harkin, Gordon \nSmith, Mikulski, Reed and Hutchinson of Arkansas. The National \nEducation Association has also endorsed this amendment.\n  The Collins-Warner teacher tax relief amendment has two components.\n  First, the legislation provides a maximum $250 tax credit to teachers \nfor classroom supplies. This credit recognizes that our teachers dip \ninto their own pocket in significant amounts to bring supplies into the \nclassroom to better the education of our children.\n  Second, this legislation provides a maximum $500 above the line \ndeduction for professional development costs that teachers incur. This \ndeduction will particularly help low-income school districts that \ntypically do not have the finances to pay for professional development \ncosts for their teachers.\n  Mr. President, our teachers in this country are overworked, \nunderpaid, and all too often under-appreciated.\n  In addition to these factors, our teachers expend significant money \nout of their own pocket to better the education of our children. Most \ntypically, our teachers are spending significant amounts of money out \nof their own pocket on: classroom expenses--such as books, supplies, \npens, paper, and computer equipment; and professional development \ncosts--such as tuition, fees, books, and supplies associated with \ncourses that help our teachers become even better instructors.\n  These out of pocket costs place lasting financial burdens on our \nteachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving the profession. \nLittle wonder that our country is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  Estimate are that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed by 2009 \nbecause of teacher attrition, teacher retirement and increased student \nenrollment.\n  While the primary responsibility rests with the states, I believe the \nfederal government can and should play a role in helping to alleviate \nthe nation's teaching shortage.\n  On a Federal level, we can encourage individuals to enter the \nteaching profession and remain in the profession by providing tax \nrelief to teachers for the costs that they incur as part of the \nprofession. This incentive will help financially strapped urban and \nrural school systems as they recruit new teachers and struggle to keep \nthose teachers that are currently in the system.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. While many people spend their \nlives building careers, our teachers spend their careers building \nlives.\n  The teacher tax relief amendment goes a long way towards providing \nour teachers with the recognition they deserve by providing teachers \nwith important and much needed tax relief.\n  At this point in time, I think I should yield the floor for purposes \nof such other remarks as other Senators may wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor his usual eloquent and gracious remarks. He is a terrific Senator \nwith whom to work. The people of Virginia are very fortunate to have \nhim representing them. He has also been an extremely strong advocate \nfor education his entire time in the Senate. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Jack Reed, another very strong advocate for education, be added \nas a cosponsor of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for her \nvery thoughtful remarks. She is a pillar today in this Senate, and she \nwill always be a pillar of strength and wisdom in this institution.\n  Now, Mr. President, we will be anxious to hear from the managers of \nthe bill.\n  I note, again, that both managers voted for the Warner-Collins sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment on the education bill endorsing this concept. I \nwill quote again the amendment for the benefit of the managers. The \namendment was adopted on May 8, 2001. The amendment passed by a vote of \n95-3. And I quote it:\n\n       The Senate should pass legislation providing elementary and \n     secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \n     recognition of the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses \n     educators incur to improve the education of our Nation's \n     students.\n\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, it is remarkable, as I travel about our State, the \ngreat State of Virginia; you cannot go to a school, and particularly \nthe elementary schools, without hearing of teachers, although they will \nnot tell you, who reach into their own pockets and take out their \nfunds--after paying taxes--and quietly buy, here or there, various \nnecessities which they, in their judgment, believe are necessary to \nenable them and their students to learn. I wish to emphasize, it is \nvoluntary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise, with great trepidation, \nthe time of the senior Senator from Virginia has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate my junior colleague, the Presiding Officer, \nadvising me, but if I could have 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Without hesitation, if you asked the question, they will \nthen say: Yes, but I do it voluntarily out of the goodness of my heart. \nAnd they will say: Look at the walls, Senator. Look at the drawers. \nLook at the desks. And they can point to object after object they have \npurchased with their own funds--after taxes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield very quickly for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, also be added as a cosponsor of our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I feel \nconstrained to say a few words, urging my colleagues, as meritorious as \nthis is and as wonderful as the Senator from Maine is in representing \nher State, that this is just regrettably not good policy.\n  I appreciate the remarks of my good friend from Virginia pointing out \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I think Senators tend to vote for \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions because that is our sense, that it \nwould be a good idea. But when, as the Senator well knows, we have to \ndecide what is within the parameters of how much we can spend and when \nit comes down to crafting something that is particular and specific, \nthat is where the rubber meets the road and we have to decide whether \nthe specific idea is really good tax policy or not.\n  There is a lot of money here for education generally. It is about $35 \nbillion, for higher ed and elementary and secondary ed. I am not going \nto list it all. I know that it doesn't directly help teachers.\n  Teachers, I might say, in my State are probably some of the lowest \npaid teachers in the Nation. I might add to my good friend from Maine, \nI am afraid that some teachers are going to leave Montana to seek a \nbetter salary in other States. We are in a tough spot. If I didn't have \nthe responsibility of managing this bill, I could very well support \nthis. But I feel a responsibility to say a few words about it.\n  First, it singles out for credit one group and one group only. If we \nstart going down this road, then we are going to offer credits for \nexpenses for every meritorious public service profession that exists. I \nknow many teachers dig into their pockets to help their students. It is \njust awful, the things they have to go through to help their students. \nWe don't begin to pay our teachers nearly enough, in my judgment. Given \nall that, I just don't know if it is wise to single out teachers as \nopposed to other professions.\n  Second, the responsibility for teachers' salaries really is the \nschool districts in the States. We are helping school districts \ntremendously in many ways by giving more IDEA money, more ESEA money, \ntitle I money, and all of these different categories that allow school \ndistricts to then spend more money in salaries for teachers. Districts \nwill have a lot more money in total, so in addition to what they raise \nwith property taxes, these programs will provide a lot of relief to the \nschool districts.\n  Third, this provision adds more complexity to the code. If there is \nanything we hear, it is that people want simplicity. They don't want \nmore complexity. I know that doesn't sell very well when you are \nstanding in front of schoolteachers or the NEA. We want to give a lot \nmore to our teachers. Believe me, I am one of the strongest advocates \nin the State of Montana to give more money to our teachers.\n  We should not be helping school districts in this way with \nresponsibilities that are theirs when we have a better way, by giving \nmore dollars to the other programs that I mentioned: IDEA, ESEA, and \ntitle I, et cetera. I wish we could support this, but as much as we \nwould like to help, this is not a good policy to adopt.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have served for many years with the distinguished \nSenator from Montana on the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nother avenues in the Senate. I know him well and the strength of his \nvoice. But as he addressed the Senate tonight, I see pain in his heart.\n\n  When he said there is no policy, I refer the Senator--of course, I \nrealize he doesn't know every provision in the Federal Tax Code; this \nis awesome; I wish we had some provisions in here to simplify this--to \npage 47, section 62. The subsection is (a), which covers adjusted gross \nincome defined, and I read (b), certain expenses of performing artists. \nThe deductions allowed by section 162, which consist of expenses paid \nor incurred by qualified performing artists in connection with the \nperformances by him--and I presume ``her'' although it is not written--\nof services in the performing arts as an employee.\n  There it is. There is tax policy. My distinguished colleague said \nthere is no policy. Here is the policy, given to artists. Somehow, \nhaving some modest familiarity with performing artists, I take note \nthat their salaries are somewhat larger than those who are down at the \nvery foundation of our Nation, educating our young people.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was going to ask the Senator a question. He asked me a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I have answered it, but you may go right ahead, \nsir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to answer that question. I didn't say that \nthere is no policy. Those were not the words I used. I did say, though, \nthat I don't think we should start going down this road, which \nbasically implies that, whether the provision you mentioned is \nmeritorious or not, I don't know if it is wise to keep going down that \nroad.\n  I want to share a line that kind of struck me about this whole \nsubject. When my wife and I got married about 18 years ago, we went on \na honeymoon. On the honeymoon, we stopped off on the first night at a \nbed and breakfast. The next morning we were sitting down and having \nbreakfast, and the lady who ran the bed and breakfast was serving \nbreakfast. She knew, for some reason, I was in the Senate. I did not \nbroadcast that. I did not, frankly, want her to know that. I was on a \nhoneymoon with my bride. And this lady walked up to me right away after \nshe served us part of the breakfast and she started insisting that the \nred dress she was wearing should be tax deductible because it wasn't \nfair.\n  Here I am on my honeymoon, and I couldn't get away from it. I \nthought, first of all, it is in poor taste to be asking for that, but, \nsecond, it is clear that some people, with the jobs they have, need \nlegitimate expense deductions for the expenses they have. She is not \nentitled, this lady, to a deduction for the dress she wears.\n  We have to draw lines. We have to make choices. I think this is not a \nroad we want to continue going down. We do not want to further \ncomplicate the code with even more complexities.\n  The Senator is right, it is with a heavy heart that I must stand up \nand say I don't think this is good tax policy. Even with a heavy heart, \nI think this is not the wise way to go. There are better ways to \naccomplish the objective the Senator is so correctly seeking.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his very courteous reply.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 6 minutes 18 seconds.\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield whatever time the Senator needs.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee. I commend our colleague from Maine. I know my friend from \nMontana will appreciate these remarks. I also thank my friend from \nVirginia who, once again, has enlightened us with a little history on \nthe importance of a provision such as this.\n  From a personal standpoint, we all have personal stories. My older \nsister Carol is a teacher, has been for 35 years. She has taught over \nthe last 15 years or so in the public schools of Connecticut. I was \ntelling my friend from Maine, the author of the amendment, who is so \ncommitted to education, almost on a yearly basis I go with my sister to \nliterally buy from Home Depot and other places the planks to make the \nlittle bookcases in her classroom, literally buy pencils, paper, and \nother items.\n  I say this coming from the most affluent State in the country on a \nper capita income basis. She teaches in the city of Hartford which has \nhad serious problems. They do not have the resources, and she goes and \nbuys them out of her own pocket each year.\n  This is not some abstract idea. I have literally gone with her to do \nthis. I was shocked when I first discovered it. I couldn't believe she \nwas actually doing it. I thought there must be some pool of resources \nthat would allow for the accommodation of things such as pencils and \nboards and toilet paper, literally, for classrooms in a public school \nin the United States of America. I was stunned to discover she \nliterally dipped into her own pocket each year to buy the supplies.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I reclaim some of my time?\n  Mr. DODD. This is a modest amendment. We can't do enough with the \nESEA bill. I wish we could to make up the difference. This small little \npiece, when we so value education and those who commit themselves to \nthis, to say there is a small line here for $250, that we are going to \nprovide some relief to you for doing what you are doing, for those \nreasons I am a cosponsor and applaud my friend from Maine and my friend \nfrom Virginia for their eloquence and their support of this modest \nproposal.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have such reactions when I hear my \nfriends from Connecticut speak. There is no greater champion for kids \nthan the Senator. I am surprised he doesn't have a kids tie on because \noften he does wear one.\n  A couple points. Connecticut is one of the highest per capita income \nStates in America. My response is, let them try to pay teachers a \nlittle bit more.\n  Mr. DODD. No argument there.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am sure teachers agree with that. Another point, Mr. \nPresident, is that teachers can, today, deduct unreimbursed expenses. \nIt is in the law today. Just as any employee, they can deduct \nunreimbursed expenses. They can deduct them. If it were your sister \nbuying supplies, she can deduct all that. It is already deductible \ntoday, as my good friend from Virginia mentioned, as professional \nexpenses. We are not talking about another deduction but adding a \ncredit. It is something in addition to what teachers can already do. \nThey can deduct their professional expenses today, buying paper, and so \nforth. It is true they don't have the world's highest tax bracket, so \nthe value of the deduction isn't as much as it otherwise might be, but \nit helps a lot.\n  I think we should keep the policy of deducting unreimbursed expenses, \nbut let's not, on top of that, add a credit. I think we should just \nhold the line.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that we may have a minute and a \nhalf so our colleague from Maine can wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to respond to the legitimate point \nthe Senator from Montana has raised. It is true teachers can deduct \nunreimbursed expenses--theoretically.\n  The problem is, most teachers don't make enough money to itemize. So \nmost of them do not get the benefit of the itemized deduction that \nwould allow them to write off unreimbursed expenses.\n  In addition, even those who itemize have to reach a 2-percent floor \nof their income in order to claim the deduction. So for the vast \nmajority of our Nation's teachers, these are unreimbursed expenses for \nwhich there is no tax deduction at all.\n  We have to remember that we are talking about teachers who are not \nwell paid. I agree with the Senator from Montana that we should pay our \nteachers better. But we in the Senate can take a modest step by \nadopting this proposal to help our teachers who reach deep into their \npockets to pay for classroom supplies and paper materials and pay for \ncourse work. Can't we take the small step to say thank you for their \ninvestment in our Nation's children? I think we can, Mr. President. I \nhope the Senate will adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we yield on that. I commend my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is to be recognized.\n  The Chair recognizes the Democratic leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. On behalf of the Senator from Missouri, I will not take \nthe full amount of time because I know the Senator from West Virginia \nwants to offer his amendment. We didn't have as much of an opportunity \nas I had hoped earlier to talk about the Carnahan amendment. Let me \nagain compliment the Senator from Missouri for her effort in calling \nattention to one of the major concerns we have with the pending \nlegislation.\n\n  The pending legislation, of course, purports to provide tax relief to \nall Americans. But there is a glaring exception to the equity with \nwhich they attempt to provide that tax relief. That exception refers to \nthe fact of all the different tax rates and the reductions within those \nrates.\n  The one that is entirely left out is that 15-percent rate affecting \n72 million taxpayers. The largest percentage of income-tax payers in \nthe country pay at the 15-percent rate--72 million taxpayers pay the \nremaining 15-percent rate. Yet this bill completely skips over any rate \nreduction for those who fall in that category. There is a 3-percent \nrate reduction for those at the very top. There are rate reductions for \nthose at every other level. But the rate reduction for those who fall \nin the remaining 15-percent class has been omitted.\n  Now, what the bill does do, of course, is to provide a new rate of 10 \npercent for that income below $12,000. But everybody is entitled, \nacross the board, to the benefits of that new rate of 10 percent, and \nso those income levels, at $109,000, $166,000, and $297,000 all benefit \nfrom the 10-percent rate cut, as does the 15 percent. But over and \nabove that, those income levels beyond the 15-percent rate cut, beyond \n$65,000 gross, or $45,000 net, they all get substantial additional \nreductions in their rates.\n  But this bill leaves out the 72 million taxpayers who pay at the 15-\npercent rate.\n  Senator Carnahan's amendment says we think everybody ought to have a \nrate cut. So Senator Carnahan would reduce the 15-percent rate to 14 \npercent. It would provide for a rate cut, then, in every classification \nof income-tax payer. The way she pays for it is simply to provide for a \n1-percent rate cut in all the other classifications. So those making \nincomes at levels above $297,000 would get a 1-percent rate cut; those \nmaking incomes at $166,000 would get a rate cut of 1 percent; those \nmaking incomes of $109,000 would get a rate cut of 1 percent; and those \nmaking incomes of $45,000 would get a rate cut as well.\n  I can recall hearing vividly the President say there should not be \nwinners and losers as we cut taxes, that everybody ought to get a tax \ncut. Well, if he holds that philosophy, it would be hard for him to \nsupport this bill because this bill does create winners and losers. If \nyou fall in that 15-percent rate cut--if you are one of those 72 \nmillion taxpayers who fit into that income level between $12,000 and \n$45,000 net, you don't get a rate cut. They don't want\n\n[[Page S5083]]\n\nyou to know that, apparently, because there hasn't been much discussion \nabout it. But that rate was omitted. I don't know why it was omitted. I \ncan't understand how anybody could argue that it should be omitted. But \nit was omitted. So you are left out; you have no opportunity to \nbenefit.\n  So I am really hopeful, Mr. President, that we can solve that \nproblem. The only way I know to solve the problem is to address the \nissue as Senator Carnahan would address it--providing that the rate cut \ngo from 15 percent to 14 percent. One half of all South Dakotans fit \ninto this category. I would guess that between 40-50 percent of just \nabout all of our constituents fall into this category. We know that 72 \nmillion taxpayers fall into this category. It is so critical, it seems \nto me, in the interest of fairness. It is critical in the interest of \nattempting to provide the help to those middle-class working families \nwho probably need it as much as anybody in the upper income scales to \nprovide them some relief as well. That is what this amendment does. \nLet's give them that benefit of the new 10-percent bracket like all \nother rates are provided, but let's do what we are doing for all other \nrates as well, by providing them with at least some reduction. One \npercent may not be much to some, but 1 percent is a whole lot better \nthan absolutely nothing, which is what they get in this bill. That is \nwhat the amendment does.\n\n  In the interest of time, I will yield the floor. I just hope people \nwill take this into account, and, at the appropriate time on Monday, \nsupport the Carnahan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 679\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dayton, and Ms. \n     Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered 679.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To delay the reduction of the top income tax rate for \nindividuals until a real Medicare prescription drug benefit is enacted)\n\n       On page 9, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(4) Delay of top rate reduction.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (2), with \n     respect to a calendar year, no percentage described in that \n     paragraph shall be substituted for 39.6 percent until the \n     requirement of subparagraph (B) is met.\n       ``(B) Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit \n     enacted.--Legislation is enacted that adds an outpatient \n     prescription drug benefit to the medicare program established \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, without using \n     funds generated from any surpluses in any trust fund \n     established under the Social Security Act, that is--\n       ``(i) voluntary,\n       ``(ii) accessible to all medicare beneficiaries,\n       ``(iii) designed to assist medicare beneficiaries with the \n     high cost of prescription drugs, protect them from excessive \n     out of pocket costs, and give them bargaining power in the \n     marketplace,\n       ``(iv) affordable to all medicare beneficiaries and the \n     medicare program,\n       ``(v) administered using private sector entities and \n     competitive purchasing techniques, and\n       ``(vi) consistent with broader reform of the medicare \n     program.''.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is an amendment regarding \nMedicare prescription drug benefits. Senators Graham of Florida, \nWellstone, Kennedy, Harkin, Johnson, Kerry, Clinton, Dayton, and \nStabenow are all listed as cosponsors, and I am sure there will be \nmore.\n  The amendment is an extraordinarily serious amendment. It was the \namendment in the Finance Committee which got the second most votes of \nany of the amendments we did, and which I think should have passed.\n  This amendment takes the top rate reduction of our income tax as \nproposed under the compromise bill and makes it contingent upon the \npassage of a prescription drug bill, a prescription drug benefit that \nwould, in fact, be voluntary, accessible, affordable. This amendment, \ntherefore, is in the most immediate terms about priorities. It is a \nclassic choice that Senators are going to have to make that will say a \nlot to the American people.\n  It is clearly saying the Medicare prescription drug benefit that \nevery single political person on this Hill and those at the other end \nof the avenue who promised to the American people is just as important \nas a tax reduction for the wealthiest of our people.\n  This amendment does not preclude the tax cut--I wish that to be \nclear--but, rather, shifts the debate back to the promise we have made \nand about which we have been very firm and talked about endlessly at \nhearings and years of fora.\n  The amendment basically says the reduction in the top tax rate will \nnot go into effect until and unless an accessible, comprehensive, \nuniversal prescription drug benefit is enacted. A vote for this \namendment is not a vote against the tax cut. It is a vote in favor of \nthe prescription drug amendment. The doing of the one does not preclude \nthe doing of the other. It is just that you have to do the prescription \ndrug benefit to get to the top rate.\n  A vote in support of this amendment says you believe it is just as \nimportant that all Medicare beneficiaries who suffer all over this \ncountry in various ways and various forms against the devastating and \never-growing cost of prescription drugs, some of whom have to make \nterrible choices in their lives about this, that their plight is as \nimportant as those who are the wealthiest among us getting their top \ntax rate reduction.\n  A vote in support of this amendment says you believe the drug \nbenefits should take precedence over a tax cut. It does not say you \ncannot have a tax cut; it just says it should take precedence over a \ntax cut with a prescription drug benefit and you do not think seniors \nshould be forced to make the choices they do now.\n  We have made some progress. The budget resolution, thanks to the \nleadership of the Senator from the State of Iowa, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, explicitly rejects President Bush's prescription \ndrug benefit as being insufficient and accepts the principle that a \nprescription drug benefit should be available to all beneficiaries \nuniversally--not national in that sense, not nationalize, not \nsocialize, just universal; everybody.\n  It says that 39 million Americans who are Medicare beneficiaries and \nthose who are disabled should have this benefit. It is a proposal that \nprovides a premium subsidy to all Medicare beneficiaries, a proposal \nthat ensures true catastrophic coverage against drug costs, a proposal \nthat incorporates a new benefit into the Medicare Program. So it is \njust as reliable as all of the other benefits in the Medicare Program, \na proposal that does not completely rely on private insurance because \nprivate insurance has failed Medicare beneficiaries in terms of \ndelivering that benefit.\n\n  I will close with this because there is little time and others want \nto speak. One group, which is bipartisan, says:\n\n       We agree with you we cannot enact a tax break for the \n     wealthiest Americans. We should be sure our vulnerable \n     citizens receive the lifesaving drugs they must have.\n\n  This is an absolutely classic choice that Americans need to make \nabout prescription drugs. We are doing it on their behalf in this \namendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, and I hope there \nare other colleagues in the Chamber at this time who will speak for \nthis amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes to speak in \nopposition to the Carnahan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we heard the minority leader say there \nare 72 million people who do not get anything out of the bill; they do \nnot get a rate reduction because we do not reduce the 15-percent \nbracket.\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\n  There are different ways of cutting taxes. The way we have done it is \nto put in a significant percentage of income. People were saying 15 \npercent. We said we are going to tax that at 10 percent. The net result \nis we cut everybody's individual taxes. If they make up to $12,000 as \nan individual, they get a tax cut of $300. If it is a couple, they get \na tax cut of $600. That boils down to an across-the-board cut, if you \nwant to look at that, for people who are in the 10-percent bracket; if \nthey are married, it is a 10-percent tax cut.\n  You can do that one of two ways. You could say let's reduce the 15-\npercent bracket to 13.5 percent. I have suggested that. It might make \nthat simpler policy. That way we can say we reduced every bracket a \nsimilar amount. But the other brackets we reduced by 1 point. I \nsuggested 1.5 points. In other words, reduce the 15-percent bracket 10 \npercent so we can say we reduced every bracket by the same amount. I \nwill be happy to reduce upper brackets by 10 percent. We do not do \nthat, certainly not retroactively.\n  For people to assume we are not helping the lower or middle income is \nnot factually correct. The rate reduction we have in the bill reported \nout of the Finance Committee exceeds 1 percent. It exceeds what we have \ndone in every other bracket. It exceeds it for a couple reasons. One, \nit is retroactive to January 1 of this year. All other rates have to \nwait until January 1 of next year and get a 1-point reduction.\n  On the least income rate, we give them a 33-percent reduction on \ntheir first taxable income of $12,000. That is a $600 savings, and that \nis over a 1-percent reduction for everybody who is in the 15-percent \nbracket going all the way up to $44,000, $45,000 for a joint couple.\n  My point is there are different ways of doing it. For people to \ndemagog and say they do not get a rate reduction, well, they get a \nbigger tax cut by the way we have done it.\n  If you want to change the way we have done it and say for the 15-\npercent bracket we reduce it to 14 or 13.5, we could easily do that. It \nignores that we give a $500 tax credit per child, which benefits that \nincome category substantially, and ignores the fact the income tax \ncredit is refundable over my recommendation.\n  There is a lot of tax policy direction. I believe about $450 billion \nof the entire rate reduction, which is only $850-some billion, is \ndirected on this 10-percent bracket, on the lowest income. For people \nto make this allegation that 72 million people are ignored is hogwash. \nThat is not correct. We could redo it by rate reduction, we could redo \nit in any number of different ways, but this group gets the biggest \npercentage of reduction of anybody in this tax bill. Upper income \npeople, anybody else at a 28-percent rate, 31-percent rate, 33-percent \nrate, 36-percent rate, 39-percent rate, get a 1 point reduction for 4 \nyears. We are giving a great percent or point reduction for low income \nretroactive to January 1 of this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Carnahan amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I obviously was mistaken. I did not realize the people at \nthe higher income brackets did not also get the benefit of the $600 \nreduction which comes by inserting the 10-percent bracket at the \ncommencement of the tax table.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I never said they didn't.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. People in the 39.6-percent bracket, do they get the same \ntax reduction as the people in the 10-percent bracket in dollar terms?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To answer my colleague's question, yes, the $600 applies \nto all taxpayers. The percent reduction did not happen for upper income \ntaxpayers. The fact is they only get 1 point reduction in taxes in the \nfirst 4 years of this bill, and that is January 1 of next year. \nPercentagewise, lowest income people get a 33-percent reduction \nretroactive back to this year.\n  My point is you can do taxes different ways. Maybe a better way is to \ntake the 15-percent rate and make it 14 percent, not to do it in \naddition to the 10-percent rate.\n  So if colleagues want to change the policy we have, not do the 10-\npercent rate, and move the 15-percent rate to a 14-percent rate, if \nthey like that, I am happy, but they do not get as significant a \nreduction as provided in the bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. There are only 20 minutes on the amendment. We have 10, \nand I know I have used 8, so I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. At the appropriate time, I will ask a question about what \nis the logic behind giving a 1-percent cut to the people at the 39.6-\npercent bracket but not any cut at all to the people in the 15-percent \nbracket, but I cannot at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 679\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from the State of \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There are a lot of ways in which we can determine what \nour real priorities are. One of those is not what we say. I imagine \nvirtually every Member of this Senate at some point has said they favor \na comprehensive prescription drug benefit for older Americans.\n  What really counts is not what we say because we can say all things \nto all people. What really counts is things such as how do we spend our \nmoney--that is a true indicator of one's priorities--or how do we spend \nour time--that is a true indicator of one's priority--or what things we \ndo first.\n  We had a period when we lived by the slogan ``Social Security \nfirst.'' We were supposed to fix Social Security to deal with that big \nwave of baby boomers as our first priority. We obviously didn't accept \nthat because we didn't deal with that, and we are not dealing with it \ntonight.\n  What we are saying is our first priority is to cut the tax rates for \nthe wealthiest among us. The people who earn the largest amount of \nincome in our society are about to get somewhere in the nature of 30 \npercent of this $1.35 trillion tax cut.\n  We are saying with this amendment there is another thing that needs \nto be first. That is to be faithful to our commitment to provide a \nprescription medication benefit to our older Americans. This is the \nopportunity to express the sincerity of that commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. We have been talking \nabout it for years and years and years. Mr. President, 2001 is the time \nto deliver a prescription drug benefit for older Americans.\n  We have learned a number of things during the years we have debated \nthis issue. We know prescription drugs are often the best, sometimes \nthe only, way to treat many of the diseases faced by the elderly. To \ndeny these drugs is essentially to sign a death warrant.\n  We have also learned that many Medicare beneficiaries have no access \nto any prescription drug benefit, that many others are finding the \nbenefits they have to be inadequate, unstable, and evaporate. We have \nlearned the majority of seniors are faced with a difficult choice of \npaying extremely high prices at the retail outlets or forgoing \nmedically necessary prescription drugs. We have learned those who are \nable to purchase medicines are seeing an ever-increasing share of their \nfixed incomes going toward drugs as prices continue to increase. We saw \nit last year for many of the most significant drugs for older \nAmericans. That increase was in the range of 15 to 20 percent.\n  The time is long overdue for the Senate to say first things first. \nAnd first is going to be to prepare our older citizens for a life of \nquality and dignity and affordability. The most fundamental step we can \ntake to achieve that goal is to include prescription drugs as a basic \nbenefit under the Medicare program available to all beneficiaries. Over \n40 million Medicare beneficiaries should not have to continue to wait \nfor Congress, to wait for Congress to get around to recognizing the \nimportance of something as basic as their health care and the central \nrole of prescription drugs in protecting their health.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment and \nsaying first things first, prescription drugs for older Americans are \nof equal importance to reducing the tax on the most wealthy of our \ncitizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I might ask the Presiding Officer how much time \nremains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 52 seconds. The other side has 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is \nhappy to yield 4 minutes to the junior Senator from the State of \nMichigan.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia. \nI appreciate his strong and consistent leadership on this critical \nissue. Thank you for proposing this amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor and proud to join with our Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, \nto talk this evening about what is the most urgent, critical issue \nfacing our seniors and many of our families.\n  I wish we had the same sense of urgency about updating Medicare to \ncover modern medicine, which is prescription drugs, as we do with the \nsense of urgency about the underlying tax bill.\n  I support tax cuts. I consistently supported tax cuts. But I know \nthis, when we set the priorities for our country, just like when we set \nthe priorities in our own family, if we need to ask the top 1 percent \nof the wage earners of this country to be able to wait just a little \nbit until we can modernize Medicare for our seniors, I think that is a \nfair request. I think it is fair and reasonable for us to be placing a \nsense of urgency on the senior citizen who is going to get up tomorrow \nmorning, sit down at the breakfast table and decide, do I eat today or \ndo I get my medicine; the seniors who are going to decide tomorrow \nwhether or not to cut their pills in half so they stretch a little bit \nlonger or whether they are going to take them every other week.\n  I have had doctors approach me, greatly concerned because they have \nelderly patients who are trying to self-regulate so they can last just \na little bit longer with their medications because they know they are \nnot going to be able to afford to buy that prescription.\n  I guess each and every one of us have spoken about this issue and \ncertainly we have had people in our States speaking to us. I only wish \nwe would have the same sense of urgency about this issue as the \ncampaign television commercials of last year. Many of us talked about \nthis, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the building. We \nhave talked and talked about this issue. We know we have to address it. \nWe have that opportunity tonight through this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to do just that.\n  This is a question simply of priorities. This does not change the tax \ncut other than to ask less than 1 percent of the population to defer \nuntil we can update prescription drug coverage under Medicare. This \ndoes not change the tax cut for any of the taxpayers, but it asks one \ngroup of taxpayers if they can wait just a little bit in order for our \nseniors, who have been waiting so long, to be able to have us address \nwhat is their most pressing issue.\n  I commend my colleague again. I cannot think of anything more \nimportant, in terms of addressing priorities of our country, than to \nkeep the full promise of Medicare that was made over 35 years ago.\n  We said at that time that we would provide health care for anyone \nover age 65 or the disabled. If we do not update this system to cover \nprescription drug coverage, we are not keeping the promise.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important amendment, and I \nwill yield any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to address the Rockefeller \namendment that is before us, and I think I can speak to what the \nSenator from Michigan, the Senator from Florida, and the Senator from \nWest Virginia have raised as legitimate concerns.\n  I will start over here with the Senator from Michigan. There is as \nmuch urgency about taxes as there is prescription drugs and Medicare. \nWe probably haven't had as many hearings this year on Medicare and \nprescription drugs as we have taxes, but over the last 12 months we \nhave had a lot more hearings in the Senate Finance Committee on \nMedicare and prescription drugs than we have on taxes.\n  The reason we are having taxes up before prescription drugs is simply \nthat the Tax Code was written in 1916 and there have been a lot of \nchanges to it since then. For the most part, it is a matter of just \nchanging a few words here or there. On the other hand, I have to admit \nit is complicated by adding a lot of new language. But when you are \ndealing with the legislation we are dealing with on this tax bill, it \nis not a complicated item to change the Tax Code to some extent. Maybe \na little bit on the estate tax provisions we have here, but otherwise \nit is a matter of fine-tuning.\n  When it comes to prescription drugs, we are writing a whole new \nprogram. The Democrat staff and Republican staff are working on it \nright now. They are charged from Senator Baucus and me that we want to \nbring this up by the latter half of July. My staff tells me that it is \nquite a job for them to do that. I am convinced they will meet that \ndeadline.\n  So it is a matter of doing what we can do now and taking the \nnecessary time to do what is new and to do it right. That is our \ncommitment, to doing it right.\n  There is not a greater urgency in my committee for taxes over \nprescription drugs. It is just a case of when you can get each done. \nThat is true of a lot of other things we are going to be dealing with \nas well, trade and Social Security.\n  In the case of being all things to all people, in Iowa you can't be \nall things to all people. I don't know about Florida. But if I were \nspeaking about all those things you said, the people of Iowa would know \nI was not telling the truth. Maybe there is something about me; I can't \ncover up very well. But I have been telling people in Iowa that we are \ngoing to have prescription drugs legislation when we hope to get it out \nof the committee. I have even suggested there are some people in my \nparty who maybe would rather not do anything, put it over to next year, \nget an election year, get it all caught up--we want to do that on the \nfloor of this Senate this October or November and get it out of the way \nso it doesn't come into the election cycle.\n  The other thing is resources are part of what the Senator from \nFlorida is talking about and the Senator from West Virginia is talking \nabout. Remember, we are not very far apart on the resources, at least \nin the budget resolution. My colleague supported and offered--I don't \nknow whether he offered it, but you at least spoke for a $311 billion \npot of money that is put aside for Medicare. My amendment was $300 \nbillion. My amendment carried; yours did not carry. It wasn't because \nthe $11 billion one carried or the other did not carry, it was where \nthe source of money was. Mine was from the contingency; yours was from \nsome reduction of the taxes. But you cannot say the resources are not \nset aside.\n  Is that enough? I don't know. But it is what we have set aside--$11 \nbillion separate from what you thought was enough from what I thought \nwas enough. Frankly, we don't know. It depends on how good you want to \ndo it. If you want to do it the way most of the bills are introduced to \nmake sure there is no less than a 50-percent subsidy, it is very \nexpensive. But if you start it with the idea you are going to have \nuniversal access and in the universal access have some ability to pay, \nthere is no reason why you have to have free pharmaceuticals. You ought \nto have it based on the ability to pay. We will start it with the \namount of money we can and start at the bottom of the economic ladder \nand move up and cover as many people as we can and do it in a way that \nbrings the forces of the marketplace in, some bulk purchasing.\n\n  There are probably a lot of things I can tell you that ought to be \nbrought into the program to make it so we can provide more prescription \ndrugs at a lower level of cost, both to the taxpayers and to the \nconsumer as well. But we are involved in this. So I think we do not \nneed, either from the standpoint of legislative priorities, from the \nstandpoint of the resources that are set aside, or a commitment on the \npart of both political parties--maybe not everybody in both political \nparties--but the commitment of people in political parties to get this \njob done.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands you do not have to adopt \nSenator Rockefeller's amendment to make sure prescription drugs are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\nto get the attention that the last election brought to it. The \neconomics of it are enough, but let's say the ultimate is when both \npolitical parties are campaigning on something, it is an issue in the \ncampaign, that that is a commitment to getting something done.\n  So I ask rejection of the Rockefeller amendment based upon what is a \ncommitment on the part of many people in this Congress to move ahead on \nthis issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 1 minute, the opposition \nhas 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are parts of this job that are not \nfun, and one of them is standing up and saying: I cannot agree with my \ngood friend from West Virginia. Believe me, he is a good friend. There \nis no stronger advocate for seniors and prescription drug benefits than \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  In many respects, we are here because of a man named Brian \nSchweitzer. Who is Brian Schweitzer? Brian Schweitzer is a man from the \nState of Montana who ran for the Senate. He mobilized this Nation, or \nat least got this Nation to realize that we need to provide a \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare.\n  He took busloads of seniors to Canada, where seniors could buy \nprescription drugs for much less than they cost in the United States. \nHe took busloads of seniors to Mexico, where seniors bought drugs for \nmuch less than they could buy the same drugs, manufactured by the same \ndrug companies, in the United States. He basically started a kind of \npopular ``prairie fire'' for the right reasons.\n  As a consequence, this issue probably was a major component in about \nfive Senate elections this last year. It could have been determinative \nin a couple, but it was certainly a major issue. And for good reason.\n  Last year, the 50 most popular prescription drugs used by seniors \nrose by twice the rate of inflation. Fifteen of those 50 drugs \nincreased by three times the rate of inflation, and eleven of the 50 \nmost popular drugs used by seniors increased by three times the rate of \ninflation. Utilization--a fancy term for ``use''--is increasing. Costs \nare increasing.\n  We all know that if we were to write a Medicare bill today--not as we \ndid in 1965--we would include outpatient drug coverage under Medicare. \nThat is a given. We also know that it is a very expensive proposition. \nWe have to write a prescription drug benefit bill that is fair, that \nmakes sense, that is responsible, and that helps seniors.\n  Let's take a drug that is very popular among seniors, Prilosec. \nPrilosec is a prescription drug that relieves ulcers and similar \ngastrointestinal illnesses. The out-of-pocket expense for Prilosec is \nabout $1,400 a year. The average Social Security benefits are $10,000 a \nyear. So that means that more than 10 percent of Social Security \nbenefits would go toward buying Prilosec for a senior with an ulcer.\n  And we know that seniors take a lot more prescriptions than Prilosec, \nwhich helps them so much. We all know the importance of prescription \ndrug therapies. That is a given. I do not think anybody disagrees with \nthat in this Chamber.\n  The real question is, how do we design a benefit, and when? I tell \nyou, I will work as hard as I can to get a prescription drug benefit \npassed this year, working with my good friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley. But I do not think it is wise to condition the enactment of \nmajor legislation upon other legislation. In fact, I believe it is \nunconstitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled that you cannot condition \nenactment of legislation upon a contingency. It is unconstitutional. It \nwould not stand constitutional scrutiny.\n  Although the constitutional issue is one reason, the second reason I \nspeak in opposition to this amendment is a public policy reason. It \ndoes not make sense to condition passage of one major bill upon passage \nof another major bill. We should take up issues as they come up, one at \na time. It is perhaps a bit simplistic, but you take each event as it \ncomes. We cannot condition hour 6 against hour 8 or 11, and so forth. \nIt cannot be done.\n\n  So I say to my very good friend from West Virginia--I mean, he bleeds \nfor these issues, and correctly so, because it is the right thing to \ndo. But there is a time and place for everything. One can question, \nwhat is the right time? The right place? There is a proper time and \nplace. According to Ecclesiastics, there is a time and place for \neverything.\n  I urge us to resist the Siren song of contingency and, rather, to \ntake up the issue of prescription drugs when the time comes--and that \ntime is after the passage of this tax legislation, which I suspect will \npass.\n  In relation to the conference report, I am not sure the conference \nreport is going to be agreed to. That is a very real concern that I \nhave. But certainly in the next three months or so, we can sit down and \nwork hard to get a prescription drug benefit, a universal benefit, \nalong the principles we all know we need and want, passed this year. \nAnd we can do it.\n  Let's do that, and pledge to do that. But I do not think it is wise \npublic policy to condition passage of one major piece of legislation on \nanother. Besides, I believe it is unconstitutional. So why are we are \ngoing to do something that is going to be ruled unconstitutional? Let's \njust do our tax business now and then get the prescription drug \nbusiness done. Let's aim for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have a minute remaining.\n  I would simply say, I think the point is that the words that have \nbeen spoken are good and encouraging. There is a time and a place for \neverything, but there is not necessarily the money for everything. It \nis this Senator's view--and I think anybody who does the mathematics of \nthis bill, much less the tax cut bills which will come later on--we \nwill be depleting the revenue available for us to spend on anything. \nThere will simply not be the money to pass a prescription drug benefit \nin July or in August or at any time unless we adopt this amendment. The \nmoney will not be there. You have to have the $300 or $311 billion, and \nit will not be there.\n  I strongly, therefore, for 39 million Medicare beneficiaries and for \nthose who are disabled and on a voluntary basis want to make use of \nthis, urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Because if they do \nnot, there will not be a prescription drug benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The manager has a minute and a half.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Can we reserve our time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 685\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nIndiana is recognized and is in control of time for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to modify my amendment prior to the vote in relation to the \namendment on Monday. Let me assure the managers that this modification \nwill not substantially change the effect of the amendment. It is to \nmake some minor technical corrections to the current draft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from the \ngreat State of Maine and, in doing so, would like to thank her for her \ncourage and steadfast support of this amendment. Without her support, \nwe would not be where we are today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his \nleadership on an issue in which we share a mutual goal that we wish to \nadvance and address in this Congress with respect to this legislation. \nI thank him for his commitment and persistence in bringing this to the \nattention of our colleagues in the Senate and in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are offering today in conjunction \nwith our colleagues is on a bipartisan basis. In fact, Senator Bayh and \nI have worked together since early March in addressing this issue, in \nwhich 11 of our colleagues have offered this legislation with us, to \naddress the potential for ensuring that surplus projections are \nrealized over the next 10 years with respect to this tax package, as \nwell as all the other spending proposals that will be considered by \nthis Congress and future Congresses.\n  This legislation really came to us as a result of Chairman \nGreenspan's testimony back in January before the Senate Budget \nCommittee. I think all of us\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\nunderstand--and Senator Bayh and I have had many conversations in this \nrespect--that we want to ensure that our hard-fought effort to \neliminate deficits and buying down the debt is not undone because our \ncurrent surplus projections do not materialize in the future.\n  That is why this amendment specifically will establish a trigger, \nbased on the recommendations that were proposed by Chairman Greenspan, \nthat links the tax cuts and spending increases to actual fiscal \noutcomes over the next 10 years.\n  The bottom line is, it is absolutely imperative that we make tax \nrelief and spending increases work, not only for American families but \nalso for the future well-being of this country.\n  We have a projection of $5.6 trillion in surpluses over the next 10 \nyears. Those are projections that have been made by the Congressional \nBudget Office. We have an obligation to be responsible stewards of that \nsurplus so we can address a variety of pressing national needs.\n  We are setting aside money for prescription drugs, an issue just \nmentioned in this Chamber. We are setting aside money for education \nwhich we are also concurrently debating in the Senate. We are also \nsetting aside money to bring down the debt over the next 10 years so we \ncan reduce the debt and, indeed, eliminate the national debt. We are \nalso setting aside all the surpluses that belong to the Social Security \nas well as the Medicare trust funds. We also understand that these \nburgeoning surpluses are predicated on certain assumptions upon which \nthe tax cuts as well as our spending policies are being developed. We \nhave no idea whether or not these surpluses are going to materialize \nover the next 10 years.\n  While undoubtedly these projections are predicated on some very sound \nassumptions and the best available economic and budgetary estimates, \nthe fact is they just happen to be estimates. Indeed, if the past is \nprologue, there is a 50-percent chance that CBO's projection of a \nsurplus over the next 5 years will actually miss the mark by more than \n1.8 percent of the GDP. That is $245 billion in the fifth year alone, \nwith an estimated on-budget surplus in 2006 of over $276 billion which \nincludes a surplus in the Medicare trust fund of $44 billion. The \nimpact of such an error would be disastrous as Congress would be forced \nto dip into the Medicare surplus in that year alone, even absent any \nchanges in tax and spending policies.\n  It also bears noting, as it shows on this chart I have behind me of \nthe 10-year projection, nearly two-thirds of the projected surplus will \nnot accrue until after the fifth year. In fact, only $2 trillion, or 36 \npercent of the surplus, will accrue over the coming 5 years, while 64 \npercent of the surplus will materialize in the final 5 years. So if \nsurpluses prove to be substantially lower in the fifth year alone, the \nimpact on subsequent years will likewise be substantial.\n  Any long-term cuts in spending policies premised on the higher \nestimates could quickly force us to use our Social Security surpluses, \nput our budget back in the red, or use Medicare surpluses, all of which \nare not options available to this Congress or future Congresses.\n  That is why we came to this point in terms of developing a trigger \nmechanism: How best do we address this problem in a most prudent \nfashion. That is why I commend the Senator from Indiana and the Senator \nfrom Michigan, who is here, an ardent supporter of making sure we \nadhere to these surpluses and these projections over the next 10 years, \nas any State in the country has to do with their constitutional \namendments to balance the budget.\n  In fact, many of us have been ardent supporters of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. We did so and thought so because we \nknew we had to adhere to a bottom line. So our principle is very \nsimple. We are saying that in the years 2004 and 2006, we will have to \ntake a window, we will have to look at whether or not we are adhering \nto our debt reduction goals.\n\n  In the event the Secretary of the Treasury indicates that we will not \nmeet those goals in the years 2005 and 2007, then Congress obviously \nwill have to take immediate action to cut back, to stop the next phase \nof the tax cut or the next phase of spending increases over the rate of \ninflation.\n  We have laid out the debt targets. They are laid out in this \namendment, according to the Congressional Budget Office economic \noutlook. We make sure we have the ability to respond to the Secretary \nof the Treasury's report that will be made initially in July and then \nimmediately after Labor Day on the status of our progress towards \nachieving this debt reduction goal for the year. If the Secretary \nreports that the goal will not be met, Congress will then know, very \nclearly, that steps must be taken to get us back on track.\n  As I said, if the debt targets are not met in the years 2005 and \n2007, the scheduled phase-in of the new tax cuts and the mandatory \nspending, which is additional mandatory spending, new phased-in \ndiscretionary spending above the rate of inflation will be delayed for \n1 year or until the target is met in future years.\n  In all of the other years in this 10-year window, we will have what \nis called the midcourse correction review. Again, it will give us the \nopportunity to analyze our progress made towards debt reduction, \nensuring that we are still on track each and every year for the \nspecified targets that will be laid out in this amendment, the ones \nthat have been established in the Congressional Budget Office report \nfor each and every year.\n  In the event that any Member of the House or Senate chooses to raise \na privileged motion to address the spending for the next year or \nmandatory spending or the new tax cuts, they will have a privileged \nresolution on the floor of the House for consideration. And amendments \ncan be offered to adjust, during the course of the midcourse correction \nreview, the tax cut and spending that would be adjusted. Any subsequent \namendment of that kind would have to be proportionate so that it could \nnot be adjusted just from the tax cut side of the equation or just from \nspending alone.\n  We think this is an effective mechanism because it gives us an \nopportunity to be able to analyze, as any business does in this \ncountry, any family does, any State that has to abide by its \nconstitutional requirements to balance the budget, as to whether or not \nwe are proceeding on track with the surpluses, with these projections, \nand with the debt reduction. It will give us the opportunity in 2 of \nthe years over the next 10 years for an automatic trigger in which we \nwill have the opportunity to respond to the next phase-in of a tax cut \nor new spending policies.\n  It is not a retroactive tax increase, as many have said. We are not \ngoing to be doing anything retroactive either with respect to spending \nor with tax cuts. It would all be prospective. It gives us an ability \nto look forward to make sure we are being prudent so we do not repeat \nthe past with respect to deficits in accruing the kind of national debt \nthat has been a burden to this country.\n  As I said, I hope my colleagues who worked so hard over the years for \nthe passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget will \nsee this as an effort to maintain similar fiscal responsibility. We \ncannot afford to see the hard work that went into reaching the desired \ngoal of balancing the budget that we have made a reality today be \nundone by the adoption of either tax or spending policies that are \nallowed to move forward unchecked.\n\n  For those who believe that the assumptions on which this budget and \nthis specific tax bill are based are sound, the trigger poses no threat \nas it would never be turned on.\n  May I ask the Senator for additional time?\n  Mr. BAYH. Yes, absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking to use Senator Bayh's \ntime? The Senator's 10 minutes allotted from the Senator from Indiana \nhave expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If we want to speak and raise any questions, that is \nthe only time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana may yield time.\n  Mr. BAYH. I am happy to yield time to my colleague from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate the time of the Senator from Indiana. I will \ndefer and wait towards the end. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from Maine who so \neloquently outlined the case for this amendment. I am grateful to her \nand others on her side of the aisle who have joined with us in this \ncause. It is truly a bipartisan effort in an institution that all too \noften is characterized by too much partisanship and divisiveness.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Stabenow from Michigan, from whom we \nwill hear in a few moments, who has been a steadfast supporter of \nfiscal responsibility in this effort.\n  I also echo what Senator Snowe mentioned, that Alan Greenspan, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, endorses this approach. The Concord \nCoalition, one of the foremost institutions dedicated to fiscal \nresponsibility and rectitude, endorses this initiative. The Progressive \nPolicy Institute, also dedicated to sound economic policies and fiscal \npolicies, endorses this approach.\n  I rise because I support tax cuts. I rise because I support tax cuts \nthat are fiscally responsible, that do not put our Nation on a path to \nreturn to the days of debt and deficit from which we have so recently \nextricated ourselves.\n  I support tax cuts that accommodate our other important priorities, \nespecially Social Security and Medicare, ensuring that our Nation will \nkeep that commitment to our parents and our commitment to our children \nthat we will fulfill our own obligations in supporting the retirement \nsystem of our parents and grandparents.\n  I support tax cuts that honor our Nation's most cherished enduring \nvalues: thrift, personal responsibility, self-reliance, and not asking \nour children to pay the bills that we today incur, but, instead, taking \ncare of our own obligations.\n  That is why I, along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nam honored to support this amendment. This amendment will put tax \ncuts--meaningful tax cuts--for the American people into place \nimmediately and irrevocably. It will pay down the debt more rapidly \nthan the approach suggested by the administration and the one reported \nfrom the committee. This amendment dedicates the surpluses in Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds to the cause of debt reduction, \nthereby not only paying down the Nation's debt more rapidly, but \nensuring the integrity and solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n  This amendment will strengthen our economy by paying down the debt \nmore rapidly, to keep interest rates low, investment and productivity \ngrowth high, perpetuating the virtuous cycle of the last several years \nthat has seen unprecedented economic expansion across our country--22 \nmillion new jobs and 2 million new businesses.\n  I have supported tax cuts throughout my career, first as Governor, \nsigning the largest tax cut in the history of our State; and I have \npreviously supported tax cuts in this body. Indeed, I can support the \ntax cuts before us. I speak not only for myself but for many Americans \nwhen I say the uncertainty inherent in 10-year projections disturbs me \nbecause it raises a very real and present danger of returning to \nsizable debts and deficits.\n  This would be a great problem for our country. It is something I \nbelieve we must address in a responsible way if we are going to have \ntax cuts that truly serve all of the priorities of the American people. \nThe approach we have suggested is a commonsense approach. In the early \nyears, when the surpluses are most reliable, the tax cut will go into \neffect immediately and be irrevocable. In future years, we will ensure \nthe surplus that makes the tax cuts possible actually materializes, and \nthat we don't dip into Social Security or Medicare, jeopardizing those \nsystems, to make the tax cut possible. That needs to be our top \npriority.\n  Again, we need to remind ourselves of the inherent uncertainty in 10-\nyear projections. As the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. O'Neill, \nsuggested, 10-year projections ``aren't worth the paper they are \nwritten on.'' And they are not. We owe it to the American people to \ntake prudent steps to ensure the actions we take today, in fact, lead \nto the results that we promise tomorrow.\n  Finally, two brief observations. Let me counter some of the \ncriticisms offered with regard to our approach. First, the issue of \nuncertainty. In fact, a trigger amendment in the tax cut creates \ngreater certainty. It creates greater certainty in the bond market by \nensuring that interest rates can be low because the debt will actually \nbe paid down and deficits will not return.\n  There was a headline in the Wall Street Journal Friday saying that \ninterest rates were beginning to rise because of concern that we might \nreturn as a nation to the time of deficits again. The trigger creates \ngreater certainty by ensuring that we do not return to deficits and \nthereby reassures the bond market. It also ensures that we won't have \nfuture tax increases--one of the greatest causes of uncertainty that we \ncan have.\n\n  Following the tax cut of 1981, we had six separate tax increases in \nthis country for the American people. That is real uncertainty. A \ntrigger amendment will avoid that. As my colleague from Maine \nsuggested, there is nothing in the trigger amendment that will lead to \na tax increase. On the contrary, the phases of the tax cut that go into \neffect, because we can afford them, will be irrevocable. There is \nnothing that will repeal any tax cuts that have been put into place in \nthis trigger amendment. On the contrary, it merely delays future phases \nof tax cuts until the surpluses that make them possible arrive.\n  The only counterargument to that would be to suggest that we dip into \nSocial Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts--something I am sure \nthe majority of my colleagues do not support.\n  This will not go into effect should we run the risk of entering a \nrecession. First of all, the greatest risk of deficits and a return to \ndebt is not that we have a significant recession, but that estimates \nare merely wrong and the errors compounded over a 10-year period lead \nto a sizable error in our projections. For example, a mere four-tenths \nof 1 percent difference in GDP and productivity growth would lead to a \ntrillion-dollar difference in the surplus estimates, running a real \nrisk of returning to deficits and increasing the national debt.\n  In case we do face the prospect of a recession, we have included a \nprovision that would waive the trigger in the event the blue-chip \nforecast of the most prominent private sector economists predicts 4 \nconsecutive months where the growth rate in this country will slow to \nan unacceptable level.\n  Finally, regarding criticisms, let me say that this does not favor \nspending at the expense of tax cuts. On the contrary, as my colleague \nfrom Maine so ably pointed out, spending increases are held to the rate \nof inflation--half the rate of spending increases contained in the \nbudget bill voted on last week, and much lower than rates in increased \nspending in recent years. If this had been the fact, spending would be \nmuch lower than today.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. Let us go forward and enact \nsignificant tax relief for the American people. Let us enact this tax \nrelief in a way that is fiscally responsible and would hold sure that \nour children and grandchildren do not live to rue the day of unintended \nerrors that we made that could have been avoided. Let us enact these \ntax cuts in ways to preserve Social Security and Medicare. Let us enact \nthese tax cuts in ways that will be true to the enduring values of \nself-reliance and self-sufficiency that have always made our Nation \ngreat.\n  Finally, let me say we must learn the lesson of history. The last \ntime this Chamber was called upon to make decisions of this magnitude, \nwe, frankly, didn't do a very good job. The decisions that were made \nand the votes that were cast led to the largest deficits in the history \nof our country, the largest increase in the national debt in the \nhistory of our country, to a lower rate of economic growth and a lower \nstandard of living for the American people. Let that not happen again.\n\n  This amendment and the fiscal responsibility that it will bring to \nthese tax cuts will ensure that all of the elements of prosperity for \nthe American people will be put into law and that, it seems to me, is \nour responsibility.\n  I will now be pleased to yield to my colleague and friend from the \ngreat State of Michigan, Senator Stabenow, who has been a steadfast \nsupporter of this effort. She is new to this body, but she is already \nmaking a tremendous impact.\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Bayh and \nSenator Snowe, for their leadership on this important issue. We joined \ntogether back in the beginning of March with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to come together and lay out the concept that had been \npresented in the Budget Committee by Chairman Alan Greenspan. Both \nSenator Snowe and I have the opportunity to serve on that committee, \nand we heard the chairman talking about the need to, in some way, phase \nin tax cuts as we continued to pay down the debt. He cautioned us that \nwe should maintain our focus on paying down the debt and fiscal \nresponsibility and, if we did it right, we could do both; we could pay \ndown our debt, we could protect Social Security and Medicare by doing \nit, and we could provide meaningful tax relief.\n  After listening to him and being a part of that process, I was \npleased to join with my colleagues in working to put together an \napproach that puts into place the guarantees for fiscal responsibility, \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare, and ensuring that we maintain \nthe track we are on economically as a country, which has brought us to \nthis wonderful time of low interest rates, low unemployment, \nopportunity for our workers, our small businesses, our farmers, and all \nof our families who have benefited from the last 8 years of prosperity.\n  As Senator Bayh was speaking about not returning to the past, I \nthought about when I was in Michigan as a State legislator in the time \nof the 1980s and we went through some extremely difficult times. \nMichigan is one of those States where if someone sneezes across the \ncountry, we get a big cold, because the fact is, we had high \nunemployment, high interest rates, and deficits at the State as well as \nthe national level. Many tough decisions were made to get us to this \npoint.\n\n  I was honored in 1997 to be in the U.S. House of Representatives and \ncast a vote to balance the budget. I know there were those who came \nbefore me who had to make very difficult decisions to get us to that \npoint.\n  I believe it is my responsibility and urge all of us to join together \nin accepting the responsibility of maintaining the fiscal course we are \non--fiscal responsibility and guaranteeing that we do not use the \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds for either spending or tax \ncuts.\n  This particular proposal will put in place the mechanisms to \nguarantee that does not happen. The tax cuts proceed, the phase-ins \nproceed unless we find we are dipping into Medicare and Social Security \nto pay for them or for spending. We are saying it does not matter what \nSocial Security and Medicare are used for; if it is not for Medicare or \nSocial Security, it is not OK.\n  This trigger puts in place the mechanism to guarantee we continue to \npay down our debt, that we are, in fact, keeping the promise of \nMedicare and Social Security, and that we are providing tax relief in a \nresponsible way.\n  I am very proud to have joined my colleagues. I joined Senators today \nin voting for tax relief. I have in the past throughout my time of \npublic service, and I intend to do that again, but I also intend to \nmake sure that whatever I am doing in terms of my votes, I keep first \nand foremost the value of fiscal responsibility at the forefront and \nthat I am keeping the promise of Medicare and Social Security as we do \nthat.\n  If, in fact, we do not take the time to pay down our national debt, \nabout which we have all been talking for so many years, if we do not \ntake this time to eliminate as much of that debt as possible so that \nour children do not have to bear that burden in the future, then when \nwill we? If we do not do it during this opportunity of fiscal \nsurpluses, when will we?\n  I urge my colleagues to join us. The bipartisan amendment that is \nbefore us is one that I hope we will enact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we do not have a lot of time, so I cannot \ngo into great detail. I believe we have 5 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with all due respect to my very good \nfriends, this is an uncertainty layered upon an uncertainty. The \nuncertainty is whether the surplus target will be met. The uncertainty \nlayered on top of the uncertainty is whether the trigger will be \npulled.\n  We cannot legislate certainty. We can only exercise good judgment. \nWe, as a Congress, in these next years, have to decide what to do \naccording to the circumstances at the time and exercise good judgment \nas to what we should do.\n  Unfortunately, nobody has discussed the substance of this amendment. \nIt is because we are in this time constraint where everything is \nrushed, and we are in message amendment time. Nobody has looked at the \nsubstance. There have been no hearings on this.\n  Let me tell you what this thing does. I am all in favor of the \nintent, but if this is enacted, we are making a mockery of the \nCongress--a mockery. First, you cannot and should not limit public debt \nmanagement. The Treasury Secretary has to have discretion in debt \nmanagement. Right off the top, we are tying the hands of the Treasury \nSecretary, for whatever reason he or she may want to borrow more, sell \nmore securities, sell more bonds for domestic reasons or for \ninternational reasons.\n  Secretary Rubin has said consistently that we should not tie debt \nmanagement to fiscal policy. You should not do it. It is wrong.\n  I understand why the Senator from Indiana is offering this amendment, \nand I understand why the Senator from Maine is offering the amendment.\n  Let me talk about the uncertainties in this amendment. I do not know \nif Senators know what is in the amendment. This amendment essentially \nprovides--I will summarize it--scheduled debt reduction targets, in \neven numbered years, and the Treasury Secretary will certify whether \nthese targets are being met.\n  If they are not being met, then what happens? What is triggered is \nthat reductions in taxes are automatically stopped, the growth rates \nfor discretionary spending are automatically held at the rate of \ninflation, and entitlement spending increases are automatically \nstopped.\n  What about a Medicare drug benefit? I heard that entitlement \nincreases will be stopped. No, I will stand corrected because I see the \nSenator from Indiana shaking his head. But the way it is drafted, new \nentitlement spending, as I understand it, is included in the trigger. \nBut I stand to be corrected if that is not the case, but that is how I \nread this amendment now.\n  What happens in odd-numbered years? Things are not automatic. But any \nMember can stand up in this Chamber and say the targets have not been \nmet and set a trigger process in motion. Boy, is that uncertainty.\n  Do we really want to tie our hands like that? Do we want to limit our \ndiscretion in future years as to what is best by putting this automatic \nprovision in the law? Do we want to tie the hands of our Treasury \nSecretary in debt management? Do we really want to do that? What are \nother countries going to think watching us do this?\n  Talk about the steepness of the yield curve. Why is the yield curve \nsteep? It is steep because the bond market today believes in the \noutyears that interest rates are going to rise. Why? Because the \nFederal Reserve has just lowered interest rates by 50 basis points. And \nbecause this tax cut is going to pass. The market thinks there is going \nto be growth because of the stimulus of this tax cut and because of the \nlowering of short-term interest rates. As a result, the market believes \nthere will be inflation in the outyears; therefore, long-term interest \nrates are going to be higher. That is what is going on.\n  And I will tell you something else. The markets will not believe a \ntrigger which is not real. This is not real. This is a message \namendment. It is a message amendment. It is not real legislation. We \nshould not be standing here--I am getting tired of message amendments, \nMr. President. I want to legislate. I do not want to give messages. I \nwant to legislate, and this is a message amendment. It is not \nlegislation, serious legislation. I believe we should not adopt it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr President, Senators Bayh and Snowe have a sincere \nconcern over the long-term fiscal situation of the country.\n  The fiscal discipline of the country's budget is important. I share \nthat goal--fiscal discipline first. The budget\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\napproved by a bipartisan majority of the Congress meets the test of \nfiscal discipline.\n  The trigger is unwise because it undermines the long-term stimulative \neffect of the tax cut. It makes the tax cut uncertain.\n  The trigger is unnecessary because the pattern of the tax cut follows \nthe pattern of the projected surplus.\n  The lion's share of the revenue loss occurs after 5 years.\n  Finally, if things go south on the projections, you can be sure \nCongress will raise taxes:\n  Over the last 20 years we have raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1990, and \n1993. Only twice has Congress pushed through a tax cut that became \nlaw--1981 and 1997.\n  Conditional tax cuts are not desirable--they do not stimulate \nworkers, investors, and businesses behavior. Let us have certainty in \ntax relief. The American people, who are taxed at record post war \nlevels, deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, is to be \nrecognized.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 minutes on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not think I can agree to that unless \nthere is an equal opportunity to respond.\n  Ms. SNOWE. If there is no objection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Also, we have a lot of other amendments lined up this \nevening, and I do not know whether those Senators really want to move \nto their amendments or not. There was a time agreement. I see Senator \nLandrieu is here. Senator Landrieu may want to offer her amendment at \nthis time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I do intend to offer my amendment, but I \nwill be happy to wait for a few moments, so I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in the Chair has some concern \nabout extending the evening considerably longer. There are about 2 \nhours of debate remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask consent that 5 additional minutes be \nevenly divided on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her consideration.\n  I address several of the issues raised by the ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, with respect to this trigger mechanism. I think they are \nimportant issues. I remember so often during my 16 years in the House \nof Representatives where we had to have a vote every year to raise the \ndebt ceiling before we could move further in additional spending. I can \nalso recall the number of times that was postponed.\n  I am not suggesting that is what we should do. The Secretary of the \nTreasury has considerable flexibility. In fact, we have these \nestablished debt reduction targets, ones that come out from the CBO. \nThey are targets to be adhered to by the Secretary of the Treasury and \ngive the flexibility to reduce further debt and be able to redeem that \ndebt and also, in the mid-course correction, it gives Members the \nability to raise the issues. But it would be upon a vote of the House \nand the Senate before any other changes could occur.\n  This does provide a measure of certainty that is very critical to \nensure we stay on track. That is what a balanced budget is all about. \nWe make the adjustments each and every year. I hope we intend to make \nthose adjustments each and every year in the event our debt reductions \nare not met. That is what this trigger is all about.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that we need to make tax relief and \nspending increases work--not only for American families, but for the \nfuture economic health and well-being of this nation. With a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus projected by CBO for the next ten years, we have an \nobligation to be responsible stewards of that surplus, so that we can \nseize the opportunity to address a variety of pressing national needs \nlike buying-down the debt, increasing funding for shared priorities \nlike education and health care, and providing meaningful tax relief as \nthis tax bill provides.\n  At the same time, we need to be sure that the burgeoning surplus \nassumptions on which our tax cut and spending decisions are made \nactually materialize--not disappear as quickly as they materialized. \nBecause while the projected surplus is undoubtedly based on the best \navailable economic and budget estimates, they are still just that--\nestimates.\n  Indeed, if past is prologue, there is a 50 percent chance that CBO's \nprojection of the surplus only five years from now will miss the actual \nmark by more than 1.8 percent of GDP--that's $245 billion in the fifth \nyear alone. With an estimated on-budget surplus in 2006 of only $267 \nbillion--which includes a surplus in the Medicare HI Trust Fund of $44 \nbillion--the impact of such an error would be disastrous, as Congress \nwould be forced to dip into the Medicare surplus in that year alone, \neven absent any changes in tax or spending policies today.\n  It also bears noting that for the ten year projections, nearly two-\nthirds of the projected surplus will not accrue until after the fifth \nyear. In fact, only $2 trillion--or 36 percent--of the surplus will \naccrue over the coming five years, while 64 percent--or $3.6 trillion--\nwill materialize in the final five years. If surpluses prove to be \nsubstantially lower in the fifth year alone, the impact on subsequent \nyears would likewise be substantial--and any long-term tax cuts and \nspending increases premised on the higher estimates could quickly force \nus to use Social Security surplus or even put the budget back ``in the \nred.''\n  Given CBO's acknowledged potential for error--and the devastating \nimpact it would have on our surpluses--I believe we should follow the \nadvice that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave the Budget \nCommittee on January 25. Specifically, Chairman Greenspan stated:\n\n       In recognition of the uncertainties in the economic and \n     budget outlook, it is important that any long-term tax plan, \n     or spending initiative for that matter, be phased in. \n     Conceivably, it could include provisions that, in some way, \n     would limit surplus-reducing actions if specified targets for \n     the budget surplus and federal debt were not satisfied.\n\n  In fact, in response to Chairman Greenspan's recommendation, I joined \nSenator Bayh, Senator Torricelli, and eight other bipartisan colleagues \nin crafting and introducing a bipartisan resolution that outlined the \nprinciples of a ``trigger'' mechanism that would be based on Chairman \nGreenspan's advice.\n  Specifically, our principles included the fact that, pursuant to \nChairman Greenspan's advice, tax cuts and spending increases adopted \nduring the 107th Congress should include a trigger mechanism that links \nthe phase-in of these proposals to actual fiscal outcomes. Furthermore, \nwe stated that the trigger should outline specific legislative or \nautomatic actions that shall be taken if specific levels of public debt \nreduction are not achieved, and should only be applied prospectively--\nnot repeal or cancel any previously implemented portion of a tax cut or \nspending increase.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are offering today turns those \nbipartisan principles into an actual legislative mechanism. \nSpecifically, it creates an automatic trigger mechanism that links the \nphase-in of new tax cuts and new spending to debt reduction goals in \n2004 and 2006. In addition, it includes a ``Mid-Course Correction'' \nmechanism that ensures the Congress has both an incentive--and an \nexpedited means--to get back on track during all other years in which \nthe debt reduction targets are missed.\n  First, the amendment lays out debt targets that must be achieved at \nthe close of upcoming fiscal years. These targets--which are taken \ndirectly from CBO's ``Budget and Economic Outlook'' report issued in \nJanuary--assume that the Social Security and Medicare HI Trust Fund \nsurpluses are used for debt reduction.\n  Besides laying out debt targets for the end of each fiscal year, it \nalso requires that the Secretary of the Treasury make additional \nreports to the Congress--on both July 1 and the first Tuesday after \nLabor Day (when Congress returns from the August recess)--on the status \nof our progress toward achieving the debt reduction goal for the year. \nIf the Secretary of the Treasury reports that the goal will not be met, \nCongress will know that steps must be taken to get back on track.\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\n  Next, the amendment creates the automatic ``trigger'' that links the \nphase-in of tax cuts, mandatory spending, and discretionary spending to \nthe achievement of the debt reduction goals in 2004 and 2006.\n  If the debt targets are not met, then--at the start of the following \nfiscal year (2005 or 2007)--the scheduled phase-in of tax cuts would be \ndelayed for one year, or until the target is met in a future year. Of \nimportance, this tax trigger--if implemented--would in no way lead to a \ntax increase. Rather, it would simply delay the next scheduled phase-in \nof any tax cuts that included a phase-in during those years.\n  In the same manner, the phase-in of new mandatory spending programs \nwould be delayed, with no impact on any provision that had already been \nimplemented.\n  [Of note, based on the package before us, the tax cuts that would be \naffected by the trigger would include the phase-in of marginal rate \nreductions (2005 and 2007); the per child tax credit (2007); marriage \npenalty relief (2007); and estate tax rate relief (2007). Because no \nnew mandatory spending programs have been enacted this year, there \nwould be no impact on such programs--at least at this time.]\n  In addition, the trigger would hold discretionary spending at the \nlevel of the previous year, adjusted for no more than the rate of \ninflation.\n  Why allow for growth with inflation? Put simply, these programs--\nwhich include education, defense, and health--are funded on an annual \nbasis. In contrast, mandatory spending--such as the Social Security and \nMedicare programs--is not controlled on an annual basis and can \nfluctuate from year-to-year depending on how many individuals are \neligible for the program, the rate of inflation, and other factors. \nWhen considering the critical importance of many discretionary spending \nprograms, we should ensure that these programs are treated no worse \nthan mandatory spending. By simply allowing them to grow with \ninflation, we are at least ensuring that the benefit of these programs \nis not eroded simply due to a rise in the cost of living.\n  Ultimatley, if the combined impact of stopping the phase-in of tax \ncuts and mandatory spending, and of holding discretionary spending to \nthe rate of inflation, is more than is necessary for meeting the debt \nreduction goal, the impact can be mitigated through the consideration \nof legislation that would lessen the impact. To ensure that tax cuts \nand spending are treated equally, such legislation must increase tax \ncuts and overall spending in a proportionate manner, and any amendments \nto the legislation must maintain this balance.\n  The amendment also includes a ``Mid-Course Correction'' mechanism \nthat would be available to the Congress in all other years that the \ndebt reduction targets are not met.\n  Specifically, if the debt reduction target is not met at the end of a \nfiscal year--or the Treasury Secretary reports in July or September \nthat the debt reduction target will likely not be met--any member of \nthe House or Senate would have the ability to call up privileged \nlegislation that would immediately block all scheduled phase-ins of tax \ncuts and new mandatory spending for the coming year, and hold overall \ndiscretionary spending at the rate of inflation over the previous \nyear's funding level. During the floor consideration of the \nlegislation, amendments could be offered to adjust the impact of the \nMid-Course Correction legislation if it would generate more savings \nthan are necessary, but such amendments must affect tax cuts and \noverall spending in a proportionate manner.\n  Ultimately, it will be up to the Congress and the President to decide \nif Mid-Course Correction legislation will be passed and enacted--and it \nwill also be on their shoulders to explain why they did not act in the \nface of debt reduction targets not being achieved. Ultimately, if \nCongress continually ignores violations of the debt reduction targets \nduring these years, the automatic ``trigger'' in years 2005 and 2007 \nwill almost inevitably be enforced.\n  As with the Mid-Course Correction, this amendment also allows \nprovides for the consideration of privileged legislation that would \nmake adjustments to the automatic trigger if its impact would be more \nsevere than is necessary. In the same manner, amendments to adjust the \ntrigger's impact would need to ensure that a proportionate balance is \nretained between tax cuts and spending.\n  In response to concerns that a trigger may actually lead to tax cuts \nand spending being turned off at the ``wrong time''--such as during an \neconomic downturn or national emergency--the amendment would allow the \nHouse and Senate to waive the trigger with a three-fifths vote at any \ntime, just as the requirements of the Balanced Budget Amendment would \nhave been waived with a supermajority vote. And if we are actually in \nthe throes of a recession or a declaration of war is in effect, the \ntrigger would be waived with a mere majority vote--a margin that would \nbe easily attainable.\n  Finally, in deference to the fact that there are legitimate \ndifferences of opinion about how quickly the publicly held debt can be \nredeemed, the amendment allows the debt targets to be adjusted in a \ngiven year if the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that the target \ncannot be reached because the Department of the Treasury will be unable \nto redeem a sufficient amount of securities from holders of federal \ndebt to achieve the target.\n  Of note, such certification--which must be transmitted by the \nPresident to the Congress--must outline the specific reasons that the \ntargets cannot be achieved, and the estimated amount of ``excess \nreserves'' that will accumulate due to an inability of the Treasury to \nredeem federal debt. Under no circumstances would such a waiver be \nallowed if the reason for the shortfall is simply a lack of surplus \nrevenues being available to redeem federal debt. And to ensure that \n``checks and balances'' are maintained, Congress can override the \ndecision of the Secretary of the Treasury with a majority vote.\n  Mr. President, just as the tax bill is the type of ``insurance'' that \nChairman Greenspan recommended to lessen the impact of an economic \ndownturn, I believe this amendment would serve as a critically needed \n``insurance plan'' within this tax bill and in subsequent spending \nlegislation. While I believe the surplus estimates on which our budget \nand this tax bill are based are sound, we simply cannot take the chance \nthat our estimates will prove to be wrong or that future Congresses \nwill over-utilize the surplus and imperil debt reduction.\n  Furthermore, I would hope that my colleagues who worked so hard over \nthe years for the passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget would see this as a similar effort to maintain fiscal \nresponsibility. We simply cannot afford to see the hard work that went \ninto making the desired goal of the Balanced Budget Amendment a reality \ntoday be undone by the adoption of tax or spending policies that are \nallowed to move forward un-checked.\n  Ironically, for those who believe that the assumptions on which the \nbudget and this tax bill are based are sound, the trigger poses no \nthreat as it would never be turned on. Likewise, for those who are \nconcerned about the assumptions, there is every reason to support the \ntrigger as it would serve as a strong line of fiscal defense if today's \nsurplus estimates prove to be tomorrow's ``pipe dream.''\n  Nevertheless, I'm sure that some of my colleagues will simply argue \nthat triggers are doomed to failure, and cite the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \ndeficit control mechanism as a case in point. I would argue that \nalthough some may dispute the value of the trigger, arguing that Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings may not have been successful at reigning in deficits, \nit did serve as a strong incentive for Congress to control spending. In \nfact, discretionary spending grew at an average annual rate of eight \npercent leading up to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and only two percent in \nthe five years after.\n  The bottom line is that I can't think of any event that has ever had \nsuch a profound impact on congressional spending--short of the \nwatershed Congressional elections of 1994--and I believe that this \ntrigger could have the same profound impact both tax cuts and spending \nduring the coming 10 years.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is just the type of fiscally \nresponsible proposal that I believe the American people are hoping we \nin the Congress will embrace as we pursue tax cuts and spending \nincreases in the months\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\nahead, and I urge my colleagues to support it accordingly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have stated my reasons why I think this is not a good \nidea. I stand by what I said, on the entitlements, which is an \nadditional reason why the provision isn't firm, to say the least. It is \nmore than infirm; it is beyond infirmity.\n  I urge that the Senate not approve it. I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 686\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, the amendment I propose has to do with \nthe adoption tax credit. Before I get into the specifics of that \namendment, I will make some general remarks about the previous \namendment briefly, about the overall bill, and a few other points \nbefore I get into specifics of this amendment.\n  Let me congratulate my colleagues from Maine, Indiana, and Michigan, \nSenators Snowe, Bayh, and Stabenow, for offering their amendment, which \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of, the trigger mechanism just presented \nto this body and explained so beautifully.\n  I want to add my voice to say that I intend to support that \namendment. I think it will bring discipline to this process, it will \nbring some more certainty, and it will help us to stay the course of \nfiscal discipline which has served this country and this economy so \nwell over the last 8 years.\n  To reiterate, it is not just giving us a caution about the tax cuts, \nbut it is cautioning us about spending too much. I think that is a very \ngood balance. The mechanisms have been worked out. Chairman Greenspan \nhas indicated support of this concept. That debate will be left for \nanother day, with more debate on Monday. I express my support.\n  Second, I express my compliments to the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Montana for the way they have handled the debate. I \nespecially appreciate the way the chairman has been open to listening \nto different ideas, to considering all as thoughtfully and as seriously \nas he could, given there would literally be 100 ways to write this \nbill. But we can only have one bill and all 100 Members have to have \nsome input into shaping it. We could all write it our special way, but \nthe fact is this body and our democracy mandates we do this together. \nIt is not a simple process. I thank the chairman for his patience and \nthe ranking member for his graciousness in listening to me on many \nissues, particularly this amendment.\n  Since I am not going to speak very long, I make a public comment and \ncompliment also my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, a \nmember of the Finance Committee. He has been a tremendous leader in \nthis whole debate. Although Members may\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\ndisagree with some of his positions, I think he has gained such respect \nin this debate, explaining these very complicated matters in ways \npeople in my State, most certainly, have expressed to me, and I \nappreciate his efforts. I thank him publicly tonight for his hard work \nand dedication.\n  The amendment I send to the desk tonight is a very important \namendment. This underlying tax reduction bill has some very good \nprovisions in it. I mention a few. The refundability of the child tax \ncredit and the doubling of the child tax credit is very important to \nthe people of Louisiana and to many working families around the Nation.\n  Marriage penalty relief is something I have supported, along with \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. It is time that we make adjustments \nto this particular problem in the Tax Code.\n  I also am pleased to see the estate tax reform and repeal as a part \nof this tax package. And particularly for Louisiana and for so many \nStates, the college savings plan withdrawals, making them tax free, \ngives a lot of hope and encouragement to help people in Louisiana and \nall through this Nation begin early to set aside money for their \nchildren's education. A good, solid education through college is an \nexcellent way to give the foundation for someone's success in life. In \nthis new global economy with new technologies and the importance of \nskills, having a good, solid education is important. We have been \ndebating many different aspects of education. I think the college \nsavings plan is a very good feature in this bill.\n  There are some serious problems with it. It is backloaded. I wish the \n15-percent tax bracket could have been reduced and addressed. There is \na smaller amount of stimulus than I think is wise, given the slowdown \nin the economy. I will make a decision about how I am going to vote on \nthis bill, based on the pros and cons, on Monday when we have the final \nvote. But I want to suggest tonight that there is one amendment that \nreally should be added. It should be included. It is somewhat glaring \nthat it is not. The chairman knows this, and the ranking member. The \namendment I am speaking about is the renewal and doubling extension and \nfixing of the adoption tax credit, a tax credit that has been so \nbroadly accepted and enthusiastically supported by many Members of this \nbody.\n  Just today, in fact, over 300 Members of the House of Representatives \nvoted affirmatively for the Hope for Children tax credit relief. I \noffer this amendment on behalf of myself and the Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Craig. There are a number of other cosponsors. I would like to \nmention Mrs. Clinton, the Senator from New York, and others who have \nsupported this particular provision.\n  This amendment would extend the $5,000 tax credit, doubling it to \n$10,000. One of the things we must remember is, if we do not fix this \ntax credit now, it expires, not next year, not 2 years from now, as \nsome of the other tax measures we are speaking about, but it expires in \nDecember of this year. So in 7 months this tax credit that has done so \nmuch good for people in this country is set to expire.\n  The other reason to support it is there is overwhelmingly \nenthusiastic bipartisan support for it.\n  The third really good reason is that it is so cost effective. It is \nsuch a small amount of money relative to the overall package that I am \ncertain we can find a way, if we find the will to include this in this \npackage.\n  There were over 125,000 children adopted last year; 15,000 children \ncame to this country from another place in the world. Those places were \nquite grim. I have been to many of them. Some of these children were \ntaken off hospital floors. Some of these children were found starving. \nSome of these children were found sick. Some of these children were \nfound with an inability to walk, some could not see, some could not \nhear. But a family, a mother, a father in this country said: I will \ntake that child, at great expense, and I will raise that child and do \nsomething good for the world and do something good for our family and \ndo something wonderful for this child.\n  There were over 100,000 children who were adopted by American \nfamilies. Some of these children were healthy. All of these children \nwere beautiful. All children are beautiful and should be loved and \ncared for and nurtured.\n  Some of these children have great and special needs. I have seen \nchildren who have been adopted who have no limbs, who cannot see. \nChildren have been adopted who have a very short lifespan. But because \nthe heart of people is so great and their generosity so tremendous, \nhomes and hearts have been opened, families have been built, children \nhave been given hope, and parents who were desperate for children and \ncould not have them have had their dreams come to reality.\n\n  The least we can do in this body, as we debate this $1.35 trillion \ntax cut, is to add one-third of 1 percent to make this tax credit real, \nto extend it so it does not just go away, and to double it so it really \ncan help as these expenses rise, and to fix it so it works for children \nwho are being adopted out of foster care.\n  I know my time is coming to an end. I say in closing, there are today \n500,000 children--a half a million children--who have been removed from \ntheir homes because of abuse and neglect. There are 100,000 of those \n500,000 whose parental rights have been terminated. If we don't work a \nlittle harder and a little better to fix our court system, to support \nour social workers, to give our judges the support they need, and to \nhelp where we can--and this is one way to build in our Tax Code an \nincentive to help some of these children get adopted and to help \nparents bear the tremendous expenses associated--I think we will be \nmaking a grave mistake and missing a wonderful opportunity.\n  I urge Members of this body to consider this carefully. It doesn't \ncost a lot. It will bring a great deal of joy and hope and happiness to \nchildren and families everywhere. It is something we can do, and as Mr. \nGramm, the Senator from Texas, said when we discussed this last year, \nit really is a shame that this tax cut is scored in a way that costs \nus, because if you think about it, this is a great savings to the \ntaxpayer, because when children are adopted out of foster care, or when \nchildren are adopted who are for some reason not wanted, or their \nfamilies want them but they cannot raise them so someone else takes \nthat child and raises that child and nurtures that child, I promise you \nthere is $100,000 or more savings to the taxpayer by the little $10,000 \nwe give in the credit.\n  We save hundreds of thousands of dollars because these children do \nnot end up in special education or in the hospital or in jail or in a \nmental health ward. Why? Because they have parents to love them and \ncare for them. So while the committee has given me a score on my tax \ncredit, I have argued, and I think I could be supported in a court of \nlaw, this tax credit is a great savings to this Government. For every \nchild we can get adopted, we don't have to pick up the expenses for \nthem. I think it is what God wants us to do. I am positive it is the \nright thing to do. I thank my colleagues for giving me this time to \noffer it. I hope we can find a way to do this.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleague and cochair \nof the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, Senator Landrieu, in \noffering this amendment to the tax relief bill.\n  Our amendment will renew two expiring provisions of the Tax Code that \nare critically important to American families: the adoption tax credit \nand the exclusion for employer-provided adoption benefits. It will also \nmodernize and improve these provisions, in response to what we have \nlearned families really need and want in this area.\n  Not a week goes by that I don't get a call, or an e-mail, or a visit \nfrom someone telling me what a help the adoption tax credit is to them, \nand how important it is for Congress to renew it. As my colleagues all \nknow, this credit was added to the Tax Code in 1996, following years of \neffort. The idea was to allow families to keep a little more of their \nown hard-earned money to help absorb the extraordinary costs of \nadoption.\n  Since these adoption tax benefits have gone into effect, tens of \nthousands of families have claimed it. More important, that means tens \nof thousands of children have, in part because of this tax credit, \nfound loving, permanent adoptive homes.\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\n  Yet there are many, many children still waiting for that happy \noutcome--more than 100,000 in America, and more around the world, and \nthe adoption tax credit will expire at the end of this year. \nFurthermore, in looking at how the credit has worked since 1996, we \nhave discovered that not all families are equally able to use the tax \ncredit to help them cope with the true costs of adoption.\n  That is why at the beginning of this Congress, we introduced S. 148, \nthe Hope For Children Act, to extend and improve the tax credit so that \nit can continue to help Americans form families through adoption. That \nbill is cosponsored by seventeen of our colleagues, representing a wide \npolitical and geographic spectrum; the House of Representatives \nunanimously passed their version of the bill earlier today; and the \nbill has won the support of all segments of the adoption community. It \nis this bill, the Hope For Children Act, that is reflected in the \namendment we are offering today.\n  There are families who are sitting at the kitchen table today, trying \nto figure out if they can afford to open their hearts and homes to a \nchild through adoption. Let us send a strong message of hope to those \nfamilies, and to the thousands of waiting children, by passing this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, adoption is the right thing, at least as \nopposed to foster care. As I have been working on adoption issues for a \nlong period of time, there is one thing I hear from kids who have been \nfloating from one foster home to another, who have been in the system \nfor a long period of time. What they want is a mom and a dad. What they \nreally are saying is they want some permanency.\n  One of the greatest sins of governmental policy is in the adoption \nand foster care area, where people grow all the way through their \nteenage years and get to be 18 and are adults and never have a mom and \na dad.\n  Every child has a right to grow up in a safe and loving home. I hope \nmy work on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which succeeded in \nshortening the time lines for children in foster care, is a major \neffort towards this goal that we all seek.\n  Included in the Adoption and Safe Family Act was a provision I \nauthored to break down barriers when a family living in one \njurisdiction wants to adopt a child in another jurisdiction.\n  I compliment Senator Landrieu. She has been steadfast in her advocacy \nfor adoption. Senator Craig has joined her to make adoption tax \nincentives a very strong bipartisan objective. I have been pleased to \njoin these two distinguished Senators in the past on efforts they have \nmade in this direction. I don't know what the future holds exactly, but \nI promised the Senator from Louisiana I would work with her and Senator \nCraig on their amendment and see what, if anything, we can do. We will \nhave the weekend and Monday to work on that. Hopefully, we can \naccommodate in some way.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments of \nboth the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Iowa. This is a \nvery fine amendment for lots of reasons, as has already been \narticulated here. I think we can find a way to get this done. I \ncompliment the Senators.\n  We know lots of families who would love to adopt a child. How \nwonderful it is for the families to be able to adopt a child. It means \na great deal for the parents to have those children. So many people \nwant to have children and just cannot. I thank the Senator for what she \nis doing.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, is the next Senator to be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Florida will withhold, the \nSenator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would just like to say that on an \nearlier amendment I got a little carried away in being critical of it. \nIn fact, I even suggested the amendment was more of a message \namendment. I do recognize that, frankly, it was a very good-faith \neffort to meet a real concern; namely, whether we can meet our fiscal \nresponsibilities as we look to see whether these budget surpluses \nmaterialize or not.\n  I do still think the amendment is not a good one, but not because it \nis not well intended. It is very well intended. The authors have worked \nvery long and hard to try to figure out a way to make it work. But I \nthink it is too complicated. It is more in the nature of a Rube \nGoldberg solution. But it is very well intended.\n  I compliment the Senators who offered that amendment and tell them I \nrespect their effort efforts. I just apologize to those Senators if \nthey took personal offense at my earlier comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I request that I be notified when I have \nused 3 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is the first of two amendments I will \noffer this evening. This amendment goes to the basic structure of the \nkind of approach Congress should take to reducing our Nation's taxes. I \nsupport a significant tax bill. I do not support the bill that is \nbefore us this evening.\n  The second amendment I will offer will go to one of the reasons I do \nnot support the bill, a specific defect which I think is illustrative \nof other defects within this legislation.\n  The amendment we offer first raises two basic questions: Should we \nhave a single tax bill that will absorb all of the funds which this \nCongress has determined are appropriate to allocate to tax cuts for the \nnext 11 years? And are we so prophetic that we can decide in May of \n2001 what our total tax policy should be through the year 2011?\n  As smart as we might be, I do not think we can meet that test.\n  So I, with my colleague, Senator Corzine, will argue that we should \nhave a series of tax bills: A bill today, yes--a pause, a time for \nreflection, a time for examination of our economic circumstances, a \ntime to reevaluate our surplus for the future--and then a thoughtful \ndetermination as to whether, for what purpose, and in what amount we \nshould have a second tax bill.\n\n  Why is this approach of one-at-a-time, rather than one, period, a \nmore appropriate direction? First, there is the unreliability of an 11-\nyear projection of surpluses. That issue has been discussed at length \nin several other contexts today. Second, there will be needs, some seen \nand some unforeseen, which will emerge in the next 11 years, that will \njustify tax cuts. But if we have already committed all of the resources \navailable for that purpose, we will not be able to attend to those.\n  One of those needs we have learned about in the last few hours, as \nthe President and the Vice President have announced a new energy \nstrategy for America, much of which is based upon tax reductions in \norder to create incentives for Americans in various enterprises to act \nin ways that will be advantageous to the Nation.\n  And third, one-at-a-time gives us greater assurance that we will not \ndrift into deficits, that we will not repeat in 2001 what we did in \n1981.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, with that introduction, I would like to \nturn to my colleague and partner in this effort to discuss, if we have \na series of tax bills, what should the first tax bill, the tax bill of \nMay 2001 encompass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to support my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Florida.\n  I very much agree and concur that we would be better served by a \nseries of tax cuts that would provide for understanding where we are in \nthe economy. As we move along in this process, we could fit \ncircumstances much more effectively into that process.\n  I have some trouble with the overall tax program we are considering. \nI have trouble with the issues with regard to\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nhow this is formulated for debate. I compliment Senator Byrd for his \ntruly remarkable comments this morning with regard to reconciliation.\n  That said, there is trouble with the size, trouble with the structure \nand distribution, but maybe most importantly, as Senator Graham and I \nare addressing, trouble with the timing.\n  This tax structure we are about to vote on does too little at a time \nwhen we have real needs in a weakening, slowing, and, I think, very \nfragile economy. Seventy percent of this tax cut comes in the second 5 \nyears, the outyears, and only $10 billion in the current year, and that \nis in a $10 trillion economy. It is one-tenth of 1 percent. It is like \nthrowing a coin in an ocean. It will have little, if any, significant \nimpact on the current state of our economy.\n  There are real reasons to believe that there is a need for the \ncurrent stimulus. With the actions and words of the Federal Reserve \njust this week, with a remarkable additional 50-basis-point cut in \ninterest rates, that is five times this year, with a total 250-basis-\npoint cut, because of their serious concern. And their concern is \ndemonstrated not only by what they have done but by their words when \nthey have reviewed current economic conditions--seeing a decline in \nemployment, a rise in the unemployment rate, weakness in productivity \nnumbers, which have been so much a part of suggestion that we have this \ngreat surplus.\n  There has been a real undermining of one of the major sectors of our \neconomy in technology, but also it has moved very substantially into \nour manufacturing sector. And there are concerns about overseas \neconomic growth, which will have a very important impact on our \nexternal accounts. There are many signs in our economy that give one \ngreat pause for concern about the fragility of our economy and its \ndirection. We need a stimulus now.\n  I think the program that the senior Senator from Florida has talked \nabout in the Finance Committee, and we have discussed in this Chamber \nfor now 2 months, is an insurance policy that is fundamental to working \nhand in hand with the Federal Reserve to make sure we have a strong \neconomy going forward.\n  Those rising tides do lift all boats. A strong economy is the best \nway to make sure all Americans benefit from our fiscal policy and how \nwe manage our economic affairs.\n  So I stand strongly in support of the approach Senator Graham will \noutline.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and a half minutes remain.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will briefly outline the plan that the \nSenator from New Jersey and I have developed which we think meets the \ntest of an economic insurance policy. We underscore the words \n``insurance policy.''\n  No one, frankly, knows what is over the horizon for the American \neconomy. As the Senator from New Jersey just outlined, there are enough \nsigns of concern, signs that would raise apprehension, that a prudent \nfamily would say this is a time to buy an insurance policy that will \nprotect us, that will begin to shift the risk, to the degree possible, \nof a possible economic decline. We are suggesting what the elements and \nthe specifics of that economic insurance policy should be.\n  We think it needs to be immediate. We are proposing that our bill \ntake effect as of January 1, 2001, and that the benefits in this \ncalendar year would be fully available in this calendar year.\n  Second, it needs to be frontloaded. One of my criticisms of the bill \nbefore us, which talks about being an economic stimulus bill, is that \nthe total amount of tax relief that will be distributed in the form of \nmarginal rate reductions in this fiscal year 2001 is less than $10 \nbillion, in an economy approaching $8 trillion--in my judgment, a \nclearly inadequate commitment if we are serious about buying an \neconomic insurance policy.\n  We think it needs to be a substantial commitment. We have suggested \nthat the substantial commitment would be in the range of $60 billion in \nthe year 2001 and in every year into the future.\n  Economic experts from some of the most prestigious governmental and \nnongovernmental agencies in the country have told us they believe that \na $60 billion stimulus this year would increase gross domestic product \nby between one-half and three-quarters of 1 percent, everything else \nbeing unaffected. We think that is a significant amount of economic \ngrowth at a time when that growth has substantially declined.\n  We believe this should be placed in the hands of those Americans most \nlikely to spend it. So we build upon a concept that is in the \nPresident's budget or the President's tax bill, and that is the \naddition of a 10-percent rate. But we alter the President's proposal in \ntwo critical regards. First, his 10-percent rate doesn't go fully into \neffect until the year 2006. Ours is fully in effect as of January 2001.\n  Second, his 10-percent rate covers the first $6,000 of taxable income \nfor a single person; $12,000 for a married couple. We would increase \nthose numbers to $9,500 for a single American, and $19,000 for a \nfamily.\n  What would that mean for an American family, every American family \nthat is earning $19,000 or more up to the richest American in the \ncountry? It would mean a $950 savings in their income tax. We think \nthat is a significant amount of money, $35 every biweekly pay period, \n$35 that would be going into the pocket of that American family to buy \nclothes for their children, to make a downpayment on a refrigerator, \nall of the things they might want to use that money for, which is \nexactly what we need them to do in order to stimulate a demand starved \neconomic decline.\n  We also believe this plan needs to be simple. Complexity works \nagainst being able to get these funds into the hands of the Americans \nquickly enough to make a difference. We believe the critical quarters \nare going to be the last quarter of this fiscal year and the first \nquarter of 2002. That is the last 6 months of calendar 2001. That is \nthe 6-month period we need to impact. That is the 6-month period in \nwhich we will be putting $60 billion into the pockets of American \nfamilies. We think that is a true economic insurance policy.\n  If you believe the principle of let's go one step at a time in \nprudently shaping our tax policy, as opposed to feeling that we have to \nthrow a 100-yard-pass tax bill tonight that will govern us for the next \n11 years and that the prudent first tax bill should be one that would \nrelate to the primary challenge facing Americans today, which is the \nconcern of a declining economy, an economy that might drift into a \nrecession or a recession which could be deep and prolonged, then we \nhave the opportunity today in this tax bill to play a positive role to \nensure against those negative events.\n  I urge the amendment be adopted, and I send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Corzine, and Mr. Dayton, proposes an amendment numbered 687.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for a substitute amendment which amends the \n Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a 10-percent income tax \n                             rate bracket)\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n             1.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wonder if I could reserve the time on this amendment. \nThe Senator had another amendment he was going to offer.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Senator proceed to that right away.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 688\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the second amendment I have is not of the \nbroad sweep of the amendment we have just been discussing, but it \npoints out, maybe as a metaphor, some of the problems in this \nlegislation. This bill proposes to repeal the estate tax in the year \n2011. That same proposal was made by President Bush with a big \ndifference.\n  The estate tax is a shared source of income. The States get \napproximately 20 percent of the estate tax which is collected at the \nFederal level; 80 percent stays in the National Treasury. What \nPresident Bush had suggested was that there be an equal phase-out of \nthe State share and of the Federal share. That is not what is in the \nbill before us tonight, unfortunately.\n  What we have before us tonight is a bill which would say that \nbeginning January 1, 2002, just a little more than 7 months from now, \nthe State share would be cut in half. Then it says that there will be \ngradual further reductions and then January 1, 2005, the State share \nwould be zero.\n  The Federal share, on the other hand, continues in effect until the \nyear 2011. So effectively, what we are saying, with apparently no \nconsultation with our brethren in the States, is that they are going to \ntake the hit first because we are the ones who decide who has to carry \nthe burden first. I think that is egregiously unfair in our Federalist \nsystem. It also is going to put States in this position.\n  I was talking earlier today with the former Governor of Ohio, our \ncolleague, Senator Voinovich. Ohio is one of a number of States which \nhas a biennial budget; that is, they develop a budget, and it lasts for \n24 months. They will be starting their next 24-month period on July 1 \nof this year.\n  What we are going to say is they are going to build a 2-year budget \npredicated on receiving their share of the Federal estate tax. They are \ngoing to find that 6 months into a 24-month period half of that money \nhas evaporated because we have elected to make them our friends and \nfellow colleagues in this wonderful Federal system. We have made them \nhave their share of the estate tax cut occur, in this case, 10 years \nbefore the Federal share of reduction really begins to kick in and \ntotally 6 years before the Federal reduction becomes fact.\n  What policy rationale can there be for us to treat the 50 States in \nthe way that this bill purports to do?\n  The amendment I have offered will get to exactly the same \ndestination. The estate tax will be repealed. There will be zero income \nfor the States. There will be zero income for the Federal Government \nbecause there won't be any tax to produce any income. But it does what \nthe President has suggested--that we do it fairly; that both sides of \nthis partnership, both husband and wife, share equally and \nproportionately in the decline of their revenue.\n  There are many of us who pride ourselves on being Jeffersonian \nFederalists. We believe in local government. We vote to send more \nresponsibilities down to local governments. We are about to change our \nlabels. We are becoming situational Federalists. We want the States to \nhave more local control when it is to our benefit. But now that we have \nthis opportunity to essentially raid their income, because\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\nthey are not going to be up here voting, other than those of us who \nrepresent our constituents in the States--of course, the U.S. Senate \nwas peculiarly established to be the representatives of the interests \nof States, so we ought not to be the body leading this way. We should \nnot be the body fighting the recommendation of President Bush to be \nfair and equitable. We should be the body which is expressing its \nrecognition of the importance of the States and the relationship with \nthe National Government.\n  This proposal, in my judgment, goes 180 degrees in the opposite \ndirection. So my amendment is simple. It says, yes, we are going to \nrepeal the estate tax; yes, we are going to do it in the same number of \nyears as has been suggested; but we are going to treat both sides of \nthis partnership--the States and the Federal Government--equally and \nproportionately as we do so.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 688.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the State death tax credit is one of the \nlast vestiges of revenue sharing. The State has a luxury of not having \nan estate tax and just waiting for a portion of the Federal estate tax \nto be allocated to the State treasury.\n  What we have tried to do in this mark is, in a fair way, allow the \nStates to review the concerns of their citizens, and if they want to \nhave their own death tax, then any tax paid to the States will be fully \ndeductible on the final return. This will be phased in over the next 5 \nyears, and it will be phased in over the next 5 years until repealed. \nIn fact, the tax money will be paid out over the next 7 years.\n  The States will have plenty of time for their legislatures to meet \nand decide on a State-by-State level if they want to maintain the death \ntax.\n  Unlike the House amendment by Congressman Rangel, we did not repeal \nthe credit immediately. But if the Federal Government does not collect \nthe money, it is not ours to share. State death tax credit current law \nstates up to $2.5 million. The rate is 8 percent. Total tax is \n$146,800. Our relief act before us--the act of 2001--is identical. The \ntop rate of 16 percent is only collected on estates over $10 million. \nThe number of Florida estates, for example, over $10 million is 126. \nThe number of Iowa estates over $10 million is 22.\n  In addition, at the expense of the American taxpayers, the Senator \nfrom Florida is taking care of State governments. He postpones the \nunified credit increase for years. The act before us gives a $3 million \ncredit by the year 2005. The Senator postpones $3 million until the \nyear 2007, and he never reaches $3.5 million or $4 million at the \nexpense of the American taxpayers.\n  So I think it is very important that we take a good look at this. \nAgain, I want to remind everybody that we have tried to--in this estate \ntax provision of this bill, the phasing out of the estate tax is a \ncontroversial issue, even with those of us who have agreed to this \nbipartisan agreement. But what is not controversial is the way in which \nthis bipartisan portion of our overall legislation, the estate tax \nprovision, was worked out--very carefully, in a nonemotional, \nnonpolitical way, between Senator Lincoln on the one hand--she is a \nDemocrat--and Senator Kyl on the other hand, being a Republican--\nworking these things out. And except for those who do not believe there \nshould be any total repeal of the estate tax, even in the year 2001, \nthis was a well-accepted compromise that is in this mark.\n  Obviously, this provision by the Senator from Florida detracts from \nthat. That is why we ask that it be defeated when we vote on it Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes, 20 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Parliamentary inquiry: If we do not use all of our time \nthis evening, will we have any of that time available on Monday prior \nto the actual consideration of these amendments or do we use it or lose \nit without using it tonight?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, there \nis no provision for additional time. However, there is time for debate \non the bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So the answer is, if we don't use the time available \ntonight, it will not be carried over until Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is not a threat to use all 9 minutes but a small \nsliver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have great regard for Senator Grassley. \nI know how hard he has worked on this bill, as he has on other issues. \nAs he said earlier tonight, he is prepared to work on issues such as \nprescription drugs for Medicare. I appreciate that, and I have enjoyed \nthe many times we have been colleagues to achieve public policy \nobjectives.\n  I just say I think this is one of those issues on which maybe we have \nto agree to disagree. This is not a new relationship. Since 1924, the \nStates have been participating with the Federal Government in the \nestate tax, and 35 States have no other estate tax than the share they \nget through their participation in the Federal tax. In fact, in my \nState, it is in the State constitution that the only estate tax that \ncan be collected is that which comes as a State credit on the Federal \nestate tax.\n  So while it might appear to be easy for the States as we are \nrepealing the estate tax, it is obviously not going to be easy and for \nsome States virtually impossible.\n\n  I go back to the example Senator Voinovich gave to me earlier today \nof his own State, which is a binding budget situation. They had written \ntheir budget, or are about to, for 24 months beginning July 1 of this \nyear, and now they are going to lose approximately half--we do not have \nthe exact State-by-State numbers, but a significant percentage of this \nsource of revenue. That is a very difficult fiscal position for us to \nput our friends and colleagues in the 50 States in and I think \nunnecessarily.\n  President Bush had recommended this reduction be done \nproportionately. I, frankly, assumed it was being done proportionately \nuntil someone pointed out that we were deviating from what the \nPresident had recommended. I believe this is kind of a ``gotcha'' \napproach to the States as they are so deep into already committing \nthemselves for at least 1 and maybe 2 fiscal years. In the case of my \nState, our legislature finished its business on May 4 or 5, with the \nbudget to go into effect on the first of July. It has in it \napproximately $775 million as our State's share of the estate tax. \nAlmost half of that is going to evaporate as of the first of January, \nhalfway through the fiscal year.\n  The irony of this is that we talk about we want to do something for \nthe American taxpayer. The American taxpayer pays taxes at all levels \nof government. If we take a substantial share of\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nthis source of revenue away from the States in a precipitous move for \nwhich they have been unable to plan, what are the States going to do? \nAre they going to have to raise property taxes to fill the gap? Are \nthey going to have to raise sales taxes to fill the gap? Are they going \nto have to find some other source of revenue or begin well into their \nfiscal year to make significant cuts in services? And what is the \nservice that States provide?\n  For my State and most States, half or more of the total State revenue \nis spent on one function. What is that function? We ought to know it \nwell because we just spent the last 2 weeks talking about how committed \nwe were to it. What is the function? Education. That is what States do \nwith over half of their money.\n  If we think it is important for us to spend 2 weeks debating the 7 \npercent of public education which is financed from Washington, we \ncertainly deserve to spend some time discussing the approximately 55 \npercent of education which is paid by the States. The balance between \nthe Federal 7 and the State's 55 is what is paid at the local level, \nlargely through property taxes.\n  We seem to be, at least in the amount of attention that is being \ngiven to this, indifferent to what we are doing to our American \ntaxpayers in terms of their State responsibilities and what we are \ndoing to American education by destabilizing the primary source of \nfinancing for American education, which is the 50 States.\n  Mr. President, hoping that I have not used all of the 9 minutes, I \nwill conclude by saying I think this is going to be a test of whether \nwe really are serious, committed Federalists and think that respect and \ndignity across levels of government is an important part of the oil \nthat makes this very intricate Federal system work and that \nindifference, bordering on rudeness, toward the States is what could \ncause it to begin to grind the gears.\n  I believe the adoption of this amendment, which is the proposal made \nby President Bush, which is a proposal that gets to exactly the same \ndestination as the advocates of repeal of the estate tax would do but \ndo it in a fair and equitable manner as between our 50 States and our \nFederal Government, is an extremely important statement of our \ncommitment to federalism. I urge the adoption of this amendment when it \ncomes for a vote on Monday.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will take a couple minutes, and then I \nbelieve we are done.\n  To respond in a short fashion to what the Senator from Florida said, \nwe have 14 States that have a separate inheritance tax. In addition, \nthe tax due to the State will continue to be paid through the year \n2007.\n  The repeal basically happens because we increase the unified credit \nso rapidly, and this is a direct result of the American taxpayers \nhaving spoken by the thousands that they want immediate relief.\n  The President of the United States in his proposal did his death tax \nrepeal with $260 billion. The bill before us does it with $145 billion.\n  The President does not increase the unified credit. So, yes, his plan \nis a proportionate reduction, but the Senate and the taxpayers wanted \nimmediate relief, and that is why we end up where we are.\n  Obviously, there are problems for some Senators. I respect their \nobjection, but we did it in the best way we could in a compromising \nfashion, trying to do as much as we could with a lesser amount of money \nthan what the President was trying to do in his tax program, and do it \nin a bipartisan fashion.\n  As we end this evening's debate, and we will continue it Monday with \nvotes well into Monday evening to finish this bill, I hope I can speak \nfor people who have wanted to see a tax bill passed, and that includes \nSenator Baucus and me, that we have defeated amendments that have come \nbefore this body to change this legislation.\n  If we had taken the second alternative of bringing this bill before \nthis body, that second alternative would have been perhaps--if we had \nbeen fortunate--a Republican-only measure that would have been voted on \nin committee 10-10. I believe a lot of the amendments we defeated today \nwould have been adopted.\n  We brought a bipartisan bill out of committee 14-6. We have had quite \na few bipartisan votes today. I hope people who are reflecting upon \nwhat they want in a tax bill, if they have what they want without the \nbipartisan cooperation--when I say ``what they want,'' again I remind \neverybody this is a work of compromise--more importantly, bipartisan \ncompromise--so nobody has really gotten what they want. But I know \nthere is more of an urgency on my side for the reduction of marginal \nrates than there is maybe on the other side.\n  It could be that people on my side do not like the 36 percent that I \nagreed to with Senator Baucus, but looking at some of these votes, and \nparticularly how hard Senator Baucus was working to make sure this \nbipartisan position won, without that, some of these amendments, and \nmaybe a lot of others, would have been adopted.\n  I say that because there is Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to think \nabout this before we adopt a final bill, and then there is Tuesday and \nWednesday--and maybe not even that much time--to work on a conference \nreport with which Senator Baucus is going to be involved. We have to \nthink in terms of what is possible to get through here when it comes \nout of conference.\n\n  I don't really know how to end this except to say that we worked hard \nfor 4 months to get where we are. I hope people realize what we have \nput together has been sustained. We ought to think about that as people \nwho may not be totally satisfied with what we are going to pass in the \nSenate try to use the rest of the process to gain something that is not \ndoable in the final analysis.\n  I would like to have everybody think between now and when that \nconference committee has to end sometime not too far down in the \nfuture, to be a little bit realistic. I think I have been realistic. I \nthink Senator Baucus has been realistic or we wouldn't be here in the \nfirst place. For sure, we wouldn't be here sustaining this mark the way \nwe have.\n  I ask my colleagues, particularly on my side of the aisle, to think \nof this for the next few days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to heed the wise words \nof the chairman of the committee. They were important. That is, in the \nfinal analysis, this will come down to whether there are 51 votes to \nadopt the conference report. This is an evenly divided Senate, 50/50, \nfor all intents and purposes. I am sure the Vice President can break \nthe tie, but it is basically 50/50 and it comes down to whether there \nare 50 or 51 votes.\n  I do believe very strongly that the bill we are working on today is a \nvery significant improvement from my point over what we otherwise would \nbe passing in this body and that it is a bill very similar to that \noffered by the President and passed by the House.\n  This bill before the Senate today is much better in terms of \ndistribution, child tax credit, refundability, more for education, \ntuition deduction provided for, a whole host of provisions. It is a lot \nbetter from my point of view and the point of view of the vast majority \nof Members of this side.\n  I urge Members, as our very wise chairman has said, to think about \nthis over the next several days, because when we do come back from \nconference, the conferees are going to have to come up with the result, \nto sustain not only in the House, which is very easy, but to sustain in \nthe Senate, which is more difficult.\n  I urge the conferees and I urge Senators to be prudent, wise, and to \nremember there must be 51 votes in the Senate to adopt a conference \nreport. I commend the chairman of our committee, but particularly \nMembers on my side of the aisle who have offered amendments. There have \nbeen good amendments, very well intended, and I wish I could have \nordered more of them. I could not, in the view to get a better bill for \nall Senators, Democrats and Republicans.\n  I think it is important for all Senators to vote for a tax cut that \nthey think is better than otherwise we would be facing. Some Senators \nare not going to vote for a tax vote that the conferees will bring \nback. It will not happen. But I think it is my responsibility to bring \nback a conference report\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nfor which some Senators on my side of the aisle can vote. It is my hope \nwe can bring back a conference report that does have the support not \nonly of 51 Senators but significantly more than 51 Senators so it truly \nis bipartisan. That very much depends on the conferees.\n  I thank my good friend from Iowa who has been so decent and \nstraightforward and honest as the day is long, a very wonderful person. \nWe have more miles to travel, and my expectation is we will travel \nthose in the same spirit of cooperation.\n  I see my good friend from New Jersey standing ready to leave. I say \nto my good friend from New Jersey, I appreciate his efforts, \nparticularly on the stimulus amendment. There will be another day when \nwe can adopt very good amendments as proposed by my friends from \nFlorida as well as New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5100-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the early part of the Eisenhower \nyears, I joined that administration and later came to Washington and \nthen met a whole series of World War II veterans. We talked and dreamed \nthen of a memorial to a war in which we had just been. Fourteen years \nago, the World War II memorial was conceived and the process started, \nto have it built here in Washington, DC. Eight years ago, the Congress \nauthorized this memorial; 6 years ago the first of 22 public hearings \non the site and design of the memorial commenced.\n  Construction was scheduled to start last month, but the memorial is \nnow bogged down in legal and procedural issues.\n  Of the 16 million men and women who served in World War II, only 5 \nmillion are alive today. We are now losing veterans of the greatest \ngeneration at the rate of 1,100 veterans a day. I questioned that, but \nwe checked it; 1,100 veterans of World War II are passing away each \nday. By the year 2004, there will be less than 4 million of us.\n  In my home State of Alaska, in the last 10 years, we lost one-third \nof the veterans whom I had known and worked with so long.\n  The site design of our memorial has been endorsed by the Historic \nPreservation Officer of the District of Columbia, it has received four \nendorsements of the District of Columbia's Preservation Review Board, \nand five approvals each from the Committee on Fine Arts and the \nNational Capital Planning Commission.\n  The memorial is governed by the Commemorative Works Act of 1986. That \nact gave the final site and design approval to the Commission on Fine \nArts and the National Capital Planning Commission and the Secretary of \nthe Interior.\n  Eight sites were considered for the memorial. In 1998, the design was \napproved by the Commission on Fine Arts and the National Capital \nPlanning Commission and the site selection was reaffirmed. In 1998, the \nNational Park Service, in accordance with the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, completed an environmental assessment and issued a finding \nof no significant impact. In the year 2000, the final design was \napproved by the Commission on Fine Arts and the National Capital \nPlanning Commission, and on November 11 of last year, the year 2000, a \nceremonial groundbreaking took place for this memorial.\n  More than 500,000 Americans have sent donations to the fundraising \ncampaign, 48 State legislatures have done the same thing, 1,100 schools \nand more than 450 veterans groups, who represent 11 million veterans.\n  Even though all the procedural steps have been taken, the memorial \nhas now been delayed because of a procedural issue involving the \nNational Capital Planning Commission. The National Capital Planning \nCommission decision of 2 years ago of including a World War II memorial \nhas been placed in question because the former National Capital \nPlanning Commission chairman continued to serve after the expiration of \nhis term. The legislation that would originally establish this \ncommission permitted members to serve until replaced, but when that law \nwas amended, inadvertently the language allowing continuous service \nfell out with no explanation. That created a technicality that has \nforced a review now, again, by the National Capital Planning \nCommission.\n  This memorial has been through 22 public hearings, it has complied \nwith every applicable law, and this technicality regarding the National \nCapital Planning Commission Board should not penalize the millions of \nveterans who served our country honorably when asked to do so. They \nwant to see this memorial.\n  I congratulate the House of Representatives, particularly Congressman \nStump, for sending this legislation to the Senate. I thank all who have \nbeen very considerate in trying to work out the problems relating to \nit. I believe I am joined by all the veterans of World War II who serve \nin this body in urging that the House bill be enacted and sent to the \nPresident for his signature immediately.\n  For many of us, this year marks the 55th year since we left the \nmilitary service. We were in World War II and returned home.\n  We want to see this memorial finished while a significant number of \nour comrades are still alive. We want to be there when this memorial is \nopened.\n  Memorial Day for 2001 is just 1 week from next Monday. The veterans \nof this Nation intended to celebrate the initiation of this memorial on \nthat day. They will not be able to do so unless the bill gets to the \nPresident in time to sign it. This is more than a dream of our \nveterans; it is a demand on our country. I urge no Senator stand in the \nway of the prompt enactment of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5101-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REQUEST FOR ABSENCE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate to report on the \nprogress the Judiciary Committee is making with respect to a number of \nadministration nominations to the Department of Justice.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have been working to reach an \nunderstanding on how this committee will handle nominations. A number \nof procedural and substantive issues have been raised in these regards \nfor both Executive and Judicial Branch nominations. The Democratic \nmembers have sought to work out arrangements and understandings so that \nall members of the committee would know what our rules are, know what \nour practices and procedures will be, and understand how this committee \nwill approach our important responsibilities with respect to \nnominations.\n  Over the last 2 weeks the chairman's insistence that the committee \nproceed with nominations before those practices and procedures had been \nagreed upon has lead to public reference to outstanding issues that we \nshould have resolved first. I always regret when we are not able to \nwork out matters through reason and cooperation. I do not believe it \nwas appropriate for Republican members of this committee to deride \nDemocratic members as acting ``irresponsibly'' or ``despicably'' or \n``in breach of their constitutional duties.'' I know that it was not \nhelpful.\n  Nonetheless, I was proud of the Democratic members of this committee \nwhen we jointly sent our May 4 letter to the chairman and provided a \nway out of the impasse in spite of the name calling. A few days later \nthe chairman responded with language that reflected our respectful tone \nand for which I thank him.\n  While I disagree with much of what the chairman argues and asserts in \nhis letter, I appreciate that he has now indicated that with respect to \njudicial nominations, he ``intends to be fully respectful of \n[Democratic Senators'] views and will assist in any way to ensure that \nyou and our other Senate colleagues receive real, meaningful \nconsultation by the White House on judicial nominees.'' I appreciate \nthat in his letter he writes that he ``respect[s our] views and efforts \nin ensuring [we] will be appropriately consulted in a meaningful manner \non nominees to vacancies in [our] home states.''\n  For the last several weeks, we have also been seeking to resolve \nconcerns about how this committee handles certain confidential \ninformation about nominations, information that may reflect on their \nfitness for office, and may be relevant to how Senators in this \ncommittee vote on reporting nominations to the Senate, as well as how \nSenators vote on confirmations. Those concerns have also been pending \nfor several weeks now without resolution. Those concerns are what \nprompted our request for an executive session in accordance with Rule \n26.5 of the Standing Rules of the Senate so that we could fully discuss \nthese very important matters in accordance with the confidentiality \nrules that bind us.\n  Those concerns made it inappropriate to proceed on certain matters \nover the last few weeks. Although our Republican colleagues knew about \nour concerns, they nonetheless berated us without any acknowledgment \nthat those open issues, which affect executive as well as judicial \nnominations, were still unresolved. That, too, was most unfortunate.\n  Over the last several days I have also reached out to the Bush \nadministration to work with us on ways to resolve these concerns. Those \noutreach efforts may provide the opportunity to reach a mutually \nacceptable resolution of these matters. I hope so.\n  In light of the cooperation we began receiving from the \nadministration last week, we were able to proceed to report and confirm \nLarry Thompson to be the Deputy Attorney General at the Department of \nJustice and Dan Bryant to be the Assistant Attorney General for the \nOffice of Legislative Affairs. I understand that they were sworn in \nlast Friday and, again, congratulate them and their families.\n  I have spoken to Attorney General Ashcroft about the staffing needs \nof the Department of Justice and assured him that I will do my part. \nFor those with short memories, I note that Attorney General Ashcroft \nwas confirmed 6 weeks before Attorney General Reno's confirmation in \nthe last administration and the Deputy Attorney General was confirmed 3 \nweeks before his counterpart in the last administration. Assistant \nAttorney General Bryant was confirmed 7 weeks before his counterpart in \nthe previous administration.\n  The committee is moving expeditiously on the administration's \nnominations to the Department of Justice. Indeed, we are ahead of the \nconfirmations schedule of the Clinton administration for each and every \nnominee confirmed to date.\n  The Clinton administration's Assistant Attorney General to head the \nCriminal Division was not confirmed until November. The committee \nproceeded to consider the Chertoff nomination this week, after a \nhearing last week. That is extremely expeditious. Indeed, in spite of \nMr. Chertoff's role as the lead counsel to the Republicans in the \nWhitewater investigation, an extremely partisan effort, we are moving \nahead. Mr. Chertoff explained at his hearing that he understands the \nrole of the head of the Criminal Division and will carry out those \nfunctions without regard to politics or partisanship. I believe him and \nlook forward to working with him.\n  The Assistant Attorney General to head the Office for Policy \nDevelopment in the last administration was not confirmed until August, \n95 days after her nomination. Professor Dinh did not return his \nresponses to written questions until this Tuesday. He was precipitously \nplaced on the committee agenda last week. Once his responses were in, \nhe was considered and reported out this week, months ahead of his \ncounterpart in the last administration.\n  While we consider the current nominations, the many dedicated \nemployees at the Department of Justice continue to work, do their jobs, \nand serve the public. Many of the comments made over the last several \nweeks disparage their fine work and commitment. I see no evidence that \nthe Department is ``floundering'' or that the dedicated public servants \nwho staff the Department and the United States Attorneys' offices \naround the country have stopped doing their jobs.\n  The chairman has noticed another hearing for Department of Justice \nnominees next week, although he has yet to specify who will be included \nat that hearing, which is less than a week away. Democrats on the \ncommittee are continuing to work expeditiously and cooperatively to \nconsider, report and confirm the vast majority of the President's \nnominations to the Department of Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5102-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, in a speech in Philadelphia on Monday, \nPresident Bush spoke out about gun violence in this country. Citing \nalarming statistics about the number of Americans killed and injured by \nhandguns each year, he stated that ``this is unacceptable in America. \nIt's just unacceptable, and we're going to do something about it.'' The \nPresident emphasized that ``we're going to reduce gun violence in \nAmerica, and those who commit crimes with guns will find a determined \nadversary in my administration.'' I commend the President for his \ncommitment to helping eliminate gun violence.\n  In his speech, the President introduced ``Project Safe \nNeighborhoods,'' an initiative to combat gun violence. The main focus \nof this initiative is on\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nthe increased enforcement of existing gun laws and more vigorous \nprosecution of crimes committed with handguns. The President plans to \ndevote $550 million in funding to this initiative over the next 2 \nyears. The majority of the funding will be dedicated to hiring new \nFederal and State prosecutors to focus on gun crimes, updating State \ncriminal record systems, improving Federal ballistics testing that \ntrace illegal guns and developing regional task forces of Federal, \nState and local law enforcement agencies to catch and prosecute \ncriminals in gun cases.\n  Although there is often disagreement about the best approach to \nending gun violence, we can all agree that enforcement of our gun laws \nand prosecution of people who use guns illegally are essential elements \nto any successful approach. Since 1993, increased law enforcement and \nprosecution efforts have resulted in a 16 percent increase in the \nnumber of gun cases filed and a 41 percent increase in the number of \noffenders sentenced to more than 5 years in prison. These increases in \nenforcement efforts enjoy broad bipartisan support. I commend the \nPresident for building upon this consensus by taking another step \ntoward ensuring that gun criminals are prosecuted to the fullest extent \nof the law.\n  While I agree with the aims of the President's initiative, I believe \nthat it is not enough. We must also make it harder for criminals to get \nguns in the first place, by closing the gun show loophole that allows \nthe purchase of handguns without a background check. Although he stated \nduring the presidential campaign that he supported closing the gun show \nloophole, President Bush did not mention it in his speech on Monday. \nThe President expressed that ``Project Safe Neighborhoods is one step, \nan important step'' toward making domestic tranquility a reality. I \nhope that the President will take the next, necessary step toward \nprotecting the citizens of this country by supporting efforts to close \nthe gun show loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5103-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5103-S5111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SUBMITTING CHANGES TO COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS, FUNCTIONAL LEVELS, AND \n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 310(c)(2) of the Congressional \nBudget Act, as amended, provides the Chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee with authority to revise committee allocations, functional \nlevels, and budgetary aggregates for a reconciliation bill which \nfulfills an instruction with respect to both outlays and revenues.

Mr. President, I am honored to lend my support as an \noriginal cosponsor to the Cuban Solidarity Act of 2001. As many of us \nhere know, the Cuban Solidarity Act of 2001 goes beyond what the \noriginal Helms-Burton Act of 1996 sought to accomplish. Not only does \nit send a clear signal to the Castro regime that there are consequences \nto violating political and religious freedoms and human rights, but \nthat we are going to work fervently to bring about a change in his \nregime.\n  Four years ago, I spoke here on the Senate floor in condemnation of \nthe cowardly acts of the Cuban government in the shooting down of two \ncivilian aircraft. I also expressed my concerns about the unauthorized \nuse of confiscated United States-citizen-owned property. This bill \ncontains a number of provisions that seek compensation from the Cuban \ngovernment on both matters.\n  In Castro's Cuba, dissidents are routinely subjugated to random \narrests, exile, imprisonment and beatings for openly opposing the \ngovernment. During the first two months of 2000, over 350 peaceful \nhuman rights activists were arrested. One of the most notable cases \nincluded that of Dr. Oscar Biscet of the Lawton Human Rights \nFoundation, who received three years in prison for protests against \nabortion and the death penalty.\n  These violations of human rights taking place only ninety miles from \nthe United States, are a threat to international peace.\n  Furthermore, many observers are concerned that a successor to Castro \nis currently being groomed to maintain authoritarian control over the \nisland.\n  This bill will authorize the President to pursue a more pro-active \npolicy towards changing the regime in Cuba from within. It does so by \namending trade sanctions, which will give the President enhanced tools \nin supporting pro-democracy and human rights groups. Such new tools \ninclude authorizing the export of religious, educational and \njournalistic materials to individuals and independent groups, as well \nas office supplies, telephones and fax machines. These individuals and \ngroups may include victims of religious persecution, farm cooperatives, \npolitical prisoners, and worker's rights groups just to name a few. The \nbill will also increase humanitarian aid in the form of food and \nmedicine to children and the elderly.\n  Another large component of this bill, is the support it gives to \nmicro-enterprise efforts in Cuba. By helping self- employed Cubans \nstart their own businesses, we will help to plant the seeds of \nindependent thinking, democracy and entrepreneurialism which will \nensure a more peaceful transition to democracy.\n  Because Castro will not hold power in Cuba forever, we need to take \nthe necessary steps to make sure a transition to democracy is possible \nand likely.\n  It is time for a reinvigorated approach towards Cuba, one that \nincludes bipartisan support. Therefore I am pleased to support the Cuba \nSolidarity Act of 2001, and I would urge others to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5112-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred October 31, \n1999 in Inverness, Florida. After shouting anti-gay epithets, a \nteenager allegedly drove into a group of young people dressed in drag \non Halloween night, killing 17-year-old Allison Decratel and injuring \nanother person. The teenager, Richard Burzynski Jr., 17, and passenger \nThomas Alan Bonneville, 16, drove past the cross-dressed group several \ntimes shouting ``faggots'' at the boys in the group before steering the \ncar into the group of teens. The perpetrators fled the scene but were \napprehended 50 miles north of the incident.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to the accomplishments of Stonewall Jackson \nHigh School, in Manassas, VA. Stonewall Jackson has been named Time \nmagazine's High School of the Year and is featured in the May 21, 2001 \nissue.\n  Time's Schools of the Year were judged on their approaches to the \nmost pressing challenges in education; educating children of the poor; \nconsolidating schools in rural areas; making effective use of \ntechnology in teaching; and getting parents and communities\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\ninvolved in the education of their children.\n  I firmly believe that strong parental involvement is a cornerstone \nfor academic success--for it is parents who know the special needs of \ntheir own children. Steve Constantino, principal of Stonewall Jackson, \nbelieves this also. To increase parental involvement at the high \nschool, Mr. Constantino and his staff planned to put resources in the \nhands of those who know best how to improve the education of their \nchildren, parents. He first removed the counter in the main office to \nwelcome parents and make them feel more comfortable.\n  But Mr. Constantino and the faculty went a step further by putting in \nplace a program called ParentLink. Through a website and voicemail \nsystem, parents can receive up-to-date information regarding their \nchild's grades, homework, attendance, and even the details about what \nwas being taught that day in the classroom. Bridging the communication \ngap between parents, students, and staff extends beyond ParentLink to \nthe community. Stonewall Jackson accommodates working parents' \nschedules by holding Saturday morning events and by encouraging parents \nto make evening use of the school's resources on college and career \noptions.\n  While increasing parental involvement in education, Stonewall Jackson \nhas also vigorously challenged its students through the International \nBaccalaureate Diploma program, a rigorous academic program based on \ninternational perspectives, an enriched curriculum, community \ninvolvement, and written and oral communication skills. An I.B. degree \nis often regarded as superior to the completion of advanced placement \ncourses, and about 45 percent of the student body at Stonewall Jackson \nare enrolled in I.B. courses, with 86 percent scoring four or better on \na five-point scale.\n  Over the period of 1995-1999, SAT scores at Stonewall Jackson have \nrisen 61 points; the school has reduced the disparity between minority \nand non-minority scores by 18 percent; the dropout rate has decreased \nfrom 11 percent to 3 percent; and parent satisfaction has risen from 34 \npercent in 1995 to 59 percent in 1999.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to personally congratulate \nMr. Constantino on being named Prince William County Public School's \n``Principal of the Year'' for 2001, as well as receiving The Washington \nPost's ``Distinguished Educational Leadership Award.'' I also want to \nextend the highest commendation and congratulations to the teachers, \nfaculty, and parents of Stonewall Jackson High School for their \noutstanding performance in educating our children and preparing them to \nthrive in the 21st Century. And last, but certainly not least, to the \nstudents of Stonewall Jackson; I salute you on the floor of the United \nStates Senate, because without you, none of this would be possible.\n  As we all know, today's youth are tomorrow's leaders, and schools \nsuch as Stonewall Jackson are paving the way to a prepared and \nintelligent generation. Stonewall Jackson High School is an inspiration \nto everyone in the community of Manassas, the Commonwealth of Virginia, \nand the United States of America, and should take great pride in the \nhonor this recognition represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5113-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PHOENIX HOME LIFE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise with my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Chris Dodd, to offer congratulations to Phoenix Home \nLife Mutual Insurance Company, which is celebrating its 150th \nanniversary today.\n  Phoenix is actively engaged in so many facets of our society. This \ncompany embodies social leadership through charitable contributions and \ncommunity involvement. The corporate infrastructure of Phoenix is \npermeated with a sense of compassion that looks beyond the bottom line \nand stresses to its employees the importance of investing in human \ncapital as a means of promoting community development.\n  For example, Phoenix encourages employees to volunteer through a \npolicy that allows them to devote 40 hours of company time per year to \ncommunity activities, provided it is matched by the same amount of \npersonal time. The company also rewards its top 20 professional \nadvisors through its Donor's Award, a program that enables employees to \ndesignate up to $2,000 to a local charity. Since it's inception, the \naward has benefited many organizations, including the Juvenile Diabetes \nFoundation, Lou Gehrig Baseball, and the Make-a-Wish Foundation.\n  Through this emphasis on community commitment, Phoenix employees \nadopt their favorite charities, lending their expertise, their \nleadership, and their time to a variety of local outreach initiatives. \nThe Loaves and Fishes soup kitchen is one such beneficiary. Each \nsummer, Phoenix home office employees in Hartford team up with \nFoodshare to harvest vegetables donated by Connecticut farmers for area \nsoup kitchens and shelters. Another example is the planning and \norganization, by a group of employees in 1999, of Connecticut's first \nAdoption and Foster Care Exposition, sponsored by Phoenix.\n  Additionally, Phoenix has spearheaded a three-million-dollar ``Legacy \nCampaign'' to sustain and promote the Doc Hurley Foundation. Through \nfinancial scholarships, mentoring from foundation trustees, and help \nwith purchasing books, the campaign's endowment will help city high \nschool students go to college. Phoenix will contribute a total of \n$500,000 over the course of the campaign.\n  One of Phoenix's greatest investments in our communities and in \nsociety has been its commitment to Special Olympics. In 1995, Phoenix \nmade an eight-year commitment to Special Olympics International as its \nfirst Official Worldwide Partner, setting a standard for volunteerism \nfew companies can match. Approximately 60 percent of home office \nemployees volunteered at the Special Olympics World Games. Field \noffices also provided volunteers and raised money to assist local \nchapters with travel and lodging expenses, enabling athletes across the \ncountry to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n  Phoenix has proven itself to be an indispensable asset to \nConnecticut. By making community involvement a priority, Phoenix \ndemonstrates that an alliance between the business sector and the \ncommunity is not just possible, it is necessary.\n  At the end of the day, Phoenix is not a faceless multi-national \ncorporation. Through its selfless endeavors within Connecticut's \ncommunities, it has proven itself to be the consummate good neighbor. \nPhoenix is a leader in the competitive world of business and a winner \nin the hearts of countless Connecticut residents. It is with great \nappreciation and honor that I ask my colleagues to join me in offering \ncongratulations to Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company on its \n150th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5113-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5113-S5114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHRIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments on the \nsesquicentennial anniversary of Christ Episcopal Church in St. Joseph, \nMO.\n  The first formal service of the Episcopal Church was held in the \norchard of Mrs. Kate Howard's home at 5th and Francis on September 1, \n1851. The Reverend John McNamara, Missionary to the Platte Purchase, \ncelebrated the service. On April 14, 1852, Christ Church parish was \norganized and the small group purchased a log structure at the \nnorthwest corner of 3rd and Jules.\n  On July 30, 1877 Bishop Robertson of the Diocese of Missouri laid the \ncornerstone of the new church. The building is brick in the English \nGothic style. It is the second oldest building in the city in \ncontinuous use as a place of worship by one congregation.\n  During the 1896 renovation an organ was purchased from a church in \nConnecticut. This Johnson organ was originally built in 1867. The women \nof the parish who sponsored three operettas at the Tootle Opera House \nraised the money for the organ. The original portion is the oldest \norgan in St. Joseph.\n  Christ Episcopal Church continues to be a presence in downtown St. \nJoseph. The members are involved in community outreach activities \nincluding the Open Door Food Kitchen, Downtown Partners Association, \nEcumenical Corporation for Housing Opportunities, and a Mother's Day \nBaby Shower to benefit the Division of Family Services.\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\n  I commend the congregation of Christ Episcopal Church on their \ncontinued commitment to maintain high standards of worship, music and \nfellowship for a church of 220 parishioners. I am pleased to join with \nthe St. Joseph community and the State of Missouri in congratulating \nthe congregation and wishing them continued growth and success for the \nnext 150 years. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5114-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING CURTIS GIBSON\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a young man who \nrepresents the best of Montana, Curtis Gibson. Curtis has distinguished \nhimself as an intelligent, self-motivated Eagle Scout from troop nine \nin Billings and I am proud to speak about his accomplishment today. I \nwould like to begin by stating that Curtis is the son of Robert and \nLinda Gibson and the brother of Kelly Gibson, who is also an Eagle \nScout.\n  As you may know, a Boy Scout is called to follow a strict code of \nconduct. He must be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, \nkind and brave. I am proud to say that Curtis Gibson embodies all of \nthese attributes. While upholding the principles of the Scout oath and \nlaw, a potential Eagle Scout must earn 21 merit badges and prove to be \na capable and effective leader. Moreover, he must also show that he has \nplanned, developed, and led others in various service projects. I am \nhere to affirm that Curtis has met these criteria and has recently been \nawarded the rank of Eagle Scout.\n  Along the way to becoming an Eagle Scout, Curtis organized 20 scouts \nfrom Troop Nine to improve Montana's park system. They designed and \nconstructed covered information kiosks at the entrances to Two Moon \nPark and Norm Schoenthal Island to benefit the Yellowstone River Parks \nAssociation and the Yellowstone County Parks Department. These scouts \nvolunteered more than 100 hours during the school year to complete the \nproject and I am grateful for his dedication to the greater Billings \ncommunity. Curtis's project certainly benefits our park systems, but it \nalso serves Troop Nine and those who gave their time for service and \nleadership.\n  I am proud to say that Curtis has been involved in scouting for more \nthan ten years and that he has spent six of those years with Troop \nNine. Even though Saint Bernard's Parish in the Billings Heights is \ntheir home, Curtis has allowed his scouting activities to take him to \nMinnesota, Wyoming, South Dakota, the Florida Keys and Canada. In \naddition, Curtis recently joined Venture Crew Seven. This group joins \ntogether experienced Boy Scouts in the Billings area for extensive \noutdoor activities and service projects. However, Curtis has not \nlimited himself solely to scouting. He is an active member of the \nstudent body at Skyview High School where he competes on the varsity \nswim team. Last year Curtis was named to the Montana all-state swim \nteam.\n  Once again, I would like to express my appreciation to Curtis for his \ndedication to the state of Montana and his service to the city of \nBillings. Curtis has prepared himself well for a lifetime of \nleadership. The youth of our communities will certainly one day, direct \nthe future greatness of our Nation. It gives me great joy to see that \nCurtis has taken an active role to ensure the continued success and \ntriumph of Montana and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5114-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ``BUD'' CLAY\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nWorld War II veteran who brought hope to an occupied people.\n  On May 24th for more than half a century, the residents of the former \nGerman-occupied Als Island off the coast of Denmark celebrated Robert \n``Bud'' Clay as a hero. However, until recently, Bud was unaware of \nthis honor.\n  Robert B. Clay was a Lieutenant Colonel in the 351st Bomb Group \nstationed in Polebrook, England during World War II. He was leading a \nB-17 bombing raid when things went terribly wrong. The plane's engines \nstarted failing one by one. Bud steered the plane toward neutral \nSweden, but with the failure of an additional engine, it was clear that \nthey would be unable to escape enemy territory. After ensuring that \neight of the ten crewmen had safely bailed out of the plane, Clay and \nhis copilot attempted a crash-landing in a nearby grassy clearing on \nAls Island.\n  Als Island was first occupied by German troops in 1939. The crashing \nof the B-17 on May 24, 1944 was seen by the people of the island as a \nsymbol of approaching liberation. In fact, the plane was such a beacon \nof hope to them that the people of Als Island kept pieces of the \nwrecked B-17 not only as souvenirs but also as near-sacred tokens. One \nwoman even made her wedding dress using fabric taken from one of the \npilot's parachutes.\n  All the crewmen in Lieutenant Colonel Clay's plane survived the \nflight, but were taken as prisoners-of-war. Clay was held captive as a \nPOW for one year in camps near Sagon, Nuremburg, and finally Mooseburg, \nGermany.\n  Then on the 28th of April, 1945, Bud saw the stars and stripes being \nflown from a tall building in an adjacent town. He suddenly realized \nthat liberation was on its way. An experience uncannily like the Danes \nwho viewed his plane's crash as a harbinger of freedom.\n  For 40 years Clay did not speak of his experience. He was the pilot \nof the mission and harbored feelings of guilt and responsibility, for \nthe crash, for his crew being taken as POWs, and for not being able to \nfinish out other missions.\n  However, as he was looking through a war-reunion newsletter two years \nago, Clay recognized a photograph of the plane wreckage and the hills \nand farmhouses surrounding it. An islander had taken the picture as a \nboy and published the photo and story in hopes of finding the Americans \nwhose crash-landing has been celebrated for decades.\n  This year will be the first year that Clay will be part of that \ncelebration. He and five others from his bomber crew have been invited \nto personally attend the ceremonies that have been held in their honor \nfor 56 years.\n  Clay will forever live as a hero in the memories of Als Island \npeople. He has received e-mails and letters from them expressing their \nthanks. They have told him that seeing his plane helped them realize \nfor the first time that help was on the way. I am very proud that this \ngreat man, who continues to serve in his local community, will finally \nreceive the personal recognition he earned so long ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5114-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5114-S5115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MIAMI EDISON MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you a \nremarkable story.\n  As sweeping a statement as this is, the story of Miami Edison Middle \nSchool is truly the story of America in the 20th Century.\n  It is the story of immigration, with all its challenges, and all its \nrewards.\n  It is the story of hard work, of culture differences, and cross-\ncultural understanding.\n  It is the story of a city, and a neighborhood and how each generation \nthat passes through leaves behind a layer to build on.\n  With its Art Deco auditorium and full-sized gymnasium, Miami Edison \nHigh School, originally called Dade County Agricultural High, was as \nmagnificent a structure as you could imagine when it was built in 1928.\n  Through the school, one can trace the growth and transformation of \nthe face of Miami, and indeed, the country.\n  When it opened in what was then Lemon City, a swath of land \nsurrounded by lemon and orange groves, the entire student body was \nwhite.\n  My wife, Adele, was a student there, as were many of the men and \nwomen who are today some of Florida's most respected citizens, \nincluding Congressman Clay Shaw and his wife, Emilie, historian Arva \nMoore Parks and Miami Dolphins football star Nat Moore.\n  By the 1960s, most of the students were Hispanic.\n  A new high school for the area was built in 1978 and Edison became a \nmiddle school.\n  Today, the majority of students are of Haitian descent or are recent \nHaitian immigrants. Edison High School has the highest percentage in \nthe state of students still learning English. It has the lowest math \nand reading tests scores. It has far too many students living in \npoverty.\n  The original high-school building, however, looks much the same as it \ndid when it was built, only better.\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\n  For years Edison, like many urban schools, was left to crumble. \nFinally, school and county officials decided it was time to put this \npiece of Florida history in the path of the wrecking ball. To many \nEdison alumni, organized as the ``Over the Hill Gang, this was \nunconscionable.\n  In an age when too many children are being taught in makeshift \nclassrooms, trailers and former utility closets, we were sacrificing \nwhat could truly have been called a temple of learning. We were \ncarelessly trampling our history and taking down with it the too-long-\nlost tradition of teaching our children in school buildings that \nreflect that grandeur of what goes on inside their walls.\n  A group of Edison alumni including Arva Moore Parks, one of Florida's \ngreat voices for preserving our history, fought to save the school.\n  In 1992, Dade County agreed to keep the original school standing and \nrefurbish it to meet the needs of today's students.\n  While the alumni group had the best intentions, the parents of \ntoday's Edison students were wary, and not without cause.\n  The neighborhood had been promised a new middle school in 1988. It \nwas supposed to be completed by 1992. Instead, children were still \ntrying to learn in a decaying, leaking building.\n  The move to preserve the old school looked, to many neighborhood \nparents, like another broken promise.\n  In the end, the families of that area got the best of both worlds. \nThe building, restored by architect Richard Heisenbottle of Coral \nGables, is a magnificent melding of old and new. The architectural \nelements of the past are bolstered by a new wing, new lighting, \nplumbing and air-conditioning. Old classrooms were gutted and \nrefurbished. The original wood floor of the gymnasium remains in place \nalong with a 1,700-seat auditorium with Deco light fixtures and a \ncarved, wraparound balcony. In 1997 the architect, the alumni group, \nthe Dade County School Board and the Dade Heritage Trust received one \nof the National Trust for Historic Preservation's prestigious honor \nawards for the project.\n  The building itself is a tribute to all involved, but strangely \nenough, it may not be the most important structure that grew out of \nthis effort. The men and women who fought to save the school also built \na sturdy bridge connecting Miami's immigrants to its old guard, its \npresent to its past.\n  One United Band: The Edison Linkage Foundation was formed to reassure \nthe community's parents that today's students mattered as much to the \nalumni as the school building.\n  The foundation raises money for an aggressive mentoring program that \noffers a stipend to successful students at Edison High School to tutor \nyounger, at-risk children and to serve as role models for navigating \nthe challenging and often frightening world of adolescence.\n  For some immigrant children, that world is even more frightening than \nfor most young people.\n  Language barriers are just a small part of the problem many of these \nchildren face. Some came from Haiti directly to middle school without \nhaving had any formal education before. They are illiterate in their \nown language as well as a new one.\n  Many live in poverty, with families who cannot spend as much time \nwith them as they'd like to and cannot help them with their homework.\n  Tutors can help fill in the blanks, bridge the gaps that keep them \nfrom reading, understanding, learning and staying in school. They can \noffer a living, breathing vision of something to strive for.\n  The program has been a resounding success. In the 1999-2000 school \nyear, 26 middle-school students showed measurable academic gains after \nbeing tutored.\n  Of the student's tutored, 15 percent were non-readers. Those students \nare now reading at a level three and above.\n  Meanwhile, the graduating seniors who served as tutors are all headed \nfor college this fall.\n  The money to pay for the tutors' time is raised from Edison alumni \nscattered around the country and through fund-raisers including shows \nand sales of Haitian art.\n  The art shows are both a fund-raising tool for the mentoring program \nand college scholarships, and a source of pride for children from \nHaitian families.\n  The third of these will take place May 21, 2001, in the Florida House \nin Washington, D.C.\n  All of this has been thanks to the hard work of a number of dedicated \nvolunteers and professionals. These include: Martha Anne Collins, \nLinkage Foundation administrator; Ron Major, Edison Middle School \nprincipal; John Walker, coordinator of the tutoring program and an \nassistant principal at Miami Edison High School; Alma King-Jones, \nMiddle School coordinator and administrative assistant to the \nprincipal; Betsy Kaplan of the Dade County School Board; historian Arva \nMoore Parks and my wife, Adele Khoury Graham, who co-chaired the \nLinkage Foundation; Charles Keye, Linkage Foundation treasurer; Fred \nand Mary Exum and the ``Over the Hill Gang'', who have helped \ncoordinate the brick donation program for the Dade County Public School \nsystem.\n  All these people, and many more, are responsible for the vision, and \nthen the reality, that became the Edison Middle School and the Linkage \nFoundation.\n  These men and women reached across generations and through racial and \ncultural divides to unite Miami today with the Miami of yesterday.\n  In doing so, they have helped create a source of hope and opportunity \nfor the Miami of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5115-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5115-S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    45TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAN DO, INC\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize a driving economic force in Hazleton, PA. CAN DO, Inc., \nCommunity Area New Development Organization, has served the Greater \nHazleton area with economic development initiatives since its founding \nin 1956.\n  With the decline of the coal mining industry in the 1950s, Hazleton \nsuffered terrible unemployment and low community morale, and several \nmembers of the community took it upon themselves to reverse the high-\nunemployment trend in the region. With that, Dr. Edgar L. Dessen and a \ngroup of community leaders formed CAN DO. CAN DO's initial purpose was \nto raise money to turn around the difficult time that the community was \nexperiencing.\n  With its tremendous fundraising efforts, CAN DO raised almost \n$750,000, which was enough to purchase land for the development of an \nindustrial park. In less than a year, Valmont Industrial Park was \ncompleted, providing an outstanding facility for businesses to call \nhome. General Foam Company was the first firm to occupy the space and \ncreated 100 new jobs. This was just the beginning of the great work \nthat CAN DO would do.\n  Many years and several facilities later, CAN DO has revitalized \nGreater Hazleton in many ways. The dedication of the leadership in CAN \nDO is phenomenal, and it is without a doubt that they have changed the \nlives of many Northeastern Pennsylvania residents. When economic times \nwere tough in the 1950s, CAN DO displayed the courage and initiative to \nrevitalize their community.\n  As they celebrate their 45th anniversary I would like to congratulate \nthem with the following resolution:\n\n       Whereas CAN DO is an economic development agency serving \n     Greater Hazleton in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and,\n       Whereas CAN DO was founded in 1956 as a grass-roots \n     movement to attract new industries to Greater Hazleton as the \n     anthracite coal industry failed, and,\n       Whereas CAN DO has created four industrial parts--Valmont \n     Industrial Park, Humboldt Industrial Park, McAdoo Industrial \n     and the CAN DO Corporate Center, and,\n       Whereas CAN DO has been responsible for more than 280 \n     development projects, and,\n       Whereas CAN DO has been responsible for the creation of \n     more than 11,000 current jobs in Greater Hazleton, and\n       Whereas CAN DO has been responsible for the creation of a \n     tax base worth millions of dollars, and,\n       Whereas CAN DO has been recognized nationally for the \n     quality of their work in the field of economic development, \n     and\n       Whereas CAN DO has worked cooperatively with other \n     governing and volunteer bodies to improve the general quality \n     of life for every man, woman, and child in and around Greater \n     Hazleton, and,\n       Whereas CAN DO is this year celebrating its 45th \n     anniversary,\n       Therefore, be it declared that CAN DO is to be \n     congratulated for reaching such an important milestone in its \n     long, distinguished history, and\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\n       Be it declared that CAN DO is to be commended for \n     performing such meritorious service in the area of economic \n     development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5116-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JAY C. DAVIS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity \nto recognize the accomplishments of Dr. Jay C. Davis, the first \nDirector of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, more commonly known as \n``DTRA.'' Jay completes his tenure as the Director on June 21, 2001 and \nwill be returning to Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory.\n  In October 1998, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was established \nby the Department of Defense to respond to the growing threat posed by \nthe proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, so \ncalled ``weapons of mass destruction'' or WMD. DTRA was charged to \nintegrate and focus the capabilities of the Department on the present \nand future WMD threat.\n  The new Agency needed a Director and the Department picked Jay to \nestablish the Agency, provide its vision, and assure its rapid success. \nJay's accomplishments make him an excellent choice for this job. While \nJay, a nuclear physicist, had spent the majority of his career at \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he's been active in treaty \nverification and nonproliferation technologies, as well as the design \nof research and development collaborations.\n  He served as scientific advisor to the United Nations Secretariat, \nseveral US agencies, and to the scientific agencies of the governments \nof Australia and New Zealand. He participated in two UN inspections in \nIraq. Jay is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and was one of \nits Centennial Lecturers in its 100th Anniversary Year. The author of \nmore than seventy published works in his discipline, he also holds \nthree patents on analytical techniques and applications.\n  During his three years at DTRA, Jay created an agency that is widely \nrespected. Today, DTRA performs many important missions. It is \npartnered with the Commanders-in-Chief of the combatant commands, the \nServices, and the Department of Energy on the maintenance of the \nphysical and doctrinal components of our nuclear deterrent. It provides \nwarfighters with tools to prevail against WMD. DTRA also executes all \narms control treaty inspections, cooperative agreements, and technology \ncontrol activities in the Department of Defense. In addition, Jay has \nbeen instrumental in leading and defining the Department's role in \nsupporting local and state agencies in WMD terrorism response \noperations. Under his leadership, DTRA has contributed significantly to \nthe evolving concept of homeland defense.\n  Jay has twice been awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal by \nthe Secretary of Defense, DoD's highest civilian award, for his \ncontributions to national security.\n  He and his wife May soon will return to the Livermore valley, where \nhe will become the first National Security Fellow at the Lab's Center \nfor Global Security Research. In this new position, Jay will do what he \ndoes best, bringing together scientists and technologists with policy \nanalysts to study ways in which technology can enhance national \nsecurity. I congratulate Jay on all his accomplishments at DTRA and \nwish him the best in his future endeavors at Lawrence Livermore \nNational Laboratory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5116-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5116-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5116-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:51 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 622.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska relative to the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 5\n\n       Whereas, in sec. 1002 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act (ANILCA), the United States Congress \n     reserved the right to permit further oil and gas exploration, \n     development, and production within the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska; and\n       Whereas, the oil industry, the state, and the United States \n     Department of the Interior consider the coastal plain to have \n     the highest potential for discovery of very large oil and gas \n     accumulations on the continent of North America, estimated to \n     be as much as 10,000,000,000 barrels of recoverable oil; and\n       Whereas, the ``1002 study area'' is part of the coastal \n     plain located within the North Slope Borough, and residents \n     of the North Slope Borough, who are predominantly Inupiat \n     Eskimo, are supportive of development in the ``1002 study \n     area''; and\n       Whereas, oil and gas exploration and development of the \n     coastal plain of the refuge and adjacent land could result in \n     major discoveries that would reduce our nation's future \n     need for imported oil, help balance the nation's trade \n     deficit, and significantly increase the nation's security; \n     and\n       Whereas domestic demand for oil continues to rise while \n     domestic crude production continues to fall with the result \n     that the United States imports additional oil from foreign \n     sources; and\n       Whereas development of oil at Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk, \n     Endicott, Lisburne, and Milne Point has resulted in thousands \n     of jobs throughout the United States, and projected job \n     creation as a result of coastal plain oil development will \n     have a positive effect in all 50 states; and\n       Whereas Prudhoe Bay production is declining by \n     approximately 10 percent a year; and\n       Whereas, while new oil field developments on the North \n     Slope of Alaska, such as Alpine, Badami, and West Sak, may \n     slow or temporarily stop the decline in production, only \n     giant coastal plain fields have the theoretical capability of \n     increasing the production volume of Alaska oil to a \n     significant degree; and\n       Whereas opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge now allows sufficient time for planning \n     environmental safeguards, development, and national security \n     review; and\n       Whereas the 1,500,000-acre coastal plain of the refuge \n     makes up only eight percent of the 19,000,000-acre refuge, \n     and the development of the oil and gas reserves in the \n     refuge's coastal plain would affect an area of only 2,000 to \n     7,000 acres, which is less than one-half of one percent of \n     the area of the coastal plain; and\n       Whereas 8,000,000 of the 19,000,000 acres of the refuge \n     have already been set aside as wilderness; and\n       Whereas the oil industry has shown at Prudhoe Bay, as well \n     as at other locations along the Arctic coastal plain, that it \n     can safely conduct oil and gas activity without adversely \n     affecting the environment or wildlife populations; and\n       Whereas the state will ensure the continued health and \n     productivity of the Porcupine Caribou herd and the protection \n     of land, water, and wildlife resources during the exploration \n     and development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, Alaska; and\n       Whereas the oil industry is using innovative technology and \n     environmental practices in the new field developments at \n     Alpine and Northstar, and those techniques are directly \n     applicable to operating on the coastal plain and would \n     enhance environmental protection beyond traditionally high \n     standards; be it\n       Resolved by the Alaska State Legislature, That the Congress \n     of the United States is urged to pass legislation to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, \n     to oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and \n     that the Alaska State Legislature is adamantly opposed to \n     further wilderness or other restrictive designation in the \n     area of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, Alaska; and be it further\n       Resolved, That that activity be conducted in a manner that \n     protect the environment and naturally occurring population \n     levels of the Porcupine Caribou herd and uses the state's \n     work force to the maximum extent possible; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature opposes any \n     unilateral reduction in royalty revenue from exploration and \n     development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, and any attempt to coerce the State \n     of Alaska into accepting less than the 90 percent of the oil, \n     gas, and mineral royalties from the federal land in Alaska \n     that was promised to the state at statehood.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     George W.

A bill to provide for protection of gun owner privacy and \nownership rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to announce the introduction of \nlegislation that would make a technical correction to Chapter 44 of \ntitle 18 of the United States Code which would ensure that the rights \nof law-abiding gun owners are not further eroded by the Federal \nGovernment when it performs background checks for the purchase of \nfirearms.\n  My heart goes out to the families who have suffered harm or death at \nthe hands of persons who have chosen to break State and Federal gun \nstatutes. There is no excuse for violence. When one citizen suffers the \neffects of violence, all of America should be outraged and should \ndemand the violation be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  Unfortunately, many people have lost sight of the reason for these \ntragedies, and rather than focusing on preventing further gun violence \nby working to resolve the violent nature of modern society, the debate \nover gun control has deteriorated into an argument over ways to punish \nlaw-abiding citizens for the criminal actions of others. This leaves us \nfar too often confronted with legislation that attempts to make people \nfeel safer without providing any real security.\n  Because of the extreme seriousness that surrounds incidents of gun \nviolence, and because of the deep grief and horror that accompanies \nthose times when the value of a human life is taken so lightly, I \ncannot in good faith support any legislation that makes empty promises \nand then does nothing to protect America's children.\n  Events during the past two years clearly show that no number of laws \nor statutes will protect our children if those laws are not enforced. \nThe key to curbing gun violence is stricter enforcement of existing \nlaws and teaching our children that it is wrong to kill.\n  No legislative action in the world will keep anyone safe if it is not \nenforced. By that same token, taking away the rights of law-abiding \ncitizens does nothing to protect America's children from the illegal \nownership or use of a firearm. As in all social problems, the solution \nto ending gun violence lies in addressing the cause of the disease and \nnot in picking away at its symptoms. Moral and social changes must take \nplace throughout the nation. People must become more involved in their \ncommunities. Parents must become more involved in the lives of their \nchildren. Our society must reinforce the importance of treating others \nas you would like to be treated yourself.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would correct a misguided \noversight that has occurred in the enforcement of the background check \nrequirements by first, prohibiting the Federal Government from imposing \na tax on federally mandated background checks conducted for the \ntransfer of a firearm; second, it would require law enforcement \nagencies who conduct background checks to immediately destroy the \nrecords of those firearm purchasers who, as a result of the background \ncheck, are determined to be a legal purchaser; and finally, it imposes \ncivil penalties for Federal agencies who fail to comply with this \nrequirement.\n\n  The United States stands out as the example of democracy and freedom \nfor the rest of the world. We hold this position because of our \nunswerving dedication to the Constitution, and to a Federal court \nsystem that has diligently worked to uphold the individual rights \ncreated by that historic document. This legislation makes it possible \nfor law enforcement agencies to prevent conflicts that have arisen \nbetween an individual's right to privacy and an enumerated right to own \na firearm. These conflicts have arisen as a result of a bad policy \ndecision that allows Federal agencies to hold onto background check \nrecords for up to 90 days for ``Internal Audit'' reasons. Because of an \ninability to monitor what agencies do with those records during that \ntime, the immediate record destruction requirement is absolutely \nnecessary to prevent abuses that could place the rights of our citizens \nin further conflict. Once again, this does not apply to persons whose \nbackground checks show they are attempting to illegally purchase a \nfirearm but only applies to law-abiding citizens whose background \nchecks demonstrate that they can legally purchase a firearm.\n  The underlying background check statute that this legislation amends \nauthorizes federal agencies to conduct background searches for one \nreason and one reason only, to determine if the applicant can legally \npurchase a firearm. Once that purpose has been fulfilled there is no \nfurther authorization to retain the records of legal and\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nlaw-abiding gun purchasers for any other agency actions.\n  I realize that the question over the rights of gun ownership is an \nemotional issue for many people on both sides of the debate, but until \nthe United States Constitution is overridden and our citizens' rights \nto own a gun are taken away, then our Federal agencies have no \nauthority to impede or prevent law-abiding citizens from purchasing or \npossessing legally-acquired firearms. This legislation would retain \nthose rights and restore equity to the implementation of the firearm \nbackground check statute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN:\n  S. 907. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage the use of ethanol and the adoption of other forms of value-\nadded agriculture, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, things are happening fast in the value-\nadded agriculture industry, and I'm pleased that Missouri is leading \nthe way in establishing innovative, value-added enterprises that will \nhelp our farm economy prosper.\n  By encouraging new economic opportunities that add value to crops, we \ncan help improve the economic stability of our family farms.\n  While value-added agriculture can take many forms, a prime example is \nethanol production. Increased ethanol production is not only exciting \nbecause it can be farmer-owned and farmer-driven, but because it will \ncreate a cleaner-burning fuel that stands to improve air quality.\n  Ethanol production has become increasingly important as cities across \nthe nation strive to fight smog and meet federal clean air standards. \nHundreds of Missouri gas stations in the St. Louis area have begun \ndispensing reformulated gasoline, a move that will help boost demand \nfor ethanol. With ethanol we also have greater energy security because \nwe are replacing oil imports with domestic sources of renewable energy.\n  Additional ethanol production will help provide a consistent demand \nfor corn, which should help to improve corn prices and put more money \nin growers' pockets. Now more than five percent of our domestic corn \nproduction, or 550 million bushels of corn, is used every year to \nproduce ethanol. That's especially important in times such as these \nwhen our farmers are facing critically low commodity prices.\n  Today, I am introducing the Investment in Value-Added Agriculture \nthat will build on the success of programs enacted during the Carnahan \nadministration to encourage ethanol use and other forms of value-added \nagriculture. My legislation updates existing federal law affecting \nethanol and uses Missouri law as a model for federal legislation to \nencourage investments in ethanol and other value-added agribusiness.\n  My proposal consists of three components.\n  First, it would extend the ethanol motor fuel excise tax. Currently, \nthis exemption is due to expire in 2007. My legislation would extend \nthe exemption through 2015.\n  Second, the legislation would expand eligibility of the federal \nproducer tax credit to farmer-owned cooperatives. It would also \nincrease the production capacity limit to allow plants producing up to \n60 million gallons of ethanol receive the credit.\n  Third, the legislation would encourage private investment in new-\ngeneration cooperatives by creating a 50 percent tax credit on \ninvestments in these enterprises. New-generation cooperatives are \nproducer owned entities designed to add a step to the production \nprocess that adds value to crops.\n  With this legislation I want to continue to help farmers in Missouri \nand to also help farmers throughout the United States by bringing \nproven Missouri programs to the federal level. During my husband's \ngubernatorial administration, Missouri made great strides to encourage \nethanol production and value-added agriculture.\n  To encourage ethanol production in the state, Governor Carnahan \nprovided the initial funding for the Missouri Qualified Fuel Ethanol \nProducer Incentive Fund. Under the incentive fund, Missouri ethanol \nproducers are eligible for a maximum annual grant of $3.125 million for \n5 years.\n  Two farmer-owned ethanol plants are now operating in Missouri. Both \nplants utilized funds from this incentive fund.\n  In 1997, Missouri established a value-added grant and loan programs \nto help farmers process and add value to their raw commodities and earn \nmore profit on their products. As of last year this program awarded \nmore than $1.6 million in grants.\n  In addition, the Value-Added Loan Guarantee Program has issued loan \nguarantees for more than $1.7 million. This program offers commercial \nlenders added security on agricultural development loans for projects \nthat add value to Missouri farm products.\n  One of Governor Carnahan's top priorities was the creation of an \nAgriculture Innovation Center. This Center, run out of the Missouri \nDepartment of Agriculture, serves as a one-stop shop for Missouri \nproducers seeking help to implement creative ideas for raising, \nprocessing and marketing agricultural products.\n  It is my sincere hope that this legislation will help encourage \nadoption and investment in value-added agriculture. Value-added \nagriculture holds the promise of invigorating the rural landscape and \nkeeping jobs and income in local communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 908. A bill to require Congress and the President to fulfill their \nconstitutional duty to take personal responsibility for Federal laws; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nCongressional Responsibility Act of 2001. The underlying principle of \nthis legislation is that the Constitution forbids the delegation of \nlegislative powers to any other branch of government.\n  Following the preamble to the Constitution, Article I, Section 1 \nbegins: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a \nCongress.'' The Founders clearly believed that this included the power \nto regulate, as they had noted John Locke's wise admonition that, ``the \nlegislative [branch] cannot transfer the power of making law to any \nother hands.'' They understood that if this transfer did occur, \nlegislators would no longer be responsible for the laws that government \nimposes on the people.\n  Throughout the late eighteenth century and the entire nineteenth \ncentury, in fact for the first 150 years of our republic, the Supreme \nCourt held that the transfer of legislative powers to another branch of \ngovernment was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, in the late 1920's a \nradical break with the Constitution, and established precedent in \nprevious Supreme Court rulings, occurred with the landmark case, J.W. \nHampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States. This was, essentially, a ruling in \nfavor of political expediency, and it started Congress down a slippery \nslope. Since the Hampton case, Congress has ceded its basic legislative \nresponsibilities to executive branch agencies that craft and enforce \nregulations, which have the full force of law.\n  Consequently, our constituents can be taxed, fined, and even \nimprisoned without any congressional action. This is unjust. The \nFounders purposefully designed the Congress to be the most accountable \nbranch of government, but Congress has grown increasingly \nirresponsible. The fundamental link between voter and lawmaker has been \nsevered. A handful of broadly written laws has spawned a virtual \nalphabet soup of government agencies and an overwhelming regulatory \nburden that undermines the very idea of representative government. \nDuring the 106th Congress, 2,510 new rules and revisions of old rules \nwent into effect. Of these, 75 were considered to be major rules--or \nrules with an impact of $100 million or more. The case has become so \negregious that many regulatory analysts believe more consequential law \nis generated in the executive branch than in the legislative branch.\n  The bottom line is that the executive branch has assumed the law-\nmaking authority given to the Congress. This is wrong.\n  The Congressional Responsibility Act would restore the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Congress over the formulation of all laws by \nmaking executive branch agencies accountable to the American people \nthrough their elected representatives in Congress. In\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nshort, it would return power to Congress, and ultimately it would \nreturn power to the people who elect us.\n  Under the Congressional Responsibility Act all rules and regulations \nwould have to come before the Congress prior to being enacted into law. \nCongress would then be required to have an up or down vote on the \nproposed rule or regulation before it could take effect. The bill \nprovides for consideration of rules and regulations in an expedited \nmanner, unless a majority of Members vote to send it through the normal \nlegislative process. Under the bill, if Congress did not take action on \nthe rule, then it would die by default. This approach not only puts \nCongress back in control of the legislative process, it also ends the \nhorrendous practice of delegation without representation--and it makes \nCongress accountable for the laws that affect the lives of every \nAmerican. It is about returning power, responsibility and authority \nback to Congress.\n  This non-partisan, ideologically neutral concept was first offered by \nthen Judge Stephen Breyer who wrote that we should end delegation as a \nmeans to satisfy ``the literal wording of the Constitution's bicameral \nand presentation clauses.'' The concept offered in the Congressional \nResponsibility Act also takes into account the Supreme Court's 1983 \ndecision in INS v. Chadha, which held a one-house veto to be \nunconstitutional. Other supporters of this concept include Judge Robert \nBork; David Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School; and \nnumerous other constitutional scholars.\n  The Constitution suffered greatly in the twentieth century. Now, at \nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, we have a tremendous \nopportunity to restore the Constitution to its rightful preeminence as \nthe guarantor of our freedoms, the protector of our liberties, and the \nguiding force for our form of government.\n  Delegation of legislative powers is as wrong today as taxation \nwithout representation was in the 1700s. With enactment of this \nlegislation, we will send a clear message to the bureaucrats in \nWashington and to the American people at home: Congress must not \ndelegate its constitutionally-granted powers.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, the Wildlife Services Division of the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture needs assistance in expediting \nproper bird management activities. I am here today to introduce \nlegislation that accomplishes this goal.\n  Proper migratory bird management is important to the State of \nArkansas for a number of reasons. We are deemed ``The Natural State'' \ndue to the numerous outdoor recreational opportunities that exist in \nthe State. Fishing, hunting, and bird watching opportunities abound \nthroughout Arkansas. Maintaining proper populations of wildlife, \nespecially migratory birds, is essential for sustaining a balanced \nenvironment.\n  In Arkansas, aquaculture production has taken great strides in recent \nyears. The catfish industry in the State has grown rapidly and Arkansas \ncurrently ranks second nationally in acreage and production of catfish. \nThe baitfish industry is not far behind, selling more than 15 million \npounds of fish annually, with a cash value in excess of $43 million. I \nhave been a great supporter of this industry since my days in the House \nof Representatives and I am concerned about the impact the double \nbreasted cormorant is having on this industry. In the words of one of \nmy constituents, ``The double-crested cormorant has become a natural \ndisaster!'' I am pleased that the Fish and Wildlife Service has agreed \nto develop a national management plan for the double breasted cormorant \nand I am hopeful that an effective management program will be the \nresult of these efforts.\n  One of my top priorities since coming to Congress in 1992 has been to \nwork to make government more efficient and effective. To specifically \naddress what I see as an inequity among government agencies regarding \nthis issue, I am introducing a bill today that gives Wildlife Service \nemployees as much authority to manage and take migratory birds as any \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee. After all, Wildlife Services \nbiologists are professional wildlife managers providing the front line \nof defense against such problems. With this legislation I would like to \nrecognize the excellent job that Wildlife Services has done and is \ndoing for bird management.\n  Currently, USDA-Wildlife Services is required to apply for and \nreceive a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before they \ncan proceed with any bird collection or management activities. This \nprocess is redundant and unnecessary. Oftentimes, Wildlife Services \nfinds that by the time a permit arrives, the birds for which the permit \nwas applied for are already gone. I hope that this legislation will \nlead to a more streamlined effort for management purposes and I urge \nboth agencies, USDA and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to work together \nto accomplish this goal.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Tim \nHutchinson, for joining me in this effort and look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that government is operating efficiently.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Dayton and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 910. A bill to provide certain safeguards with respect to the \ndomestic steel industry; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Save the \nAmerican Steel Industry Act of 2001. As you know, the domestic steel \nindustry is currently faced with the most devastating crisis in its \nhistory, one that could lead to its decimation if the Administration \nfails to initiate action under Section 201 of our trade laws. Over two-\nthirds of our largest steelmakers have entered bankruptcy since 1997, \nand some analysts predict that almost half of existing U.S. steelmaking \ncapacity may be idled by year's end if the President does not take \nimmediate and decisive action to provide the industry with desperately \nneeded relief. The surge of dumped, subsidized, and disruptive imports \nthat was initially triggered by the onset of the Asian financial crisis \nhas not abated, but has in fact worsened over the past few months. \nSteel prices have plummeted over the last 3 years, with no hopes of \nrebounding, and an additional five U.S. steel companies entered Chapter \n11 in the first 4 months of this year, with more certain to follow \nabsent Presidential action on Section 201.\n  My State has two major steel facilities, one owned by Weirton and the \nother by Wheeling-Pittsburgh. Wheeling-Pitt is in bankruptcy and \nWeirton is struggling. Thousands of jobs and two important communities \nin a small, relatively poor State are threatened. It is a situation \nthat is all too common in the American steel belt, and one that demands \nimmediate attention.\n  Throughout the steel belt, tens of thousands of jobs are at stake; \nmore than 20,000 have already been lost. Hundreds of communities are \nendangered. Billions of dollars in wages and shareholder value are \nthreatened. Most alarming, our national security is threatened. Unless \nwe act decisively, the United States could soon be as dependent on \nforeign steel as we are on foreign oil. We are facing a permanent loss \nof capacity that has the potential to harm every heavy industry in this \ncountry, including automakers, defense contractors and, in my home \nState of West Virginia, aerospace companies.\n  For some time now, I have advocated consolidation as one of the best \nways to ensure the survival of the domestic steel industry in the face \nof this massive surge of imports. Merged companies create greater \neconomies of scale and with their enhanced capacity and purchasing \npower, stand a better chance of competing against their heavily \nsubsidized foreign competitors. While consolidation by itself will not \nrelieve the hardships of the steel crisis for our steelworkers, their \nfamilies and communities, the domestic industry can really only recover \nwith the imposition of remedies under Section 201, I believe that it is \na step in the right direction.\n  Unfortunately, the pace of consolidation in the domestic industry has \nbeen slowed due to companies' fears of assuming the tremendous legacy \nand environmental compliance costs of acquired entities. Legacy costs, \nin particular, are a tremendous expense for companies, as there are \nmore retired steelworkers than steelworkers currently employed. The \nburden of assuming such substantial costs has acted as\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\na deterrent to industry consolidation, which I believe, gives our \nindustry a much better chance of long-term survival.\n  The Save the American Steel Industry Act of 2001 attempts to address \nthese concerns. Title I of the Act establishes a Steel Retiree Health \nCare Board in the Department of Labor to administer a newly-created \nHealth Care Benefit Costs Assistance Program. Under the program, the \nboard will contribute funds to eligible steelworker group health plans \nequal to 75 percent of the qualified expenditures of such plans. The \nfunds will be allocated from a Steelworker Retiree Health Care Trust \nFund in the U.S. Treasury financed by a 2 percent Federal excise tax on \nall steel products sold in the United States.\n  Title I is critical, because by some estimates, 10 percent of the \ncost of steel in the U.S. consists of payments to pension and retiree \nhealth care funds for workers laid off in the 70's and 80's. This new \nfund would be accessible to all steel companies providing health \ninsurance to retirees and, as the pool of affected retirees declines, \nthe tax will be reduced. In the meantime, U.S. companies will be at \nless of a disadvantage against competitors whose governments pick up \nthe tab for health care and retirement costs.\n  Title II of the Act allows merged companies to apply for grants of up \nto $200 million from the Commerce Department to help cover the costs of \ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations. The Secretary of \nCommerce can only provide grants after it is determined that the merger \npromotes maximum retention of jobs and production capacity consistent \nwith long-term viability. Specifically, at least 80 percent of the \nsteelworkers employed by the merging companies, including a minimum 50 \npercent of steelworkers employed by the acquired company, must be \nretained to qualify for a grant. At least 80 percent of the steelmaking \nfacilities of each party must be retained. The Act provides for \nsubstantial penalties if a company receiving a grant subsequently \nviolates these thresholds.\n  Together, these two actions could make a tremendous difference for \nmany domestic steel mills, especially small and mid-sized operations by \nproviding incentives for domestic steel companies to consider joining \nforces. The Health Care Benefit Costs Assistance Program proposed under \nTitle I makes mergers more likely by ensuring that a large portion of \nlegacy costs inherited in consolidation plans would be covered by the \nFederal Government. By providing domestic steelmakers with substantial \nfunds to bring merged facilities into compliance with environmental \nlaws, Title II of the bill provides further incentives for \nconsolidation. At the same time, Title II ensures that steelworkers and \ntheir families are not sacrificed in the merger process by requiring \nthat most jobs and production capacity are retained and by heavily \npenalizing companies that receive funding and subsequently do not stick \nto the agreement.\n  The American steel industry has earned the respect and consideration \nof this body as an industry that took some very tough medicine not so \nvery long ago. During the first steel crisis, the U.S. steel industry \ngot very little sympathy. As the first great wave of imports washed \nacross our coasts, the industry was told that it was too old, too \ninefficient, and too unresponsive to save.\n  But rather than walk away, the American steel industry put itself \nthrough a wrenching, and almost miraculous revitalization, transforming \ncentury-old mills into miracles of modern production. No steel industry \non earth gets more production per man hour than the U.S. industry. None \nhas a cleaner environmental record. No one has been faster or more \neffective at integrating computer technology into its production.\n  And yet, having done that, the industry finds itself threatened \nagain--not by better steelmakers, but by subsidized producers. \nCompanies who have the support of their governments are taking \nadvantage of our traditional commitment to trade, to dump steel on a \nsaturated market. Their competitive advantage lies in their government \nsupport, and not their manufacturing skill. It is not fair. It is not \njust. And I don't believe that our Government should stand by idly and \nlet the painful years and billions of dollars our steel industry \ninvested be stolen away by companies who do not play by the rules.\n  The Save the American Steel Industry Act of 2001 represents the first \nstep in the Federal Government's commitment to ensuring that the United \nStates maintains our basic steelmaking capacity. While I do not believe \nthat the industry can survive without a comprehensive Section 201 \naction on all steel products and ultimately, negotiation of a \nmultilateral steel agreement with our trading partners to address the \nforeign overcapacity problem, this act provides greater incentives for \ndomestic steel companies to consider consolidation, which, I believe, \nsubstantially enhances their chances of survival in today's \nincreasingly turbulent steel marketplace. Failure to act now, in this \nCongress, would be a grave mistake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 911. A bill to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act of 1973; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, on Monday, May 7, I traveled once \nagain to Klamath Falls, OR, to address a rally of more than 15,000 \npeople. They came to show their support for the farmers, farm workers, \nsmall business owners and local officials in the Upper Klamath River \nBasin who were devastated by the April 6 Bureau of Reclamation \nannouncement that the agency would deliver no water to most of the \nagricultural lands that have always received irrigation water from the \nfederal project.\n  This decision is expected to cost the local economy between two \nhundred fifty million and three hundred million dollars. This is an \narea that has already been hurt economically by the significant \nreduction in the Federal timber sale program, and was further harmed \nwhen the Federal roadless policy precluded a proposed ski area that \nwould have brought jobs and tourism dollars to the local community.\n  This crisis highlights many of the current problems with the \nadministration of the Endangered Species Act. We are managing the water \nresources in this basin for two fish species, at the expense of all \nother wildlife, including bald eagles. We are foregoing water \ndeliveries to refuges that are a critical component of the western \nflyway in order to triple the water we are sending down the river for \nfish. We are also forgetting our human stewardship, and to date have \nfailed to provide assistance to the farmers and ranchers who are facing \neconomic ruin over this water allocation decision.\n  You cannot look in the faces of those honest, hard-working farmers \nand ranchers, as I have, and believe that this situation is just or \nreasonable. You cannot see the anxiety on the faces of children who \ndon't understand what is happening, or why a fish is more important \nthan their family, and not be moved to action.\n  That is why, to begin a meaningful dialogue on the Endangered Species \nAct, I am introducing the ``Endangered Species Recovery Act of 2001.'' \nThis bill is almost identical to legislation that was reported out of \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the 105th Congress \nby a vote of fifteen to three. Those voting in favor were Senators \nAllard, Baucus, Bond, Chafee, Graham, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kempthorne, \nMoynihan, Reid, Sessions, Smith of New Hampshire, Thomas, Warner, and \nWyden. The bill was supported by the Western Governors' Association, \nand incorporates the recommendations which that Association, the \nNational Governors' Association and the International Association of \nFish and Wildlife Agencies sent to the Congress in 1995.\n  If enacted, this bill would do a better job of recovering species, \nwhile addressing the legitimate concerns of property owners or others \naffected by the Endangered Species Act. While increasing public \nparticipation, this legislation significantly strengthens the recovery \nplanning process and creates new tools to ensure that recovery plans \nare implemented. The bill also streamlines the consultation process and \nprovides significant new incentives for property owners to preserve and \nrestore habitat for listed species.\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n  I remain committed to enhancing our environmental stewardship. But \nright now, we have a situation where over 1,100 species have been \nlisted under the existing Act, and less than two dozen have been \ndelisted. Litigation is consuming far too much of the time and \nresources of federal agencies that could be better spent actually \nrecovering species.\n  The time has come to admit that there must be a better way to protect \nwildlife. I hope that this will be the beginning of a bipartisan \ndialogue that results in effective improvements in the Act.\n  In the meantime, I will continue to press for the assistance that the \nresidents of the Klamath Falls area need to make it through this year. \nIt has become increasingly apparent to me over the last three weeks \nthat existing federal disaster assistance programs and crop insurance \nprograms are simply not geared toward the type of situation we have in \nthe Klamath Falls area. I will continue to press the Administration for \nan assistance package that will provide meaningful relief to these \nfamilies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 912. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nburial benefits for veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veterans Burial \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2001. I am pleased that my colleague, \nSenator Hutchison, joins me in introducing this legislation today.\n  During the upcoming Memorial Day holiday, we will honor our U.S. \nsoldiers who died in the name of their country. These service men and \nwomen are America's true heros and on this day we pay tribute to their \ncourage and sacrifice. Some have given their lives for our country. All \nhave given their time and dedication to ensure our country remains the \nland of the free and the home of the brave. We owe a special debt of \ngratitude to each and every one of them.\n  This holiday serves as an important reminder that our nation has a \nsacred commitment to honor the promises made to soldiers when they \nsigned up to serve our country. As the Ranking Member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee that funds veterans programs, I fight hard \nto make sure promises made to our service men and women are promises \nkept. These promises include access to quality, affordable health care \nand a proper burial for our veterans.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Federal Government has not increased \nveterans' burial benefits for the families of our wounded or disabled \nveterans in over a decade. We are losing over 1,100 World War II \nveterans each day, but Congress has failed to increase veterans' burial \nbenefits to keep up with rising costs and inflation. While these \nbenefits were never intended to cover the full costs of burial, they \nnow pay for only a fraction of what they covered in 1973, when the \nFederal Government first started paying burial benefits for our \nveterans.\n  That's why I am introducing the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement \nAct. This bill will increase burial benefits to cover the same \npercentage of funeral costs as they did in 1973. It will also provide \nfor these benefits to be increased annually to keep up with inflation.\n  In 1973, the service-connected benefit payed for 72 percent of \nveterans' funeral costs. But this benefit has not been increased since \n1988, and it now covers just 29 percent of funeral costs. My bill will \nincrease the service-connected benefit from $1,500 to $3,713, bringing \nit back up to the original 72 percent level.\n  In 1973, the non-service connected benefit payed for 22 percent of \nfuneral costs. It has not been increased since 1978, and today it \ncovers just 6 percent of funeral costs. My bill will increase the non-\nservice connected benefit from $300 to $1,135, bringing it back up to \nthe original 22 percent level.\n  In 1973, the plot allowance payed for 13 percent of veterans' funeral \ncosts. This benefit has never been increased, and it now covers just 3 \npercent of funeral costs. My bill will increase the plot allowance from \n$150 to $670, bringing it back up to the original 13 percent level.\n  Finally, the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act will also \nensure that these burial benefits are adjusted for inflation annually, \nso veterans won't have to fight this fight again.\n  This legislation is just one way to honor our nation's service men \nand women. I want to thank the millions of veterans, Marylanders, and \npeople across the Nation for their patriotism, devotion, and commitment \nto honoring the true meaning of Memorial Day. U.S. soldiers from every \ngeneration have shared in the duty of defending America and protecting \nour freedom. For these sacrifices, America is eternally grateful.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter from \nseveral veterans advocacy groups supporting it, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 912\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: We are pleased to support your \n     proposed legislation, the Veterans Burial Benefits \n     Improvement Act, to increase burial benefits for veterans. A \n     meaningful increase in benefits provided by our Government to \n     cover veterans' burial and funeral expenses is long overdue.\n       This proposed legislation would increase burial allowances \n     to reflect the increasing costs of burial for veterans. \n     Benefits would be increased to cover the same percentage of \n     veterans' burial costs as in 1973. It would also provide for \n     these benefits to be adjusted to cover the costs of \n     inflation.\n       The Independent Budget (IB) produced by AMVETS, Disabled \n     American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars fully supports an adjustment of \n     burial allowances to reflect the increases in burial costs. \n     The allowance for service-connected deaths was last adjusted \n     in 1988, and the allowance for other deaths was last adjusted \n     in 1978. Over these several years without adjustment, the \n     value of the burial allowance has eroded. Clearly, it is time \n     these allowances are raised to make them a more meaningful \n     contribution to the costs of burial for our veterans.\n       We greatly appreciate your efforts to increase veterans \n     burial allowances to a level that reflects the intended \n     benefit. This proposed legislation would help ensure that our\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\n     Nation's military veterans will be buried with the dignity \n     they deserve.\n     David E. Woodbury,\n       Executive Director, AMVETS.\n     Keith W. Wingfield,\n       Executive Director, Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n     Robert E.

A bill to amend title XVIII, of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under the medicare program of all oral anticancer \ndrugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a small bill, but \none with important consequences. My measure, the Access to Cancer \nTherapies Act, would provide coverage of all oral anticancer drugs \nunder the Medicare program. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nRockefeller, Gordon Smith, and Feinstein in introducing this measure.\n  As my colleagues know, there is no Medicare outpatient prescription \ndrug benefit today. If there was, we would not need this legislation. \nThere should be and there must be a Medicare prescription drug benefit \nthis year. Seniors are reeling from the burden of their prescription \ndrug expenses, and they can't defer their illnesses or their costs.\n  This legislation also reminds us of how crucial prescription drugs \nare, not only now but even more so in the future. Eight years ago, \nCongress created a unique Medicare drug benefit for oral anti-cancer \ndrugs, but only if the drug is equivalent to drugs provided \n``incident'' to a physician visit; for example, drugs that must be \ninjected. At present, upwards of 95 percent of cancer drug therapy is \ncovered by Medicare either in a physician office or in a reimbursed \noral form. But in the near future as much as 25 percent of cancer drug \ntherapy will be in the form of oral drugs that are not currently \ncovered.\n  In fact, this is already happening. Today, there are about 40 oral \nanti-cancer drugs, but less than 10 are reimbursed by Medicare. For \nexample, one of the most common drugs used in the treatment of breast \ncancer, tamoxifen, is among the drugs not currently reimbursed by \nMedicare.\n  As cancer therapy moves more toward reliance on oral drugs, Medicare \ncoverage policy must be updated to cover the new therapies, or else \neven the intent of this very limited policy will be meaningless and \nMedicare beneficiaries will increasingly lose access to the best cancer \ntherapies. And without this legislative change, beneficiaries will \nincreasingly bear the burden of buying these drugs from their own \npockets, which most seniors can ill afford.\n  Let me provide one very exciting example of an oral anti-cancer drug \nthat illustrates both the urgency of this policy change and of enacting \na Medicare prescription drug bill. Last week, the Food and Drug \nAdministration approved a compound known as STI-571. Also known by its \nbrand name Gleevec, this medication was approved in a record setting \ntwo and one-half months. Gleevec is used to treat one kind of leukemia \nand may also be effective against a rare but lethal stomach cancer.\n  Gleevec is the first, let me repeat, first, cancer drug to \nspecifically address a molecular target which is not only in the \ncancer, but actually the cause of the cancer, according to the National \nCancer Institute. More precisely, Gleevec knocks out a specific enzyme \nneeded for the cancer to thrive. By contrast, most current cancer \ntherapies act like a shotgun, killing both cancer and normal cells. \nMoreover, Gleevec is among the first fruits of three decades of \nresearch into the basic biology of cancer.\n  But Gleevec is not a cure, it simply arrests the cancer and returns \nmost lab tests to normal. Patients may need to take the drug for life. \nAnd treatment is not cheap--a month's supply of Gleevec costs upwards \nof $2,400.\n  While biomedical research is providing new, more targeted, and less \ntoxic methods of treatment through new oral anti-cancer drugs that \npatients can safely take in the comfort of their own homes, Medicare \npolicy is currently unable to provide reliable access to these \nmedications for beneficiaries with cancer.\n  At the very least, we must ensure all oral anti-cancer drugs are \navailable to our seniors. The Access to Cancer Therapies Act will build \non current Medicare policy by ensuring coverage of all anti-cancer \ndrugs, whether oral or injectable, are available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The Act will provide beneficiaries with access to \ninnovative new therapies that are less toxic and more convenient, more \nclinically effective and more cost-effective than many currently \ncovered treatment options. I urge my colleague to support this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have spoken many times about \nthe importance of adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. There \nare other ways in which the Medicare program could be strengthened, for \nexample, by upgrading for innovative medical technologies not covered \nunder the old structure of Medicare. One example of advanced \ntechnologies that should be in use are oral anti-cancer drugs. I rise \ntoday in support of the Access to Cancer Therapies Act.\n  Most people would be surprised to know that all cancer therapies are \ncovered under Medicare. This situation is due to an accident of fate. \nWhen Medicare was created in 1965, orally administered cancer drugs \nwere completely unknown. While 90 to 95 percent of anti-cancer drug \ntherapy is covered under Medicare Part B, this coverage is largely \nlimited to injectable drugs that are administered incident to covered \nphysician services. Orally administered anti-cancer drugs are only \ncovered if they have an injectable equivalent. Currently there are only \nseven of these pharmaceuticals available. Researchers fully expect that \nin the near future, cancer care will be much more heavily based on oral \ndrugs; while oral drugs currently make up around 5 percent of the \noncology market, it is projected that they will become 25 percent or \nmore within a decade. Continuing to exclude coverage of oral cancer \nmedications will impose significant unnecessary cost burdens on \nMedicare beneficiaries, and could influence treatment decisions more on \nthe basis of cost than quality.\n  The cure for cancer has long been the golden ring of medical \nresearch, eluding the grasp of even the most intrepid scientists. But \ntoday, in Oregon, we are one step close to a cure. At Oregon Health & \nScience University, or OHSU, in Portland, Dr. Brian Druker has \ndiscovered a treatment for a specific form of leukema--a treatment that \noffers hope to cancer patients everywhere. Dr. Druker's treatment, \nknown as Gleevec, offers hope to cancer patients everywhere because it \nshows us how to fight cancer: at the molecular level. As Dr. Peter \nKohler, President of OHSU, said: ``People have won the Nobel Prize for \nlesser work.''\n  For Dr. Druker, this was a dream that began over twenty years ago, as \na medical student. He sat through a lecture on chemotherapy and thought \nthe practice barbaric. He dreamt of the day that chemotherapy could be \nreplaced with a more humane treatment that killed cancerous cells, but \ndidn't ravage the body. In his research, he developed an interest in \nthe proteins responsible for signaling cell growth. He believed these \nproteins were perfect targets for new therapies. In particular, he felt \nthat BCR-ABL, an abnormal protein responsible for overproduction of \nwhite blood cells in a certain type of leukemia, was the best bet for \ntargeted therapy.\n  In 1993, he came to Oregon to head up his own leukemia research lab \nat OHSU. It was at that point that his research really started to \nblossom. He began to experiment with potential treatments for chronic \nmyelogenous leukemia, or CML. One chemical compound, STI 571, \nimmediately showed the most promise. Clinical testing began in June \n1998 and the results were nothing less than astonishing. In every case, \nwhite blood cell counts returned to normal within six weeks. ``I \nthought it was too good to be true,'' Druker says.\n\n  In fact, further clinical trials have shown that STI 571, now known \nas Gleevec, is, if anything, more effective than Dr. Druker originally \nthought.\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\nTrials have been extended to 30 countries and nearly 3000 patients. \nOver 90 percent of those in the disease's acute, or blast, phase have \nseen their white blood cell counts return to normal, and one-third in \nthe same phase have no remaining traces of leukemia. In other words, \nnot only did Gleevec treat the leukemia symptoms, it began to eliminate \nthe molecular basis of the disease altogether. Not surprisingly, the \nFood and Drug Administration last week approved Gleevec for the \ntreatment of CML, the fastest ever approval by the FDA for an anti-\ncancer treatment.\n  Further clinical trials have shown that Gleevec is effective for a \nrare form of cancer known as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST. \nSimilar to the way Gleevec inhibits the BCR-ABL protein that is found \nin nearly all CML sufferers, Gleevec also appears to inhibit the so-\ncalled KIT protein that is prevalent in most gastrointestinal tumor \npatients. Trials are also planned or already underway to test Gleevec \non brain tumors and soft tissue sarcoma. As Dr. Druker says, Gleevec is \nunlikely to be a cure for every form of cancer. Nevertheless, it does \nprovide a road map. The important step is to find the molecular defect \nthat underlies each form of cancer and target it for therapy. And with \nthe completion of the Human Genome Project, the information to help \nfind those molecular defects is now available.\n  The discovery of Gleevec secures Dr. Druker's reputation as one of \nthe foremost scientists of his generation, and may well put him in line \nfor that Nobel Prize mentioned by Dr. Kohler. But it also symbolizes \nthe growing strength of the Oregon Cancer Institute at OHSU. The \ninstitute is relatively new, but that hasn't hindered it from having a \nlarge impact on the field. That's a testament to the high intellectual \ncaliber of the staff there. As Dr. Grover Bagby, director, points out: \nthe Oregon Cancer Institute was founded on the principle of fighting \ncancer at the molecular level. And thanks to Dr. Druker, fighting \ncancer at the molecular level is now the guiding principle for cancer \nresearchers everywhere.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the cure for cancer has \nlong been the golden ring of medical research. Yet today, thanks to the \nwork of Dr. Druker and others at OHSU, cures for cancer are at hand. \nThis is a proud day for medical research, and a proud day for Oregon.\n  Passage of the Access to Cancer Therapies Act would give hope to \nOregonians such as Jim Underwood, a Medicare beneficiary in Oregon in \nthe last stages of leukemia. Because Medicare does not currently cover \noral cancer treatments, many patients like Jim Greenwood may not \nbenefit form the most innovative, appropriate cancer fighting \ntechnologies. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move \nquickly to pass the Access to Cancer Therapies Act so that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries can have access to the most technologically advanced \nmedications available and appropriate for their conditions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I am pleased today to join as an \noriginal sponsor with Senators Snowe, Smith and Rockefeller, a bill to \nprovide Medicare coverage of cancer drugs.\n  More than 8 million Americans require some form of cancer care: 1.2 \nmillion of these are newly diagnosed patients; some are already on \ntreatment; some need follow-up care. Over half a million people will \ndie from cancer this year.\n  Medicare, generally, does not cover cancer drugs. This bill will \nprovide that coverage.\n  Providing Medicare coverage of cancer drugs is particularly important \nin light of a promising new class of drugs that are becoming available. \nOne of those drugs is Gleevec, formerly known as STI 571.\n  I am greatly heartened by the news that on May 10 the Food and Drug \nAdministration approved Gleevec for the treatment of chronic \nmyelogenous leukemia. Gleevec is revolutionary because it can precisely \ntarget the dysfunctional proteins that cause this cancer and it can \ndisable cancer cells to the point that they are metabolically \ninactivated with 12 hours of administering the drug.\n  Furthermore, Gleevec does not destroy the ``good'' cells, as other \ntreatments do. It helped over 90 percent of patients in clinical trials \nand holds great promise for other cancers. Scientists say this drug is \nthe wave of the future.\n  Not only is this drug highly medically effective, it is cost-\neffective. Gleevec is expected initially to cost around $25,000 \nannually. While that is a high price, in my view, the other \nalternative, or standard treatment for this kind of leukemia, is a bone \nmarrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants cost on average $250,000 per \nprocedure. So this drug will be cheaper than the conventional \ntreatment.\n  Sixty percent of cancer cases occur among people over age 65, a \nnumber that will grow as the American population ages, so Medicare is a \nmajor payer of cancer care. Cancer therapies have evolved to the point \nwhere most cancer care is delivered on an outpatient basis, not in a \nhospital.\n  In terms of Medicare, oral, outpatient, prescription cancer drugs are \ncurrently covered by Medicare only if the drugs have the same active \ningredient as the equivalent injectable cancer drug. This means that \nvery few cancer drugs are covered.\n  No one really knows how much Medicare patients pay out-of-pocket for \ncancer drugs, but according to the Institute of Medicine, ``available \nevidence suggests that it is substantial.'' One study found that \nMedicare covered 83 percent of typical charges for lung cancer and 65 \npercent of typical charges for breast cancer. Out-of-pocket expenses \nranged from less than $100 to near $4,000. One-third of Medicare \nbeneficiaries have private insurance that covers the prescription drugs \nthat Medicare does not cover. Even if beneficiaries have private drug \ncoverage, that coverage often has high deductibles and other limits so \nthat beneficiaries still have high out of pocket expenses.\n  The bill we are introducing today addresses just part of the problem. \nClearly, we must work for a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit for all \nillnesses and we must work to improve private health insurance \ncoverage.\n  The cost of delivering cancer care is $50 billion a year, says the \nNational Cancer Institute. These are costs that we can reduce and this \nbill is one step.\n  I hope that by expanding Medicare coverage to cover cancer drugs we \ncan garner support for broader coverage, we can encourage drug \ncompanies to make many more new drugs and we can give hope to millions \nwho suffer from cancer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 914. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n95 Seventh Street in San Francisco, California, as the ``James R. \nBrowning United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to name \nthe courthouse at 95 Seventh Street in San Francisco, CA as the ``James \nR. Browning United States Courthouse.''\n  Judge Browning was appointed to the court by President Kennedy and \nhas spent 40 years as a circuit judge on the Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit. For twelve of those years, he served as Chief Judge. As \nchief judge, Judge Browning reorganized and modernized the \nadministration of the Ninth Circuit. Now, he is on Senior Status.\n  He is originally from Montana and graduated from Montana State \nUniversity in 1938 and from Montana University Law School in 1941, \nachieving the highest scholastic record in his class and serving as \neditor-in-chief of the law review.

Con. Res. 39\n\n       Whereas during the last 8 years, the Federal Government has \n     operated robust offshore and onshore oil, gas, and coal \n     leasing programs that matched or exceeded production levels \n     during the administrations of former President Reagan and \n     former President Bush;\n       Whereas offshore, the United States has leased and \n     currently manages more than 44,000,000 acres of outer \n     Continental Shelf land;\n       Whereas proposals to provide more access to currently \n     protected Federal land for development by the oil, gas, and \n     coal industries ignore the quantity of land that is already \n     available for that purpose;\n       Whereas it is not necessary to drill in sensitive areas to \n     meet the energy needs of the United States;\n       Whereas since 1982, there has been in effect a statutory \n     moratorium on new leasing, pre-leasing, and related \n     activities on submerged land of the outer Continental Shelf;\n       Whereas in 1990, former President Bush used his authority \n     to declare areas of the outer Continental Shelf along the \n     coastlines of Washington, Oregon, California, Bristol Bay, \n     Alaska, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and more than 100 \n     miles off the Florida coast, off limits to new drilling \n     through calendar year 2000;\n       Whereas in 1998, former President Clinton extended the Bush \n     limitation through June 2012;\n       Whereas citizens of California, Florida, and other States \n     affected by the outer Continental Shelf drilling moratorium \n     are overwhelmingly opposed to new oil drilling off their \n     coastlines and are concerned about plans to open the Florida \n     Gulf Coast to new leasing;\n       Whereas a majority of people of the United States are \n     growing increasingly concerned about the environment and \n     believe that protecting the environment should take \n     precedence over economic development;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have made a \n     decision to protect the coastlines of the United States from \n     oil development, because the people know that far better \n     alternatives exist; and\n       Whereas there are many other worthy options before Congress \n     that could increase energy independence and reduce reliance \n     on foreign oil, such as reauthorization of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve, incentives to improve energy efficiency, \n     research into renewable energy and alternative fuels, and \n     full funding of energy conservation and efficiency programs \n     (including programs for solar and renewable energy, \n     weatherization, and other initiatives): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     moratorium in effect as of the date of adoption of this \n     Resolution on new oil and natural gas leasing, pre-leasing, \n     and related activities on submerged land of the outer \n     Continental Shelf should be maintained.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \nresolution to maintain the moratorium on new oil and natural gas \nleasing activity on submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. I \nam happy to be joined by Senator Boxer.\n  With this resolution, we are urging President Bush to continue the \nexisting executive order that places coastline areas of several States, \nincluding California, off limits to new drilling. This moratoria was \ninitiated by former President George H. Bush in 1990, and extended \nthrough 2012 by President Clinton in 1998.\n  The timing of this resolution is important, as the impending \nPresident's energy plan will focus on drilling for new oil and gas \nreserves. With this focus, many of us in Congress fear that the \nAdministration may pave the way for new exploration of the Outer \nContinental Shelf. This would be a tragic mistake that endangers the \ncoastlines of many States, including California, which is one of the \ngreatest environmental treasures in the world.\n  One oil spill from offshore oil wells almost did destroy the \nbeautiful California coastline. In 1969 an oil spill in Federal waters \noff the coast of Santa Barbara killed thousands of birds, as well as \ndolphins, seals, and other animals. Estimates of the amount of oil \nreleased range up to 200,000 barrels. Within days, oil spread from \nCalifornia's Channel Islands to the Mexican border, an area of \napproximately 800 square miles. The people of California were so \nconcerned that shortly thereafter they voted to create the California \nCoastal Commission.\n  Since the 1969 spill, there have been more than thirty additional \nsignificant oil spills off the California coast. Each spill has \nimperiled the environment, the economy, and the beautiful landscape of \nCalifornia.\n  We can try to measure the economic cost of oil spills. For example, \nthe value of our coast as ocean-dependent industry is estimated to \ncontribute $17 million per year to our state economy. But we cannot \nmeasure the value placed on our quality of life. In 1991, the \nCalifornia Department of Parks and Recreation found that almost 70 \npercent of Californians had participated in beach activities, and that \n25 percent of Californians had participated in saltwater fishing. We \nsimply cannot endanger this resource for limited production.\n  There is widespread and bipartisan agreement that oil drilling \npresents serious environmental dangers, and I urge the President to \nmaintain the moratorium on new oil and gas leasing activity on the \nOuter Continental Shelf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5127-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5127-S5128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 40--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n REGARDING THE DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF MAY 20, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL \n                   EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \nCarnahan, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. \nDaschle, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nEnsign, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\nFitzgerald, Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. \nLincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                             S.

Res 40\n\n       Whereas emergency medical services are a vital public \n     service;\n       Whereas the members of emergency medical services teams are \n     ready to provide lifesaving care to those in need 24 hours a \n     day, 7 days a week;\n       Whereas access to quality emergency care dramatically \n     improves the survival and recovery rate of those who \n     experience sudden illness or injury;\n       Whereas providers of emergency medical services have \n     traditionally served as the safety net of America's health \n     care system;\n       Whereas emergency medical services teams consist of \n     emergency physicians, emergency nurses, emergency medical \n     technicians, paramedics, firefighters, educators, \n     administrators, and others;\n       Whereas approximately two-thirds of all emergency medical \n     services providers are volunteers;\n       Whereas the members of emergency medical services teams, \n     whether career or volunteer, undergo thousands of hours of \n     specialized training and continuing education to enhance \n     their lifesaving skills;\n       Whereas Americans benefit daily from the knowledge and \n     skills of these highly trained individuals;\n       Whereas injury prevention and the appropriate use of the \n     emergency medical services system will help reduce health \n     care costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the week of May 20, 2001, is designated as ``National \n     Emergency Medical Services Week''; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such week with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am rising to introduce a bipartisan \nresolution to designate May 20-26, 2001 as National Emergency Medical \nServices Week in honor of the 750,000 Emergency Medical Services, EMS, \npersonnel who are on the front lines every day saving the lives of \ncountless Americans. I am delighted that my esteemed colleague, Senator \nBaucus, is joining me as the primary cosponsor, in addition to 50 other \noriginal cosponsors.\n  The theme of this year's week is ``EMS: Answering the Call,'' \nemphasizing the responsiveness of emergency medical services around the \ncountry, while underscoring the importance of the national 9-1-1 \nemergency number system. This observance also honors the passion and \ncommitment of those serving the system including emergency physicians, \nemergency nurses, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, \nfirefighters, and many other dedicated individuals who provide \nlifesaving care 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n  The continued strength and growth of our Emergency Medical Services \nSystem has been an important issue to me. In 1984, Senator Inouye and I \nworked closely with several of our colleagues to enact legislation to \nestablish the Nation's first Emergency Medical Services for Children \nprogram, EMSC.\n  Over the past decade, this pediatric EMS program has improved the \navailability of child-size equipment in ambulances and emergency \ndepartments. It has fostered literally hundreds of state and local \nprograms to prevent injuries, and has supported thousands of hours of \ntraining for Emergency Medical Technicians, EMTs, paramedics, and other \nemergency medical care providers. EMSC efforts have led to legislation \nmandating programs in several States, and to the development of \neducational materials covering every aspect of pediatric emergency \ncare. However, most importantly, EMSC efforts are saving kids' lives.\n  EMS providers, be they career or volunteer, which the majority are, \nengage in thousands of hours of specialized training and continuing \neducation to enhance their lifesaving skills. It is well known that \naccess to quality emergency care dramatically improves the survival and \nrecovery rate of those who experience sudden illness or injury. In \nfact, emergency medical services providers have traditionally served as \nthe safety net of America's health care system.\n  However, this healthcare safety net today is in crisis. On the front \nlines, emergency medical service providers are faced with crowded \nemergency departments and dwindling resources. These, and many other \ncomplex issues are threatening the ability of health professionals to \ndeliver quality care.\n  A solution to the overcrowding of our nation's emergency departments \nrequires a national commitment. This will mean allocating significant \nfinancial resources and convening Federal and State policymakers, local \nhospitals, community leaders and public and private health plan payers \nto develop workable solutions. We will also need adequate monitoring \nand data collection efforts to understand the scope of these problems \nand to uncover the best methods for resolving this crisis.\n  To continue to deliver quality healthcare in this country, we must \nnot only recognize those individuals who have dedicated their careers \nto caring for the very sickest Americans, but also the undue stress and \nburden this system in crisis places on them each and every day. We must \nwork toward resolving this crisis so we can continue to attract quality \nhealthcare professionals to the EMS field and to give them the \nresources they need to continue to save lives.\n  It is appropriate to recognize the value and the accomplishments of \nemergency medical service providers by designating this May 20-26, \nEmergency Medical Services Week.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/17/senate-section/article/S5128-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5128-S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 650.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For the vast majority of households the pathway to the \n     economic mainstream and financial security is not through \n     spending and consumption, but through saving, investing, and \n     the accumulation of assets. Assets promote economic household \n     stability, decrease economic strain on households, promote \n     educational attainment, decrease marital dissolution, \n     decrease the risk of intergenerational poverty transmission, \n     increase health and satisfaction among adults, increase \n     property values, decrease residential mobility, increase \n     property maintenance, and increase local civic involvement.\n       (2) One-third of all Americans have no assets available for \n     investment and another 20 percent have only negligible \n     assets. Assets are distributed far more unevenly than income. \n     Whereas the top 20 percent of American households earn over \n     43 percent of all income, such households hold over 68 \n     percent of net worth and almost 87 percent of net financial \n     assets. Moreover, asset poverty and wealth gaps are even \n     higher among minority households by a ratio of more than 11 \n     to 1. Up to 20 percent of all households are unbanked and do \n     not have access to the basic financial tools that make asset \n     accumulation possible.\n       (3) Public policy has contributed to large asset gaps in \n     the United States. Traditional public assistance programs \n     based on income and consumption have rarely been successful \n     in supporting the transition to economic self-sufficiency. \n     Tax policy, through $288,000,000,000 in annual tax \n     incentives, has helped lay the foundation for the great \n     American middle class, but only for some citizens. Fully 90 \n     percent of such current tax benefits accrue to households \n     earning more than $50,000 per year, roughly half of all \n     American households. Lacking an income tax liability, low-\n     income working families cannot take advantage of asset \n     development incentives. Moreover, low-income families seeking \n     public assistance must first spend down their assets and face \n     severe asset limits once on assistance.\n       (4) Individual Development Accounts, or IDAs, have proven \n     to be successful in helping low-income working families save \n     and accumulate assets. In one national demonstration project, \n     2,378 low-income families saved\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n     a total of $834,442 in one year which generated another \n     $1,644,510 in private matching funds. Thus far, IDA savings \n     have been used to purchase long-term, high-return assets, \n     including homes, post-secondary education and training, and \n     small businesses. Presently, about 10,000 IDAs are in \n     existence in the United States, held by a very small fraction \n     of the at least 70 million Americans who are asset poor.\n       (5) Therefore, the Federal Government should support, \n     through the tax code, a significant expansion of Individual \n     Development Accounts so that millions of low-income working \n     families across the country can save, accumulate assets, and \n     move their lives forward, and thus make positive \n     contributions to the economic and social well-being of the \n     United States, as well as to its future.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to provide \n     for the establishment of individual development account \n     programs that will--\n       (1) provide individuals and families with limited means an \n     opportunity to accumulate assets and to enter the financial \n     mainstream;\n       (2) promote education, homeownership, and the development \n     of small businesses;\n       (3) stabilize families and build communities; and\n       (4) support continued United States economic expansion.\n\n     SEC. ____12.
